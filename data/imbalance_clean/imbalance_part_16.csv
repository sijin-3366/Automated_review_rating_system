4.0,tiara wasn't as large as i thought and it was really difficult to keep in place.<br /><br />But it was very pretty
4.0,"I've been a photographer since the sixties, and this is the most comfortable strap ever, however the little thin portion that goes into the camera eyes sometimes came undone.  I solved the issue with a little super glue."
4.0,"It works very well, I'm happy"
4.0,"Gorgeous dress! DEFINITELY order a size up, though. I'm usually a size medium/large and I couldn't even get the large over my hips. Get the gold one!"
4.0,I ordered two different colours and got both the same so I was disappointed. But they work great although they make you extremely hot which I expected but they do the job
4.0,I took this dress to Paris France for a wedding and it traveled beautifully and was a good length.
4.0,"The fabric is nice, but the waist was super tight for being an XL."
4.0,"Now, the only reason I bought these was for my halloween costume this year and I'm going to be Kenny &#34;Fkn&#34; Powers and I wanted Oakley look-alikes.  Just wanted to repeat; this is a very good bargain and you get 5 different tough, polycarbonate lenses.  I only gave 4 star because of two reasons: 1) the instructions on how to remove and install the different lenses are written in badly translated English.  But once you figure it out it's a 'snap' to remove and replace the lens and 2) the fixed opening of the nose bridge is too right/narrow which causes the frames sit up too high on my nose, and my nose is not particularly wide at that point.  Since I'm only wearing these one or two times for my Kenny &#34;Fkn&#34; Powers costume it's not a big deal, but I would have been disappointed had these been my daily drivers."
4.0,"True to size!! Fits good, the only complaint I have is that the bottom of the tank is a little loose on me but the top part fits perfectly. Good buy otherwise for the price."
4.0,"I like the design, easy for my 5 year old to put them on by her self<br />I don’t like that the water gets in easily ."
4.0,"Nice dress watch by Relic with a metal band, a gold dial, gold hour markers and a dial surrounded by crystals and more crystals on the band. Lovely for evening or dressy event"
4.0,IF it ran a little wider it would be a 5 star. Perfect for a change in shoes at a wedding reception.
4.0,"It's a very nice feeling band,very soft and waterproof."
4.0,"I got the charcoal gray color. They fit well, don't show cellulite, and the material feels really soft. However, during a routine workout you could see my butt sweat on these pants. This hasn't happened with other leggings I own. I thought that the color would be dark enough to minimize the occurrence of this, but no luck. And I don't sweat a crazy amount."
4.0,Only complaint is that the arms are slightly tight but it isn't too bad. I'm 5'11&#34; and the length isn't too short. It comes down about 3 inches above the knee.
4.0,"The shirts were perfect, but one had a weird scent stuck to it.."
4.0,This necklace is quite pretty-it elevated my plain V-Neck royal blue dress to a more special occasion level.  I got several compliments admiring this piece.  I encourage you to look closely at the neck chain which is gold toned-I would have preferred silver/white metal tone but I will definitely be keeping and wearing.
4.0,"My husband bought this for me as a Valentine's present. I love it, and it fits great. It seems to hold up just fine in the wash also. The only drawback is the top is a bit see through, make sure to wear an under shirt."
4.0,"Its a bit small but it fits very fitting. Its really comfy and the color is not as pink as the picture but its still nice, its more subtle."
4.0,I got this the same day I ordered it...which is awesome.  It looks decent and it feels a little flimsy with the band.  I took out the links to make the band fit and it is very comfortable.  I have enough sense to only wear it once in awhile.  Being a machinist....it will get ruined if I wear it daily.  We'll see how long it lasts...but for the money.....I'm not expecting too much.  So far....I like it.  Looks and feels good !
4.0,"Buttery soft, great leggings, especially for the price. If I bought the. Again I would size down to a small though."
4.0,"It looks very nice under a sweater.  But the material is pretty see through to wear on it's own, I think.  It does have a nice cut and a nice look and feel."
4.0,"These bibs are nice and long. They cover a large area which keeps food from getting all over clothes. The Velcro around the neck holds well and doesn't give or fall off easily when pulled on. The neck size is a little bit on the snug side, but it fit around my two year old good."
4.0,Great fit and materials. Would definitely recommend.
4.0,"Purchased for a long flight, it was comfy and stylish ."
4.0,"This is just as it looks. However, I got a hole in my first one after a couple wears, so I had to order another one."
4.0,Liked it alright picture shows lot more detail than product has. But price was right.
4.0,Thin material but still nice
4.0,"I really like this vest. I'm typically an extra small and the small fits well. It does run slightly small, not extremely so. It's form fitting and if that's what you're looking for you'll be pleased.<br />I read the review about it not washing well, so I will have it dry cleaned or hand wash. The fabric is nice. I'm pleased. It was not expensive, but looks to be of decent quality."
4.0,Wedding.  I love it. But it started falling apart same day.
4.0,Bought for my daughter she loves it. However the valves  on the front come off way to easily. Wore it to school once and lost a valve.
4.0,I really like how they are made and designed but I found the thick hoops to be a bit smaller than I expected. Actually they all turned out pretty small.
4.0,"Super cute tank! Great quality, etc... But, the xl fits like a medium! Just FYI!"
4.0,Love top only negative hand cut on bottom
4.0,"These shoes run very small. You have to size up one size from regular cycling shoe size. I thought I just had to size up from street shoes, which is smaller, anyway since more room is needed in the toes for cycling. Nope. Very streamlines, and the shoe is not deep, either.<br /><br />I wear size 42 2/3 in Mavic road shoes, size 43 in Giro Mountain bike shoes, 43.5 in Sidi road shoes. I ordered size 43 since I'd heard they were supposed to be sized like Giros, and had to send back in exchange for a size 44.  Usually, size 44 is much too large for me. (I wear size 41.5 - 42 in street shoe European sizing). Size 10.5 women's. Not completely sure about men's. Maybe 9.<br /><br />Anyway! Hope that helps someone. Haven't received the 44's yet, so I'll update when I verify their fit."
4.0,"Fit nice , comfortable to. Least thing I liked was it was so wrinkled when it arrived."
4.0,The item fits good. Wish it fit tighter around waist area.
4.0,"LOVE this style, but it was way too long for me! And ran a bit large overall."
4.0,"The pattern on the leggings are just printed on, not actual venting. The waist is tight and compressed but the rest of the legging is more like a thick tight than a compression/workout pant. Ok, I guess"
4.0,"it was very cool, all my friends loved it. I used it for Halloween. the only thing I didnt like about it was it was hot and since i'm 10 when i ran I sometimes couldn't see but if your an adult it will be great!!!!! ( By the way im not victoria just this used to be my moms computer.)"
4.0,"Large fits well, im 6ft and 185lbs."
4.0,Nice fit.  A bit too long for me.  Will but it off and make about 3&#34; shorter.  Bottoms too large for me.
4.0,"I've bought these twice because I scratch them easily.  Easy to bend frames and ear pieces to suit your personal size/preference.  These are awesome for the price (for 2 pair) HOWEVER, buy an eyeglass repair kit that includes the nose cushions that constantly fall off of these and the micro screw drivers that tighten the hinge screws. If you crimp the little metal pieces that hold the nose cushions on, the nose cushions will not fall of so easily, but tightening the hinge screws seems to be regular maintenance, especially on the right side which is the side I grab to take them off.  I  got the repair kit here on amazon.  Search ""20 pairs nose pads oval....."".  This kit includes nose pads and the micro screw driver."
4.0,Listen to other review. Ordered an xxl. Usually wear a large. Fits normal. Can wear lots of places.
4.0,Very nice not cheap.
4.0,"Super cute and great quality! The only noticeable difference is that their size 5 seems more like a 6-7, because it is much bigger when compared to a tennis shoes size 4 from Target."
4.0,"Runs a big large in the straps, but it's something I believe I can fix myself.  For the price, it's a good product! Arrived quicker then anticipated!  I am 5foot 1, 115lbs 32D"
4.0,"Gots as expected and very colorful, may want to tie look together with a belt"
4.0,"This came before the estimated delivery time, which was awesome!  The fabric is comfortable and soft, but somewhat sheer. I may have to wear a tank top under it.<br />The sleeves are also a soft material.  Not at all itchy like I thought they might be. But they are a weird length. Not 3/4, but just unusually long.  They will need shortened to look right.<br />It fits great. I followed the guide and bought an x large to be safe bc I'm rather busty. Could have easily fit into a large, but since I will need a tank under it, it's better that it's a little loose. Also, one of the few shirts I've purchased from here that is long enough."
4.0,these fit 2 of my rx glasses & are much more scratch resistant than they used to be.  great deal on the 3 pack.
4.0,It's an adorable little dress. It's very plain and simple and the tie belt is imperative to keep the shape. It isn't lined and relatively thin. but it's a great summer vacation dress. I wear it to Martha's Vineyard when I want to compliment the cute little colorful cottages
4.0,"Good belt, great price."
4.0,The size is perfect. It's a beautiful dress with a zipper on the side. You have to figure out what's the front and what's the back because it looks the same on both sides. The cloth can be a bit itchy. It's not very soft. I have only worn it once so I dont know it it will shrink after washing. I will find out soon!
4.0,Pretty but brittle. Even pairs that were never used became brittle and broke a couple months after I got them.
4.0,"Cute dress with a light and airy material that will be perfect for the summer. The reason I did not give the item 5 stars is because for some reason, the dress seems to have been designed for someone with a much longer torso (I have never usually had this problem with anything else I've ordered so I assume my torso is pretty average). What this means is that the sleeves are too long and keep falling off my shoulders. I kept the dress because it is an easy fix (I just sewed the sleeves in a bit), but a warning for those who don't want to have to adjust the products they buy. In addition, the zipper in back is pretty cheap quality, but that is something that is fairly easily overlooked given the dress was pretty cheap."
4.0,These are very  comfortable.  Love them
4.0,Nothing to present.
4.0,"I tried a bunch of them. Overall love this dress when it's sized right. Skims the body without being too tight or too tent-like. I'm usually a medium in dresses like this. (8-10 pants size, medium shirts, 34DD, 5'7"") but took smalls and extra-smalls in this. Photo shows skirt difference between a Small Black and a Small Green-1:<br />Black:  Small is great. The fabric is flattering and flowy. Not too thick or thin. Bought 2 of these.<br />Green-1:  Small was too big in the skirt - too much fabric. Extra-small works pretty well. A bit short, but it stretches on the hanger. Kept it.<br />Green-2:  Small was too big in the skirt - too much fabric. Thicker and less flowy than the other colors I tried. Also, this is absolutely blue by any definition.<br />Black & White (tie dye):  Small was too big in the skirt - too much fabric. Extra-small looked great in the body but the neckline was too high up and unflattering. Thinnest fabric, but not see through."
4.0,I haven't worn it to do any sports yet but I like the fit so far. Good basic inexpensive top.
4.0,I normally wear a size small (I wear size 2 or 4) in everything but had to return and get medium. Other than sizing issue I am very happy with the jacket. I am even thinking of ordering another color.
4.0,comfy to move in
4.0,"Beautiful and not taking up my whole wrist. If you're not looking for a chunky watch, this is the one you want. Works well and is waterproof. I am a groomer and always have my hands in water, no issues at all. Nice watch. Only issue I've had (twice) is that it does unlatch but have not had it fall off."
4.0,Yes I love my Moochi 18k gold Plated.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, one mistake was going by someone else's reveiw and ordered up, now it too big and i will have to get it tailored."
4.0,"It's amazing , just wished it was a bit straight but great quality isn't to big just perfect for the ears ."
4.0,"Smaller than they seem in the picture. But the details in the silver are beautiful, and intricate."
4.0,Only gave it 4 because it’s built for me as a woman
4.0,"Nice golf hat, I ordered the S/M size and have a 'normal' size head for a 5'10'', 200 lb male. It fits but I'm surprised it is not more snug. Otherwise, I like the color and the way it looks, would certainly recommend."
4.0,"The StimuLight glasses are NOT polarized but I knew that before ordering (Polarized lenses are not ideal for dim light). This Eagle Eyes product fits over my Rx glasses and really sharpens vision in dim or hazy light, as advertised. Pleased with them altho the quality of the frames, as with other Eagle Eyes glasses I've purchased, is cheap, brittle plastic and not up to the innovative quality of the lenses they put into them! For the money, the frames should be of better material."
4.0,Looks like it's just what I needed
4.0,Such a great belt for the price. It is well made. Nicely stretches without losing its shape. Keeps its color. Ends are well stitched and the buckle is a very good quality. i now own multiple colors of this item and wear them all the tme.
4.0,"Great deal and impressive quality for the price. I am on the leaner side (138lbs, 5'8&#34;), ordered XS hoping for a pretty tight fit, but it was still a bit looser than expected."
4.0,The earrings are fantastic but too heavy for my ears.  I gave them to a friend who is able to wear them.
4.0,"I love this piece, but there was no clasp to open the necklace.  Very nicely made, so I can just add a clasp.  It looks heavier than it is.  Rests comfortably. Also, the necklace doesn't drop low enough for me.  Again, I can just add some pieces."
4.0,"This down jacket is very nice and beautifully made, and the teal color is beautiful.  I'm a 5'1"" woman, 130 pounds, and I ordered a men's x-tra large, with the idea of layering it over a sweatshirt.  But even though it's advertised as generous in fit, it isn't.  The jacket basically fits me with just a flannel shirt under it.  The sleeves taper down from elbow to wrist to an extent that anything more than a shirt bunches up.  It's a trim fitting jacket.  I like it enough that I've made it my going to town jacket, but I think it's not really generous enough for layering over farm clothes."
4.0,Good if leg is not too swollen. Not as elastic as same size Jobst
4.0,Mine were broken
4.0,"I ordered the red but received the mint color. Customer service was awesome and got me the red one within 24 hours of notifying them that I received the wrong one.  Loved the dress!  I ordered a medium and am 5'7, usually size 4-6.  I would have liked it to be a tad longer but it still worked.  Very comfortable and got a lot of compliments!"
4.0,Order the first part a few weeks ago and was a little too big not bad but just a little big.. When I looked back I noticed I order a half size larger than normal by mistake.  So I ordered another color in normal size and they are tight not sure if they will stretch I may send back. Disappointed on the second pair.
4.0,"So far so good for one week. What remains to be seen is how long the spring to shut the case works. With all previous eye glass cases I've purchased, the spring seems to break quickly. Sometimes it was only a month and others a week. We shall see,no pun intended."
4.0,cute idea the girls will enjoy these
4.0,I purchase this glove set to use as utility gloves for belt sanding small hard to hold onto parts.<br />The rubberized coating helps grip the parts; while the steel mesh helps protect the fingers for the belt sander. ;)
4.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry but it doesn't seem true to size. Perhaps I have a really tiny wrist. Nevertheless, it is a simple, elegant and chique bracelet and diamonds stand out on their own."
4.0,The bracelet is a comfortable fit and good quality. Stones are beautiful and not too heavy. Colors are great with many outfits.
4.0,size of earring- good
4.0,So much nicer than I expected! This is made out of a stretching jersey type fabric. (black and white)<br />I ordered a second one in blue and white but it is not the same fabric.  Disappointed in that.
4.0,Good size fits well... stitching on the star could have been better.. looks generic ..
4.0,Wore after a short period but a great looking lunch bag!
4.0,"I ordered a medium at first but returned it due to it being too small ( very tight on the chest and waist, so much I couldn’t wear a bra). Im 5’8 height, 150 lbs, 36B, 29 waist, and wear mediums in women’s but I reordered it in large. It has more room now on the top, more than i want but its not loose. I also noticed it is a tad sheer so i may order a slip for underneath, sun rays could cut thru maybe. Still planning on wearing it for my bridal shower since its so hard to find a cute white dress anywhere without it being too short or expensive. Great price and good quality dress overall!"
4.0,"This is a great pendent for less than $10! That said, the cord is extremely delicate and I can't help but wonder when it will either break or come apart. I don't know how well the ""coin"" will look on a metal chain, the pendent and the cord go together really well - it's the perfect look. Maybe a leather cord or rawhide might look as good and prove more durable..."
4.0,"Very nice purse. I bought mine in grey. Lots of compartments not heavy to carry. Some day I will buy another , in a different color"
4.0,Very nice sweatshirt except the size. I normally order large sweatshirts with out any problem but this style seems to run a little smaller.<br />Other than that the quality is good and I will just give to someone that it will fit.
4.0,"Not as solid as in the picture. Still, it is  a lovely inexpensive ring."
4.0,I bought this to go on a trip to an indoor waterpark worked perfectly it was a little bit large but very comfortable and was nice not to have to constantly pull my top down over my stomach after every ride.
4.0,"I was really happy with these wristbands they're pretty dang good. They are cheap, came with three colors, And clicked in well. I like how they're matted in color and not shiny. They also are a little bit more grippy. I like that they don't slide around my wrist as much, but that also means a little bit of a struggle to strap it on... The bands don't slide as easy as you're locking it in. But worth it to not have it slide around your arm. I'd say solid 4.5 stars"
4.0,"she said it catches on things, other than that its beautiful."
4.0,"Nice looking purse, vibrant red color.  Roomy inside, enough room for wallet, phone, makeup and other essentials."
4.0,Finally got here in the mail a week ago and I have been wearing it almost everyday for about 6 hours and it has helped me keep in check of my tummy. I ordered a Medium expecting it to be tight but it actually fits me on the third hooks and I can move around in it ( I'm 5 ft and weight is 150). Which I'm pretty pleased because I can order a smaller one. It's very breathable and comfortable. Keeping the current size I have for when I have more children I can put the medium back on.
4.0,RUNS SMALL  BUT FIT  /  NICE BRIGHT COLORS  DIDNT FADE
4.0,Came as expected....it really speaks to me!
4.0,Love the look of it and the style but it's somewhat large. That's my only concern but I like it.
4.0,"The only reason I deducted 1 star is because the bow tie was made for large necks or something because it was hanging on me even when I had it as small as it goes. Easy fix, though. Everything else was great."
4.0,"HELPS COVER MY TUMMY AND I CAN WEAR THIS ALL SUMMER LONG TO THE BEACH OR POOL, FLOWS LIKE A DRESS."
4.0,"I wear a sz. 14 in pants so I purchased a Large. The pants were too a little too small in the hip area but the top fit perfectly. However keep in mind, I have 38” hips with a 24” waist. The pants are a little thin, so I suggest either going commando or wear thin seamless panties. The pants inseam is a tad bit shorter than I expected, however I wear a 34” inseam, so I guess it would be fine for average length legs lol.. overall, I like the set. I may buy another in a different color"
4.0,Fits nice on my cheap timex expedition that I like. A little bulky with the two rings on the right side of your wrist.
4.0,I bought these to wear while waiting for the bus. I like to have my fingers free to use my phone or do other things. The added length above the wrist is a nice bonus. A good purchase.
4.0,I’m not disappointed with the purchase but I felt like it would look a little different. The material is not what I expected. It’s a bit see through and almost a type of stretchy material. Ordered a 2x hoping to have a big cozy sweater. 2x but fits like a XL in my opinion. Like I said Not a bad purchase though.
4.0,"I ordered the orange cardigan for fall. The color is bright orange, not a coral or burnt orange. Even though I’m a medium I ordered a size small because I knew a boyfriend fit would run large. The small fits like a typical US size large. This may not be small enough for a size 4 and under, but is good for size 8 and up. It is open so it’s versitile for a wide range of sizes. I gave this to my sister who is pregnant since it’s open she can wear it over anything."
4.0,It’s really pretty but holy crap does it draw attention. I don’t have a problem with it but everyone will ask. It’s kinda become dull in color but it’s still nice and shiny. I wear it mostly with a gray shirt or something dark otherwise it clashes lol
4.0,"They’re cute, but the style of crocs I purchased weren’t suitable for these chains. I returned them."
4.0,Seem to be pretty decent. I didn't notice a problem with the lenses being too thin like others have posted. Only thing keeping this at four stars is lack of time. I've only had them for a few days and I'm concerned they may not last as well as the originals.
4.0,Going to look good with my post apocalyptic costume
4.0,Decent fitting shirt good for the price
4.0,They are cute straps. I just wished they had more characters. I clicked all characters and they all showed Jung Kook.<br />My daughter is fan of J Hope.
4.0,"I bought this (Pebbled Champagne Gold) for myself because I have no need for a huge wallet that takes up a lot of space. I've been using it for about a month now & I love it so far. It looks exactly as advertised; it's a gorgeous color that looks both fun & professional; it's made well -- no loose threads, no zipper malfunctions, no issues of any kind; I love how it's a button snap for easy access; & it's the perfect size for me -- I can fit it in my small purse or even in my winter coat pocket & I can fit all of my cash & a few cards with much more room to spare. However, now that I own this I would prefer having some sort of small strap so that I could hold onto it more easily, especially since the material mine is made out of is a tad slippery. I thought I would want a thumb hole for my driver's license but I've never had an issue slipping my license out. And I appreciate the coin pocket but haven't used it yet so can't really speak about that, even though I have tried the zipper numerous times & it works fine. Overall, I'm happy with this product -- I think the price is relatively fair (I bought it for $10.99) & I think it's held up well so far."
4.0,"So these leggings are super soft!!!!  A real slim fit. I'm 5'3 170lb. Volleyball player build. Soo large butt, thick thighs small waist. They are high waisted and it stays put!!! When you bend, sit, or anything. It does not move!!! They only thing wrong with these leggins is that they failed the squat test SOO bad. You need to wear black underwear or a great thong. Also you might want to wear seamless under wear. so your not showing the world your treasures. I brought a XL, after reading the reviews. Fits great."
4.0,"Just received this bag & it is EXACTLY what I expected. On top of it arriving early, it is big and roomy ! If you are somebody like me who has to have everything from their house in their purse, this is the purse for you! i thought it was goin to be in white and black news paper style but the color makes the bag even better. Love this bag ! Never been a fan of small handbags & I had been suffering carrying around a little ass satchel but no more worries ! Lol"
4.0,The tshirt is just ok. Does have a tshirt feel and does not have a sheen to it like many of the Amazon tshirts. Fit is loose but color is a little darker than the picture.
4.0,"Cute little dress.  Form fitting and comfortable (soft with good stretch).  Fabric is thin but of decent quality (purchased in gray and material is very thin though not quite see through).  However, would still recommend as I think it's a good value for the $.<br /><br />As to sizing, I purchased a medium and it fits perfect (fitted but not tight). I am 5'7&#34;, 148 lbs."
4.0,Very nice sweater. I thought it would be softer. Maybe after a few washes.
4.0,"These leggings are great, I'm a bigger lady and these fit very well. They won't pass the no skirt test, but they are very comfortable and wear beautifully. Great layering piece for warmth and a fantastic color."
4.0,Midline of v neck is somewhat off centered
4.0,"The colors are extremely vibrant. The length hits right at my ankle. I'm extremely curvy and the material is stretchy. I didn't like belt and the material is flimsy, but cool."
4.0,"I like these a lot, but I would make the string a little thicker. I'm worried I'm going to break it."
4.0,Nice quality but runs huge! I am a true XS and ordered so. I will be returning for an XXS.
4.0,product was smaller than expected.
4.0,"A bit thin but very nice looking dress. Not the dress' fault but heads up to anyone with a tummy, it definitely accentuates the midsection:("
4.0,I like it but it fits tight near the bicep area.
4.0,"Beautiful color and texture. Fit a little bit larger than expected, but overall good."
4.0,"Nice, lightweight."
4.0,"I'm 5'7 and 150lbs, based on the size chart I ordered an XL (size L for US) and it was too big. But besides that, the quality was good. Since it was too big it was hard to tell how much stretch it had, and when you have a larger back side and smaller waist, stretch is really important (you can see in the pic how it doesn't touch the small of my back) if you're looking for a body hugging dress, order this in a size smaller."
4.0,"Lovely little charm that I bought to fit my daughter's european bracelet, basically a dupe for Pandora. Looks like the jewels are securely set in the eyes. Just as pretty in.person as the pic."
4.0,"They are super soft, but not the quality that I was expecting for the price. They seem quite thin, and there were strings needing to be cut off of them. If you tried to pull them off they were going to leave wholes. And all three pairs had string that was just laying on the sock. They will be fine for warmer weather, and in dress boots, which is what I bought them for. I would probably buy them again."
4.0,There not the best quality but they get the job done
4.0,I love everything about this hoodie except for how small the neck is.  I wear it all the time.
4.0,Beautiful top but a little snug through the bust.
4.0,"These are really nice.  I was debating between a size XS and S and went with S to be safe.  I could have gone with XS and been fine, these are a tad loose, but then again, the XS might have been too tight.  For reference I am 105 lbs and 5'3&#34; with a straight and slender build so I am not very curvey.  They are comfortable, the material is a little strange, but I still think they look nice.  It has a sort of.....waterproof feel to it, but it isnt bad.  The only gripe I have is that they seem brighter than the picture.  They still look nice though and I will keep them.  They have quite a bit of stretch to them which is nice.  The back pockets are fake (i think another reviewer mentioned this too) but the front pockets are ok, what you expect from ladies pants.  I haven't washed them yet and will update if they don't wash well.  I would not call these winter though.  They are lined, and the lining is soft, but I don't think these will hold up to the cold.  Its too hot where I live to actually find out though."
4.0,Cute little outfit. Not very soft but great. Hat was to small.
4.0,"For men's socks, these ran just a little bit on the small side. Other than that, they feel good and wash well. Even with a hot water wash and medium heat dryer.<br />They give just a tiny bit of support, like most good athletic socks.<br />Fairly good at wicking away moisture, but one of the most important things in my book are the fact that they are soft and comfortable, without any noticable shrinkage. The colors stay true.<br />I expect that these will last a good long time."
4.0,Fits true to size. The colors were little more bright and pastel than pictured on white tank. Love the lace detail but make sure to be more delicate when handling it. Not too low in the front but I have a long torso.
4.0,"A bit stiff at first, but definitely softened up by end of day. Also they are surprisingly comfy to walk in. I'll buy more from this brand - but the next pair will be suede - in hopes of a bit softer from moment one."
4.0,"Nice socks, not very thick. But cute"
4.0,"So pretty, great fit, but way way too short and I'm only 5'2!"
4.0,Fits nice. Material is nice and it's sewn well.
4.0,I gave it a 4 star because one of the straps was way longer when sown onto the mask and it makes it awkward to wear like that. So I ended up modify it to my like and it still looks like I bought it that way. Besides that it’s awesome!
4.0,I bought this for my teenage son in the color white.  White is a very popular color currently.  My son likes to have different color beanies to match each shirt.  I am putting this in his stocking for Christmas.
4.0,I ordered this for my sister.  She said it fit and she liked it.
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty. I have worked in the jewelry business for years and I was not familiar with gold filled silver, so I looked it up and it does exist. It is seldom used. Gold filled is generally used on other metals. The bottom of the pendant is marked with the silver marking .925."
4.0,Nice watch but band links are very difficult to remove. Happy with the quality.
4.0,This elephant costume was so funny!  I was hoping it would blow up well to keep its shape and it does!  Such a great costume!
4.0,These are reasonably priced & comfortable. A good substitute for slippers. Well made but the soles are slippery till you rough them up.
4.0,"they are really comfortable, good shoes for an economic price."
4.0,I ordered a medium and large to see which size fits best for my workout needs. Both fit well but while exercising the medium gave me the support I needed.
4.0,"I did enjoy the hat, but I feel like the hair doesn't really match the color of the photo which was upsetting. Regardless, it looks good."
4.0,"I actually would give it a 3 1/2 just because it seemed to look nicer in the picture, but it is pretty much just as described: a mid-calf dress. The fabric is m ce and soft and now t see-through, which is important I. A white dress. Maybe it is just that I am too short for this length, but I feel like I will adjust the skirt. The pattern is nice."
4.0,Purchased to wear outside to sit on porch.  Seem durable for my purposes.
4.0,These glasses are great for my needs at this price. I needed glasses i'm not afraid to take out camping and kayaking and other outdoors activities because if I lose one I still have 2 and they are cheap. However they don't feel cheap. It's a pretty durable plastic and the shading to the tint is very comfortable (not too dark since I prefer a lighter tint) The only reason I am giving a 4 star review is one of the 3 glasses I received had some paint chipping on the inside of the frame that you can't see but its still there
4.0,The glasses themselves are really nice. They just were too small for my face. If you have a prettt slender face they should work for you.
4.0,This charm is very nice. It is just as described and pictured. The processing and timely shipping was great.
4.0,"Very cute mask!  It made a great gift, and the person absolutely loved it!  Thank you!"
4.0,"Good quality hat with nice, strong strap.  I thought it would be just a bit large, which is what I wanted, but it is snug. Not enough to return and am hoping it will stretch with time."
4.0,"These fit great and seem super comfy for my toddler, 16 months old. However, after about a month of wear, they already are wearing out, holes in the toes, etc. If they were longer lived I'd give them 5 stars, but they are not, they are very short lived unfortunately."
4.0,This cute and simple anklet is good quality for the money and stylish as well.
4.0,"Looks very pretty.  Fits as expected. Do not make it wet, it will stain your finger. Orher than thar, very staisfied."
4.0,Very cute but they aren’t flared enough to stay in. They fall out often and chip. I still wear them but have to remember to take them out before bed/shower
4.0,Very cute and I received lots of compliments already. It didn't get 5 stars because both my boyfriend and I had to fight with the clasp for it to open.
4.0,"I plan to buy these again because they were super cute. I'm a bit pf a perfectionist though, so it bothered me that one of the pearls was missing from the frame when I received them"
4.0,Cute cheap scarf for light weather days.
4.0,"I ordered a Medium as that’s what I usually order in Shein. I also usually get large bikini tops & medium bottoms. The bottoms are slightly big & the top is too small :/ I love it though, the material is great & I love the style of bottoms. I wish I could exchange tops."
4.0,"Package came one day earlier than it said it would arrive, which was a very pleasant surprise!  I am a size 14-16 (jean size and dress size)  and ordered a 3XL.  It fit perfectly, slightly snug on the top of the tummy area below the breasts.  However, I have recently become vegan and I suspect this dress will fit more comfortably once I'm a few inches thinner.  Sitting down it can feel a bit snug.  Overall, the dress is very charming and cute!  Good casual dress with sandals, or you can dress it up in heels and some jewelry.  Love it!"
4.0,"My toddler loves the Amini Little Fox Pattern socks.  He is 2 years and the socks fit him great.  Being a toddler my son from time to time took off his socks, this was a pain because he has lost a lot of socks because of this, now with these it has not happen.  He loves that the socks fit him almost up to his knee cap but best of all he loves that they have a character, now instead of taking his socks off he plays with the little ears on the fox.  The socks are 75% cotton which makes them feel nice and soft.<br /><br />I received a sample at no cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review! All of my reviews are based 100% on my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
4.0,"Only docking a star because they’re kind of pricey, and because the pockets aren’t deep enough to securely hold a phone, but these shorts look great… not too short, but not long, honestly the perfect length for me. I would buy more in different colors if they were a little cheaper. Also very comfortable."
4.0,"This is very flimsy, small in the hips, and does NOT come with a staff, nor boot covers. But it was cute and my daughter looked adorable."
4.0,"These are cheap exercise shirts. I ordered them to sweat in at the gym. They are lightweight, breathable, and comfy. The mesh design also means they dry quickly. I've put them through about a dozen wash/dry cycles so far and they have not shrunk or fallen apart. Will you win a fashion show? No, but who cares.  A+ workout shirt, will probably order more in the future."
4.0,Love the feel of the material!
4.0,"Material is a little bit thin but non see through and extremely comfortable, is not super flattering but the pokets are really great"
4.0,Great color and cut for the price. Be mindful of irons though. The material is largely synthetic and I did get a little spot where threads “melted” a bit when I was trying to smooth out wrinkles. A steamer is a safer bet. But it is machine washable.
4.0,Adorable!  I'm sure my sister will love it.
4.0,"I ordered a medium but I think a small would fit better. However, I am generally a medium in tops/jackets. The jacket is nice and warm. I wore it in 50 degree weather and was toasty. I’m sure it will keep me warm in colder temperatures too. I wish there was a least one contrasting color to add some style (I ordered it in black).  It also snaps up and I would prefer a zipper. Overall, if you’re looking for warmth and comfort at a lower price point, this is a good option!"
4.0,I’m still waiting for it to break in but so far it looks good. Great Lid for people who kinda prop em up on their heads in a loose manner with the front tilted down. Material is ok. Has a cardboard like feel to it. I really like the logo and colors but buy a few if you’re going to be wearing it often. They are not of nba mlb or starter cap quality. It’s stylish tho<br />Oh and the back is just a Velcro tab that you can make tighter or loose. No snaps.
4.0,Grandson loves.
4.0,"have worn just one pair so far, I am impressed. I am lean an muscular so they look pretty good."
4.0,I like the lace with the stripes top. Very cute idea.
4.0,"I read all the reviews regarding the sizing problems and I can say I'm glad I did.  My daughter is a 2T and she JUST fits into this leotard.  The fact that it's labeled 2-4T is concerning simply because there is no way a 3 or 4T could fit into this comfortably.<br /><br />But aside from the sizing concerns, my daughter loved her leotard.  She even took her nap in it :-)  Good thick quality and seems sturdy.  I like it a lot and will be purchasing more."
4.0,Not quite as vibrant color as the picture but still nice material and cannot beat getting the set of 3 items for less than 30 bucks!
4.0,Beautifull dress and it firs perfect
4.0,"I was hesitant on these, so far only used silver but, satisfied."
4.0,"I purchased these to embroider for a custom order, which worked perfectly. They’re lightweight and fairly flimsy - more like a pencil case than a makeup case. It’s not structured, it’s a thin canvas material that folds easily. Perfect for projects but not a high quality item."
4.0,These see a perfect gift for my brother. He loves crazy socks! So nice that the bottom is more neutral and as you go up they get more fun! Very comfortable and light weight. Vibrant colors to add a little fun to any outfit.
4.0,smells weird but its super cute
4.0,Really long. I mean really long. Other than that they are made really well
4.0,"It's a beautiful beautiful skirt, but this didn't fit me. I was really hoping it would.... im a size 16 in dresses and wear XL and XXL in blouses.<br />I was hoping hiking it up above my belly button would help close the skirt, but there was no give at all.<br />It's sooooopretty and made well. I really need to lose weight because it's just too pretty to return."
4.0,I wish that the “to the” was smaller
4.0,The only thing I was disappointed in was the there was no yellow face as shown in one of the photos.
4.0,Size was not true to fit for XL
4.0,So comfortable and colorful!
4.0,The seller is vested in customer satisfaction and cares about her product. Reasonable pricing and cute style. Material is soft and silk like.
4.0,I bought this tshirt because I like nautical tops when I go on vacation. I must have ordered the wrong size because it was way too big.
4.0,"The arms were a little tight, but I could just have large arms. Otherwise, I am a US Size 4 and I ordered a medium and it fit well. Would recommend."
4.0,It's beautiful . The material is not too thin. I am pleased and plan to get more colors.
4.0,"I LOVE these tanks, the quality is great and they are so soft! BUT I would say unless you like a tighter fit size UP! I bought a large which I usually wear (Im 5'2"" and 165 lbs) and they are too tight for my liking, like you can see your rolls :(  Otherwise love the shirts, I think they will look more flattering on me though once I lose the weight I want to lose!"
4.0,I got this ring in honor of my cat who passed away I love the way it looks with the angel wings I get complimented on it all the time and every time I look at it I smile remembering my cat
4.0,Easy to put together and looks very nice only complaint is my watch band is already losing color all around pretty pleased
4.0,Like the look of these but fit a little loose on my face. Still used them though.
4.0,Beautiful in person. Gave as a gift and he loved it!
4.0,"I've ordered some kind this before so I thought I knew what to expect. Don't get me wrong there's a ton for the price and I can't complain about quality, but in the past I've gotten very little duplicates but this time probably 20 of the 70 were doubles..."
4.0,I like it was worth buying
4.0,this shirt has washed and worn really well! would buy again
4.0,"These are definitely stronger than the Hanes and L'eggs pantyhose that I've tried. They are footless which can absolutely come in handy when wearing open toe shoes. They don't squeeze at my ankles.<br /><br />They seem heavy enough to withstand a decent amount of activity. They are see through from my upper thighs  up. They keep me warm and still have a  sheer look to them. The control top is not very tight. It's actually  pretty comfortable. They go up a little too high. As I'm sitting, the tights are a couple inches below my chest.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'2 and 125 pounds. I went with the small. It fit me true to size."
4.0,Not a fan of the fabric but it’s a nice fit
4.0,This is so comfy.
4.0,Fits a Lil small. But that just makes me work harder on my body..
4.0,I ordered this as a gift . It appears to be very suitable to use at football games.
4.0,"Very cozy, and perfect for travel. Washes well. If it were longer, I'd give it 5 stars."
4.0,Bought as a Gift. But it looks and feels amazing!
4.0,"This is my most consistently worn compression shirt.  The compression is strong, which is what I wanted, and the overall fit is great.  There is a problem with the sleeve hole size, however.  They are very small for anyone with a decent sized arm.  I don't consider myself overly muscular at all, so I would imagine someone with more muscle would be extremely uncomfortable.  There is quite a bit of chaffing after extended use (more than a couple of hours) so I typically only wear it for shorter work outs, which is most of them.  Larger arm wholes would get this to a 5 star review without hesitation."
4.0,This is oversized so if you don’t want it to fit to big size down. It’s a very thin jacket and doesn’t have a lot of weight to it so I would suggest to wear in the early spring or fall time. It came packaged well. Very fashionable.
4.0,"Although it's smaller than what I thought it would be, the color of the amethyst is deep and beautiful and the quality of the earrings is high. I am overall very happy with this purchase!"
4.0,A gift for granddaughter
4.0,"No complaints. Looks nice, hope it holds up"
4.0,"Very cute set,great price. Best for smaller chested women.i love the top but it just doesn't look as good as it would on a 34B chest. The bottoms are perfect, so cute a little cheeky but not a thong. Fit great to."
4.0,I love wearing these and ended up buying 2 sets.  They are mid comfortable but the top is too small for my busty chest and the shorts are falling off too big.  That was going up 2 sizes from what I wear too after having to send back th other sized sets.
4.0,I like the package as a whole.  Jacket and accessories are ok.
4.0,My granddaughter just loves these - she calls them her Party Shoes.  They are a little wide but easy for her to put on and she likes them.
4.0,I have purchased these before and really like them.<br />One disadvantsge is thst because they are nit &#34;tight&#34;<br />Hair slips out and looks messy.
4.0,"I llove the dress, but the side split too high"
4.0,"I didn’t expect much for this costume, but what a pleasant surprise!!! Really looks great and the accessories are fun!! The gloves are seen kind of crooked….other than that, very happy with this one!!"
4.0,"I love the look of the glasses, they're not at all flimsy they're made pretty sturdy. They came well boxed each individually wrapped and they came with two (2) lense cleaning cloths. The only thing I dodn't like is that it has no UV Ray protection. The third bullet point on the maintenance postcard is also a giveaway 🤦🏻‍♀️ ""- Avoid exposing your sunglasses to excessive heat for a long time""... When I read this I thought to myself ""What's the point of SUNglasses if it has no UV protection!!!"" 🤷🏻‍♀️ But for the price I can't really complain! 👍🏻"
4.0,"The date on the back is wrong.  It's supposed to go through September 29 and the date on the back of this necklace is through September 20.  It might not be a problem if the necklace is for someone whose birthday is before that, but this was purchased for a person whose birthday is September 26.  If not for the date issue, it would be very nice and get a 5 star rating."
4.0,Sons loved them
4.0,"Looks great, my daughter loves it. The first watch we received broke after 1 month, but after contacting Dovoda they replaced it straight away."
4.0,"I loved them, but they were a bit thinner then expected"
4.0,I love this top although it's a little big on me. Goes great with leggings and straight leg pants. I wear a long tee with it and it looks great. Get lots of compliments.
4.0,"You can see through it. Fabric is ok, not the best nor the worst. I gave it to my sister because she is smaller chested than I am and it will look cute worn as a see-through sweater with a cute tank underneath. I just didn't want that many layers. She loved it."
4.0,"I got the for a Halloween costume so it worked for that, it ran a little big or maybe it was just me. Also, it definitely has some weight to it."
4.0,like but it's a gift so don't know until I give<br />it to her
4.0,Comfortable to wear around the house.
4.0,Smaller than I thought. but still very cute.
4.0,No cold weather yet....
4.0,"The fabric is very soft, it is comfortable and the way it tightens is the best. I am not crazy about the white color only because it gets dirty quick and looks thin. It is a little long for my liking but my husband loves that for cool nights playing ball. Over all really nice product would recommend"
4.0,"Really short crop top which I didn’t realize. Lightweight, but not see through. Fabric is really soft, I was impressed.  If you’re large cheated I wouldn’t recommend. I’m a small C and 5’3” for reference."
4.0,made great gifts.
4.0,"For the life of me, I can't find saddle soap in Singapore (strange, considering how well high-end leather goods of 4-5 figure dollars are being sold here), so I ordered this as a order stuffer (for Amazon Global eligibility). It's a little pricey at $9+ but it works really well and easy to use."
4.0,Cute shirt! I like it!
4.0,"I am a professional dog groomer and wear this smock/apron daily at work. Love the way it resists the hair and water. Very light and comfy. Only downside I have found is that lining around the neck has ripped from dog nails getting caught. But, anything I wear to work is going to take a beating. I have went through numerous smocks, scrubs, etc and I like this the best."
4.0,"Great bonnet.  Seems well-made and is made of cute material.  Would have given 5 stars, but the ties needed to be an inch or two longer.  They wouldn't stay tied around my neck and I felt like it was choking me."
4.0,I originally ordered a 10.5 size and once receiving them. realized a half size would be much better.
4.0,falls nicely but the material is a little thin. great for summer but definitely has to be washed on delicate to maintain wearability.
4.0,You’ll need to order a larger size
4.0,Made me look skinny where I wanted. Very forgiving fabric
4.0,"Pretty big for a boys size 6, but hopefully my son can wear this coat for two winter seasons"
4.0,"Fit ok, just not my style. I'm 5'10&#34; , 140 pounds and ordered the medium."
4.0,Flattering fit but blue looks more like a true blue or royal blue instead of the dark blue in the picture.
4.0,good quality and looks great for the money
4.0,Not what I expected but very easy return
4.0,a bit tight in the arch/instep area over the top
4.0,They were cute but it was hard to decipher which ones were the clear pink looking lenses I later found out it was pink pink the ones I hot had a mirror lenses but I love them regardless!
4.0,Pretty but too small and too wide
4.0,La tele tiene una buena textura!! Buena calidad.
4.0,"This is a beautiful necklace.  The clasp fastener was a bit loose, but I was able to tighten it.  I will be testing the diamonds for authenticity soon. Would have given this 5 star if the clasp didn't give me any trouble, but overall this is a very good buy. I will be updating this soon."
4.0,"Bought one of these hats over 17 yrs. ago at a Flower Festival in CA.  I think I paid about $50 for it in 2001. Has had some hard use over the years. Very comfortable to wear. Love the ventilation of the open mesh. I don't get the sunburn that some people have complain about with similar designs. It has stood up to a lot of hiking and camping trips. I've stuffed it in backpacks and suitcases. Seen some harsh climates and has been left in a truck out in the desert sun on many occasions.<br /><br /> I wash it once in a while. Gentle cycle in washing machine, then air dry on a form (another hat). A little out of shape of course but still wear it. Might try to reshape with hair dryer in the future. Part of outer head band has pulled loose near metal button recently. Need to hot glue it back in place.<br /><br />Reading other reviews seems they may have changed the design a little bit. Mine does not have a replaceable head liner. No sweat or salt stains on headband. Hat material and stitching has withstood the test of time. Surprisingly no real wear and tear shows on fabric or stitching.<br /><br />Had a loop sewed under back brim. Use it to carry hat on my belt with carabiner. For restaurants or times when not wearing a hat and want my hands free. Makes it harder to misplace my hat...heh."
4.0,"Nice set, soft and comfortable.  I ordered XL as I'm a little busty, and the top fits loose and comfortable, but the pants are HUGE, Giant size, luckily they do have a drawstring, but they are huge.  Will size down on next set."
4.0,"These sock really do what they say. Feet stay dry, warm and comfortable all day."
4.0,"This dress is really pretty! I love the print and the design of it, so I am willing to put up with the issues:<br /><br />1. It is completely see-through. Like, you just cannot wear it without a slip.<br />2. The neckline goes too low. I think maybe if I had ordered a size up, it might fit better. It's a wrap dress, so you can always wrap it tight enough around your body, but I think there isn't enough fabric to cover my boobs, so it forces the V to go down too low. You can see my bra. My bra size is only a 36 B so, if you have a medium to large chest, I might order a size up from your usual. My work-around will be to sew on a little button so that I can close it tighter."
4.0,"Fit great, very stretchy!  Would have gave 5 stars but you could see under garments through them."
4.0,Nice lapel pins but not very high quality. You get what you pay for. But I am happy considering the price.
4.0,"I like the different covers, and the clasp fastener, However the Band Cover Sleeve Protector Accessories for Fitbit Flex 2 ft hat I purchased to &#34;dress up&#34; the band will not fit on any of these replacement bands, only the original Flexbit Flex 2 band.  And, a word of warning: be sure to wear these bands snugly on the wrist,  My band twisted over when I removed a long sleeve sweater, and the Fitbit Tracker fell out. I've never found it, and had to buy a new Flexbit Flex 2 tracker."
4.0,"Cute, but way to small"
4.0,The bathing suit fit as expected but for big breast women I recommend going up a size. I got a XL and the top barely fit.
4.0,"I LOVE this dress. Bought it in black and have now ordered two more colors.  The material is a bit thin, but for something to throw on when it's hot that isn't really a drawback.  It has a cute, flattering retro fit to it and looks good over leggings or tights also. It's also a good option for days when you don't want something super tight on your tummy area.  The cut is nice, so it doesn't look boxy or big.  I would say it fits true to size.  I'm usually a small or medium and I went with the medium which I think was the right choice.  I can't say for sure, but I think the small might have been a little tight around the bust based on how the medium fits. I love the versatility...I've worn this to work, to an outdoor concert and even just for running errands.  I was pleasantly surprised with how much I like this dress.  I would probably buy them all except olive looks awful on me.  Unless you're bothered by the thin fabric, you should be happy with this cute little dress!"
4.0,So super comfortable and doesn't show too much cleavage!  Bought one size larger and it fits great!
4.0,"Gorgeous, but tight. I ordered the largest size possible that was equal to a US 9.5/10, and it's still too tight. They're wearable, as they'll stretch in the toes, but probably can't wear them for more than an hour. If you're a size 9 or up, be very careful."
4.0,Expected much better quality for the price. Somewhat disappointed.
4.0,"fit well, but the compression on the toe area maid my ingrown toenail very painful by middle of day"
4.0,"This item arrived early. It was just as described. All stones were in place. They actually gave an extra red bumblebee pin as a gift, which was super cute. It's an adorable item to cinch sweaters or to playfully decorate winter collars. Quite apropos now that bees are on the endangered list :( I would definitely buy from this seller again."
4.0,"It passed the washer & dryer test without shrinking or loosing colors. That, per se, makes this thing a good choice. I prefer the zipper to be a couple of inches longer, so I don't have to partially take it off when nature calls me to do number one.  Other than that, I'm very pleased it keeps me warm."
4.0,Purchased for our granddaughter for school.  She is attending the Career Center in Health Tech.
4.0,"This was a gag gift I bought, and I was suprised by the material. It almost felt like dry fit after a wash, which was actually cozy. Pretty pleased."
4.0,"I love the style, however, I should not have listened the reviews.  I am large in most clothes, and after reading the reviews, I went a size up.  It is huge.  The straps don't stay up and the top is too big. So big, that I am tempted to go down to a medium and try again.  I do like the style, so I am tempted to try it again.<br /><br />I was not worried about the bottoms because I already have a swimsuit bottom that I love and haven't even worn with this one.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it is a result of the large size, but I had the hardest time figuring out how to wear those straps!  Am I the only one?  That one had me way confused and I am still not sure I can offer any advice to anyone else in figuring it out.  I just kept trying things while looking at other people's pictures."
4.0,cute and it goes with my bag--love the ability to hook your keys to your bag to make them easy to find
4.0,Very comfortable fabric but rubs a little small.
4.0,"comfortable but a little loose, I had to tie knots on the ear straps."
4.0,Ldurian Aunt morse code bracelet.  Great 14k gold plated bead bracelet.  The black silk cord is nice and easy to put on and take off. I like all the different sayings they have for these bracelets.  The idea is so unique and neat. I have several of these bracelets and someone is always commenting on how neat they are. Great quality unique gift for someone or for yourself.  The bracelet is well made.
4.0,Very cute and easy to put keys on and take off. I am giving another one for a gift. I really like the extra bling.
4.0,"Runs small. Thin material, but I like it. Size up."
4.0,Worked very well today. Weather started at 12 degrees and went up to 30 degrees and I was able to use the gloves on my tablet and keep my hands warm. I would give it five stars but not good with wet snow or rain.
4.0,This is a great hobo. The color is really nice.  And the interior has just enough compartments.  I can carry everything in this bag without feeling like I have a suitcase. I have gotten many compliments on how cute it is.
4.0,"My only problem with these glasses is that when I am driving look towards the back of the vehicle, the glasses have a reddish tint to it."
4.0,"It's great for going out for the night and having a light purse to carry with the wrist strap. Pretty, love the Zipper pockets. Hold my Iphone 6Plus."
4.0,"For the price, a solid knot tie. No complaints!"
4.0,"Like a lot, but wish skulls were bigger."
4.0,"I have not yet had the opportunity to try to wear these belts, So, this review is based upon observation. The clasps are on the smaller side, so I imagine it may just look like a metal blob in the middle at a distance. But that is fine. The rose ones appear to me to come undone quite easily, but the leaf ones appear to have more resilience."
4.0,"I love the contrast of the bright color with the black on this suit.  It runs a tad small so I'm glad I ordered a size larger than I normally do, and I would recommend you do as well.  It is made from good material and fits well if you order a size up.  The only thing I don't like is that the tie around the waist isn't sewn down all the way around, so it is sewn down in the front, but loose in the back, so it shifts around a bit here and there.  I think if they sewed it around the top, bottom and into the back so it was sure to stay put, the suit would be perfect."
4.0,My delivery was great.  The product is a bit small for a 34 waist.. more like a 32.  The material is thin.  I wish it was thicker  or heavier.  I'm hoping I don't split the butt out.
4.0,"Great cap for the price. Good quality, we used to iron some letters."
4.0,Fit well and works exactly as expected. Good quality item. Not to much more to it than that
4.0,"ONLY ONE! There are less little dangling parts than in the picture, but otherwise it is just adorable and I am very happy with it!"
4.0,Nice glasses for the money
4.0,The material was slightly irritating to my skin but other than that its was good for its purpose.
4.0,I like it … is exactly what you see in the picture only it looks prettier on the model. But exactly as u see it. I like it
4.0,"Pants are ok, Jacket is kinda small"
4.0,VERY NICE TOUCH.. PERFECT FOR 5 CARDS.. BUT should made for 8 CARDS which is average cards per person
4.0,It’s a little to long
4.0,"This is a really pretty dress, but it is really short for this 45 year old bod. I might be able to wear it with short leggings but haven't bought any that match yet. It is very flattering and not poorly made (especially for the price)."
4.0,"This dress was exactly like it was displayed.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 165 lbs, ordered a large and it fit like a glove.  The material is a bit thin and zipper is a little weak, but other than that, it's a great dress.  I would consider getting the gold too."
4.0,"This is a very nice nightgown house coat, but go down two sizes when ordering. It’s also long. I’m 5’3” and I keep tripping over it, hence the four stars. If you are a tall, large lady you will love this!"
4.0,It’s ok too small for me but I can give it to one of my daughters.
4.0,"Clean, nice, sharp sneakers!"
4.0,"Daughter said the stitching/band around the arm ruffle was a little tighter than expected, since everything else about the dress is a bit oversized (not in a clunky way but in a comfy way) I was surprised. The material I would agree with some of the others is not a typical t shirt material, it's a bit shiny and slick. That was unusual, but it's still cute!"
4.0,The pants are perfect. Thank you.
4.0,"First let me start off by saying these are pretty good sunglasses for the price. They look good and feel good, but you can definitely feel the plastic frames to them. If ur looking for more heavy duty sunglasses look else where, but if u just some for a good price then these are for you.<br />The one thing I did not like about then is they don't fit how I want them to fit on me. They fit a little to high on my nose. 30mm bridge gap is not that comfortable to me which is why I had to return mine. If you like your sun glasses to sit lower on your nose then these aren't for you."
4.0,"I am updating an earlier post I had made since Emolly sent me a replacement pair of these glasses.<br /><br />The original pair had very loose arms and was not the quality I would expect however the replacement pair is perfect.<br /><br />These are awesome glasses for activities like SUP, boating and Kayaking since they float!"
4.0,"Very cute, but cheap material.. I mean for the price it's good, I would definitely buy it again.. The pants are of regular length, they don't cut your leg at the bottom."
4.0,"These jeans are great as long as you know what they are.  They are not a traditional set of jeans, rather they are &#34;stretch&#34; jeans that function more like sweat pants with the look of jeans.<br /><br />Overall the look of the jeans is excellent, they look just like a regular pair of bootcut jeans, and you cannot tell upon first look that they are made of stretch material.  The overall cut of the jeans is slim through the legs, but they do stretch out as you wear them.  The jeans are made of a stretch material, so even if they are a little snug when you first put them on, they will stretch out over the day as you wear them.  This is both a good and bad thing.  It is good in that it provides extra comfort, it is bad in that if they fit snugly when you first put them on, as they stretch out over the day they get loose around the waist.  My biggest complaint was that they were perfectly fitted when I put them on, but then after a few hours the waist seemed to have stretched out and they felt as though they were sagging a bit.<br /><br />The jeans are very comfortable as well, you almost forget that you are wearing jeans because they are so comfortable.  And unlike some other stretch products these jeans definitely look like ordinary jeans.<br /><br />I really liked the product except for the fact that they tend to stretch a bit too much as you wear them.  A belt is definitely needed when you wear them, but if you are looking for a little bit of give in your jeans and a great look I think you will like these."
4.0,"I really liked this dress but I had to return it.  I bought the XXL in the red that is pictured, and it was too tight in the waist and hips.  I got the same style dress in black with the red and white polka dot trim, that I purchased at the same time, and it fits perfectly.  I will say the return was hassle free."
4.0,The material is nice. Im top heavy but after reading the reviews I ordered a L instead of XL. Im reordering in XL and will report back!
4.0,"Thick material, the attachment strap broke but other than that I love it."
4.0,I am converting this by stitching ears down into Kissy Missy for Halloween. I ordered mask that has Led lights and will run the battery string in her sleeve for easy on off switch. She has yellow gloves and yellow tennis shoes (contemplated ordering more yellow gloves but feared it would be a trip hazard on feet). Blue ribbon will be stitched on front. It is warm suit and fits great. But the zipper area could have been longer.
4.0,"Took a long time to arrive in the 1st one got lost. My girlfriend loved it, unfortunately, the keychain part of it was wasn't too strong and it broke and disappeared :-( Just be careful with the keychain."
4.0,I love these slouchy kind of shirts. I like to wear anything that I can wear with leggings. Because I'm pretty basic lol but... This shirt was a little bit different than others I've gotten like this. Usually I order a large because of my cup size being a d despite my height being pretty short in the rest of me being pretty small and this shirt fits me like a dress. The fabric is also very very heavy so it's not the greatest thing to wear in the summer heat. But the pricing was really good so I couldn't pass it up. Maybe in the winter when I gain weight it'll fit better LOL
4.0,"A little expensive for a costume, and larger than I expected, but it worked with my Pope costume"
4.0,I loved this until my nose started to get sore from it. Not good for everyday wear
4.0,It is of good material but it is very short in the front
4.0,"I liked the shirt but it was a bit too big when it got here, had to give to a friend. But she really likes it"
4.0,"I bought these Polo shirts for the men in my life.  My father, my husband and my son.  I ordered size large due to the fact I wasn't sure how they would fit, but I thought I'd be safe with the large.  I received XXL, 1xx and 2xx.<br />These shirts are great for summer use, they are quite thin.  The material is thin enough I can see my hand through it.  The variety of color is great.  The range of dark and light colors give you quite a few to choose from.<br />I wouldn't recommend these for winter wear, they definitely arent thick enough for that.  The buttons on the front are nice and tight.  Nothings more irritating, clothes wise, then purchasing an item just to have to sew the button tighter just after buying it.<br />All in all, the polls are a nice, light summer shirt.<br />DISCLAIMER:  I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Pros: The watch looks nice. It comes with a tool to make it smaller, which was easy to use.  The price is right.<br /><br />Cons:  You can hear the ticking of the second hand even when your arms are relaxed at your sides. The watch is cheaply made;  silver color shows through on parts of the watch that aren't visible when you're wearing it,  leading me to suspect with enough wear and tear the silver will eventually start to show on the visible parts of the watch."
4.0,This outfit is really cute and it fit my 1 year old pretty well! The shirt is a little long but it still looks good. The fabric is different but it’s held up being worn and washed so far!
4.0,"Love the look, feel, and most of all, the price point of this hat. Fit a little more snugly that I had hoped but not enough to warrant a return for me. May not be able to pull if off with curly hair, so straight it is when rocking this look."
4.0,I love the lacy material but the shades other than black do not match any of my shoes.
4.0,Adorable dress! Little shorter in the front than I expected but it could be me. I'm 5'6&#34; and bought a medium.
4.0,These are hard to string in shoes with smaller holes and the ends tend to snap and break but so far I am loving them in my shoes. I could use shorter pieces.
4.0,Seems size is larger so I would size down. Pants are short on me and I’m just about 5’7” I had to pull them up and rock them as tights.  Very stretchy and really high waist for the pants. Cute look tho.
4.0,These are great. Fabric soft and comfortable. The high waist is really high and sometimes rolls down. Also the fit is slimmer than most joggers but i still like them. Good quality for the price and not as heavy as other joggers.
4.0,Dress was very cute and flattering!
4.0,Bought L. Feels and looks good. Bigger than L
4.0,"Great color, wear well but bought a size larger as recommended, but should have bought my reg. shoe size. Very comfortable but had to put in some inner soles to make it fit better. Would like to try another color but will buy my size. Many compliments on this trendy style."
4.0,Cute little change purse that looks and even feels very close to a real Hostess cupcake.  Be careful not to take a bite out of it by mistake!
4.0,"Really cute and pretty good quality for the price. As others have already said, they run quite large. Definitely size down. I'm not sure how well they hold up when she starts walking but they more crib shoes anyway."
4.0,"This jacket is really cute.  Due to the design, like another reviewer has said, it is asymmetrical and has one pocket.  The pocket has a small Velcro rectangle for a closure and a little black tag with a white star to make it easier to get open.  The large zipper is slightly to one side and the smaller is just part of the design - it opens but I haven’t found any use for it other than maybe if your child gets too warm around the neck.  The jacket has a light jersey lining with red and white stripes which did not bleed with washing on cold.  The outer material is a light water repellant material.  I’m not sure if it’s waterproof because my daughter hasn’t worn it while it’s been pouring rain.  It was a little large for her when I received it, but unfortunately since I cut out the tag I don’t remember what size I got.  I believe I ordered a 4/5T.  It was too long in the sleeves last year when she was 4 and a half but fits her fine now a little less than a year later.  Overall a very cute jacket that looks like the style of another much higher priced children’s brand."
4.0,Very cheap looking color. I ordered a sky blue. Material is cheap too. Whatever though. Will give it to someone who already told me that she likes it.
4.0,"I decided to try these mask-style goggles for the first time. I wear them for lap swimming. I like them better than goggles with individual lenses because they provide better vision and are more comfortable. I like the adjustable straps with the quick release buttons. I'm still learning how to adjust them for the best fit without leakage. My previous goggles hurt when I tightened them enough to prevent leaking, and I would end up with ""raccoon eyes"" after swimming because the goggles left circles around my eyes. These are more comfortable and no more ""raccoon eyes."""
4.0,Cute outfit. Fits perfect.
4.0,This wallet is so so cute. I love it. If my checkbook could fit in it then I would be in love with it. That is they only reason why it has only 4 stars. Other then that it's perfect!
4.0,IT IS OKAY EXCEPT THAT THE BACK IS LOW.
4.0,"This watch is beautiful. It has a large face, and unfortunately is too large for my husband. The quality is great.  I like the 12/24 hour option. It really is beautiful to look at. It has a tachometer feature, which you have to do some reading to understand what it is and how to use it. It's not physically difficult to use, it's just a mathematical thing that takes some brain power ;) Lovely watch, just a bit too big :("
4.0,"The material is very comfortable, fits perfect with minimal bulge in the tummy area."
4.0,I bought this coat for my daughter.  She loves the color and style of the coat.  Fits her well. True to size. Fur is detachable from the hood. Machine washable.  Great coat.
4.0,For the price these are very nice and fit very well.
4.0,"The puffs are just what we needed for our project. There's a felt backing, making it easier to glue in place."
4.0,I did order a large purse and I got what I ordered and I am fine with that but next time I order a purse I will order one not quite so large since I have found out I really do not need one quite so large.  The purse was delivered when expected and I am happy with what I ordered.
4.0,Product met descriptions. I’ve worn it for 2 weeks.  It has wore well
4.0,Sleeves are a little longer than average but love the feel and thickness of this shirt.
4.0,I would have given it 5stars if not for the top...it fits...just needs a tad more structure.<br />The material was really thick and form fitting. The top you will definitely need a strapless bra.  I am 5'4...170lbs...hips about 42ish.... I do have a small waist and wide hips. I bought the 12/14.
4.0,"I use Grid-It to organize my family's ever growing pile of charging cables, batteries, and plugs.  It currently holds 5 charging cables, a mobile wifi hotspot, a portable battery, and a multi-USB plug.  It's great since I can just grab it and go.  The grips hold things well and I have little fear of something falling out.  They expand quite a bit as well."
4.0,This was for my ex-girlfriend but we're no longer together so all this review does is bring memories back. She liked it.
4.0,"This “helmet” looks really good but you need to know that it is a latex mask and is not sturdy in the slightest. As long as you know that, you should be fine."
4.0,"Really like them, not super comfy but for the price they are good. Well worth the cost."
4.0,I get so many compliments on these when I wear them. My only complaint is that they make my sensitive ears so sore after a couple hours - worth the pain though!
4.0,Beautiful dress but the chest and arm region is a bit small.
4.0,Great dress but it has no stretch in the chest at all. I’m 5’3” and about 135. I’m a 34 H in the chest and trying to button the dress is nearly impossible. I imagine if my boobs were smaller I’d be ecstatic with this dress.
4.0,"This is a cute dress, but the fabric is very thin that it looks not so good snuggling to your body. Guess i will be only wearing it under a duster."
4.0,I really like the style & turquoise. The color is slightly “dull” but I don’t mind it at all.
4.0,I liked that it could be adjusted
4.0,"This is a very cool invention, to have leggings where you don't need to worry about your top being long enough to cover your backside. The material is thick and warm. I am 5'4, 120 pounds, and the Asian XL fit nicely, even though it is hard to believe a petite person like me would need an XL size! My complaints however: 1) The seam on leg was not sewn well. After only one wear, a hole developed on the leg seam. I sewed it back up and now it is fine, but I shouldn't have to do this on a brand new product. 2) The legs are not full length. If you wear higher boots it's not a problem, but they look like &#34;high waters&#34; if you're wearing with lower shoes. Overall, I like this product. But it does have some significant shortcomings. I plan to wash/dry by hand to avoid more holes in the fabric, since the seams can rip very easily.<br /><br />Update 2/08/15: I loved the concept so I bought a 2nd pair, in grey this time. The black ones ran short and developed many holes along seams. I wrote to the company to complain about this, and they said they'd be more careful in the future. The grey pair I bought recently (same size, XL) were longer and sewn better. No holes so far. I did go over the seams with grey thread to prevent any future holes, but I have not seen any developing. Despite the shortcomings with the first pair, I'd say this is a very nice product to own. Just be gentle with them!"
4.0,It's a comfortable material I love the pockets I was just hoping it would be a bit thicker I feel like it's a little things.
4.0,They seem to fit true to size. They were a little too large for me but after having my daughter my size keeps changing. Love the pockets.
4.0,"This hat is toasty warm, high quality, only negative about it is it's a bit small. I did get some positive comments about it's looks, overall I would recommend it, just wish it was a little larger."
4.0,"Beautiful watch I person, came in a nice presentatable box.<br />N"
4.0,"The fit is a bit small.<br />The teal center band comes out or gets twisted from time to time.<br />So far, it doesn't have any smell to it.<br />It's pretty elastic, which is nice if it catches on anything, less prone to breaking.<br />It will hold water and ""prune"" your finger if you are sweating or in/around water.<br />The fact that it comes in pairs is nice.<br />For the price, you get what you would expect.<br />Just two basic silicone rings."
4.0,"I like this shirt.  I needed a dressy shirt, but I'm on the heavy side so I wanted a shirt that hid that and this shirt does that!  I bought more than one and am so glad that I did!"
4.0,"The shirt itself is awesome and good quality but the &#34;pre-shrunk description led me to buy a Medium which turned out to be just a bit too small to wear. I'm about 5'10 160lbs, should have gone with a Large."
4.0,"I love the top, is easy to wear and the color is beautiful. I got a small and the fit is perfect."
4.0,Great item clasp is on backwards.
4.0,"I returned because I no longer needed it, but it was overall a pretty nice quality dress for the price. The sleeves were a little tight, but could be withstanded."
4.0,Dress is fabulous! You just can't find clothing as unique as this in stores. I would normally never taken a chance and bought dress on line for special occasion but if you measure yourself and order according to size chart you will not be disappointed. I've not been this excited to show off a purchase in a long time.
4.0,Cute but engraved sentiment is unecessary and a bit strange in wording.  Would love it more if that wasn’t on the piece.
4.0,Good but a little tight on my big head.
4.0,Fits like a glove. Glad I saved the springs and clips from the old bands. quick and easy to install. Thanks.
4.0,Lo utilicé para regalo
4.0,This necklace is adorable and great gift idea for a new mom. It’s light weight and well made.
4.0,"Good quality buy, NICE!"
4.0,i love this very pretty
4.0,The dress is cute with lots of fabric
4.0,"This product was great for the fancy event I went to, you can probably only get a few uses out of it because it snags pretty easy."
4.0,Fit is great. Color is more olive greenish brown than true brown.
4.0,Pretty Good for the price
4.0,Nice design but not cut for all body shapes.
4.0,not crazy about the fit.  a little tighter design than i expected
4.0,"Bit short, otherwise lovely"
4.0,The slippers did not match the robe
4.0,"These socks are a bit hard to put on, even with talcum powder on your legs. But once they are on they are comfortable and can be worn all day without trouble. I highly recommend them for thise who are having issues with venous reflex or other issues"
4.0,I like the tie. It was on the money with the right shirt.
4.0,These pants are comfy and cute! I usually wear a medium but ordered large and it fits nicely. Soft material. Thin so you can wear them in all seasons. These pants are honestly a little weird tho. I would say they are more of a low rise pant. The pockets are in an awkward spot. The area from crotch to waist band is really short. I don't know how to explain it. I haven't washed them yet so can't comment on that. I like them but won't be ordering more.
4.0,"The picture shows a printed interior, but mine is solid black.  I wanted the printed really badly, but I guess it will work. I'm too tired to send back."
4.0,"These are quite thin from what I've come to expect from Darn Tough. Still solid, but room for improvements."
4.0,It’s a nice sweater! It feels soft! I’d wished that I went up a size but then my sleeves would be too long! I keep it!
4.0,"I like it, it's a good stretchy material and the price is much better than the Lularoe brand I found this to substitute for :)"
4.0,I like the shirt and I like the color (gray).  I was surprised at how shiny the material is but it is comfortable.  It would be nice if it was a bit longer in the front!
4.0,Nice fit.  I'm 511 230.  Really nice fir
4.0,Sweatshirt is comfy and fits as expected. Washes well and doesn’t shrink. I bought a Large as I didn’t want it to be snug
4.0,"Well designed, looks good, real leather.  Company tries hard to please!  Will know in five  years if it deserves fifth star."
4.0,"it is a little bit too large, but the duck necklace is absolutely adorable and the perfect gift for anyone who likes ducks. duckie love &lt;3"
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it and uses it all the time.  I'm thinking of getting her another for Christmas.
4.0,These appear to be adequate but l prefer the brand name (out of stock.)
4.0,Material is thin. Material is soft. Easy to put on and great for casual wear. Worth the value.
4.0,Very nice shoe. Fits a little tight even though I got the wide width.
4.0,Comfy and look good on.
4.0,I think it's a little different from the first one that I got (which I gave to my sister) but I like this one better as far as design and weight. It seems to be flatter but the detail is crisper. There are a few metal debris in the lattice work but it's not very noticeable unless you're admiring the ring off the finger. I have a nice collection of claddagh rings and this will be one of my favorites to wear.
4.0,Awesome earings . I woumd of gave them 5 stars but one of the earrings was slightly bent
4.0,I like these earrings although one of the earrings does not clasp tightly and falls out of my ear sometimes but so far I’ve realized that it fell out.  They are pretty.
4.0,Like style and quality however they did not fit a 14 year old girl. Gave them to her younger sister.
4.0,Very cute but a little short.
4.0,"Super comfy, lightweight, oversized fit. Great for a simple look or layering.  Haven’t washed yet, so can’t speak to it’s durability."
4.0,They're sunglasses. Does exactly what sunglasses are supposed to do. Personally they are a little too dark.
4.0,"Did not get right product at first and took a very long time to receive, but seller redeemed themselves by correcting errors.  Once I got the boots I was very pleased.  They are warm and great for Winter."
4.0,"Bought for teenage son, he liked them, still wears them 2 years later."
4.0,"A little small, but cute around the house"
4.0,Didn’t love the color. More teal than lagoon. But it’s a great bag!
4.0,Love this dress - so cute on and it was just the right size - I’m 5’5” and ordered a small and it was the right length and looks flattering
4.0,Perfect shade of purple!  Sizing appears to run small; I am an XL but ordered 3X based on other reviews and glad I did.  It's a nice fit.
4.0,Very cute pendant I wear it everyday and shower with it on so far still no tarnish I’ve had it for over a month
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet!  I received this bracelet three weeks ago and have literally not taken it off since. shower, lotion, gym, yard work... No stones have fallen out and it is the same gold color as when I first opened the box.  It is exactly 6.5 inches as advertised.  I took off one star because the stones are not as clear as my real diamonds however unless they are next to one another,no one would know.  Either way, this bracelet surely sparkles.  I got this on sale and will be buying it in silver when the price drops.  Truly beautiful piece of jewelry."
4.0,These fit my 10 yr old perfectly but a little big on my 7 year old.i like how many you get but they come with zero filter inserts...zero. they should have at least come with 1
4.0,Product as expected. No complaints on product and quality. 4 stars since price is a bit steep.
4.0,"wear my bracelets!! My husband has no finger nails so he could not help me with my bracelets. With this handy little tool, I don't need help."
4.0,"I like it, it's a bit bigger than expected but that's my fault cause it's true to the measurements but I like it because I can keep cash if needed and I won't have to worry about key rings or keys for that matter breaking and getting lost."
4.0,"Cute, the color is a little lighter than pictured.. Fits as expected and good overall."
4.0,"Comfortable bra, just wish the straps on top were narrower so it doesn't show with some blouses."
4.0,"Love the material and the graphics, but runs small.  Husband wears an XL and he purchased a 3X for comfort."
4.0,Makes Identifying the keyset for the Moto Guzzi simple and fast.  Seems well made and large enough to keep the keys visible.
4.0,"Very nice boots! A wee too hard to get them on, the ankle portion is TIGHT. No give either. Once you get them... nice."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, but they are heavy"
4.0,Wish I was able to tighten more securely
4.0,I wanted a compact umbrella my son could easily store in his backpack and use to and from school. It doesn’t collapse properly now but still works. Perfect for him. He’d break any kind I’d get. 🤣
4.0,"These are cute for an average height man, my hubby is 6’4 and these are shorter than normal still cute but for inside."
4.0,"I love the color, the feel of the fabric and dye job.  The problem is that this is very very very very short. I am as short person and it's still way way to short.  I would not even wear this to get the mail  without wearing shorts or leggings underneath. Usually everything I buy is way way too long, this is more of a shirt than a dress."
4.0,They're fine for the price. they're warm. I feel like they're going to fall apart if I'm too rough with them though.
4.0,Bought it as a gift for my mom.... she loves it... good quality.. just right for everyday use
4.0,"Needed a short sleeve version for a different uniform. Only downside is I was sent the wrong color, nothing I couldn't hide easily though.<br /><br />Regardless I'd still buy it again. I like the snug fits and buy them in small, I'm 5 7 and about 140."
4.0,"This is an awesome shirt but fits really small for its stated size. I consistently wear M, but this fits like a small all around."
4.0,This is a fun party outfit but it really should have been labeled petite. This simply will NOT work for anyone that has a long torso or long legs - absolutely a NO GO due to short torso and short leg fit.
4.0,Super cute without the tassels I cut them off right away -the tassels do NOT match color of dress
4.0,Beatiful but no true the size!
4.0,"These are really lovely on. Loved the mirror finish and color. Taking one star off for comfort as the nose pieces are a bit tight/pointy on me. Overall, though, GREAT deal! Received a lot of compliments."
4.0,Shipping was a bit long but these were exactly what was pictured
4.0,faded super easy. fit good though.
4.0,"As adorable and well made as hoped. Was a bit small on my 11 month old (size 12-24 months) although he does wear 2t now in most clothing. It squeezed on for a wonderful addition to his owl Halloween costume, but he won't be able to wear it a while as I'd hoped."
4.0,More of a mustard yellow then the yellow it looks
4.0,Fits just as expected. VERY stretchy. And very long. Longer than I expected. I am 5 ft 7in and it hits calf. But other than that good fit.
4.0,"The fabric could be slightly longer so that it wraps around not so tightly when putting on, but I guess thats probably just my fat ass.  wrapping the cover up over the front of me is kind of a struggle and I wish it covered the girls more...and I'm only a b cup. but once i adjust and cover everything/tuck them in it fits nicely. it'll be a great lightweight alternative to a dress as a beach cover up for my Florida vacation in a week!  the material is so silky smooth and very very light.  and the pattern hides all lines/imprints from bikinis.  I recommend. why the hell not."
4.0,"I like this shirt for the most part. It fits well and looks like the picture. The only thing I don't like (apart from the incredibly strong smell) was that the back part of the crossover feature wasn't sewn down. If I didn't get the crossover part &#34;just right,&#34; the back part only folded down part way and I could see the seam. I do have to adjust the shirt quite a lot to get it to look and feel right, but I like it enough that I'll deal with it. I will be sewing the piece down in the back so I don't have to constantly make sure it's folded down all the way."
4.0,"The fabric is a bit cheap... but so was the top. It is cute, comfortable, and looks great."
4.0,"Good looking product, slightly thin for a hoodie. Kid likes the item."
4.0,The shirt is a great value and very comfortable.  It runs very large.  I should have ordered a smaller size.
4.0,"Only docking 1 star for the fact that the color looked a bit different in person. Otherwise, fit was great, the material is soft and comfortable - really a solid product for the price. I’m normally a 2X and i was nervous because it sounded like the sizing ran small, but i ordered an XL (it was all they had left) and it fits fine! In fact i probably could have gone down to a large"
4.0,It was a returned item and not checked very well. This shirt had been worn and had tooth paste drool on it. Other than that it was a a good purchase for the situation.
4.0,Cute shoes.  They were great for my daughter.
4.0,It was what I was expecting. Works well.
4.0,"I got Black, Dark Gray & Heather Gray in size small. I love that these come in a 3-pack! These cardigans are very lightweight and comfortable.  I have all three colors in the photos for reference. Dark Gray looks a little bit purple, as it does in the models' photo, which I wanted. I am size 5'3,"" and my waist is 24-26"" in inches. I usually get cardigans in a size medium or small. Overall, I like these and will be ordering more colors!<br /><br />PS. I am using my Dads' Amazon account."
4.0,"Really nice socks for wearing around the house on cold mornings.  They stay in place, don't slip on my feet or on the floor, and look good.  My sister and I would both buy them again."
4.0,Absolutely Love this top! The color is vibrant and the quality is very good. I believe that it runs small.
4.0,Too big in top section
4.0,"They’re a really soft material but they’re transparent. Order a size bigger, they run small."
4.0,Exactly what you see in the picture.
4.0,"These socks are very cute. Of course I am a fanatic for anything that has lace on it.The only thing that I didn't like about them is that the elastic around the ankles were not wide enough, so that you could slide your feet in them without struggling and ripping a hole in them trying to get them on."
4.0,Tools that come with package did not help to remove links to fit. Cost another $25 to have it sized.
4.0,"So I just got purse... I haven't used it this is just a first glance review... so it had some noticeable marks on the front of purse... maybe done when packaging, not sure, but they can't come off... for the price , it's cute.. I'll see how it does once I've used it..."
4.0,Love it! The fit was great for me.
4.0,"I'm a 38 DD with big hips and an hourglass shape. I'm not a small girl, so I went with the 3X after reading reviews (which is a huge blow to the ego, by the way!)<br /><br />The top did not work for me. At all. I had to go buy a new top, which is a bummer because I loved how this one ties. Even if it did fit, I don't believe it would have kept the &#34;Girls&#34; in very well. There is padding in the front of the top that is not removable; it seems as though the entire front is padding with a couple lumps in strategic places and covered with a veneer of swimsuit cloth.<br /><br />The bottoms I did like. The high waist is a definite plus, and I like how it's got this ruched look that helps hide imperfections. The leg holes are low cut for that cute retro look. My swimsuit didn't ride up, either. Very nice. It is thinner in the back than it is in the front.<br /><br />Overall I liked the swimsuit and I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,I love this shirt but it does ride up a bit and has to be pulled down. Still worth the purchase.
4.0,The only thing I don’t Llewelyn is the seam down the back of the top. Everything else I love about it
4.0,"Amazon for the win again!!<br />Love this dress very flattering and the color is great. I am always a size Large but sized up to a XL and I am glad I did, it fits perfect!"
4.0,"Ordered a large, could've ordered a medium.. 220lbs 5'10"
4.0,"Love the patterns of these headbands, purchased for running in the cold and it worked great! they are a little tight to begin with but didn’t give me a headache or anything"
4.0,"Very cute! Decent quality and the engraving is very clear. It came with a cute little thank you note too!<br /><br />The note said the bracelet should come in a velvet bag, but i didnt see a bag in the package so that was a little disappointing :(<br /><br />Overall good product!"
4.0,Shirt was exactly as advertised and look exactly like the pictures. it's soft and stretchy. I wouldn't recommend for a cardio day as it shows sweat pretty easily!
4.0,Purchased for my daughter and she really liked them.
4.0,It's a cute bag. The straps are a little shorter than I prefer but overall I like the size and quality.
4.0,"Love the pattern and it fits great, but was surprised to see other reviewer said it looks whiter than picture because mine is more gray. Still very cute, just not as &#34;white and blue&#34; as I thought the photo made it look."
4.0,"When compared to Apple products , very nice price , worth the buy"
4.0,"Very pretty, but too big for my taste. Will be returning."
4.0,"so cute, not the best quality but i just needed it for one night (at college lol)"
4.0,"I like the shirt but the fit is odd, particularly in the bust, I had to go 2 sizes larger for it to fit my bust, but then it is big in other areas. And my bra cup size is a B so I am just average size. I am 5’2, weigh 135lbs, normally wear size medium, I had to order XL.  I kept and will just wear around the house, shame it isn’t cut better."
4.0,Very good quality. Fit perfectly.
4.0,"I ordered these for my fiance because I have a pair of Dearfoam's myself and they are the most comfortable slippers I have ever had.<br /><br />I like the hard sole on these slippers because they are just like shoe soles, not what you normally see on a slipper. These soles go up the side of the ""shoe"" so he won't ruin them when he wears them outside to put the dogs out or to go to the corner for a paper.<br /><br />The upper part of the slippers is very comfortable, fuzzy, warm and soft, but the hard sole does mean the inside isn't as ""squishy"" as that of my own dearfoam's. Mine conform to my feet, sort of like memory foam--these don't do that but are still very comfortable. They are well suited to a man and he loves them.<br /><br />I also have to say that I love that these are machine washable. The construction is very sturdy and I think they will last him a very long time."
4.0,"The bottoms are a tiny bit tight whereas the top was too big for my 36DD, the top is super structured too which I didn't like so much. And after only two wear the underwire came out and stabbed me:( But still a cute suit."
4.0,Only problem was the strap came undone from the screws
4.0,The overall fit is good but I would like it to be a little longer...
4.0,"It’s really true to fit, however there’s a bad glare at the bottom of the lense."
4.0,"Great fit! Bottoms were perfect, not too loose and not too tight. I liked that the top had straps and wasn't a halter like most others. I wasn't a big fan on the design though. I'm 5'5, 120 IBs, and 34b cup. The Medium fit great."
4.0,"Cute shirt, much smaller than I expected.  Also shrinks when washed so order a size up! My son only got to wear it once before it shrunk up too small."
4.0,"The only feature missing is moon phases and tide times. Everything else is there.<br /><br />This is my second protrek, so they are all super accurate, super easy to use, and a bit cheesy looking. The first one lasted 20 years, and the buttons finally gave up on it.<br /><br />Casio does not seem to know how to move from a seven segment display to matrix one for some reason, so you get a display within a display. That needs fixing.<br /><br />Finally, the strap is beefier than the previous ones, but also pinches your skin more if you have hairy arms like mine. Altogether, a very nice 100% maintenance free watch."
4.0,"You have to pick up your feet to wear them safely. Super soft, and I use them as supportive slippers as I have plantar fasciitis...no more slipper sox or plain slippers for me.  PS they do squeak on hardwood floors :)"
4.0,"Very pretty, but needs to be hand washed."
4.0,Love this t-shirt! The color and fit was great!
4.0,A bit smaller than it should be. Material is pretty thin.
4.0,Cute and comfy! Just as pictured. Just a bit too big on the ankles.
4.0,beautiful and flowing
4.0,Use for barn work. Just enough to cut the wind.
4.0,"I bought these because I get leg cramps at night. Sometimes it was so bad I had to jump out of bed and say bad words. The one where the big toe starts to flex outward was the worst. Followed closely by the foot turning inward and the calf knotting up. I wear these when I sleep now and it doesn't happen anymore. When I'm laying in bed and thinking of getting up, there are times that I still feel the twinge of a cramp but it never develops. They work for what I bought them for."
4.0,"Pros: just as shown in the picture. I ordered the grey in a size small &amp; it fit a bit tight but I liked it, I’m 5’2 and 125lbs.<br />Cons: the material got me a little itchy, I’m assuming because of the glitter on the outside. Also, the slit for me personally is a little high, when I sit most of my leg is out so I need to watch out for that when I sit down.<br /><br />Overall though, satisfied with what I got."
4.0,Super cute dress for work. Just wish the pockets were actual pockets but I love it.
4.0,"Bought 18-24 months, too big. My daughter is 19 months but small for her age. Her feet are 4 3/4 inches but since there is no measurements I just went for 18-14 months. They were too big. I gave it 4 stars for the inconvenience of them not placing any measurements on their product. Otherwise it seems decent quality for the cheap price. Obviously it won't be the same quality as a known brand like stride rites."
4.0,Very pretty.  Only drawback are the posts which are made of a type of plastic.
4.0,"I dropped the score because of the toe seam (where they end of each side).  Sadly the seam was a bit too pronounced for my sensitive feet to wear; therefore, I gave them away."
4.0,Extremely large but okay
4.0,These are okay. They feel little bit cheap and plastic-y. Not smooth and thick like the last pair I ordered on Amazon. But the two toned is cool and they are HUGE so they cover the face when in need.
4.0,It was delivered on time. and was described as it is.
4.0,Beautiful top but it was too small
4.0,Dress is fabulous loved it top is a little stretchy glad I ordered up.<br />I can wear 12-14-16 's depending on fabric. I ordered XL<br />Fit was perfect!<br />Would order again. Bought black & Navy
4.0,Nice soft and colorful. Just order one size bigger. For 8 yr old I ordered 14 size for 2.5 yr old I ordered 3t. Works good.
4.0,These aren't as pretty in person as you'd think.
4.0,"I love the quality of this coat. I bought it for costume use, but it is a REAL lab coat, in a style that's harder to find. You can unsnap all but the bottom snap and the left shoulder snap to fold back the chest if you want to.<br /><br />I doubt that this coat could be effectively dyed, since it has stain guard treatment on/in the fabric. That's great if you actually work in a lab, not so great if you want to modify it for a costume.<br /><br />Fit: I usually wear XL to XXL shirts, but I have an 18"" neck. I purchased the XXL coat, and I'm glad I did. The neck is snug but not too tight. An XL would have been too small. The arms are a bit short and the cuffs ride up when I bend at the elbow. You can see the elastic cuffs above my long electrical work gloves when this happens. There would be a gap if I were just wearing nitrile gloves. I do think that the shape of the coat conceal my belly, which is nice."
4.0,Love the quality of the fabric.
4.0,Very warm and cute. Nice quality.
4.0,Esta bonito pero me<br />Esperaba algo mejor
4.0,"I purchased this hoodie with the intention of wearing it as a dress. However, the arms are nice and large but the mid-section tends to be tight. Its like the upper part of the hoodie is 2XL and the midsection is medium. It is cute, I am just not going to be able to wear it as intended."
4.0,"If you are like me, you go off of photo reviews! Gave it four stars because it arrived broke from the clip (I don't think it was the sellers fault but shipping). Other than that it is gorgeous and great for the price! Hoping to get a new one."
4.0,the pink rubber thing at the nose is easy to come off.. but it's sturdy and I like it
4.0,"This is as described...a basic push-up bra. No frills. At all.<br /><br />You get what you pay for. But, having said that it, it is a very good value if you just want a basic bra.<br /><br />I thought it ran slightly small. There's also a fair amount of padding in this bra, so it does make the most of what you got."
4.0,"Very nice material but the elastic waist is very tiny and I bought a size XL.  The waist looked like it was a size small on an XL garment.  Sadly, it had to go back."
4.0,"I ordered a size up but it still seems a bit too small on me. The buttons that hold up the straps are at nipple level and the hem of the pants is about 10 inches above the bottom of my feet. I am over 6 foot tall so it is hard to judge size. If I was more well endowed or bigger around the middle then I would not be able to fit at all. I was really hoping for a wider leg and waist than what arrived. The material feels more like linen that you might use as PJs, so it is soft but still ok for wearing outside"
4.0,Bought this for my Grandbaby. The outfit was cute for her Halloween pics. Legging size was way off and couldn't use them. The other pieces were cute.
4.0,We got several of these custom necklaces for the girls in our family. They are VERY PRETTY and the girls loved them. However they are quite thin and were easily bent.
4.0,"The suit was very pretty but was very small. If I ordered it again, I would have to order a size larger."
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, but runs large. Have to return for an exchange. I get mediums but this fit like a large. Other than that, it wears very nicely and it's well made."
4.0,Seem very comfortable as I just tried them on when I received them
4.0,"This fits and feels good, but the leather needs some oil or something to give it a better look.  The Black alligator grain band looks way better in my opinion.  I might try to doctor this one up and see if I can give it a richer patina, right now it just looks sorta cheap."
4.0,I love see through tops and bodysuits. I love this one but the colors could have been richer. Still happy with the purchase.
4.0,Awesome item I'm a very curvy woman and I have large breast 36DDD and they aren't perky. With this outfit I'm able to wear it braless and it holds in and holds up my breast. The Jean material is stretchy. I'm happy with the outfit.
4.0,Dress is well made. No complaints there. But it runs so big. I bought XS and it’s too long and too loose everywhere. Doesn’t give me any kind of shape. I’m 120lbs. 5’1. Even if I have it hemmed up lengthwise it still will not be very flattering. I wanted to love it because it’s so cute on the model.
4.0,Didn’t wash up very good
4.0,"I cut these down and make belts for Barbies to sell on Etsy.  I needed a color I was out of in a pinch and I got them the next day, so that was good.  However, I was disappointed that there wasn't a silver in my package. I wonder if it would be possible to request specific colors. Overall, they'll work fine for my purpose."
4.0,"I purchased these to replace a Tiffany & Co pearl earring that I lost during travel.  I didn't want to spend too much on a replacement pair and these were a welcome surprise for the price!  The backings are a little loose, but I've had no trouble with them staying on.  The one strange thing (that isn't obvious in the advertised product pictures) is that the pearls are a tad squashed; they're not perfectly round like what I expected, but they look fine when worn.  Would definitely recommend as a budget pair."
4.0,Very nice jacket.  Glad I ordered a size large after reading the reviews. I am 5'4&#34; and weighs 125 lbs and normally wear a medium.  Looks better worn unzipped than zipped.
4.0,"Very cute kids socks, perfect for baby who is just crawling so protect legs from the floor!"
4.0,I bought this to wear throughout my pregnancy so it's okay that it's big but it wears like a potato sack.
4.0,Gave as a gift. Cute for teen girls.
4.0,good quality and roomy. I wanted a shoulder strap not a cross body but this will work for now. I am ordering a shoulder strap to attach to it.
4.0,"Like them, but somewhat overpriced for the quality. & also very, very snug. Hope they stretch a bit."
4.0,"It's good but you need to get used to it. Every mouse responded different to this.<br />Honestly I did not like it for gaming I thing is very big for the space I have, but I used vertically in my office and it just works fine.<br />Mine got full of stains very quickly and even is washable I could not get them off, at least not all of them.<br />But other than that it just works and looks good."
4.0,"Great shirt, great price. I'm a 14/16 & got the US 16, I should have went for US 14 it runs just slightly big. But over all love the style and the color (grey)"
4.0,Buen producto tal cual lo esperado pero la fecha se descuadra un poco
4.0,Makes my fitbit look like a piece of jewelry!
4.0,It fits well and secure and looks good but I'd love a more vibrant red like G-shock
4.0,"These are very nice glasses. They don't have any tint to them though, which makes me wonder if they're blocking the blue light. The colors are NOT like the photo. I ordered the mixed color pack and they seem to be either brown or grey. They are very comfortable and came with a cleaning cloth and one soft case. I would recommend."
4.0,I like the casual look. its is a good purchase.
4.0,"Can beat this for the price. It’s so cute and extremely comfortable. It is a little shorter than I expected but not too short. The fit, however, is great. The only issue is that you should wear a slip with the dress and finding one short enough has proven to be more difficult than I thought it would be. The 16” slip I have comes right to the hem of the dress warranting a 14” or 15” slip. That length is hard to find."
4.0,Nice necklace.  Would have like to seen it received in a necklace box or even a small cardboard one.
4.0,"I have to hand it to this company. The first white visor it sent had several small dirty smears on it. I said so and the company sent me a new, clean one immediately; cost free. Five stars for customer service. As for the visor itself, fit as expected. I like it. Also bought a red one."
4.0,"While this is decent quality, the creases from sending it folded means you have to iron it quite a bit to make it wearable. The material is good for meetings that go long and the rooms are freezing. I should've got my regular size of Small. The Medium is large on me and a bit too long. However, might work better in the colder months when I layer up."
4.0,"I am in between a medium and large and it fit in all the right places. It’s very soft and breathable! You can dress it up or down. I ordered a large and have a little room! I am 5’6, 140lbs, and a DDD. I also have a long torso and have run into no issues."
4.0,It’s a horizontal textured sweatshirt. Comfortable to throw on over a shirt. Good length for my small frame.
4.0,Good enough for the price. Comfy.
4.0,"The fit is a little larger than true to size. I would have almost gone a size smaller had I known. I would say that they are designed for bottom heavy body types (wider hips and fuller bottom) and I am not that type so a medium would have probably been a bit more flattering in the backside...but they are just for lounging around and working out, so I am not that worried about it...and just for the record, they are not hideously unflattering, I would have returned them if they were, this is for sizing information only. the look is great and they are really comfy!"
4.0,Liked. It was used a a gift.
4.0,Really nice ring but fits a little big so we can't use it.
4.0,This is a casual dress that falls above the knee.  It also has 2 side pockets.  It's machine washable.  Good to wear on a hot day out with friends or walking on the boardwalk at the beach (could be used as a swim cover-up).
4.0,Love them will order again
4.0,"Really like it! I'm  5'5&#34; 160 lb and typically wear a 38DD. It compressed my chest a bit, which wasn't super flattering, but it did cover my belly which was a bigger concern."
4.0,high price
4.0,"Good quality, fits well. Bought for adult man."
4.0,"I have several pairs of glasses and rather than keeping them in individual cases, I went online to Amazon and browsed through what was available.  I am happy with the purchase.  There is not much to say other than that this is a quality product and a case that holds these many glasses is in fact useful.  I vaguely recollect that the price was a bit on the higher side, compared to others, but I am satisfied with the purchase otherwise."
4.0,Loveeeeeeeee this piece
4.0,Very cute shoes but the buckle is super annoying
4.0,"This skirt is a beautiful color, I feel like a ballerina when I have it on. I’m tall (5’10”) so it’s not floor length on me, but still hangs nicely around my ankles. The perfect skirt to wear in the summer months to church or a casual outing."
4.0,Very nice. Better quality than I was expecting.
4.0,Good dress for summer
4.0,Fits well and very sturdy.
4.0,I love this shirt! It’s so feminine and flowy and it has a very flattering fit. The spaghetti straps are great for summer but it looks good underneath a cardigan or jean jacket too. A little thin but super cute!
4.0,The Zipper is not finished well where it starts at the bottom of the sweater. It is over bounded by the thick sweater edge threaded material instead of a more clean traditional finished edge. I had to use a scissor to cut back the threaded material to expose the zipper mechanism on both sides to get it to zip properly. I am really concerned that over time the zipper will not perform well.
4.0,"These shoes are about 1/2 size too big.  I ordered a 9.5M, which is my regular size, got them and they were way too big.  Sent them back and reordered a 9 and they are still a little big, but my husband can wear.  Other than the sizing, nice comfortable boot."
4.0,"These slippers are ADORABLE. However when ordering, note that they run VERY small.  I ordered a size bigger than my girls wear and they were still small."
4.0,Compared to other shirts made by the same manufacturer..it runs a bit larger than others
4.0,"An extra star for the follow up in customer service. I have purchased a couple dresses from Homeyee and they were both made with a thicker material and have better sewing. There are many loose threads on this dress and the material is significantly thinner.  There is also unattractive puckering at the side seams so if I don't rest my arms at my sides, you can see that the seams don't lay smooth. This quality is not what I have come to expect from this company and I am disappointed by the workmanship. Note also that the sleeves are longer and wider than in the picture."
4.0,El collar está lindo y la cadena gruesa
4.0,My 4 1/2 year old mermaid loves it.
4.0,I get a ton of compliments when I wear this HOWEVER it sheds like crazy!
4.0,It’s a super cute top. Getting compliments already. I would steam let it air dry after washing and steam it.
4.0,The belt doesn’t fit But other then that it’s pretty
4.0,"These shorts are comfortable and are perfect for my home workouts. They are longer than I expected, but they fit and meet my needs."
4.0,Looks great. Could be lighter.
4.0,Basic subtle for casual wear
4.0,"Super cure glasses, mine came with the logo on glasses so I am assuming this is an original. not sure if this is polarize but overall it is a good sunglasses. The only down side is that it didn’t came with a cleaning cloth"
4.0,I love it!! Wore it in the ocean on vacation and I slept with it on. Still beautiful ❤️
4.0,This necklace is beautiful but smaller than expected.  It's my fault for not paying attention to the description but my friend still loved it.  It was a retirement gift so that's all that matters.
4.0,"These are a nice set of slippers.  They are quite comfortable, feel good on the feet and have some good support unlike some where you may as well be wearing just socks. They look pretty good.  Time will tell with durability, but no immediate obvious concerns--no visible glue, no hanging threads, no separation or cracks. They look and feel as if they’ll hold up.  I would recommend sizing up at least a half-size and if you tend to wear thicker socks with slippers a full size; they definitely run small.  recommended."
4.0,I wore these to work today. Very comfortable. And good for the office.
4.0,The very nice bag is the chain of the bag
4.0,They work great.  But they were a little tight for me.  My husband uses his for work and I made mine into scarf mask.
4.0,"I love this costume but I should have ordered in the 3x instead of the 2x. It was quite snug in the top area as well as the bottom sleeves. Although I still received many compliments, I will always go up a size when ordering items such as this!"
4.0,"This is a very lightweight pant meant for hotter climate. It should serve that purpose well. It is made of a raincoat like material, which is comfortable against the skin.<br /><br />The medium pant fits as expected for an average/regular length person. The drawstring at the ankles will help it fit petite/short with a sweat pant effect or will just drape over hike boots without the extra couple inches getting in the way. This drawstring is also helpful to place the pant higher on the leg as shown by the photo.<br /><br />Good quality and nice deep grey color. The price could be lower considering the material used, but overall a good buy for what it is, and the adjustability for a hiker’s height and/or need to keep the pant higher off ankle during hike stops at water, walking through water areas, or just cooling off."
4.0,I really like this charm. It fits great on any pandora like bracelet and looks great too. It's perfect for anyone looking to personalize there bracelet a little more. I got this product on a review site for my honest opinion.
4.0,"My order was one size. I’m 5’8, 175 lbs, 38B. Fits just right. Flowy but not too big. Length is just right for a tunic blouse. Not anywhere near a dress for long waisted ladies. Got light pink and is pretty apricot pastel as shown. Beautiful embroidery. Brown banding looks v dressy with brown slacks."
4.0,"It's cute but it's super small! Just the top, i have big boobs and the Largest size too was too. Small. Others then that it looks as pictured, and I'm still gonna wear the bottoms! Lol"
4.0,"This was an extremely lightweight headband. I wore it in the cold weather as well as warmer weather, it worked well in both. It is not completely fleece so it didn't have me overheated. The only negative for me was that it didn't completely fir over my ears so it made it a bit cumbersome. Otherwise I would recommend it for anyone looking for a fitness headband"
4.0,Lovely dress! I got a lot of compliments! Great dress<br />I got a large but I should have gotten a medium but I wore it anyway
4.0,Suit fit as expected. Good quality.
4.0,When I received the socks they felt thin and chintzy.  After washing and wearing them. They are actually very comfortable and durable
4.0,Bought for my 16 year old kid. He says they are great
4.0,"It took 5 weeks to receive and my tracking info was incorrect, but I will admit it's a nice top.  I'm 5'5 135 lbs. and a 34C cup and this fits me perfect.  It's the perfect summer top to wear with skinny jeans, or cut off shorts."
4.0,"I love this suit! It's flattering and ""sucks you in"" without giving the ""overflow effect.""  I do wish it had just an extra half inch of coverage on each side  on the booty, but I will continue to wear it."
4.0,"Husband said they are pulling moisture from my feet, they dry my feet out and my feet smell awful when I wear them."
4.0,"i gave it four stars because the posts are a little long, and if you fall asleep in them, for instance, the poking can be very uncomfortable.  great quality and wonderful classic design!  get the 10mm; an expensive look for little money!"
4.0,"I love this corset because it is very comfortable. However, it is made for women with large hips. We had to take out part of the hip section and sew it back in order for it to fit me. However, after that I loved the way it fit!"
4.0,Like the color and fabric . My friend’s daughter look cute in this outfit. Not reccomended for thin baby.
4.0,This gown fit me beautifully!!! I am wearing it for formal night on my cruise and I know my guy is going to it .. I usually wear a large but with amazon things I will get an xl.  The large fit great!! Don't be afraid to jump on this
4.0,Fit is OK but runs a bit small.
4.0,A little larger then expected but still very soft and comfortable
4.0,"I didnt realize how high wasted these jeans were and they are very see threw. Other then that, they fit perfect."
4.0,Good glasses. They are a little big for me but fits okay.
4.0,Beautiful bangels I purchased seven of them for my wife and she love's them.
4.0,"The flash coming through the symbol actually pokes my ear cartilage making it somewhat uncomfortable, but may be fine for someone with different industrial placement. It's very cute and good quality,and it's The Flash, so I will keep wearing it."
4.0,"The only negative I feel about this purchase is it was a surprise gift for a friend, which I had shipped to her. She loved it, but she had no idea who had sent it. I didn't mind that a gift card wasn't available for it, but I thought the package would show who sent it. Luckily, she suspected it was from me and contacted me. This might be a process to fine tune."
4.0,I'm 5'9&#34; and ended up returning the product because the dress was about 3 inches above my knees. Not the fit I was looking for - too short.
4.0,Kid loves it. Took a while to arrive.
4.0,I did like the dress however I needed to travel with it for a wedding and it would wrinkle
4.0,"The material is so soft and light weight, perfect for summer.  I love the vibrant color. It seems to run just a bit large so if you are wanting it to be more curve fitting order a size smaller then you normally wear."
4.0,It would have been nice if the stripes had matched up at the side seams
4.0,Great feel. Great price. Soft!!
4.0,"These are definitely quality made. I can't really tell if these make it look like I'm wearing gages or not, but they are unique and I really like them. Overall these are pretty cool."
4.0,great gift for first baptism
4.0,"This is a nice nylon feeling soft fabric that is stretchy. It has a thick pad where the eyes are so it’s impossible to see through. My wife probably wears a “large” hat, and has a full head of thick hair. It fits her well."
4.0,sock ministry
4.0,"Item as described.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with how pretty the colors are.  Very tight and nice quality, will last a while."
4.0,Light weight and eye catching
4.0,"There is nothing wrong, persay, about this cardigan, I just had expectations that were not quite what this is.  First I was expecting a light-weight cotton sweater, this is more of a t-shirt material.  Okay, I can adjust to that.  It's not quite as long as the photos, but I'm tall (5'11"") so I won't knock stars off for that.  It is a bit more brown than I expected.  There's green, brown and black in it.  That threw me a bit, so I did leave a star off for all of those things together.  I did find it true to size.  Altogether, not a bad wrap/cardigan, just not exactly what I expected."
4.0,Just as described. A little heavier than I expected.
4.0,"Product fit as expected, nice material."
4.0,"I like the bag for how well it stands up on it's own without falling over. This one seems to fill up quickly with smaller items falling to the bottom. I use another zippered bag to contain smaller items, but there is not room for much more than a wallet, a planner, and a glasses case. I also miss a center zipper pocket in the middle of the bag.  It came as described though. It comes with 2 other pieces, so it is a great buy if you like to carry smaller bags on occasion. It also wipes off easily with a damp cloth."
4.0,"Loved the size and color of these earrings.  Not to big, and not to heavy.  Unfortunately, someone broke into my car and stole my luggage.  Good bye cute earrings, as well as the skirt I bought them to go with 😞"
4.0,"Beautiful boots. Really sexy. Normally a.  9 is the smallest size I can wear.  These are a bit tight in the toes, but they go on. I guess a 10 would be better.  Can't beat the price though, not for as sexy as these are.  Really well balanced too. I can walk in these and not feel like tipping over."
4.0,gonna order more love the free feeling and fits good even with erection in mornings and im quite large down there
4.0,I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the material this blouse is made of. I somewhat expected it to be very thin and not fit well. It is quality material and the fit it great. I received many compliments on the both the style and color of the top. I would recommend this item as both a casual and business casual top. I have worn it out for girls night and to work.
4.0,"I have bought and returned A LOT of tulle skirts on Amazon looking for the perfect one. This is the best one found. It's a little longer than pictured and a tiny bit loser in the waist than expected, but still lightyears better than anything else I've found!"
4.0,Love it! Fits just right & I luv that it has thumb holes. Love it with jeans.
4.0,So far so good and really cute
4.0,"Comfortable, but somewhat small."
4.0,bigger on the inside then expected
4.0,"Bit larger than expected, but even prettier in person. Nice quality product, including nice packaging. Beautiful statement piece."
4.0,"Soooo this is very cute.  I, however, can NOT wear this as a dress.  I may be a bit curvy but there is no way I can wear this like the photo shows.  It does look cute with leggins or jeans tho.  So, I'm still happy.  It is cute and is of good quality.  It's just not a dress for those of us with curves.  Thank you."
4.0,"The dress is a cute style! The material is very comfortable too. The material is a little on the thin/see thru side so you may have to wear a slip, but not bad see thru to where you can't or don't want to wear it. The comfort definitely makes up for the thinness of the material! Unfortunately it is sized a little small, so I had to return. I usually wear a dress size 6 or 8, bust size 34 waist 28. I bought a size Medium but it was a little tight in my stomach & butt. But otherwise I would have kept because it looks good on (if it fits). The material hugs your body a little (if you have curves) so it is form fitting but very cute style!"
4.0,"Good quality. The fabric is very heavy. I'm 5'2 113 lb, got a small one. It's little bit lose on me. Got a lot of compliments about my skirt."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised how cute and stylish these are.  Comfy but you need to wear cotton ankle socks.
4.0,"I like the softness of the pastel hues. It is exactly as pictured and I love it. The one thing I wish was different was the quality of the texture on the inside. However, once I washed it a few times it became softer and more comfortable, since I like to wear it without an undershirt I find this very important for me. I see this more as a shirt than a sweatshirt because it is more on the thin side and that is what I had hoped to use it for. Overall, it serves it purpose well and it is a great product."
4.0,Loving this dress! Purchased the burgundy color and it is beautiful. It’s a very comfortable fabric and has a lot of stretch it. Wish it was touch longer but its okay.
4.0,Wrinkly but comfy
4.0,The masks do what they're supposed to but they're not really suited for people who are wearing glasses since there isn't a pliable bit in the nose section to adjust and make sure that your breath does not fog up glasses. They are washable and they do a pretty good job with filtering air. If I didn't have to wear glasses I would wear these happily.
4.0,"Let me be succinct. (Notice, I didn't say &#34;brief.&#34;) These briefs didn't change my life, but I enjoy them.  You know, as much as anyone can enjoy ... briefs."
4.0,"Very high quality, same quality as what came with my watch from Apple. My only complaint is that the bands are noticeably smaller. The one I got from Apple, I wear on the tightest or second tightest notch, with these bands, I have to wear it on the 4th notch. I have very skinny wrists, anyone with larger wrists may want to size up, or risk this not fitting."
4.0,"I like this but it's kind of a pain to open until you get the hang of it, other than that it's great and strong!"
4.0,"Super cute pattern. I found it difficult to charge with the middle piece on, so I took that off and just use the straps. A little disappointing but I still like the look of the straps."
4.0,"It was really beautiful, however really small and I have tiny wrist."
4.0,5’7 155lbs I like a tighter fit so ordered a small. Fit was good materials seem good as well.
4.0,"Decent quality for the price, however I'm not a huge fan of the strechy material."
4.0,Well Made!👍👍<br /><br />I would order again! 😊
4.0,This is absolutely adorable It’s very sturdy totally get the ball and comes in all different colors and styles totally worth it
4.0,I like that the company reached out and asked for my measurements and made the dress according to them. It fit and shipped timely for my event. I didn’t have to take all 6 kids to the store and try on a bunch of dresses.
4.0,For my grand daughter
4.0,"So cute but I had to exchange it because there was a defect. There was some purple threading on the white part. Otherwise, the fit is great!"
4.0,This design gets tangled in itself easily.
4.0,Very warm but a little more bulky than I’d prefer. Love the color since it goes with many earth tones.
4.0,"I only gave it 4 stars because it is a bit big for me. I am 4&quot;10 100lbs with a natural pair of 32DDs (Yeah most of my weight is boobs lol) the bodice part of it has boning and the boning goes down a little far for me. The bra part of it is a bit too wide to give me any cleavage but it can easily be pulled together in the middle with a needle and thread.  Despite all of this, it still does look very sexy on me. Over all its a very cute, sexy and good quality costume."
4.0,"It fits baggier than I expected, but I have received many compliments. It’s very comfortable."
4.0,"The pouch is a welcome addition to these shorts, but consider ordering a size up if you're on the high end of your size range."
4.0,This is a very cute shirt.  It runs small and is thin material.
4.0,"Pros: They're cute, and a good value for the price. Good for indoor wear to keep your hands warm when reading, typing etc<br />Cons: Not super warm so I wouldn't wear them out if it's cold, and thumbholes fray easily."
4.0,I had to alter the chin strap otherwise the hat is perfect. Soft and comfortable. Very warm
4.0,"This fits my 4-year-old perfectly and she loves the pattern. Not sure how well it’ll hold up- it’s a little thin- but she’s 4 so she’ll probably grow out of it before she wears it out. I’ve gotten some leotards at target that seem to be a little better quality for the same price, but she loves this pattern so she chooses this one to wear. Overall a decent value."
4.0,Like it. But needs to be changed to brooch for the description
4.0,"Not totally sure this is genuine leather, but it does seem to be above average in quality. It is pretty flexible and doesn’t leave too much of a mark after wearing it for a bit. It is wider than most belts, but it does fit through the loops of jeans. Only issue I have is with the sizing. It seems to run smaller than standardized men’s belts."
4.0,"brim is a little large but flexible, nice hat done care for the bow, may take it off."
4.0,This was a gift for a oerson who sings in the chorus.  They said it was very thoughtful.  I thought it was a nice pin
4.0,"This bathing suit is classy and modest. The only problem is the cups, like other users mention. I bought a medium first and it looked fine but the suit was so tight on my booty that I looked like a can of pop and fresh biscuits on the brink of explosion. I sent it back and the large fit great but it makes my breasts a little pancak-ey. If you have a smaller bust, or haven’t had kids, this suit would probably work perfect. I still like it, but I wish it was a tad more structured. (My measurements are 32, 28, 40😑)"
4.0,Attractive and work as advertised.
4.0,"The wood in the picture looks finished giving it a nice glossy look, but the actual wood is much lighter in color without a finish, maybe a finish isn't good for the ears? Either way, they are still cute and the stones are nice, they are one of my main pairs that I wear!"
4.0,"It is not a bad choice to have one for the winter. They are soft and light weight. The quality is not very great, but not bad for this price. I am keeping it in my office to use."
4.0,good quality glasses
4.0,"The fit is very comfortable and the frame color is very stylish and versatile with different clothing. I like the polarization - visibility is very clear, but the lenses are not dark enough for very bright sunlight, and appear darker in the ad than they actually are. If the lenses were darker, they would be perfect."
4.0,"I actually loved the style of all the rings! Only downfall, the size. 3 fit good and the other 2 are very small, but for the price I cannot complain!"
4.0,Ordered this for my sister in law she loved design tank was good quality. Size XL fits more like a LG. She's has a larger chest so that's a factor as well. It's only for a cruise we are taking starting St Patrick's day so not really a big deal.
4.0,Fits well. looks good<br />just a bit thin
4.0,It was my favorite new bracelet until 2 if the strings broke. But the look is beautiful. The magnetic clasp is awesome.
4.0,"Most of the reviews and pictures are for the dress with the ruffle on the front. I bought a medium in the &#34;pure orange&#34; dress, which I thought was mostly like the other colors but is missing the ruffle. Nope. It's shorter. I still gave this 4 stars because it's not the dress's fault that I'm tall and a prude. I'm 5'9&#34; and about 140 lbs. On top I'm a 32C, and I'm about 40&#34; at the widest part of my hips. Being a younger-looking teacher at a high school, I won't wear a dress or skirt that doesn't touch my knee. This wouldn't come close. It falls just the below mid-thigh. I'm posting pictures, but the angle gives it the appearance of being longer than it is. (I don't own a selfie stick, so you're going to have to trust me on the length.) I considered keeping it and wearing it during the summer, but I'd be too concerned about being able to bend over in it.<br /><br />The top fit well, and with shorter legs and a run through with an iron, it would be perfect. I just can't."
4.0,Haven’t wore these yet but they look nice.  Will update review once wearing
4.0,Very nice!  Pretty item that goes nicely with Steampunk costuming!
4.0,"These leggings are true to size and showed up fast!  The print is exactly as pictured and they are opaque (they are leggings, not tights).  If you're looking for some comfortable leggings to show off your Scottish pride - or otherwise just want tartan leggings - these are great!"
4.0,These earrings are absolutely beautiful but I rarely wear them because they are very heavy and pull my ear holes.
4.0,"Cute, affordable but glue is weak and bow snaps off my daughter's head and requires re-gluing."
4.0,Great bag and looks great! I love the color too!
4.0,"I found this ran a little small, other than that the quality is great and was everything I was expecting"
4.0,"This shirt has a flowy type fit to it. I wore it with a pair of leggings and I loved the look. I gave it four stars only because the collar is a little bit odd looking because it has that turtle neck look too it but it sits just below the neckline, but before it reaches the collar bone. This is not a deal breaker because of the three different looks it gives you in one shirt: The long shirt is spiced up because of the cold should look, the peekaboo cutout in the back is a sexy surprise and the short/long combination at the bottom of the shirt adds to this stylish piece. I am 5'8, 165lbs, 36DD."
4.0,Shorter than the photo but it will work for what I wanted it for.
4.0,"These are absolutely adorable. Visually, they do not disappoint! They are actually metal! This means they are quite heavy. I read other reviews saying they were heavy before I bought them but since I'm used to large earrings I brushed off the warnings. Even for someone who wears ""heavy"" earrings, these are a little heavy."
4.0,Perfectas para el invierno.
4.0,Very cute dress but smaller than expected.
4.0,"I've waited a while before reviewing so they get worn enough to make a valid review.<br /><br />Had these for about 2 months and they are exceeding expectation.  I thought they were going to rip because of how thin they are. So far they are still intact.<br />I have taken these hiking, playing basketball, and running.  No issues.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the rubberized heel to keep these socks on.<br /><br />The reason for not giving 5 stars is because of how thin it is."
4.0,When you put them side by side they don’t align the best.
4.0,Works well came in crooked
4.0,"Not as soft or stretchy as expected but I haven't used it yet so I can't complain, so cute!"
4.0,"Very different and very creative. The box that it came in is really cute but when I open it was all tangled and what a nightmare to untangle it. But I managed. It is very long and I wore  half of it  pulled up on my back. It stays in place which is a great thing. It looks well made I have to wear it for a while to check the quality though. So far, I’m enjoying it."
4.0,Fits small. Got an XL and I wear a medium.
4.0,"A little bit big and boxy for an XL, but comfy."
4.0,"Surprised by the size, larger than expected, but perfect.  Surprising quality and detail for the price."
4.0,Good pair of fit over sunglasses.  However it makes the sunlight look blue.
4.0,"My daughter loved this necklace that I gifted to her for Valentine's Day. Perfect for kids, she is 8."
4.0,"I really like it, the only thing I wish it had were pockets."
4.0,This is a nice case. My nexus 5 phone fits in it. The case itself is big so not very convenient to place it in a small purse and take it with you.
4.0,"This dress is very cute.  I bought the purple red and its more red than purple but it is pretty.  The skirt fabric is stiffer and heavier than expected, but the dress appears to be well made.  The fit is perfect.  I'm 5'5&#34;, 145-150 lbs and I usually wear a size 8.  This dress really accentuates the waist.  Very flattering for a curvier figure.  I'll probably wear it with tights and boots this fall."
4.0,This is exactly what it looks like and I am very satisfied with the product. It fits perfectly fitted and is light material so it is not bulky. This is perfect for my vacation!
4.0,"Quality product. In particular, I really like the metal latch as it will give me more confidence in its durability while surfing and kayaking"
4.0,Love the product but it was not white and more vanilla color.
4.0,"Plain black dress, able to dress up or down, worked nice for a wedding. I'm 5'6 and it was just barely was off the ground even with a low heel on. Fabric was stretchy and comfortable. Few minor stitching strings present when I received it, but was able to cut them off without issue. Doubt it will last a long time, but for the price, I am satisfied."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. The material is a little see through which I dont really like and it shows more tummy then expected.
4.0,I received a lot of compliments at my Sorority brunch.  Loved the pockets. I will go back and buy others in different colors.
4.0,It seems like a good product . It is hard to  measure the effectivness of such a product against not using any product when attempting to stretch a shoe .I used it with a number of different types of shoes and did not experience any issues of staining .I would reccomend it .
4.0,The product was as advertized
4.0,"I measured and ordered based on the size guide but they were too big. I ordered the 4 pack; the color for the rose gold was inconsistent, some parts appeared lighter than others. Good price, would probably have kept if they fit."
4.0,"Nice fit for my birthday, glitter was glittering. Top fit just right and skirt had me have a nice body shape. You do need black undergarment"
4.0,"My wife purchased this women's v-neck to wear to work in as a teacher.  She ordered this in a large and it fits her the way other large shirts do with the exception that this one is intended to have a baggy feel to it.  She likes that it is very loose and comfortable to wear but nice enough to wear to work and still be dresses appropriately.  Teachers need to be comfortable and professional at the same time.  She likes the material because it is very soft and not to thin.  The seams are sewn well and should hold up over time and use.  The colors are fun and give off a nice pleasant vibe.  When it arrived there were no strange smells, stains, or issues with the shirt.<br /><br />I did not receive a discount for an honest review of this shirt or any other types of compensation.  I simply try to review all purchases to help others decide if this will work for them or if they are getting a quality product."
4.0,Pefrcy size
4.0,"beautiful watch, love the price. worn carefully I am  hoping to make it last."
4.0,"I simply love this suspender dress! I usually wear a L, but I bought an XL, because I wanted a little bit of a looser fit. It hugs your curves in all of the right ways and really like the higher waist. It is very retro-looking and comfortable. I really haven’t had many issues with the straps falling down. If you are in doubt, buy this. I saw similar ones on other sites for a lot more money."
4.0,"I'm glad one of my favorite bloggers shared this dress (@colette.prime on ig). It is such a fun dress, the straps and ties give it a unique look. The white parts are a little sheer depending on lighting so I would just recommend light colored undergarments and you'll be good to go!"
4.0,"Good quality for the price, I can wear them for days with no discomfort."
4.0,"This arrived fast, and is very pretty.  The stones look darker than this photo.  Still, it's pretty."
4.0,Okay quality. Cute style though.
4.0,"It's a little too short for 5""3"
4.0,Good fit ! Only for fashion purposes. Won’t stop cold winds!
4.0,Nice protection for expensive ear protection.  I bought this for my MSA ear protection.  It comes with a shoulder strap which is removable and makes fitting in a range bag easier.
4.0,"I ordered a Medium, i usually wear a small.  I was going to order a small, but didn't want it to look skimpy. The fabric is a nice soft knit.  I would order my normal size when I order from this company again.  It is a good value for the money."
4.0,"Gave as a gift. As I stated with my other reviews just a bit shorter than I wanted, but I can't complain.  Price is too good if you're looking for a lightweight scarf!"
4.0,The item came quickly. What I liked was that it looked exactly like the picture and the material was great. What I didn’t like was that the item ran big so the bottoms kept sliding off 😩.
4.0,The ring didn't have a black background as shown in the picture but my mom still loves it.
4.0,"Cute. Fit well. Not my favorite pair of workout capris, but they are comfortable and do their job. Not too sheer either, which is a plus!"
4.0,"They are short, but they do not bother me for that, I do know that is an issue for others. I love how pretty they all look and they are 8mm in the center. I prefer the smaller flare as I have a pair of stone plugs from the mall and they do not like to fit, at all. The reason I took a star off was due to the fact that a plug from the blue goldtone pair was chipped, but it doesn't effect my ability to wear them; however the pair of hematite had a giant scratch down the center, but it is typical for that stone."
4.0,"The color is not extremely bright, but worked great for costume"
4.0,"The lava rocks on the necklace and bracelet do a great job of holding the essential oils used. Six hours after use, I could still smell oil on the necklace when I shifted my head a certain way. The only reason I dropped this one star is that the set I received had a slight color &#34;mismatch&#34; between the necklace and bracelet; the bracelet was a true black while the necklace stones were more of a dark ash grey."
4.0,"I like the simplicity of this dress.  It is a little snug in the upper body, so I would recommend sizing up for a looser fit.  The belt is definitely super long, but it wasn't a huge deal for me."
4.0,my grand-daughter brought her puppy home-puppy is 11 months old and weighs 90 lbs.- these sleeves protect my arms from puppy's overt affections-
4.0,These fit my 4.5 year old son very well. He thinks they are super cool. We've only had them for a week so I can't speak to how durable they are.<br /><br />Edit: We've had them for 3 months now and they are still in great shape with no scratches or popped lenses.
4.0,"strap is a bit stiff, light isnt too good, looks nice is very functional for $10"
4.0,"I love this nose ring ! I gave 4 stars only because it was difficult to close. It’s comfortable, cute , not too big and the seamless hinge is a huge plus !"
4.0,The necklace is beautiful. Excellent quality. The earrings in my opinion could have been a little bigger and hang longer. The bracelet could have also been a little bigger.
4.0,"GREAT shoes, great packaging - EXCEPT I ordered a men's 8 and not a women's 8. I ordered these as a gift, waiting for them to get them back to me so I can hopefully return for the proper size - I only marked too large because it was my error in ordering wrong size."
4.0,I like them he wants to get them in but they are small n I have long nails it hard to help him open his holes
4.0,Pretty good gloves. Fits me perfect and will be using them in the winter. They seem sturdy and have survived on winter already
4.0,Nice top but a little too close fitting
4.0,"This probably does run true to size. I bought an extra large but it was frumpy. Go with whatever size you normally wear, no need to buy larger. It’s polyester and shouldn’t shrink which was something I was trying to factor in. Otherwise it’s really cute, colors vibrant. I ended up returning because I ordered way to large."
4.0,My daughter wore these at hwee skate party..... So beautiful
4.0,"The struggle is very real!  This shirt also fits really great, and is nice and soft.."
4.0,If you are a fashionista like me then you will live this watch. The only drawback is that I'm not sure how the magnetic clasp will hold a watch of this size. And the way I love it I definitely would not want it to fall of my hand.
4.0,"Okay, but disappointed that the black decorative is not solid, but broken."
4.0,"I didn't like it when I first put it on, but it's perfect to wear with leggings and it's warm as well."
4.0,Beautiful and very comfortable. Runs a little smaller than expected.
4.0,Ight weight
4.0,Like them  very much.  Hope they hold up.
4.0,"This is a great price for a two-pack. The leggings are not see-through at all. The ankle-length and capri-length in my pack were different fabrics, and even though I bought the same size, the capri-length were very tight. They are a much more tight-fitting, almost spandex-like material. The ankle-length felt like they were made of cotton and are much more comfortable. I would purchase both pairs again, but would go up a size in the capri-length. I got a medium in both. I'm 5'5&#34;, about 130lbs, with a 28&#34; waist and 40&#34; hips."
4.0,I loved the color and the lace it felt like you were wearing nothing and very elegant looking
4.0,I would definitely recommend these clear masks. I bought them for my Kindergarten aged son to use during Speech. They are great! They fit well (and have adjustable straps. He says they are comfortable and all of his teachers and friends love seeing his mouth. We've had them for over a month and he rotates wearing them almost daily. They have held up well with machine washing. The clear panel isn't quite as clear as it was originally but for the price I would definitely buy these again.
4.0,"Perfect combination of Valentine/Celtic theme for which I was looking, but this is a VERY dainty little bracelet - hearts are quite small.  I like the company, they ship quickly."
4.0,"This T-Shirt is light, looks great, and feels great. However, it does wick away sweat, but not  as well as other synthetic T-shirts I own."
4.0,Beautiful casual dress. Definitely order a size up.
4.0,"The skirt fit, it was a lil gathered (extra space)."
4.0,The hat is nice fits accurate true to size.<br />The graphics a great and sharp.
4.0,Very good shoe!
4.0,It works for my need.
4.0,"I bought this coral fascinator to wear to my daughter's wedding.  It is a great way to make a statement about being young and fun.  This one is fairly well made and very cute on.  It is a little larger than I had wanted, but it is not overwhelming.  I would have preferred one about half its size, but I couldn't pass up the price for this given that it will probably spend most of its life in my closet."
4.0,"Bought this to accommodate my growing pregnant belly so I went I size bigger than normal. Fits well, looks great and is super comfy! Only reason not 5 stars is that they are hand wash only."
4.0,Comfortable. Fit true to size but at 5'3&#34; it is a little too long for flats.
4.0,Loved this purse. Only thing I did not like was that the inside is a bit tight. Cramped more than what I expected. But other than that...beautiful purse.
4.0,"Yes, this hat has a purplish tent instead of a dark grey; but honestly it's working for me. The hat will look as shown if you just mess with it a little. It is very soft and does not itch at all. It arrived on time and overall, I am pleased with the result."
4.0,Fits a bit larger than i expected. I would have liked to be able to order a small as opposed to a small/medium.
4.0,"I normally wear a medium, but they  didn't have a medium so I ordered a small and unfortunately it was too tight in the chest area. There's no stretch to the fabric. Too bad because I liked the dress."
4.0,"El vestido es hermoso, algunos hilos fuera pero si relacionamos precio producto esta bien :), mido 5'4 y peso 114 libras, pedí  un small un poco holgado detrás pero no se ve mal."
4.0,Runs small.. light.. really cute. J ordered the olive green. It is short though. I ordered the large  5'5  162 lbs 34dd.  The clothes would have been too big.
4.0,"These don't include backs, so if you have extra no problem, but if you're like me you can't keep up with them. Somewhere in your home is a sock/earring back/spoon monster that just eats only one sock all the spoons and all the earring backs. However, the earrings themselves are BEAUTIFUL!"
4.0,"they are very pretty and have a good weight on them, but one of the keys broken on the top"
4.0,I like the sleeves but they do not stay on my arms. I wish they were just a little snugger.
4.0,"I have a very wide foot and this shoe fit perfectly EXCEPT!!!! Because my foot is wide the shoe strings weren't long enough. I am currently searching for the right shoe strings buy other than that, Everything else is perfect! Very light & comfortable to walk in! I am ready for summer!"
4.0,"Really soft material, will work well on hot days. No seams so no form to the dress so it hangs loosely. But it is comfy!"
4.0,"I loved this a lot. The only bad thing is it’s not meant for bigger chested woman, my boobs kept showing. It’d probably be best if you were pasties or a  bralette but I went with nothing."
4.0,I great purchase.<br /><br />Looks Good and comfortable fit.<br />Will and did purchase more than one.<br /><br />I recommend it with 4 stars
4.0,Very nice dress with pretty print. Perfect length for 5 feet 1 inch tall. I ordered S and the bust &#34;just fits&#34;. Not &#34;blousy&#34; enough so I will return for M. The waist and hips fit perfect. I am &#34;D&#34; cup.
4.0,It’s my everyday earrings and I love it. My only issue is that one of the backing is a little looser and would slide off the post easier than expected so there’s been a lot of instances where I had to stop playing with my son and find both the backing and the earring that fell.
4.0,"The upper part is more see through than I'd prefer, you have to make sure you're wearing a nude bra otherwise the straps will show through the dress. The belt it comes with is a bit thinner/smaller than the photo suggests. I also wish the belt came with a belt loop, because the ""tail"" of the belt just kinda dropped forward.<br /><br />Other than that, I like it a lot. The material is thick, not clingly or see through, the length is just right. It's comfy. Fingers crossed it holds up in the wash, because I like it a lot as a work dress.<br /><br />I'm 5'3"", 145lbs, with a large bust. I ordered the Medium and it fit just right."
4.0,Great material and comfortable but I would order a size bigger they are a very smug fit
4.0,"The review ask me to answer 'Do these shoes provide good arch support?' hahahaha, no no no, this bad never provide that..."
4.0,"Great buy, great price, a little too small for my needs"
4.0,"would've been 5 stars except the waistband rolls. they are a little long, and would've preferred a little tighter compression, but this seems normal for this type of product."
4.0,I really like these socks!  They seem to reduce sweating and odor - I just wish they were more affordable!
4.0,"I requested Return Paperwork from Amazon, because the lights wouldn't come on, even after switching out the batteries with new ones.  I had a friend of mine look at the battery container and he did someything I obviously didn't know how to do, they came on...and WOW! The hat looks great with the colors blinking.<br />Thank you."
4.0,"its Good quality fabric and a little stretchy, very warm good for cold weather."
4.0,"Really hot! Im 5'6 and 120 and i got a small that fits well! This dress is definitely revealing but in a sexy, gorgeous way. It doesnt look like too much and i think the slit isnt as bad as some of the reviews said. Its definitely a high slit but just be careful and everything will stay covered! The low back creates a really nice silhouette"
4.0,"This product is a good deal for the price. The material is soft but also more of a sleek shiny appearance. You could dress this up or down, but for me it was a little too much."
4.0,Got compliments and it stayed in place and feathers didn't fly off.
4.0,Pretty nice shirt but it’s very long.
4.0,This is a really nice style perfect for the holidays. I ordered the pink and it looks just like the picture a very beautiful muted lilac pink. I did however return due to being a little too long for my 5’3 height . It was about 2 inches past my knee and I prefer a few inches shorter to just hitting the knee or a few inches above. I also felt I was in between sizes . I’m 5’3 108 lbs with a 34 b chest . The small was very tight in the chest but perfect in the waist . If I sized up it would have been too big in the waist . I love the color a hope to buy another dress in this brand in the dusty pink shade.
4.0,"I'm really frustrated with this bikini. I absolutely love the print, colors, and cut of the suit, but it definitely runs very small. I'm currently a large in swimwear, sometimes a medium, but sized up to an XL in this to be safe, as I'm somewhat busty and have a bigger butt. For reference, I'm currently a 34D/DD and around 40-31-40-42 (bust-waist-hip-butt). While I could definitely get the suit on, you wouldn't catch me wearing it out right now. My bust was nearly falling out of the top, though it is wearable, but the bottoms completely cut into my hips and looked more like a straight up thong on me. The sizing chart in the pictures lists bust and waist measurements, but considering how huge the waist measurements are, I'm going to assume that column should say hip instead... With that in mind, I should have expected the bottoms to be tight, but I was hoping they would work.<br />As for the actual quality of the suit, it's pretty nice for the price, which is why I gave it 4 stars. There was a Cupshe tag attached and I've gotten some great suits from them in the past. I got an XL in the &#34;Light Yellow&#34; version because that was the only one available with Prime shipping at the time, but I actually wanted the blue or regular yellow one. I'd say the colors are very true to the pictures shown.<br />Overall, I plan to keep the suit and see how it'll fit as I start to slim down, but be very aware to size up at least one size, if not two. If you're smaller buster and slimmer than I am, and buy the right size, you'll love this bikini. It's a great deal! I'd just look at that size chart with the thought that the &#34;waist&#34; measurements are actually hip."
4.0,Excellent gift for mom! Beautiful and customizable as the family grows!
4.0,"Takes some time to recieve but I Love this Jacket!!! So comfortable!!! Love the style, look and feel of it!!! Just wish shipping wasn't so long to recieve it!!!"
4.0,I would have kept it if it zippered down the front.  But it was hard to get into without a little help but manageable with a little gyrating and plenty of time!
4.0,Likes:<br />Cute colors very vibrant<br />Great quality<br />Don’t show sweat from working out<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />Not very fitted but made it work
4.0,"I am usually a Large/XL in old navy clothing depending on the style and make, I wear a size 12/14 and this fit but I am not able to stretch my arms too wide without feeling like it might rip in the back area. Definitely size up  two size's."
4.0,Arrived early. Great bag!
4.0,"Super cute. Probably my favorite choker that I own. I like playing with the little pendant, but one day it actually came off. It wasn't too difficult to put back on, though. The lace is maybe a little bit scratchy, but that's to be expected with most lace products. Overall, I would definitely recommend."
4.0,"This large  brim hat is made of a nylon or polyester fiber with side mesh vents. I washed it by hand  immediately out of the package. I don't think it would hold up in the washing machine since I can't tell if the brim is plastic or cardboard sewed in the fabric.<br /><br />Perfect  for bike gardening or hiking, watching the grandkids at the park. It won't keep you warm for winter hiking or bike riding.<br />The rim is so large it might be good in the rain.<br />The khaki is very neutral.The black is a little washed.<br />I ordered two different styles, wore one to a family yard party and now have added another fan to these hilarious hats. They are stylish but the brims are so large they look a little goofy but don't let that deter you. The enlarged base ball cap has a detachable flower; the fabric of the flower is better than the fabric of the hat.Just remember to wash by hand, they dry quickly.These hats are better then walking around with an umbrella, try different colors"
4.0,Good fit and comfortable. Not my preference in fabric but good for the price.
4.0,"It was a tad short, but not bad at all!  Super cute!!!  The material is nice and soft and comfy!"
4.0,"Good belt, but the cut out logo at the end broke off after a while, still recommend"
4.0,A little longer than I expected.
4.0,Follow the size chart and you'll get a comfortable fit. These shorts are mid thigh length and are very comfortable. I use them for around the house wear and for short bike rides. The side pocket does hold and keep my S20 Ultra secure.<br /><br />I wash in cold and tumble dry low.
4.0,"Like the colors, paracord feels thin, don't know if I would rely it to hold my canon m50"
4.0,"Easy to personalize! My sister loved it, I made them for us for Christmas. The pockets are very uneven, and it’s not the nicest quality. But I do recommend!"
4.0,"Pros: lightweight<br />  Easy to clean<br />  Good length<br />Cons: Needs to be waterproofed.<br />  Material is a catch-all adhering to<br />  any food particles or other fabrics,<br />  making you appear very messy<br />  after even very limited use."
4.0,Very soft but they are definitely see thru.
4.0,This item looks nice but too wrinkly for me. Even after put into dryer.
4.0,"Love them, they were so beautiful just as the pictures."
4.0,Pretty! Not quite as darkly tarnished as I though but still nice...
4.0,I love that it clips to my purse and I don't have to dig out my phone to see what time it is. What I didn't like was how long it took to get here. It must be shipping from the moon. :D
4.0,Great sunglasses for the price! The lenses are dark and most definitely polarized! I love the variety of frame color choices as well.
4.0,They are ok but I have high hopes they were going to be better
4.0,"Thick, warm and soft. Perfect for wear under boots, but a little too bulky to wear with my flats. (Too bad because the colors are pretty.) I suspect they will come in handy during the subzero days I know are in my future here in Chicagoland.<br /><br />The only downside to these socks is the care. They take a long to air dry, hanging off the shower rod. This stops me from wearing them even more."
4.0,So cute but made small.
4.0,Good glasses. No problems. Slightly darker tint than I expected from the picture. I use them for biking and am happy with them. They have some flex in the arms so I'm not worried about breaking them.
4.0,"I bought these for my 6 year old granddaughter.  She really likes them; they are soft and the design is cute.  They are a bit too loose on her so she needs to keep adjusting them but if they were smaller, I do not think they'd fit over her head.  So far, she hasn't needed to wear them for a long time so I don't know how that will be."
4.0,Perfect size and color that I was looking for. Delivered promptly.
4.0,"This dress fit as expected! I ordered a large (I can very from size 10-12) because I wanted a little wiggle room. However, it was staticky when I put it on to try. I wore this dress with spandex underneath and it helped a lot with the static, didn't stick to me the whole night. Very comfortable material and very danceable!!"
4.0,"Muy bonita , y se parece bastante a Pandora, los charms son bonitos no brillan tanto, pero la pulsera es muy bonita, es para regalo espero que dure!"
4.0,This bathing suit is very cute. It fit perfect on me. The only reason him giving It 4 stars is because the wiring came out after the first wash. Other than that I was complimented on It. I was doubting about ordering due to not sure about the sizing. I weigh about 145 and ordered a L It fit me perfect.
4.0,"Great fit and feel rash guard for BJJ. Perfect length for a bigger guy, no slip during training. Superior wicking and odor control. This shirt does what it should."
4.0,"Love the colors! I've only wore one pair, the reason why I have not worn the others is because the little piece of fabric that is by the ankle really bothered me, to the point that I thought a bug had bit my ankle! Maybe you shouldn't put that piece of ribbon because it is very annoying. Thanks!"
4.0,"Loved the product, design, and look bt it was a little large but I can live with this"
4.0,"Beautiful and just as pictured. A good length, not short like so many Tshirts. Slightly snug in the waist area for the size, but otherwise a great shirt. Colors are pretty and as pictured."
4.0,cute for a lounge shirt for my teen daughter. need an undershirt for it tough cause it does hang pretty low and slides off the shoulder easily.
4.0,The small was a smaller fit than expected.
4.0,Super cute but the batteries were dead when we got them.
4.0,Somewhat large but I washed and dried it and now fits perfectly. Im 5'2 and 155lbs bought a large.
4.0,"Bought this legging for my wife and she loved it. The material is so soft and comfortable. It perfectly fits on her body. It has a beautiful curvy design at the bottom. The best part is it has a pocket on it, where you can keep your phones or cards while in a gym. Looks so attractive and eye-catching."
4.0,Nice jacket but the 2x is way to small
4.0,Very comfortable. Fit well and loved the hemline. Washes well and retains shape.
4.0,I sent them back. I ordered two sizes larger than I wear and they were still too small!
4.0,"I usually have severe swelling in my feet and ankles on long distance flights. I wore these on a recent trip lasting 15 hours. The socks are far more comfortable than others I've tried. They are easier to put on and the wide band doesn't feel binding or cut into my leg. Swelling was reduced, although not eliminated, and there was less pain and discomfort. I recommend the socks and believe they are a quality product."
4.0,It does what it needs to do. Not amazing. But it works
4.0,A very confortable and good quality dress. A little bit stylish in it shape and a pastel color that doesn't seem full
4.0,"9.5 and pretty snug. I usually wear a 9. Not true to size, but quick shipping."
4.0,Cheaply made but super fun & the kids love them
4.0,These fit as expected and are great quality sports bras.
4.0,"Luv this shirt! I’m a Disney super fan and just had to have this shirt! I am plus size and busty, it’s hard to find shirts that fit and aren’t tight at the bust. It fits my body shape perfectly. Good length. Did not shrink in the wash!"
4.0,"This is adorable! My only issue would be the sizing. I ordered a 2-3 years for my 3 year old. I'm very glad I didn't order 3-4. This should fit him for awhile, and thankfully the suspenders should hold the shorts up because they are a little too big. My son weighs just shy of 30 pounds and was close to 36 inches tall at his last check up if I remember correctly and this is a little big. It's still very cute, and the material seems decent."
4.0,Strapbroke on first day
4.0,I wanted to like this dress so badly but it just was not flattering on me. I did get the dress pictured.
4.0,They worked well and fit great until the screw on the right kept backing out. Did not hold up well with frequent use.
4.0,"Ordered, Tote Bag Khaki.  Love the color and size!  Can fit an IPad, in the side pocket.<br /><br />Positives:<br />CAPACITY:  So much room!  Lots of pockets, interior and exterior.<br />FORM:  Good form not slouchy.<br />FABRIC:<br />1)Outside fabric is sturdy/thick, like a backpack quality;<br />2)interior fabric, thick polyester fabric;<br />3)The handle and removable strap looks like durable due to its thickness.<br /><br />Negative:<br />1)the handle is a bit of nuisance, while using longer handle;<br />2)the zipper is okay.  Could be better.  The interior zipper, split once but I was able to zip it back to functional.<br /><br />The description, called it a backpack (tote);  Maybe because the outside fabric is similar to a backpack?  It’s more like a medium size messenger bag.<br /><br />I do like this bag.  I’ll be using it for traveling.  Great price!  4 1/2 stars"
4.0,"I like this shirt. The fit around the body is great. The neck hole IS too large, but it doesn't look bad on me. I thought this was a 3/4 sleeve shirt when I ordered it. The sleeves are not only long, but they're so long I can put my hands inside them. I'll have to wear this with the sleeves pulled up.<br /><br />Not awful. Just a bit of a weird fit."
4.0,"Bought these for my 6 year old.  I knew they would be a little bit too big, but kids grow so fast.  Bought the smallest women's size.  She loves them and likes to wear her flip flops with socks.  Material is as thick as normal socks, comfortable.  Nice product."
4.0,This product works exactly as advertised.<br />It revived an old pair of favorite leather shoes to look like new.<br />Arrived quickly and intact.<br />I will order again.
4.0,I did the tighter fit of the regular weight shirt and it’s a little too tight.
4.0,Description said 22/20 MM Assumed it tapered from 22 down to 20 at the clasp - it didn't.  Assumed the perforations went all the way through the band - they didn't.  Just a junior-scale watch band thus the low rating.  Still going to use the band until something more appropriate comes along.
4.0,Nice t-shirt material but it does not fit loosely around the hips as the picture indicates. It's more of a column dress with pockets. I opted to return this for a looser fitting sundress.
4.0,"Great shoes for doing cardio classes and everyday comfort. They fit a little small, so order one size larger than normal."
4.0,Runs small but that was expected for the material. However this is the perfect skirt for sexy night time parties.
4.0,"Pretty good. Not nearly as bad as some other reviews would suggest. My phone fits fine in the pocket. My main complaints are that they are a little tight, (the blue is tighter than the others), they are not as high waisted as I would like, and the band is meh. BUT I got 3 for 16.99. I feel like they are worth that. Don't know that I would pay much more than that though."
4.0,"Very cute top. Material is pretty thin and it is a snug fit, but wearing a tank top under helps with comfort."
4.0,"Very soft material, love the colors."
4.0,"These are plastic, not wood!!"
4.0,"Very nice dress, material not to thin and neckline not too deep. Good LBD. Small a little loose in waist (I'm 5'5&#34;/120) but couldn't tell on and was REALLY comfortable."
4.0,"Not sure what I was expecting. The straps near the armpits are wonky. It's basically a bandeau thing with decorative front. Back is a loop hook.<br />I'm 5', 108 lb and am a 34B."
4.0,It was way to little and you guys need tell people that it runs a couple of sizes smaller
4.0,"I like how these laces look. They really make my shoes look unique. As for the quality, it's fine but I'm not sure how it compares to others."
4.0,"The necklace was the perfect length and is very colorful.  I normally wear sterling silver, but bought this on a whim.  I thought it looked just like the picture and is very comfortable to wear."
4.0,This was a big surprise! This said is an incredible value!! I was thinking it would turn black or discolored and it has not. Excellent gift idea for an excellent price
4.0,Nice dress. Material was thinner than I expected more like s thin cotton T-shirt material. I ended up returning because I thought it might wrinkle too much to wear to a wedding.
4.0,"I do like this band. It's comfortable, light weight and the material is very breathable. The only down side I have found is that the elastic does stretch out really fast, so my watch doesn't fit like it should and just moves around a lot. Other than that, I do like the product."
4.0,"I got this hat a week or 2 ago, but I just unpacked it and left it in my car.  The printing came out very nice and I was happy with it.  Today I wore it for the first time and it is the worst ball cap I have ever worn.  It has such an odd point at the top that it makes me look like I have a very odd shaped head when I wear it.  I have tried to manually reshape it, but no luck.  It's a shame because I really like the way the printing came out.  I gave a good rating, however, because the printing was perfect and the company took care of the issue for me."
4.0,"very cute, just a little too big on the smallest setting"
4.0,This bracelet is just beautiful. I use it only for special occasions and the magnetic locking system is much more secure than the other bracelets I bought. Highly recommended.
4.0,"Like it, its simple"
4.0,Love the watch! Worth every penny!
4.0,"Small but cute. Works well for backpacks, etc."
4.0,The overalls I received doesn't look like the ones above..Amazon has always been great with any returns or problems I have had ..but these overalls are comfy so I kept them anyway...
4.0,Very beautiful earrings!! Great customer service as well!!
4.0,Beautiful dress was planning to wear to church but unfortunately it’s a deep plunge neckline. I have DD/Ds so this would draw way too much unwanted  attention. I thought I could swoop it over but unfortunately couldn’t so I had to return. But the fit was perfect and I loved the dress just wished the neckline was a bit more modest for me.
4.0,"I realize each of these rings is going to be unique in its own way, as they are handmade, but the ring I received looks less polished than the one in the photo. I still love the ring and it fits well, but know that the look of it is a bit more rustic than pictured."
4.0,Love them except they are a little too short for me.  I have to take the hem out.
4.0,I really like the dress the top part could be a little bit bigger. I'm old school don't like nothing hugging my chest.
4.0,"my singular complaint is that the bust is not large enough.  for a xxxl I would expect them to make the bust larger to accommodate but over all I am very pleased it still fits, the color is epic hunters/neon orange and the side cut outs are cute.  I would happily recommend this swim suit for the price it is super fun."
4.0,The delivery time and everything was fine. I thought by the pictures that the spikes were longer. It will read more and be certain that I get what I want next time.
4.0,Nicely depicted.
4.0,The color was a terrible off white instead of that beige.
4.0,Love paws
4.0,"Shoulder straps a bit too long and too wide at midline,  pattern and material quality excellent"
4.0,He liked how long the battery life was and how it was noticeable that it was Bluetooth
4.0,"Great, cheap watch. The indicators on the face of the watch don't really work, but it is very nice looking and the tourbillion works wonderfully. I only ever have to wind it every other day or so. My only issue is the large button used to adjust the date. It is very easy to accidentally bump it when you bend your hand back, so my date is never accurate by the end of the day. I use my watch as my main means to check the date, so this watch loses a star for that. Overall, I get lots of compliments, and works fine for basic time telling."
4.0,"This bag is cute, but definitely on the smaller side. I can only fit a few things in this bag which is fine for me because I knew from the other comments this would be the case and all i really need are my wallet, phone, and keys. I got this in red and just love the color but it is just a tad lighter than the description photos. The design is adorable and I've received a handful of compliments for this bag. The material and clasps, however, are definitely problem points. The material is on the stiffer side so the strap, if not straightened by the weight of the actual purse and its contents, will have creases and bends from the packaging. The clasps are clunky little things that don't have any strength or weight to them. I'm just waiting for them to break like I've read in other people's comments.<br /><br />All in all, it does its basic functions as a purse and I LOVE the look and color but the quality does not match the normal pricing. I got this during a lightning deal so I am relatively content with this purchase."
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  Material is nice and breathable. Ends tend to ride up as your walking so they end up looking a little shirt but otherwise perfect for walking trails with protection from shrubs or bugs
4.0,I got the green clear. These glasses look so nice. They feel good on my face. The lenses looked good until I cleaned them. Tiny cracking along edges. I'm still going to wear them. The blue light serves its purpose and they are really cute. I wish the lenses were of better quality.
4.0,Super cute for a quick costume. A bit cheaply made but great nonetheless.
4.0,"fit very well,  washed a couple of times and is still like new."
4.0,"This is a great keychain. Switch the lyric to “We just might win.” Good quality, and shipped fast!"
4.0,My son loves it. He wears a size 2 and the size 3 I purchased fits snug.
4.0,cute good for a gift
4.0,"I messed up and ordered a size too tight. Even though, tried them and they are a very cool and you can feel the quality of materials. Order one size bigger because the stitching on the bicep area tends to be  a cinch too wide and even me not having the biggest biceps in the world, bothers a bit much."
4.0,It looks good but a little big.
4.0,"The only thing I don't like about this is that the main stone is round but is set in a square setting which is a little odd. Other than that, it fits great, is very sparkly and has a large presence on your finger."
4.0,Took this bad boy out ice fishing average temp 5degrees was terrific no jacket just the vest and a couple shirts no problem obviously pants kinda rides up when underneath bibs and the zipper is not hunter friendly otherwise REALLY WARM
4.0,"These are really great love 90 degrees<br />Just was bummed there was streaks of darker color on the legs I thought would come out with washing but didn’t , still wore them not extremely noticeable and they r so comfortable"
4.0,"Very cute and love the print. Is a bit large on my 2.5 yo daughter, but she is on the petite side at 25 lbs., by is tall and it's still pretty long. Will keep it because it's so freaking cute!"
4.0,"Came quick, fits a little awkward other than that its nice for the price."
4.0,"I'd give 5 stars but seams need to be waterproof for that. It is the best clear bag for use at NCAA games where backpacks are not allowed unless clear. It is heavy duty. Well built good room for your items pocket for tickets, keys ect. We got a rainstorm at a game this was under my seat . Other than that we're loving these I got 2."
4.0,"Just a little small. Seems cheaply made, but looks just like the photo in the advertisement."
4.0,"Really cute socks, a bit expensive but qood quality."
4.0,Well done and very cute. My daughter needed red shoes for a wedding she is in and wanted a little heels. These are super cute. They are a tiny bit larger than I expected probably because she has a narrow foot but they will be perfect. She's worn them a couple times already and been comfortable and the wedding isn't for another few weeks.
4.0,Really cute dress.  Fits perfect but little to short.  Sending it back I would not we as r it that short.
4.0,Wish band would be a little bigger
4.0,"Love the style, color, and fit. Screws kept coming loose even after tightening. Just ended up buying a kit and replacing the screws and they were back to new. Overall a great pair for the price!"
4.0,This has been perfect for travel- the only downfall to this is the zippers have already broke. I got this for a trip 2 weeks ago. I really do like this. Such a bummer.
4.0,"A bit more yellow than the orange pictured, but cute enough for the price."
4.0,Super cute but super short as well. I am 5'3 and even for me it wasn't able to be worn as a dress.
4.0,The tiniest ring is a bit too small and it doesn’t lay evenly with the other hoops. If they make the last one a fraction bigger it would look more even on the ear. Great for nose rings tho.
4.0,Its a good item but i didnt read that it was 100 ml....
4.0,Light weight but not see through. I ordered the yellow and love the color. True to size for me. Would definitely order again.
4.0,These fit well in the waste. But are a tad bit tight everywhere else. If you want some room to move I would suggest getting a size bigger and wearing a belt if needed
4.0,"Happy with the purchase, been looking for this item a long time."
4.0,"The bracelets are fine if you just want to wear them by themselves. However, I have some beads I wanted to thread onto them, and given the dimensions of the beads' inner openings and these bracelets' connecting parts, it looked liked they would work. I had bought these previously and one of them was the advertised size and the other was not. This time, neither was. So I lost my original bracelet and was not able to replace it with the same product, because the dimensions are not quite exactly as described. Again, for most buyers this won't be a problem."
4.0,I really like this cute dress and get lots of compliments when I wear it. The only thing I don't love is sometimes the ruffles shift and look inside out on the front. Wish the fabric was on both side of the ruffles.
4.0,"Me encantó, pero llego con un detalle! :("
4.0,Terrific case.exactly same as shown.
4.0,"These look like quality leather and I like the color...... Too bad the button was broken when I got them and they are too small.......<br />I wear 38"" Jeans and ordered 38"", waaaay too small ! I'm gonna return and buy 42"" HOPEFULLY they'll fit cause I really like them. Even if I have to repair a button"
4.0,"I’m 5’4”, 118 pounds and a small fits great! A little past the knees and a light fabric. Just don’t dry it because it starts to fade. Could have used a better quality of fabric."
4.0,Tight but nice
4.0,Hard to put on but does the job
4.0,Great. Wish the buckle was metal.
4.0,"Well, hard to beat the price!<br />These are plastic framed magnifying glasses. I have to have them now to work on crafts, or read stuff - you know, when you've reached the age where body parts just don't work like they used to!<br /><br />These came packaged very well. Each pair has its own black fabric case.<br />The frames are an assortment of colors. The lens area is pretty large. I probably wouldn't wear these out in public, but at home, family is used to me, so they don't mind. 😁<br /><br />On one pair, the lenses look like they have concentric circles on them, and it is a little annoying. The screws have already worked loose on a couple other pairs, but hey - I have three other pairs I can wear while I put the screws back in!<br /><br />Overall, not a stylish set, but I didn't buy them for style. I wanted inexpensive magnifiers so I could have a pair in every room. That's what I got!"
4.0,Loved the deep purple color. The lace trimming wears beautifully. Material not as soft as I hoped and would have liked more of overlap when tying the robe on. Definitely not for pregnant moms with bellies for that reason.
4.0,Our lil' guy likes wearing this shoes & looks great on him.... comfy he said!
4.0,Which it was a little thicker
4.0,"This dress is really cute. I'm 5'1&#34; and 136lbs with a smaller chest and round belly. I ordered a medium. I usually wear an 8. I thought it'd look boxie on me but it doesn't. It skims over my imperfections nicely. It is REALLY thin though. You can see my hand through the dress, in the picture. I'll have to add an extra liner or wear a slip with it."
4.0,"Chain is very short, but pendant is gorgeous."
4.0,ordered 48 pair of these for my daughter's outdoor wedding at Disney. They are made pretty well and the guests liked them.
4.0,Cute and comfortable! You can wear sneakers or heals depending on the occasion
4.0,I believe mine is a US size XL although I actually wear M/L. The tag says 3XL but it fits just right. I am a 5' 8&#34; 190lb guy with not much muscle or fat so there you go.
4.0,These look relatively small for the stated size; sure hope they fit when given as gift!? Are cute and sure my 4 year old will love these awesome green monsters.
4.0,Looks great. Quality is appropriate for price. It’s not fancy nor is it a $500 wool sweater but I kind of love it and wear it a lot. Probably should have bought two:)
4.0,Styling is great but size is narrow. I need a wider fit.
4.0,Christmas present for my 6 year old granddaughter.  Wanted a decorative birthstone earring and these were perfect for her little ears.  She loved them.  Not sure about any skin sensitivity since she has not worn them yet thus the reason for giving 4 stars.
4.0,"Adorable piece,  really like it but on the sides of the chest,  the arm holes cut in to far and expose a bit too much side chest."
4.0,"Ok but I should have bought a medium instead of large have a 31 inch waist,kinda over thought the product due to other reviews and product guide"
4.0,"Nice fabric and fit. However, got a different color than ordered. Not going to return for the hassle. But, would buy again."
4.0,I bought for picture day. the pants were smaller then I expected them to be but the shirt and vest fit great. pictures turned out great
4.0,These are pretty good shirts.
4.0,swim suit cover
4.0,I like the watches but one of them quit working shortly after I started wearing it.
4.0,great beach cover. is made long but I liked that
4.0,It fitted my girl.a lil tight bit it was Good overall
4.0,"When I sit in my recliner I sometimes have a problem seeing the letters when using three search feature. With these adjustable readers, I can now have enough magnification to help me se the letters. I do not use Glases ex pet for reading fine print."
4.0,"Super cute little top, runs a bit smaller than the provided measurements. I ordered a size Small in the yellow based on the measurements. My measurements are 33, 27, 36 and I’m 132 lbs. The Small was a bit tight in the bust (had that stretched button effect), in the underarms (dug in a bit), and in the elasticized waist.<br /><br />The waist, though stretchy, is only held together by tying the front tie. Because of the material the tie slips a bit which widens the area with the tie to expose skin awkwardly. I think this is just because it’s a tad too small.<br /><br />I’m going to exchange for a Medium.<br /><br />Overall I think the top is adorable, but I recommend sizing up. It’s cropped, but perfect with high waist jeans without showing midriff."
4.0,So beautiful!! It is extremely well made and just gorgeous.  I had taking pictures but I can not seem to get a good angle right now that shows its beauty.  I know it already has an extender but unfortunately is does not fit my ankle... I am SO SAD because I love it so.  That is not a problem with the jewelry or the craftsmanship it is because I have a wide ankle so I am hoping to find another extender because I love this anklet.  the only reason I give four stars is because of the tape on the box because it was for me it did not matter one bit but if it was for a gift well that's a different story because the tape tight around the box and it rips it and hard to open.  That is just being petty though otherwise I will find an extender and I will have this dangling from my ankle.  Silver Masters are awesome!  I have much of their products and I am a fan! I have received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.  Glad I did and I hope it helped.  Have a great day!
4.0,It is a cool jacket it lightweight
4.0,"Again, beautiful style, comfortable, good quality and good fit. Great product."
4.0,I just wish it didn't have a light weight feel to it. But it's simply gorgeous!!
4.0,"I got these glasses to help my three year old’s eyes while he watches tv or his tablet. I love the color because I was able to convince him that they are “Spider-Man” glasses. They fit just right and withstands playtime, which can be quite rough! I mean you never know when you need to fight crime!"
4.0,Very cute for a birthday party
4.0,"it's very cute, with silver dots that sparkle.. comfortable to wear. and big head friendly."
4.0,These shirts do run small so order a size up. I typically wear a 10/12.  I bought a 2x.  It wore well and was not clinging to me.
4.0,Liked it just wish the skirt was a bit shorter
4.0,Second piece great for highschooler polished at a high gloss or any age well recieved
4.0,"This dress fits perfectly, however it has a rip in the armpit area."
4.0,Cute.  Good for the price.  Received quickly.
4.0,"Like the helmet and graphics.  Only had modulars before in a large, so it is different to put on and adjust so the ears aren't crushed.  Glad I ordered an XL as I would not have been able to get a large on in this style. Much quieter than my Hawk!"
4.0,A bit tight and I am a medium size woman but I really like them.
4.0,"A beautiful pearl and setting. I marked it down because of the chain, which is a small diameter, and the clasp which is extremely difficult to operate. The ring to which the clasp attaches is tiny and very tricky for my wife to connect. Maybe she will get used to is over time, but a slightly larger diameter chain and improved clasp would merit 5 stars!"
4.0,"The color and quality of the dress was on point; what wasn't, was the turtleneck. It was oversized for the dress and hung weird. If you don't mind a drooping turtleneck, this sweater dress is super soft and very flattering."
4.0,Very comfortable and warm. My feet do not hurt as much after a long day on my feet.
4.0,"Love the soft material, it's soft and doesn't show wrinkles.<br />I've been looking for a long sleeve print dress & this is perfect for so many occasions."
4.0,These are beautiful and so soft & comfortable. I gave them to my daughter as they run small and were too tight for me but she says they are the best pants she owns and they are affordable for the quality.
4.0,Goodv
4.0,The socks are great for boots with cutouts and the rubberized edge on the inside back work for keeping the sock on the heel.
4.0,"One of the stones fell out within the first week, but still a great ring"
4.0,Only thing I dislike is that the picture shows it printed in black ink whereas they sent one in brown/tan ink. Looks just like pic otherwise.
4.0,"I’m 5’6 and 190 lbs.  I typically wear a 12-14 post baby, and this fit perfectly! I wore it to a morning Bar-Mitzvah and in the evening for dancing, and it was comfortable and beautiful. Quality material for a great price! Would definitely recommend this purchase."
4.0,"Ordered a size 13: Amazon recommended, sneaker normal size for me.  They do run large, especially without socks,  but are serviceable.  Soles grab carpeting nicely.  Upper material is soft and conforms well.  Lining is soft and keeps feet warm.  I do recommend one size smaller for a more snug fit,"
4.0,This is super comfortable and stretchy. It fits great and is more flattering than the short sleeve options.
4.0,Nice product but doesn’t work for my 3 year old
4.0,"Wrist opening a bit small, but once I got them on, they were great."
4.0,"loved the shirt.  It was a little snug, so it made a great gift!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:bede539f095798932f540bc40cb5e4f]] This polo is comfortable and fits as expected. My son is five and normally wears a 5T. The 5T fits him well, although I think it may have shrunk just a smidge after machine washing it on delicates and drying it on medium heat.<br /><br />The gray color is nice and neutral to match a variety of shorts or pants, and the logo is cute. The collar is comfortable but adds a touch a professionalism. The buttons can unbutton to make it easier to pull over the head.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a nice polo."
4.0,Fashionable and comfortable.  The hands are a little thin so it is hard to see what time it is but it is lightweight and looks nice.
4.0,"These are great. I agree with other posts though you should be careful with the zippers. Nicley water repellent, warm, and comfortable. I took them alpine skiing just to see how they did and they were great. The cuffs are too small for ski boots. Awesome for winter hiking."
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty.  The issue that I had was that they were much too large, and heavy, as a result.  If you're into large earrings, these would be great for you.  I had to return them.  I would opt to try them in a smaller size."
4.0,Love it. A little snug. Won’t fit if your wrists are bigger.
4.0,Runs large but was easy to take in. Definitely needs to be steamed / ironed. Get the bustle it really makes  the dress. This is a 3X I should have gotten a 2x. I’m 5’9 and it was very long.
4.0,Love this hat.  Although I don't have a daughter still great deal
4.0,"I ordered a large because I wear 36 waist pants. It was a guess.<br />When I took them out of the package, I thought I had ordered circus tents by mistake. They were huge! But then I washed them, dried them all the way, and they fit perfectly.<br />Now my only concern is that they'll shrink again next time I wash and dry them. My wife says, &#34;No.&#34; Hope she's right.<br />Otherwise, they're colorful and comfortable.<br />It's not hot here in MI yet, but these will be great in the humid summer days. By the way, if you have any intention of wearing these outside your house, just forget that right now."
4.0,A bit expensive but cute.  Seems to fit appropriately.
4.0,I just wanted some cheap fancy rings to wear to my baby shower and these did the trick. However they do not feel like 16guage. They are thinner than my retainer which worried me a bit so I won't wear them for long periods of time.
4.0,"The price is good, but the material is too thick .."
4.0,Very comfortable love the pockets
4.0,"This is a really nice shirt.  My husband looks incredible in it.  I have had to restitch the pocket once, but whatever...I would still buy it again."
4.0,Bought these for my daughter.  Didn't realize how thick they were. So they are a little heavy for her ears. But overall great quality. Better suited for teenagers or adults.
4.0,"The o-rings could be smaller, but they look great."
4.0,"I love this blouse and it’s very comfortable. I was expecting red as stated, but it’s more of a rust color."
4.0,Was an okay cover
4.0,Great organizer but the phone shaped pockets are a little too small for phones these days.
4.0,"When I took this t-shirt out of its bag, my initial reaction was that it seemed cheap, which made me surprised because I love esstive products and usually find them to be really great and high-quality.  I guess first impressions are not always correct because I tried it on anyway and actually found it to be flattering and fit well.  I did size up and the fit is similar to the model pictured, ever so slightly relaxed but fitted, so I would consider it to run small.  It is stretchy, so people who want a snug fit could get their true size.  I think the reason I was initially surprised was because I was expecting a thicker material - this t-shirt is soft and comfortable, but it is thin and somewhat sheer.  Luckily, in combination with the fit, it does not cling or show off any rolls.  I still think the stars DO look a little on the tacky side, but perhaps that is just a personal issue because screenprinting makes me think of cheap souvenir tshirts.  There were no problems with the stars themselves though, no blurring or peeling.<br /><br />While I personally do not love the print, this might be a comfy, fun option for people who do really love stars.  I will still wear this one, but would likely not order any more printed options.  However, since I did find this t-shirt to be lightweight, but substantial and flattering, I would consider ordering some plain ones if they are offered.<br /><br />esstive Women's Ultra Soft Fleece Basic Casual Lightweight Star Printed T-Shirts"
4.0,"First of all it is 15mm, an unusual size. It fit a Citizens pro diver for women. It was easy to install using the original spring bars, or whatever they are called. Owner of watch is happy."
4.0,"They fitted well, looked really good on me. I'm happy with them, but if you're 6 ft or over, you will have to keep hiking them up a bit."
4.0,The product came on time and is exactly what I was expecting.
4.0,I just love them....Thanks!!
4.0,"appears well made...not as smooth as one it's replacing (I lost it)...not quite as silent either, but that's no big deal...pleased with purchase, gonna but another"
4.0,Cute. Not as comfortable as I thought they would be.
4.0,"Soft and Thin<br /><br />I am 5.11"" tall 190 pounds and I bought my size ""Large"", it fits very well. I wear it, washed, and dry it in the dryer. It shrunk a very little bit may be an inch in length and half an inch in width. By all means it is an under shirt because it is thin and I don't recommend as a T-Shirt. It is soft, comfortable, and well made and designed. If you don't like the thin material, then I don't think those are suitable for you.<br /><br />Dear Reviewer:<br />I posted the above review few days ago, but you rejected it because it does not meet your guidelines. This is a very honest  review, do you want me to lie? I am really shocked and want to know precisely what is wrong with it."
4.0,"Love the color (was wanting more of a pastel pink but the jacket is exactly the same as the picture), but it isn't as roomy as i would like, and I bought a size up!"
4.0,Its a bit clunky but it does the job.<br />I painted mine black so its not so hideous in my yard..
4.0,"I like this strap very much.<br /><br />It was a bit thinner and also longer than I would have liked, but it seems well made and seems like it will last."
4.0,"Very pretty, bigger than I anticipated, but very nice."
4.0,very nice cap
4.0,Fit ok. I  would buy them again.
4.0,"Do the job, and look nice. Can't beat the price."
4.0,cute and snugly fits. great for dress up and Halloween for my 4 year old
4.0,The material wasn't what I expected but it is a very cute dress. Comfortable too! Can't wait to wear it out.
4.0,Its smaller than i thought. Holds mostly wallet and other small items
4.0,It was a decent costume for the price
4.0,"Pretty, but slides off my tiny wrists."
4.0,I was surprised when I first got it at the size that was my fault as I didn't read the dimensions correctly so I was disappointed when I saw it but once I started packing it I was very happy as I was able to get everything in it that I need to for my trip.
4.0,"Love having these to go to the farm & pick up my produce every week. Seem sturdy will be washing soon to see how they hold<br />Up. The varying sizes are great, I just need to remember to bring them with me when so go food shopping."
4.0,Very comfortable cleats and easier than I thought it would be to late up. They give great traction and give extra support for your ankles. Only bad thing is that after a year of use you can definitely tell they've been worn a lot.
4.0,"Very realistic! I did have the front of the eye come loose from the muscle part, but that was after it dropped off a table. Will buy again."
4.0,Esta bien para lo que cuesta
4.0,"Little larger then expected, good buy tho!"
4.0,I received it already
4.0,"Fits pretty well. Not too short or tight. The thumb holes do feel a bit off, but I just roll the sleeves. Would order again."
4.0,"Very nice, well made but smaller than I expected"
4.0,Fits good and very comfortable but VERY thin material
4.0,"It works really well. It takes a second to light depending on the wick size. It charges SUPER fast, like 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />Since the tip is small, the tip gets soot on it very quickly. I suggest wiping it every once and awhile. The tip will be stained black within a few uses."
4.0,"Hat runs a little small, and the stretch band is somewhat tight."
4.0,"I like these socks and they are comfortable throughout my workday.<br />My only criticism is that I have four pairs, and they all fit differently. One is completely unwearable because the length is so short that it defeats the purpose of compressing up to the knee. I would get more if I was sure that they would fit properly."
4.0,"Sturdy and we'll made. I wore it for 12 hour a day, average 4 days a week. After 18 months it's time to replace it. The nickel plate wore off but I'm buying another.  I wish they made a sterling silver version."
4.0,"I bought this dress for my engagement pictures. I am 5’4”, 155 lbs, a triple D in chest size, and a large fit perfectly. I bought it in the color white, and it was completely see-through. I bought a nude slip to wear underneath and then it was perfect!"
4.0,Ok very skinny hardly noticeable. Not really gold color
4.0,The items were Christmas gifts
4.0,"Very nice bra just wasn't for me the fit is tight & very uncomfortable, it is good quality. Instead of returning it I gave it to may daughter she into more sports & use to the fit she loved it. Delivery time was great, That is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star I do not think they a true to size..."
4.0,Everything it also in my car. Soft and all wow
4.0,So tiny.  Perfect for my second row.
4.0,It looks just like the photos. I only gave four stars due to it running slightly small and having a dark black tag on the back. It looked so weird that I removed the tag and sewed it up. It looks perfect now. Super nice quality. I want the large to be restocked so that I can size up for my next order. I'm a size 2 and got the medium.
4.0,5'8 184 lbs fits super snug but cute nonetheless.  Too tight around the calf area so i have to pull up when trying to step up or fast walk. But great for the price
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for! Comfortable, lightweight cap for work to keep my hair out of my face. I like the simple design.<br />Fits perfectly."
4.0,Very nice color and material. Just runs small
4.0,Thought it was a shirt. But it's more of an over shirt
4.0,"I love the dress. It is very easy to put on, it’s breezy. Tailoring is good. My only issue with this dress is the fitted torso area. It’s unnecessary so I took out the elastic threads from that area..hence 4 stars."
4.0,I like them so much it fit perfectly
4.0,"Handbag is NOT dark gray!  It is definitely the light brown color it appears in the listing photo and as other buyers have described.  I actually LOVE the light brown color it is!  It does have a slight odor, but not horrible.  It's super cute and appears of good quality!  It is several inches wider than I would like it to be, but it is exactly what the dimensions indicate in the listing.  The narrow opening and the straps do make it a challenge to get into (as some have described).  I do LOVE the overall color and look of this bag!"
4.0,"It's pretty, the fabric is uncomfortable and the cuffs are very tight, I'm a size 6."
4.0,Thought i was gonna get more than one pair but only one color other than that on time an safe
4.0,Super cute.  Very small. Very..
4.0,"I love these - they are super cute and comfortable. Beware if you are doing a lot of walking, however, because the strap at the front is a little tight and causes my foot to slip backwards a little.<br /><br />I want these in every color!"
4.0,The garment is comfortable and fits as expected.
4.0,"The back is cute, but the bra pads used and will need to be replaced."
4.0,Quality of stone was ok...Base was crafted/designed well...looked like white<br />gold...backs were abit of a problem...they wanted to go off center...nice &#34;go to&#34;<br />ear rings...wish I had got larger stones...
4.0,Purchased as uniform pants for my daughters.  Runs on the larger size and they are between a 7 and 8 currently so they were a little too big.  Otherwise nice quality and soft and comfy.
4.0,"Ran really small, looks like it is made well and arrived on time undamaged"
4.0,This is a comfortable pullover type partial zip sweater. The material is not especially thick so that it can be worn in cooler weather but may need an additional layer underneath in colder weather. The size fit is a bit large so putting a layer on underneath is no problem. The material initially is not especially soft but his improves with washings although I do not expect it will ever be as soft as synthetic fleece.
4.0,"They're good piercings but even though it says 14g on the top, they're 16g and say that in the description but I didnt read the description until after purchase because I realized they were the wrong size. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of improper labeling."
4.0,Seems authentic yet the XL fits like a Large. Been wearing LIG T's for years and XL is my size yet this one runs smaller. If you purchase buy the next size up.
4.0,I usually don’t write negative reviews. But these slippers didn’t last even 2 months.
4.0,Feels a little odd but looks great - definitely worth the money!
4.0,"These groovy John Lennon-looking sunglasses come gift-boxed and have a nice carry case with them. They're much nicer than what I expected and really knocked out the glare when I took them outside for a test run. They are very dark, but since they don't cover a large area you'll probably need to wear a groovy hat with them. Small, portable, stylish, and the right price."
4.0,Really nice bag. Larger then what I wanted.
4.0,Love these suit body shirts. I strongly recommend choosing a size bigger than you think you should get as they tend to be a little tight around the bust line but they look fantastic and you don’t have to worry about the coming untucked from your suit pants
4.0,"This was a cute romper but it didn't quiet have that much stretch to it, but all in all it was a beautiful birthday outfit."
4.0,Great transaction. Easy and Fast. The only problem is the holder is beaded and it pinches my neck so I'm not using it at this time. It is a great product if not for that.
4.0,This bracelet is excellent quality and very pretty. It runs small so be aware of that.
4.0,"Belt is good quality, stylish, and well made.  Sometimes belt gets stuck with the release button."
4.0,It is very cute and pretty. Real silver. The chains are delicate and thin but seem strong. The only thing is there should have been a little more space between the first tier and the second tier with the 2 chains. They get a little tangled sometimes. But over all it is cute.
4.0,"Nice purse, seems of a good quality. But I'm surprised to see the handle is neon-orange, lol... I thought it was more of subtle orange like the picture shown, but...nope..it's neon orange, hehehe. But it's still a cute bag for my niece, she will love this."
4.0,"Could use a little padding, sits a little close to the face/eyes. Also nose/mouth area needs vented.. lots of condensation. Was a hit for Halloween. Lots of folks was asking about them."
4.0,"one of the underwear arrived with the seam coming undone, but other two in package were fine. just got a bad one i guess."
4.0,Shipping was great. Bra gives great support
4.0,It is a lighter weighted watch and it's comfortable to wear. I have never snagged it on anything and it hasn't scratched me. I really like the metal mesh band. It is pretty sweet!
4.0,"Great bra, but was too small, I've lost weight, have not tried yet again. I'd order a bigger size.  4 star due to size issue."
4.0,"The bottom is huge, I wear them and they get dirty on the bottom,so now I have to limit them to inside wear! The rest fits tight just flare at bottom !"
4.0,Beautiful colors turquoise and gold coins!  Shakes and shimmies easily.  Very pretty and fun to wear.
4.0,This is good so far. Not too big but not too small either. Stones seem to be in there nice and tight so I don't think they'll be going anywhere. The only thing I don't like is that it comes undone pretty easily so if you even wipe your nose with enough friction or tug a but too hard adjusting it it opens.
4.0,Nice work at a  good price.
4.0,Very pretty...like picture. Nice sun blockage. Wish frames were larger for fuller faces but overall nice
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 105 lbs, 34c chest, 27 waist, 34 hip and small fit great. I'm typically a U.S. size 4.  I deducted 1 star due to its thin material. I cant say its see through, but it could be thicker. Nice material for hot weather! And the &#34;yellow color&#34; was not yellow, but goldish/brown. Just a super weird color, but I'm going to return it and get another color due to the overall fit, cuteness and quality! Exactly as pictured(even yellow) and described. Hope it helps :)"
4.0,I would order a size up. Otherwise my kiddo was thrilled with it.
4.0,"More casual than it looks like in the picture. It's comfortable and nice material not see through at all! Nice size pockets that aren't obvious. Nice adjustable straps. 5' 9"" 165 lbs I got this in large it fits perfectly."
4.0,Very flattering style.  Shows off waist.  Color is perfect!  Wish it had spandex. Starting to get baggy.
4.0,ordered the chain separate and now decide I need the bracelett
4.0,i bought this because it looks very close to a coach wallet the way the letters intersect. overall good amount of space but the only the thing that didn't like is it looks like a fabric outside but its genuine leather. but has a real plastic feel to it.
4.0,This was a birthday present for my friend.  She absolutely loved it.
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. Somewhat see through but I wear them around the house so it's alright.
4.0,"Cute, stretch Apple Watch band.  My only small complaint is that the slider, that keeps it at the length you want, moves too easily and gets bigger over time.  I’ve adjust it every few times that I wear it."
4.0,"They're not for extreme cold weather use but if you just need them while you're waiting for a bus or your carpool, for example, they're definitely worth the money.  I have no trouble controlling my iPhone with these on."
4.0,"The quality of the material is good, and they feel light and comfortable except on the thigh area they’re too tight. If you are a thick and curvy person then I would suggest to go up a size. I wear a large and ordered a large and they squeeze the thighs especially at the seam of the hem. I would have exchanged them for a bigger size but I just wore for the first time and my window of return had already expired."
4.0,I was happy with the socks
4.0,"I don't usually buy shoes online since I'm worried about the fit, but my son saw these shoes and decided he had to have them. The price was right so I ordered them. To my surprise the shoes fit well, and lasted a lot longer than I expected."
4.0,It’s cut very long
4.0,"I've been searching for (and ordering) bras that fit me (a thin, small-breasted, senior citizen) for ages.  After many. many tries,  these are just right.  I'd give the product an extra star if ""cute"" wasn't a factor.  I am 72 years old -- bows and contrasting strap colors detract rather than add to the product's appeal.  It would be grand if the manufacturer produced single-hued bras in white or beige."
4.0,"The fit was right on, comfortable too."
4.0,"The socks are comfortable, however they do show when I'm wearing flats, which totally defeats the purpose of why I bought them"
4.0,"I liked the dress, the only bad thing is that it is some what see through."
4.0,"This watch looks nice.  I was looking for something inexpensive that I could use when I feel like a nice watch is needed.  Usually I'm not much of a watch guy, and I really don't like large bulky watches.  This is good for me, it is light and looks good.  Since I don't wear it everyday, it seems like the quality is good enough that it will last me.  Im happy with it."
4.0,The size I ordered was Large/X-Large the hat could have been a little bigger but it was great thank you.
4.0,"These shoes are very cushiony and comfortable. They do become a little ""bottom-heavy"" because of all the extra cushion and that does make them harder to keep on and seem larger. They are nice looking shoes."
4.0,"It's super cute and quite stable sitting on my desk. 4 stars only because you have to be precise with the placing the stems of your glasses in the slots. If I place them too quickly, they fall off. When placed precisely they are held well."
4.0,"Comfortable and breathable but short, back piece has no support and folds down easily. This slipper doesn’t stay on the foot without using the added strap. This makes the slipper not actually be a slip-on as you need to fit the strap into place every time that you wear it."
4.0,Everything they said it was. Well worth the purchase.  Easily adjusts
4.0,"My daughter loves this necklace. For the price, it is very cute but don’t expect much in quality. I think it’s just meant to hold up for a short time period, not a lifetime."
4.0,"This swim suit is nice,  but honestly it should be called a by the water suite. There is honestly no way I would feel secure in playing around or swimming in this outfit as it offers very little support for my breast. Don't get me wrong,  I will be wearing it,  because I look fabulous in it.  I purchased an XL and I'm 5'6.5 195lbs if that helps.  I really love the look of the outfit it looks like the picture, but the top just doesn't offer the support."
4.0,"I’m 5’6’ 1/2, 150lbs, 36D, 28/39 & bought a medium. It fits but runs a little big, which gives it a flowy look if that’s what you’re looking for. The drawback is its very long and I have to hold it up to not step on it (even wearing heels), it will need hemming. it also stretches out throughout the day, like from the weight of it.<br /><br />It’s soooo pretty though and I get complimented on it everytime I wear it.<br /><br />I’d recommend it."
4.0,These are super cute and made my two nieces very happy. They LOVED the matching robe for their baby.
4.0,Nice quality shirt. Did not shrink when washed and dried. I liked it so much I bought another shirt from this company.
4.0,"I heard someone saying this may be a fake, but I'm not sure if it is or not.  It came with a ziptie,  a  rockshox sticker,  a pretty large manual.  And it came in proper protection in a box that says rockshox all over it.  As for the lockout,  it doesn't work well.  It does stiffen the suspenyion up even more,  but it still has some squish to it.  The rebound adjustment works well. Make it faster,<br />it returns faster.  And vice versa.  And the preload,  works just as well.  It has served me well since I do some jumps from time to time,  maybe 4 feet max.  Haven't bottomed out yet even at the softest preload.  It soaks up bumps well,  and mine even makes a neat &#34;pshh&#34; sound when compressed hard. No bother to me.  Fake or not,  it works.  Well.  I would buy this again for a cheap alternative to pricey air forks. Oh, and it doesn't feel cheap.  Sure,  it's still heavy.  But it isn't cheap."
4.0,"High quality and very beautiful product.<br />It’s a little big size to kids, but my 10 years old can wear it already."
4.0,Speedy arrival and they did what I needed them to. I couldn't ask for more. :)
4.0,Very pretty but quite large. I wanted something more for daily use. Better for formal evening engagements.
4.0,"The swim suit is bepautiful however it was too small in the chest , I'm a 34 ddd or 36 dd and the largest suit doesn't fit up top"
4.0,Love this little dress...  light and summery
4.0,"This dress is too small in the waist. I like the dress so I would like to exchange it for a larger size. I ordered an XL, can I get it in a 2XL? Thanks!"
4.0,These work well keeping masks off my daughters ears. We haven’t used them all day but look forward to doing so.
4.0,"it came as described, fit perfectly and the sleeves were nice and long!<br />only con to the hoodie, was that the picture of Jack and Rose isn't as pigmented as the picture, its not as white, pretty faded!<br />but the red script on the sleeves POPS very bright and true to the picture. over all I'm happy with the purchase!"
4.0,"I love the look of these. I wore them for a Special event and got a lot of compliments on them. They are beautiful. Not a high quality and it looks like they might fall apart soon, but I love the style."
4.0,These blue light readers are great for the price. The solid black pair seems to be flimsier than the other 2 pair. But I would definitely recommend them.
4.0,I rated this product 4 stars because of the comfy fit. I also can style this shirt and dress it up-absolutely one of my favorite shirts!
4.0,Great suit but sized too large
4.0,"Fits well, looks like the photo. The fabric is a little rough. It might soften after being washed."
4.0,"Simple, nicely detailed, inexpensive material, relatively strong magnetic catch. These are not high end pieces, but they're not bad for the price. Comes in handy for seeing tiny print without having to drag out my reading glasses. The magnifying piece wasn't glued in very well and arrive loose; nothing a quick drop of glue couldn't fix."
4.0,Beautiful! Perfect casual bracelet to wear with jeans or summer dresses.  Very comfortable to wear.  Difficult to piut on at first but once I got the hang of it I like that it is secure
4.0,"material gets oddly worn when anything touches it. so badges, etc. wear marks in certain areas which looks bad."
4.0,Little bit too big for me but good quality!!<br />Got lots of compliments at work haha :)
4.0,The item did it's JOB.  Will  order again
4.0,"I love the design, I will love that the material is cotton."
4.0,Cheap looking in person. Picture looked better.
4.0,"I really like this dress, it is nicely patterned, well made with comfortable materials, and the color stays on wash after wash, the only issue I had with this dress was sizing issues. I originally purchased the Large, which fitted very well besides a little tight in the chest area, I returned that one and sized up, when I first received the XL, it fitted only slightly larger than the Large did around my chest, but it was comfortable. however after a couple washes, it feels like the dress got bigger. I have tried to shrink it with high heat but that didn't work. Overall a very nice dress and I like it a lot!"
4.0,"Even though followed measuring guide, are a bit larger than expected.  Temp. has not hit 0 yet so not sure how warm they truly will be."
4.0,"Very nice indeed. This is a very solid and attractive band. Good weight and an attractive matte / brushed finish. Came with a small tool set of good quality with extra pins.<br /><br />Only reason for one star reduction: Band is way to small, and does not come with extra links. I only have medium-ish hands for a man and it is too tight for me. So at this price, I just ordered another one, took two links out of it and bingo! Fantastic looking new band. I really like it."
4.0,These are nice although my husband had to make the ear loops smaller so that the mask would stay on my face. But once they were more custom fit they were really nice to wear and they are 3D. I don’t really like when masks touch my mouth and these allow breathing without the mask sucking in. The designs are nice too.
4.0,Great replacement for factory band
4.0,"Love this dress, great quality I bought 7 or 8 of them but needed a smaller size. Not at all their fault as I lost 30 lbs. Just altered the dress and it looks amazing. I recommend this dress. 3 x too big I am now a 2x Normally i wear a 18-20 I am now a 16."
4.0,I used them for compression for my ankle that swells and bursitis on the inside of my knee.<br />My only complaint is they are hot in summer.
4.0,Super adorable ballerina outfit for my 2 year old. She loved it and wants to wear it constantly!
4.0,Love the charm but the chain was uncomfortable
4.0,"it runs large, but it's ok, because it for church. it's nice<br />I like the material, it feels nice, I just got it today<br />I tried it on. it's not tight fitting & I like it.<br />I wear a 1x, but 2x &1X runs small<br />so that's why I purchased the 3x"
4.0,"Super cute, they look nice, just what I ordered... a little cheap and easy to break but great for the price"
4.0,"Despite what the description states as ""Breathable"" I would say it depends on the person perception. To me this poly/cotton type material does not capture airflow well. Tends to generate more moisture/sweat about the mouth area. Unfortunatelyon these kind of items are not returnable even if you never open package [ordered two. tried on one].  Airflow/design would be my reason for 4star review. The slide adjusts work well. Would suggest to keep looking/research further, and only choose if there's no other options/alternatives."
4.0,"One star off for being a little brittle, but otherwise happy with these."
4.0,This arrived in a little plastic bag. It is as it looks in the photo and very dainty. A Bohemian look and one that will look good on average sized arms. It has plenty of room for adjusting the circumference of your arms!
4.0,I purchased this watch for my 20 year old son. The watchband broke on his other watch. This watch was priced low and cost the same as a new watchband.  He really likes it except for the light.  You must keep pressing the button for the light to work.  His other Casio stayed on a few seconds after pressing the light. Other than the light this watch works great and he is glad to have it.
4.0,"My husband is 6’-4”, and they are very short for him. Otherwise, the material is very comfortable."
4.0,"Nice fit and has cups that separate each breast, but then there is the material that goes across the front. Creates a ""uni-boob"" effect when the cups are already separated underneath. Also doesn't stay lifting, kind of sags down slightly. I found myself pulling it up a little, but not sure if that's because the size was too big, or there aren't enough rubber strips along top, or if that's just the style. The bra is good for the most part and will do, but not completely happy with it."
4.0,"Too big and they would not let me return for an exchange.  Had tags, box and everything the way I received them but said they could not allow returns on them.  Gave them to the Goodwill."
4.0,"Good sunglasses for the price. These are men's sunglasses but hey're a little small for my husband's face, although they fit me just fine. They're lightweight but durable so I'd recommend them."
4.0,"Jersey runs big, definitely order a size smaller than usual. Overall, good looking Jersey though."
4.0,The material was really comfortable.
4.0,"This crop top is really cute. I am 5'2"" and 125 lbs. Ordered S size. It fits well except the sleeves. The sleeves are too long for me. This is definitely not for a petite woman. Otherwise, this is really cute."
4.0,It's was a rubber lion that it made it cheap
4.0,"Whether it’s you or a professional, someone’s going to have to bend the spring bars. Impossible to get it installed otherwise. I just bent them with my hands and that made it super easy. Even with the bent bars, it feels secure and the clasp works just fine. But, if you own a more expensive watch, you should look into a better band. For my Casio, it looks great and serves its purpose just fine. The quality of the links could be slightly better - there is some play between the links that make them move a bit more than I'd like, and it has a very metallic smell to it (hoping that goes away) - but overall, for my inexpensive Casio, I am pleased with this product. Lighter weight than expected. Just wish I didn’t have to bend the spring bars."
4.0,"My son loves them. Works well, no issues so far"
4.0,"I knew from previous rash guard fittings that I would need to size up from my usual clothing size of XS to S and it fit perfect. It is very fitted all over, but I love the zip closure because it helps when putting on and taking off. I also didn't want a frumpy guard that made me look like a kid because I'm 25 yrs old, only 5', 103Ibs, 32B bust and 25&#34; waist so this added a bit of sexiness to the look when unzipped ;) I also loved the minimal logos.<br /><br />I wasn't able to wear it outside yet, but I did buy it last minute before I went to an indoor water park because I didn't want my bikini top to fly off.  Plus, it would double as a nice guard without a farmers tan when im boarding at the beach, heres to hoping the chlorine didn't completely ruin the Upf. However, I do like to rinse with fresh water before and after leaving any chlorinated water. Although it isnt a thermal guard, It was somewhat cold for me at a 84 degree indoor water park and this kept me nicely warm without being over heated. It also dried very nicely without weighing me down.<br /><br />I thought I read there was a boardshort loop, but didnt see any. It has a tendency to ride up just a little when wet, but it isn't terrible. Maybe I'll update to five stars after testing at the beach on a warm day, but so far I love it."
4.0,"I purchased these boots for my daughter for a Christmas gift.  She adores them.<br />They are a good fit, unfortunately they are not being made any longer or I'd buy another pair for back up.<br /><br />Super cute and she's received a lot of compliments on them."
4.0,"My kids haven't gone back yet, so this hasn't really been used.  Its nicely made, seems sturdy enough for a 3rd grader.  I do worry that the beads will grab at neck hairs if not worn over the collar.  I look forward to sending this with my kids when they go back to school"
4.0,Overall excellent!! Great for working out
4.0,"Soft, stretchy, flattering, opaque - I love for most workout classes but not really for anything where I'm moving around a lot, like running or jump rope. I find myself pulling them back up frequently in those cases. Could be my big a$$ :D In any case, I can never have enough leggings and I love the pattern."
4.0,I really love having simple basic dresses in my wardrobe.  The material is a bit on the thin side but certainly lightweight and cute.
4.0,Stylish. 💕💕
4.0,"Nice but when I took them out placed them back in, the clasp wasn't sturdy. Also, I wished they'd add the diamonds all around."
4.0,"The fit is good, looks super cute on. It’s a tad more polyestery than I usually like so it’s not as breathable as cotton. But it’s soft and comfortable and overall is a nice shirt. True to size."
4.0,they were smashed in pakaging
4.0,"Bought this dress for my baby shower and absolutely fell in love with it. Yes, I have purchased more in different patterns. The only one negative thing I have to say about it is that it fights a little tight in the shoulders (I do have broader shoulders so it may just be me). Other than that, the length was perfect (I am 5'6"" and got an XL for my prego belly). The pockets are absolutely amazing and a huge plus on a dress. I get many compliments every time I wear this dress. I loved it so much that I wore it for some of our maternity pictures! Must have dress!"
4.0,Good quality and good fit. Great choice for a two year old
4.0,"Super cute suit! Unfortunately the top was a bit too small for the tatas :( it’d be great if the company offered a way to buy the top and bottoms separately, not everyone is the same size in both areas. I needed a large top and a medium bottom ☹️"
4.0,Good socks great gift
4.0,Very good quality but a little big
4.0,"Gorgeous shoes. I purcgased these for my daughter to wear at her b-day party. She loved them. They do run a little small for the size though. Other than that, they're great!"
4.0,Heart larger than expected.  Perfect
4.0,"Be careful with this particular line.  I ordered three, same style different stones, for three different people.  The sizing is off.  On all of us, the 6 was too small, the 7 too big.  Then the 7 was too small for the middle finger. The ribgs are lovely, just keep in mind they're a half suze off and you'll be fine."
4.0,The hat is cute but it’s too big for my head. I’m gonna have to figure out a way I can make it tighter so it won’t blow away when I wear it.
4.0,Had to order a size larger.
4.0,"Under the impression that two bracelets came with the couples bands, one one bracelet included. The wording was confusing. Otherwise quality was good and picture was clear."
4.0,"What a lovely colored and soft shirt! This shirt is very generously cut with a front pocket design, side splits for extra give and easy comfort and the only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the little cuts where it looks like the hem came up at the neck and arm, are a little bit 'I wore this shirt too long and it's ragged' which kind of drives me a little crazy. The color of the shirt is true to the picture, and is very bright and very chic looking, washes well, fits generously without shrinking, and can be dressed up or down with ease. A super soft comfy shirt for working out, or sleeping, or any occasion, minus the really odd seam that kind of juts out at the neck and arm, which I get is the style, but it makes it look a little trashy. I do absolutely love the fit and feel of the shirt, I just think the split hem is really unnecessary to make this shirt stylish."
4.0,"I wear a size 7 shoe and these are just a touch too big. Definitely wearable, but sometimes when I put my shoes on I notice the heel slides up towards my ankle. If they had a smaller size I'd order that, but I'd probably buy these again. Quality seems good and the designs are cute"
4.0,Love these shorts! Unfortunately they run big on me. Size smaller will be too short. I’ve tried medium and small (and I’m not a tiny person!). I wear a lot of clothes from Gaiam but these just don’t work personally.
4.0,Perfect for a 12 hour shift. Made my feet forget I was wearing shoes! I wish however they were a tad shorter I'm 5&#34;1' and they came up over my knee just high enough they rolled themselves down.
4.0,"Works as it’s supposed to, easily cleans and polished tarnished silver , good for gold jewelry as well, just wish it was a bit bigger"
4.0,"Only problem is they aren’t short people friendly. I’m 5’2” and they bunch up a little bit at the bottom. Not bad, but I prefer when joggers sit right above the ankle. But they are perfect for lounging around the house because they are super cozy and butter soft!"
4.0,It seems that Weide and Shark are either the same company or they are mocking each other. However i would lean on buying watches by Shark as they seem to be placed in a professional box with authenticity cards and the watch itself seems built well. I own a few Weide watches and they often came in bubble wrap in an envelop with instructions taped on and Weide bands easily would break and buttons would pop off. I can easily fix a band but not the button popping off.
4.0,Buy a size up.  It runs small.
4.0,"I bought this for a costume project and had planned to use a hoop skirt underneath it. The inner slip does not have enough room to fit a hoop skirt underneath. The product images imply that this skirt is fabric with maybe a layer or two of tulle, while in actuality the majority of the volume and silhouette of the skirt is tulle. I'm returning it for this reason."
4.0,Just a little shorter than I expected but super cute.
4.0,I wish it had actual handles to tie with instead a shear square.
4.0,"I like the crossbody style, the ease of use of different slots/organization. It's perfect for use on short errands."
4.0,"The material isn't thin and see through which is great! The material just flows nicely when worn. Love this dress...true to size, so if you want a bit more room to move in, order one size up... this is now a favorite of mine!"
4.0,Great hat and have already used it several times
4.0,Mom Loved this for Christmas!
4.0,Somewhat small but not too bad! I wear a 42dd it would have been more comfortable had I ordered a size up or a spacer!
4.0,"This case is otherwise great, but the lid does not stay open while putting the hats inside. Seems that the straps are bit too short."
4.0,A little expensive but great product
4.0,"I have three pairs and only have one issue - the charcoal heather pair has threads that are coming out in the seams, which is a bummer because they're my favorite pair. I've tried to fix them and now they don't look as problematic, but am considering returning that particular pair. But for the product in general? Love. I'm 5'5&#34;, 150lbs, and Mediums are great. I could probably even get by with a Small (in fact, if you have a smaller-than-average waist but with my general height/weight, I might actually suggest a Small.)"
4.0,"Nice, well made."
4.0,"they look cool ,,,<br />can't imagine them fitting a small child as they are even large on myself as an adult !"
4.0,Nice sticky socks but the ribbon on one pair gave away after just a few wears
4.0,"They are very light, more like a costume than for heavy holiday baking. My youngster was delighted to wear this while helping make holiday bakery."
4.0,"I got the smallest size (im 5'3 size 0/2) but I still felt they could have been tighter around my stomach and butt. They were super cute- I got the powder blue color. Super soft. A little thinner than Lulus. Not great for sweaty cardio, as they aren't super moisture wicking, but they are great for pilates/lifting/yoga/just chilling. All in all, worth the price and will get in black. Compared to the Lulu price, I will get a couple more of these, but always have a Lulu pair on hand ;)"
4.0,There is nothing wrong with this item other than being too large for my daughter.  We ordered a medium but had to return it for a  size small.
4.0,Tinkerbell is much bigger than I expected
4.0,"Love the dress. It's good quality material & stitching is clean and precise. I gave this dress a 4 because they did not have a medium so I purchased a large. However, I'm a seamstress so I can make it fit to my body # little boobies committee # hippie big booty"
4.0,"Excellent value and now I keep an extra set in each vehicle. I use them for cycling and water sports as well and have absolutely no complaints. I also own a polarized pair from the same company and have to admit I like them better for both the color of lens and reduced glare, but they also cost more. For general purpose safety sunglasses, these are a great deal."
4.0,.Gave this to my wife as an early Christmas gift. We both love it
4.0,"The item is not a 30x lens.  It is a 10x lens.  That said, 2 loupes for $5 is a good deal.  Just know that you are getting 10x lenses."
4.0,"It's great for Florida winter, until it gets lost by the 11 year old when he puts it wherever"
4.0,"I will probably outfit my wallet with protectors since all credit cards and debit cards have those microchips. Still, I get a lot of use out of this wallet since it also holds my checkbook as well as my cards and ID. It's worth buying for its versatility."
4.0,"It worked for me as the other copper I have  but it does turn your finger green very bad in just a few hours, but that's a small price to pay for relief."
4.0,None of the buttons can actually button. Strong chemical smell when received.
4.0,Just as beautiful as the pics! I’m so excited it’s perfect for my dress and decor! And Absolutely worth the price for the couple of hours I’m going to wear it. Love it ! 12/15/18❤️💍
4.0,I like this bra. Its thick and fits as expected. It has a lot of support and I think the design is pretty flattering and cute. I only took away one star because the elastic band gets twisted inside the bra every time it gets washed. It always takes me a few minutes to straighten it back out before I can wear it.
4.0,The circumference is good for children’s small wrists. It’s a little bit on a small size - it snuggles my wrist but it will work for holding my classroom keys. I bought 20 pcs for cheap so I can give some to other teachers in my school. They have different pretty colors too. It could have been a 5 stars if they are big enough for adult wrist.
4.0,"Good tunic, especially for the price."
4.0,"Nice ring, bold statement but the 7 is too big and slides around all day! I like my rings stable. You may want to size down. I also hope is doesn’t fade and it’s real stainless steel."
4.0,I got this bag as a gift and the person loves it. Good quality!
4.0,"Its a little tighter than expected. I would definitely probably go up a size. I generally light my shirts fitted, but this was a bit on the slim side."
4.0,Nice look by it's appearance.The quality is pretty good. I would recommend it to anyone  to buy.
4.0,"This is a nice and shiny chain, exactly as it was described. I like it. I gave a four star to this product only because when I received it, it was out of the box and all tangled! Had to spend almost 20 minutes to untangle the chain."
4.0,Comfortable and well-fitting. These were a great value for the money.
4.0,no instructions
4.0,I wanted the lotus ones but they sent me the pack with everything else. Although they look pretty they were not what I needed
4.0,"I bought the jumpsuit for my granddaughter she is between a med/large I went with the size large, she loved the way it fit. the fabric is  a heavy enough knit so you wont be able to see through.  My grand daughter is 5'7' and the length was good, she wore a stack heel with.  You would need to wear a lower cut bra. Overall I would say this was worth buying I was very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Look good. Bigger lens then I thought. Not what I'm used too. Kinda too big for my face but i like them, just need to get use to them. Look exactly like the picture just a little bigger."
4.0,Generic rebranding of a pocket watch. The emblem looks fine and doesn’t looked glued on (even though it is). It’s a nice gift for someone who likes the game and you don’t know what to get them.
4.0,This dress is beautiful but I bought a large for my daughter who usually wears medium and the bust was tight
4.0,"This is a really pretty and dainty pendant necklace. It came packaged very well. I wore it the first day I got it, and got several compliments on it. What I really like is I can wear it with jeans and a shirt, or I could wear it with a dress for a little something special. I think it would be nice even paired with several of these necklaces, stacked up. I love that look. The stones and nice and shiny, and the necklace is well made and this looks like the real deal. This would be a wondeful gift.<br /><br />For my honest opinion if this necklace, I was given a discount on the price. Knowing what good quality this brand now is, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more at the regular price."
4.0,Really like these.  Only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was that the lens could have been made a little bigger.
4.0,Its a little sheer. Had to wear no underwear...
4.0,Band doesn't look this dark. More gun metal
4.0,"Nice,perfect gift!!"
4.0,I bought it for a party. Followed the size chart but was too big. Amazon shopping is the best! Contacted them and it was quickly replaced with a smaller size.
4.0,"It's great.  It's a thin material, feels comfortable.. the only thing that was sort of upsetting was the arm hole isn't as far down like the picture is."
4.0,I actually really like this suit. The bra pads were a little weird like they didn’t quite fit for the top but over all it gave me what I wanted.
4.0,"There’s no complaints here, I have not my bike with them yet but I can tell by the way they fit that I’ll love them after the first ride."
4.0,"The jacket is cute, but the fabric does not stretch  and it's a bit itchy."
4.0,"Got this for Christmas, I really wanted to have a slouchy beanie for when I didn't feel like fixing my hair up. This fits the bill, and I've worn it twice so far, and it's very comfortable. it does feel a bit loose, so I may need to wash it and have it shrink a bit to fit better, however, it can be secured with hair pins, so I'm not too worried."
4.0,"Only have had it for a few hours so far. That being said, I also have zero experience with wigs; so take this with a grain of salt. I like it. Didn't tie my hair up for it, just put it over the top of my hair so the blonde showing thru in the back looks cool. I was surprised that it didn't tangle super easy, but I was also careful with it. It's what you pay for & I'm satisfied....unless I like the other one I ordered better... ;-) it's super fun to wear! I love being an adult child!"
4.0,"They did the trick. Still a bit too large for my 8 year old, but inexpensive so I don't feel like it was a loss."
4.0,I bought a pair for each of my children for the monster truck show.  3 and 6 yrs. My eldest actually fell asleep during the show so they obviously work well. However they’re a little tricky to get on. She couldn’t do it by herself so that’s a bummer. But other than that they seem well made and worked for us. My 3 year old has SPD and is sensitive to loud noises so I am looking forward to using these in the years to come for all different occasions.
4.0,Beautiful scarf! Perfect fall/winter accessory
4.0,"I was so excited to get this shirt! It came and I opened it and it had a very overwhelming smell of onions, like it stunk. Other then the smell it felt super soft and the design looked great. But just beware... the smell was horrible."
4.0,I love this bracelet it's beautiful and won't fade for along time. But it's my replacement and they break easily.
4.0,"I've been buying wrist bands on Amazon for long time, and this one is lasting the longest so far (2 months so far). It does wear off, but in a vintage way I'd say. It's comfortable though. I wear this all the time, since I like to wear very simply. :D"
4.0,I was very pleased when I got these. They were nicer than expected and very comfortable. They do run a bit large but still fit me okay.
4.0,"The pendant was a perfect gift for my daughter.  I like the quality and the silver trim.  I would rather not have had the chain included, it was much smaller than it appeared in the picture.  It is too delicate for the pendant and doesn't look strong and sturdy."
4.0,I really liked the idea of the design of this purse. It just needed to be a little bit roomier for me. I could use the touch screen of my phone through the plastic screen. It was just too tight a fit for me. I was disappointed it wouldn’t work for me.
4.0,Perfect for pregnancy!
4.0,Beautiful sweater that says brown... but the color is orange!  Kept it cause it's pretty!
4.0,Love this stylish set. Shorts are a good length. Without being too short or too long. Super soft. Love the tie dye color.
4.0,Love it but it does come a little bit big i ordered a M but very comfortable
4.0,fits great I like this better than the rubber one it comes with
4.0,"it was to small, but i manage to stretch it...it makes your stomach area heated, which is good for loosing inches..<br />It is a good product."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty and it fits perfectly. I was concerned at first because it was a one size product and those can sometimes be less than great. But it did fit surprisingly well and I believe this would work for all kinds of body shapes. I have some belly fat that I have been fighting even after losing weight and this dress masks this very well. It flows beautifully.<br />The reason I am not giving this a five star rating is that there is an obvious and not easy to miss design problem. The top black layer, right where the straps are attached to wrap around your neck is not even. Most other color layers remain their size and shape around the dress but the top layer is very uneven, shorter on the left side and larger on the right side. I saw this in the picture but thought it may be a problem with the sample dress but it's unfortunately rather obvious in the dress I received and my friend immediately noticed it too. I mean, all in all its not a huge deal but you know how we girls can be sometimes... We see something that doesn't look right and it becomes even more obvious the more we see it.<br />Other than that however this dress is beautiful, light, cool and fits all kinds of shapes and sizes. I will be wearing this at the beach, but also on other occasions as this is not see through.<br />I received this dress at a discounted price (not free) in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. And I am very thankful to the seller for that opportunity. A great new addition to Amazon."
4.0,Fits little larger than expected. Shoulder straps falls off frequently.
4.0,"I liked this top. I've been using it for about 2 years and it has stood up to washing and drying very well, although it has faded ever so slightly."
4.0,"Very pretty pink color, the material lays well and is very flattering. Perfect sizing chart to fit my frame."
4.0,"Beautiful color, comfortable dress!"
4.0,"It looks like good quality workmanship. The company explicitly says not to try to adjust the cuff width, so I didn't, just in case. The cuff doesn't fit my ear very well, so it's either too tight or falls off, sometimes both. However, if you can get the cuff to work right, it looks great on either ear, and the chain is a good length."
4.0,Hat seems to run small - good thing it was for a small person.
4.0,"Nicely made, but though described as being for tall/large, they were a bit tight."
4.0,FIts beautifully and shipped without wrinkles.
4.0,"My great niece loved this, nice selection of items all in a carrying case. Very cheaply made though. One of the magic wands broke right away. Other than that is a great item."
4.0,Not my favorite nightgown
4.0,"This jacket looks wonderful, feels wonderful and fits my son perfectly. Startlingly, however, as at least a couple other reviewers have mentioned, it REEKS of fish. I'm not sure if it's a coating or flame retardent or what, but I'm hoping the many dryer sheets I stuffed in it are enough to remove the smell.<br /><br />And, to be clear, we're not talking, &#34;lol I detect a faint whiff of the ocean,&#34; here: I'm talking, &#34;what unspeakable sins did Dory and Nemo commit within this jacket's soul?&#34;"
4.0,i am huge fan of final fantasy  so when i saw this i had to have it. I have been looking for a final fantasy face mask for awhile and finally found this which didn't charge me more for shipping than the actual cost of the item.
4.0,"Great jersey for the price. My only concern is the longevity of the zipper. They have saved a few cents by using a zipper other than the YKK brand (if you don't know YKK, look at your zippers, chances are very good that they have 'YKK' on them). But I have not had it long enough to comment - so far, so good."
4.0,"I really like the looks, and I've made them work by always wearing thick socks with them. Good looking and comfortable, just wish they were a bit shorter length (don't mind the width)."
4.0,My son loved his shirts!
4.0,"I hope they hold up, they look a bit cheap"
4.0,"really pretty, the lace is very nice. I like it quite a bit, not fitted at all through the middle. That is fine, I may use a sash."
4.0,"Like the title says, good colors/pattern but the top layer is a bit rough due to the final stitching along the outsides of the entire strap. It is not really bothersome but is noticeable enough when picking up your guitar to put it on."
4.0,"First of all, I ordered the army green color & it’s absolutely not anywhere close to green. Definitely a dark chocolate brown. It is buttery soft though so that’s a plus but I’m curious to see if the material is going to shed & leave fuzz everywhere. All in all, a cozy robe though."
4.0,It’s very nice plain dress.  No pockets or it would be perfect.  Casual office dress.
4.0,My granddaughters wedding this summer.  It fits perfectly. Thanks!
4.0,"Looks good and fits perfectly.  However pins did not fit, had to reuse old pins."
4.0,"For reference, I’m 5’ 7”, 130 lbs, and a 34B. I ordered a small and it fits well! It’s very flattering, but simple. The length is right above the knee, so it isn’t too short to wear to work. Very glad I purchased this!"
4.0,"For the PRICE this is One Cool looking Ring!the surface is a glossy Black which you really can’t tell from their stock pics So I included a photo with this review.Ive deducted a star because of a section that should have been glossy Black was Not finished correctly,So perfection wasn’t had BUT for $9 it’s a fun ring that I always keep on,even to the gym.I wear a size 9 and the ring fits true to size 👍🏼."
4.0,"Seems to be good quality leather and workmanship.  The sizzing might be a little bit misconscrewed; and XL is supposed to be 39/42 however I'm 39-40 and I'll at best be able to get to the 2nd hole, so only one hole to spare.  Also to note, this is a bit wider than most belts, so some pant belt loops will be too tight for this belt."
4.0,I really like these boot I and get a lot of compliments on them! The only things they are alil loose around my ankle and feet which’s are small. Also they were scratches on the sole of the boot but not too noticeable. I do not regret my purchase one bit though!
4.0,This bracelet is very cute and it is very sturdy.
4.0,fits well and looks very good
4.0,bust area too big & straps not adjustable
4.0,"Purchased the green bag.  It holds all my necessary items in the many zippered compartments.  If you have a bit of a tummy, the length of the strap limits the cross-body ability of use."
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; (size 16) -- The purse comes to my lower stomach instead of at the hip, so the strap could be a little longer.  Other than that, its good quality leather, and although its small, everything still fits inside nicely (full size wallet, phone, keys, small makeup bag) -- It's great for running errands. Glad I bought it."
4.0,"Loved this dress, the arms where s little tight and the sequence scratched my under arm but other then that the dress was perfect for what I used it for!!!"
4.0,This is a nice looking sweater. It fits the oversized look that is in right now. The muted and earthy colors are pretty for fall. My only complaint about this sweater is that it is kinda itchy.
4.0,"Like most face masks, this one bunches up in my mouth.  But, hey. Vaccine is out, I'm vaccinated,  hopefully we won't need these for much longer (get vaccinated,  people!)."
4.0,Bottom half fit top half would not even come up for my arms to go in. Gave to my younger sister
4.0,"XS fits me really well. I am 156cm and 95 pounds. It’s comfortable and happy with the purchase. For outside wear, the material looks great. If for home use, wish it could more soft."
4.0,"Use this to stop from sweating up my headset.  It's  thinner than I thought  it would be,  but does it job  if not sweating heavily."
4.0,"I really love this. The bad news is I ordered the small and usually go medium. It's a bit higher neck than I thought but overall, really cute style!"
4.0,"This is a tad big, I might take it in on the shoulders, my torso is probably not as long as others, so it fits nice, just a tad big.  I love the color and look of this dress.  It is cute on.  It is very comfortable.  It looks nice on.  made well.  very stylish."
4.0,I think this is fairly stretchy. It just isn't made very long so it will go on but not go far down on the head. I actually had it on and it was fine so the size isn't a problem. The light is very bright and it fun that it has the blue and red flashing lights. The light comes out easily to recharge or for washing. My problem was with the the music part of it. The USB port is really hard to not only hook up but just to find it initially. I couldn't get it to function properly. This hat would actually be better just to light up. The information says it can be machine washed but I am not sure how the water wouldn't get into the unit as that part can't be removed. So it seems a bit pricey for what it is.
4.0,a beautiful piece. Only gave it a four because I didn't realize it is a clip on...
4.0,This is a nice bracelet for the money. Made very well. Quick delivery too.
4.0,"The size is the exact one I ordered, good quality"
4.0,These pants are super cute and the color looks more like a muted green-- a dark army green.  I liked the color but my kids nixed that. I also found the waist to taper in tightly. Not a huge issue but it does make a slight muffin top which isnt attractive. i wear a 2 and bough a small. i should have bought a medium
4.0,Love this earrings and enjoyed wearing them while working out. Too bad they broke after only a few wearings. :-(
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ea98b00df6b13009c14c91feb3e97dd2]] Nice dress for the price.  When I ordered, there were only a few color options and this Wine Red color one WASN'T the one that offered free shipping.  However, I wanted it to go with a vintage hat of mine so paid the extra shipping and had to wait for it to arrive from overseas.  Now there are a slew of colors available.  The first thing to note is that it is NOT burgundy as it appears.  It is a deep red with a bit of a pinkish hue to it.  However, the color is stated as &#34;Wine Red&#34; and not &#34;Burgundy&#34; so that is no fault of the vendor.  You take a chance when buying online so I had steeled myself for that disappointment.  I still like the dress, but had I known I would have had fun and purchased the bright red instead.<br /><br />At least one reviewer commented on the top button placement for us &#34;larger&#34; size women.  I can't argue with that.  There are options, though.  If you don't like the placement, you can take the top two buttons off.  You can also take them all off (I think it would still look cute).  Even better would be to take them all off and put on a black belt.  For me, I am leaving them all on for now and may or may not wear it with a belt.<br /><br />Good coverage for the cleavage area and most importantly to me, it covers my bra straps.  I like the little cap sleeves as well.  And the arm holes are roomy, but not loose or too low.  Nice neckline for wearing jewelry.<br /><br />The skirt is roomy enough for a petticoat.  My favorite petticoat for these is the [[ASIN:B01FTPQONC Tidetell Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt 26&#34; Length Petticoat Black L(FBA)]].<br /><br />For reference, my measurements are 45&#34;/39&#34;/47&#34; and I purchased the 4X.<br /><br />I know we aren't supposed to review the seller in the product reviews, but I would like to point out how nice ZP Fashion was to work with.  When I ordered mine, there was only one review and I had to pay for and wait for overseas shipping.  Shortly after, the dress became available for free Amazon shipping and from the States.  So while I took the chance early, others were picking, ordering, waiting, receiving and reviewing theirs while I was still waiting on mine.  I ordered November 27, 2016 and it didn't arrive until January 3, 2017.  And the tracking status hadn't updated after December 8th.  ZP Fashion answered all of my questioning e-mails with prompt and courteous service.  Any questions were answered directly and without a &#34;canned&#34; reply.  I would buy from them again (although probably not with the long wait time as it is maddening)."
4.0,Absolutely love it fits correctly and very comfortable only thing I would change is the material for the white is basically see thru..
4.0,"this leather handbag is hot i received so many complements, the color is a different grey, it blends with any grey you wear you can dress it up or down."
4.0,"This DG sunglasses are even cuter than shown online. The fit is perfect. I really like the zebra case and the microfiber bag that come with them. I have problems keeping scratches off my glasses and the case and bag solve that problem, if you keep them in it. I highly recommend this product."
4.0,"These mittens are beautiful, pretty color, good quality, arrived as stated in a timely matter.  Reason for a 4 star rating is the lining is a little bigger than the outer mitten so they bunch up somewhat.  I think they may stretch out.  They are very warm, I live in Iowa and it was -1 the other day and my fingers stayed warm, I wasn't outside very long!"
4.0,"These were smaller than I expected, so I gave them to a friend and they suit him perfectly. So I guess they don't really suit my face shape. Consider your face shape before buying these sunnies."
4.0,"Decent quality, but seems a bit small."
4.0,"These slipped onto my toes so easily. Putting on Yoga Toes are way more clumsy than these individual toelet socks (what else to call them?!). I love how they grip my laminate floors and how they give my toes room to breathe and the tops of my feet which seem to have a high arch, while my feet have barely no arch (but a tiny one - it's worse than flat feet, I assure you). Plus they grip the back of my ankles so perfectly, it's like I have shoes on but my feet aren't suffocating :)<br /><br />I also thought that the claims to provide arch support were spurious at best but I actually feel like my arches are given at least a little support. Granted, it can't be much but it's some. My feet are happy! I'm so happy that I splurged and bought the multipack from the get-go. This was a great purchase. I'm one happy camper. I'm totally buying more of these going forwards.<br /><br />I took one star off due to the very slight fraying factor that has been mentioned by other buyers. This truly is something that the seller could take into account of in manufacturing but chooses not to due to being a cheapskate. These sell for a high enough pricepoint that they could fix this defect so it cost them a star."
4.0,"This is a well made comfortable shirt.  The size fit perfectly, too.  The blue with white accents made the shirt look more appealing than just all one color.  It's wicking capability should come in handy during warmer weather.  Good product at a good price."
4.0,Runs a little large and it was pretty long on my 5ft 2in frame.  Very pretty and good quality
4.0,Liked it a lot-- only 4 stars though because the clip does not feel tight/snug on the bills.
4.0,I got this as a birthday present with my Amazon gift card.  The mustard color is really in and I could not find a purse in that color that was not hideous. I found this and thought it would be perfect. It arrived on time and was wrapped nicely inside a box. It held almost everything I needed that was flat. It did not seem to want to zip closed when I put a set of house keys in it. I did stuff every pocket to get all the things I needed in it and it stayed closed. It is a cute purse that is just a little too small. That is why I gave it 4 stars. But it was easy to carry across the body and looked great with my mustard suede boots! I am happy with this purchase.
4.0,"the 3X turns out to be the right fit for my 46"" 38DDD bust. the fabric is very stretchy both ways. has a microfiber feel, not slick and shiny.  thankfully, this dress doesn't barrel out at hips as much as it appears to in pics.  at 5'4"", I do have to hem it up about 6"" so that I can walk in it, way too long. and the pockets - a nuisance!  bulge way out and ball up inside, ruining the line of the dress.  luckily it is roomy enough that I can sew the sideseams in enough to cut those miserable pockets clear out.  bottom line, requires sewing skills to make this dress fit and flatter, unless you are 5'9 or taller and appreciate/need pockets."
4.0,I think it is cute and holds a good amount of stuff. The only downside is it was smaller than I expected and the side pockets don't fit any of my cleaning bottles in it.
4.0,Very comfortable and a good fit. I plan to order another pair.
4.0,Very pretty dress. A little too short for my liking.
4.0,"My daughter was looking for a simple wrap to use as she heads off to school. This little black number fit the bill just fine. The sizing is standard - meaning she's a medium and the medium fit her just fine. So true to size. The fabric drapes well and while on the thin side, is fine if you're just needing a light sweater or jacket. It hangs well and looks cute. She likes it and it should work well for her. The fabric is light and flowy, and appears to be well made. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I will periodically update these reviews as I have more experience with the product."
4.0,Really nice dress just runs a little small.
4.0,"Nice little earrings! They are a tad smaller than I expected, but I don't read the measurements before I ordered."
4.0,Granddaughter Christmas gift
4.0,"The dress itself, while cheap, is very cute and fits well. Material is very cheap. However, I ordered a long sleeve option and they just sent me the same exact dress but with no sleeves. It’s still cute but kinda annoying that they didn’t say anything about it.<br />UPDATE: after I posted this they offered me a refund or to be send the correct dress for free. I changed my rating to from three to four, cause again, it’s a good enough dress."
4.0,"The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because the bottoms are only lined in the front not in the back ??? Super thin but other then that it is a really cute suit and runs true to size , I bought it in a medium"
4.0,could use a little thicker sole
4.0,Perfect fit on me and  give you nice cleavage!
4.0,"Great product.  I brought to play golf in during the hot, bright summer days in the South.  Great clarity on the golf course."
4.0,It works well. It iss little bit of a pain to put it together so that the keys slide in but not horrje
4.0,"The chain is not as long as I had hoped.  But, it works.  Very pretty."
4.0,Good shirt. Very cute and material is not cheap looking. I order a medium but the sleeves seem a little tight. Not that big of a deal because the shirt is stretching material. All in all good buy!
4.0,"If you get the Red colored version; can follow the Red thread of fate mythology for your relationship<br />Very cute gesture with the magnets<br /><br />Magnets are good. As strong as fridge magnets. It won't hold on while one of you is falling off a cliff, but is noticeable when one person tugs away at it.<br /><br />Comes in a clinch bag. Material used for the bracelet is of high quality.<br /><br />Able to loosen/tighten to fit. No instructions on how to re-tie if everything comes loose"
4.0,"look great, quality is what you get for the price."
4.0,"Lasted a few months before the gem fell off, but worth the price!"
4.0,"These were unevenly cut, one slightly smaller than the other. Overall a little smaller than I expected / wanted although larger than the DDD's I ordered to replace them. They are very thin, not sure if they would've held up to swimwear....the purpose of my purchase."
4.0,Fit on the shoulder is good.  Pads are comfortable.
4.0,"My father is retired Navy and his last pair of patriotic suspenders finally bit the dust.  As with many WWII-era vets, he's lost quite a bit of weight over the years and a belt just won't do it.  His eyes lit up when he opened this Christmas present, making it all worth while.  Don't know how well they work yet, so could not give 5 stars, but the look on his face certainly earned 4 stars.  Thank you."
4.0,"The glasses are very nice looking. I got them for a cosplay (Dippy Fresh). I ordered them in white and received black, which was a bit of a disappointment but I am keeping my fingers crossed that the paint will still look good with a black base instead of a white one. If not I can use it for sunglasses for everyday use. They are very dark and I tested them outside for daily use and they block a lot of the sun from your eyes."
4.0,"I always buy black-faced watches with gold and platinum bands. I like that stunning combination. However, when I saw this brown watch, I had to try it. For the price how could I go wrong?<br /><br />I've had this Relic watch for almost two months. It does have its problems. It tends to run a little fast, but I don't mind resetting the hands a bit once a week. The coating on the band has actually rubbed off in places. I don't mind that either. I have already scratched the face of the crystal covering. But then I have always been hard on watches.<br /><br />There are two things I really like about the Relic. One, I love how it looks--the color, the band design, its feminine appearance. I also like that it came with three clasps. I removed one for sizing and would do better to remove one more, but kind of like the bracelet look.<br /><br />Despite the slight negatives which don't bother me, I really like this watch and would buy Relic again."
4.0,They were chunky shoes when I first saw them. It did not have no odor or bad smell. It's comfortable but it does have cheap material. It gets a pass for cheap shoes.
4.0,"Love this roomy, sturdy bag. The only not great thing are the many patches of plastic leather-look. They are not shown in the photo and not what I wanted on my bag. Otherwise it is perfect."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, but it does run a little small.  My only other complaint is that the lace and the string aren't the same shade of red.  I'm returning mine because it is too tight, but that's the only reason.  As mentioned in another review, you will need a petticoat if you want the skirt to be full."
4.0,"I tried this shirt on a whim, since I liked the retro flower motif, but once I put it on, I couldn't wait to take it off!  The outside material felt fine, but the inside was so scratchy feeling and uncomfortable.<br /><br />I ordered a size 4, which I assumed would fit, but it was a bit baggy, so I'm guessing it was the equivalent of a Small. (I normally wear Extra Small in all my shirts, which is probably a 2 in this shirt.)"
4.0,"This was the 2nd necklace I ordered from Bellrela!! Beautiful, stunning design! Quality is great!! Packaging was so pretty! Thanks Bellrela for great craftsmanship!! Will definitely be ordering again!!"
4.0,"Ran small compared to size chart, nicely constructed. Wish it would have worked."
4.0,Watch band was just like they described. Fits perfect and is comfortable
4.0,"I love this suit and have received many compliments on it.  It seems to be well made.  I have worn it to  about 5 Hydro-fit classes so far.  The color is much brighter and more appealing than in the picture. I am 5 ft. 3 inches tall and weigh about 115.  I vacillate between a small and a medium.  This particular suit was only available in small.  The top is a bit snug and I would prefer a medium but I am keeping it, as it is not so small as to be uncomfortable."
4.0,Like overall comfortable
4.0,"Very soft socks and the colors and nice, but they are kind of thin."
4.0,"I always liked the classical look in a watch and this satisfies that in me.  One thing to say up front for those contemplating one of their own. This is an ""automatic"" mechanical watch movement. It does not run on batteries, it has to be wound.  This winds two ways. One; movement of the arm winds it as you go about your business.  Two, you can wind it at the knob just like an old fashioned watch.<br /> I am retired and disabled so I don't always move around enough to rely on that alone to keep it wound.  What I do is start the day by winding it with the knob first thing then let movement keep it wound.  Only a few times has this wound down on me.  One good feature is over-wind protection. Used to be when winding a watch, you had to be careful not to ""over-wind"" them.  That is, if you wound it to hard against the stop, you could break the spring attachment.  I don't know how this works in here but it never gets to a 'stop.'  So, no worries on that count.<br />All the feature on the face are fully functional.  The date hand counts the number of the days and the day counter ticks on the Mon., Tues., Wed., &tc.  The moon phase also turns around through it's course and counts off a 24 day lunar month. Only... truth to tell, I haven't quite figured out how to set it.  The instructions are not all that clear and are pretty generic, not necessarily watch specific.  Probably just an am/pm indicator as some have mentioned.<br />Another good feature are the ""hidden"" setting buttons for days and date settings.  I had a watch with those raised buttons. They were forever getting bumped as I bent my wrist and I gave up on trying to get those features set.  No such problems with this.<br />There is one particular feature I have not seen before and really like!  There's a catch and release latch on the watch band!  Generally, a leather type watch band connects through use of a buckle, sometimes quite difficult to manage.  This one folds up and latches just like many metallic bands do!  A simple squeeze of the tabs on each side of the band lets it pop open.  It works well holding the band securely.  I have not had it open accidentally even once and yet it opens very easily by intent.  My pictures show this mechanism pretty well I think.  The band also looks good and is comfortable.<br />I am really quite pleased with this watch but only gave it 4 stars.  The 5 was not checked for a few minor things really. One; the watch itself is quite large, I would say a little over-sized.  I showed a photo of it on my wrist.  For reference, my wrist is too large for many metallic type bands. I have to wear an 'extra-large' size band.  Also, a down check for the instructions, the fault already described above.  The final gripe; the watch does not have a second hand. I really like and often use those.  So it's omission is a down check for me.<br />There you have it.  Sorry for the length but, I wanted to be thorough.  I have had this watch for some months now and it has proven reliable, it keeps good time and I am over all well pleased with it and would recommend it to anybody who thinks they would want one."
4.0,"Bought for my daughter to wear to a Labyrinth birthday party. She looked so cute, only wish the antlers were a tad bit longer & maybe brown or bone instead of white."
4.0,Super cute. A little small on my head but I have a larger head so that’s to be expected. Perfect for sunny days
4.0,"This jacket is not super warm just by itself, but just wearing a hoody or something underneath is enough because it is basically windproof. I should say it probably is about right at 30 degrees (F) or more, but I don't know because I have only used it when it was 20 or less. The pockets are nice and big and there's a lot of them. The zippers are super tough and water proof. The sleeves are big and meant to accommodate gloves. The whole thing feels very well made and I definitely recommend it."
4.0,"I wish I would have bought one size up for a looser fit.  I wear an XL in most clothing, and the XL fits fine.  I just wish it were bigger on me.  XXL probably would have given me the fit I was looking for.  Oh well, the XL will be fine under cardigans and as a base layer"
4.0,"I really like the design and color.  I have had problems with getting the zipper started and separated when I want to take it off.  Otherwise,  the vest is 5 stars!"
4.0,Gloves are a great quality and are as expected. The only reason that they aren't 5 Stars is due to the obnoxious band that goes around the wrist to tighten the gloves. The loop that the material is meant to go through is made of metal so it takes away a bit of mobility from the wrist and limits general movement.
4.0,"I am 5'5, 110 lbs and ordered a medium. The fit is great! The zipper is long so i dont struggle to put this suit on and off. The problem i have with this is i still got a light sunburn after only 30 minutes at the pool, so i will still be using sinscreen."
4.0,"So cute fits comfy, but what in the world is the Oder on the clothing. I have to pay for dry cleaning befor I can even wear it out."
4.0,"The dress is cute, but it is much longer than advertised. It was mid calf on me and I’m 5’3”."
4.0,"This dress is so adorable, from the cheerful flowery pattern to its flowing design. I particularly like how the top looks with its gathered flap, but I am not too crazy about the elastic around the waist and the bunched up material (there's no zipper). The material is see- through, but the skirt has a lining for privacy (I'm five fee tall and the lining goes down to the top of my knee) but I was surprised to see that there's no lining on the top half. The dress fits somewhat small, I normally take a size small and this dress fits me even though it's a size medium. The dress feels comfortable and it's nice to wear for going out to dinner or to a casual party."
4.0,"for the price, I wasn't expecting much but ended up being a decent shirt.  Unlike my UA or Tesla compression shirts, much more stretchy but again, I didn't expect UA quality for what I paid for this shirt."
4.0,"Got a size M, im 5'3 170 lbs. It fit very losse at the top although I am a 38C. It wasnt tight at all and did allow some room to stretch. Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I feel there was alot of extra fabric at the top making the top poofy. Otherwise then that, good fresh fabric, perfect length!"
4.0,"Pretty piece.  It was a fun accessory for our roaring 20's party.  Only complaint is that the bracelet part was a bit big, so it doesn't stay in place very well."
4.0,I had these from the store with different color leather and they fit just a little but bigger from the store which I liked better. Not a bad shoe though
4.0,"Great dress, well made and nice fabric.  Slightly larger than expected."
4.0,the glasses were a little crooked
4.0,Smaller than expected...other wise great...
4.0,I bought 2 of these necklaces. One for my sister and one for a friend. Very cute.
4.0,"La blusa en si es muy bonita, un poco fina la tela y suele quedar un poco mas grande de lo esperado."
4.0,"Arrived with the sleeve damaged (seam was broken) but I can fix it. It’s SUPER comfy, long and warm. I ordered an XL but I wear a L (Size 12). I was afraid it wouldn’t be long enough. I definitely could have gotten away with a L. It’s perfect for lounging. I’ve washed it on the hand wash cycle of my washing machine so it retains the softness for a while. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the seam damage."
4.0,Nice. They really look like picture
4.0,Get half a size bigger. They're comfortable once you get used to them but very snug.
4.0,"I purchased Tear drop earrings, they were smaller than what i thought they would be. They are simple but very classy and elegant, even though they dont have any diamond studs they are very shiny and bright. They were perfect for prom. Shipping was faster than expected."
4.0,"The bottoms fit perfect, but the top runs a bit small.  Soft and comfortable."
4.0,"I liked the dress, but it is was way to small in the bust.  I am returning it."
4.0,I bought this dress to wear at our post-wedding party reception (we did a small wedding and a bigger party a few months later) and it was very comfortable and flattering.
4.0,"For one, I love the look of chronographs and this delivers.  The black and rose gold are great together, the hands and dials are very well done and clean.  I like the weight of it as well. Overall the case is great, hard to say of the quality within but for pure aesthetics alone, it matches expensive watches. The crown and pushers work well and aren't hard to use.<br /><br />On to the meh. The band leather came dry and stiff, not very ergonomic (probably faux leather or the like). It also doesn't have a very good size for someone with skinny wrists like me, I have to push it up maybe 2 inches up my arm to be in a secure place.  The band straps to hold the excess aren't very good either, they're too loose and with the strap being short as is, the movable one is almost unnecessary without pulling it to the last hole.<br /><br />I set the watch a minute fast to test it over the last week. It since has lost about a minute of time moving to being nearly on point with my phone and computer so, that shows the precision of the inside workings. In the little pamphlet it comes with there's a segment talking about the time error being anywhere from -20 to +50 seconds which shows the quality of the watch as well. I have to say, this watch ticks really Loung, easily the loudest watch I have. During the day and walking around it’s no problem but if you are in a dead silent room, sleeping or whatever, you can hear this watch from a significant distance away. To mitigate this I place it either on the little pillow it comes with lol or lay it on something sound absorbing like a jacket. If loud watches bother you, you may want to avoid this.<br /><br />An lastly, the watch arrived with two nicks on it, shown it the pictures. One on the buckle and one on the band close to the lugs.<br /><br />Overall, for price I think it's a good watch, great for someone that would like the look and not be scared to wear it for fear of damaging something expensive."
4.0,"I purchased these to use as undercaps/scarfs. They work really well. They are lightweight, have good stretch and memory. The colors are beautiful just as pictured. One thing I don't care for is that the ends do curl up a bit after the first time worn. The seller DID mention this so I did expect this. I would definitely purchase from this seller again."
4.0,Okay I love this shirt and it fit well but it started pilling after the first wash! I listened to the other reviews and ordered one size down but it didn't fit like a dolman is supposed to. I ordered the size I normally wear and what a difference. It is suppose to feel loose so please buy your normal size. I have this shirt in coral and black and I would wear it to work if it didn't pill so badly. Now I wear it around the house.
4.0,Is a very pretty dress but not for woman like me with big breast. However I managed to wear something under and I love it
4.0,Go a half size down and they will be perfect.  The quality exceeds the price!
4.0,The shoulders occasionally fall down maybe I should have got a medium but I’m a large and they usually got well. This is a nice dressy top for work. And keeps you cool.
4.0,"Pretty. Not quite as shiny/glittery as the picture, but still pretty."
4.0,Only give it 4 stars because they are not comfortable to wear... Good quality but it's alsohard to get in a different color other than pink and purple. I notified them I ordered a blue and green set but the same was sent it was still pink and purple.
4.0,Very soft comfy slippers. The right one is a little to where it leans / s shaped different than the left but they add nice slipper.
4.0,I really do live this dress... I am. Very petite so I wish I could say it fit perfectly but it didnt. I am smaller in the buttox area so that was my &#34;smallest problem&#34; lol. I do love the material though.. its a little on the thinner side but it isn't see through and it really does look like a conservative dress from the front since it is a little above the knees. It really is cute and hugs your body for the most part. I'm probably going to alter my dress a little just so I can fit the bottom part since I'm loving it anyway.... me not having a big enough bum is the only reason I did t give that last star. I did order a small and it still was a little on the larger side. Irregardless I'm loving this flattering dress :)<br /><br />I received this item at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest review. All things stated above are my own opinions for this item.
4.0,"I really like these pants - the color is rich, the fabric is thin and comfortable, the cargo pockets are a nice feature - but they run a little small. I'm 5'7"" , 155 pounds, and the XL fits well. If you carry weight in your hips and thighs, like I do, consider sizing up. I'm not sure these are worth the $26 price tag. I've seen similar products at big box stores for half the price."
4.0,"Seem like pretty decent quality. Time will tell as the kids use them a little more. Went by the waist measurement chart, and both shorts were big on my two boys. Not a huge deal since that will allow them to grow into the shorts. One loves the feel and comfort that the pad gives. The other one doesn't like the way the padding feels.  I think he'll appreciate the padding on our longer rides."
4.0,"The bra fits me good, I got a size B. But the underwear was small on me :( it was kind of tight and it's not stretchy. I recorded a size C and maybe the underwear will fit better this time."
4.0,"The pattern is more basic than depicted in the photo and the material is pretty thin with some see-through spots the more it gets stretched, but the stitching is good. No worries about it not holding up. I did have to go up a size because my usual size was too tight. Overall for the price they're great and look nice on, just keep your expectations realistic."
4.0,If you don’t wear something underneath you need a slip because the sun might show through the bottom.
4.0,"I used these for tough mudder. They were great to have on some obstacles, but on some of the others they were more than a hindrance than the obstacle. They don't advertise for being used in Mudder, so I can't fault them that! Great gloves all around."
4.0,Not bad... get what u pay for. I personally dont need expensive body jewelry these days. Just something to fill the holes
4.0,Latch. Great buy for your money
4.0,Cut to low
4.0,"I really like this dress and have worn it a bunch. The fit is on the narrow side, however there is plenty of room in the bust (DD)  It is not see through and washes well. Material is soft."
4.0,"It was hard to find a skirt like this that is not super short.  My daughter is 5'5"" 115lbs with long legs and the size small fit perfectly.  It hit right below her knee. She was able to roll the waist band to get it to knee length, which was perfect for her.  We bought it to use as a costume piece, but she ended up wearing it several more times with a regular outfit."
4.0,Nice quality. This is a thinner material than most hoodies. The sizes are listed in EU sizes. I ordered a Large and received a US Medium/EU Large. Had to exchange for the size listed as XL which is actually a US Large. Size up on this one.
4.0,"Perfect for a temple dress, especially with 2 pockets. It will need a slip. It will also have to be hemmed, as I'm 5'2."
4.0,Only dislike I have is the scarf is thin and not very soft.
4.0,"my girlfriend love rose gold anything so i seen this and she wanted it.  got it in and it was boxed somewhat nicely..  set the time, gave it to her and she loved it.  she said it was beautiful but was too big.  well it had a link removal tool with it so we tried it out..  the tool broke almost immediately and we ended up using a large sewing needle to remove the pins.  once we got a link out she said it fit perfect.  now she won't take it off.  if the tool didn't break and it was packaged better i would have given the 5th star."
4.0,Fit well just the sleeve were s bit long but fits great
4.0,The cut around the top and arms has a lot of material. When I tighten the straps up it fits fine. Very happy other than the funny cut.
4.0,It's comfy and I like the color but it does not &#34;slouch&#34; like the picture-it's more fitted than I expected.
4.0,Tymidy Womens Summer Dress is a pretty dress that fit a bit small..the material is not stretchy so will recommend a size up.. the length is perfect. This dress has a subtle charm to it...the v neck is a bit deep but not inappropriate.
4.0,"These pajamas are very soft and stretchy, but run way big. I bought the 2T for my daughter when she was 2 and they were much too long and baggy. She is turning 3 in a couple of months and they now fit perfectly (see photo), and she is taller than average for her age. If you size down you will love the quality of these PJs."
4.0,"Really comfy, kind of thin but that's expected with the cheap price. Overall very happy with my purchase"
4.0,Love it but tshirt thin.
4.0,"The quality of this shirt is surprising for the cost! The fit is nice, the shirt is soft and stretchy, and the lace is not scratchy. The blue is also very vibrant. I can't comment on how this holds up in the wash but so far I'm happy. As far as The fit goes, I'm a size 10, 36D and I bought the large."
4.0,"Great product, although it is pictured with the colored lenses, it did not come with them only a pair of dark polarized.  The construction seems very good for the price and the frames do not restrict vision."
4.0,It is a bit too large. I typically wear L or XL. I purchased the large but a medium would have been a better fit for me. Super comfy!
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 150 lbs, 34ddd. Based on the size chart and reviews I ordered an XL. Even with 4&#34; platform wedges this dress was on the floor. Easily fixed (at 5'3&#34; I'm a pro at hems!), along with the size tag that was made to stick out of the top of the neckline. Slightly harder was the neckline. The &#34;v&#34; ended somewhere south of my bra. I purchased a slip dress to wear with this, and it is now my favorite go-to outfit for anything. Comfortable, flattering."
4.0,The gemstone is beautiful; I like it very much. I only wish the fabric cord could more easily be changed to a clasping chain. I can have a jewelry designer I know do that for me though.
4.0,"Really cute!! The metal is a little tough to bend but it’s supper cute, it’s good for a nose but not so much for a tragus I suggest using a 8mm hoop."
4.0,These look nice and are sturdy. I’d recommend wrapping some paper towel around the bar before using them so that they have a tighter grip. Otherwise they tend to come loose and fall off.
4.0,"True to size. Comfortable mid rise fit. These are more like a stretch denim, not chino material. They worked fine for what I wanted them for, but if you are expecting chinos, these aren’t it!"
4.0,"Good comfort and support.  At first a little stiff, but after a short while the shoes softened."
4.0,Fit is good and picture is accurate as waistband hits at bikini level. I was hoping for a longer skirt but overall this one is a keeper.
4.0,Very nice. Stays in place pretty well.
4.0,The watch is very nice. I would have given it five stars if the crown had not felled off. It happend when I got hooked on a door. Unfortunately the watch stopped working after this and I only had the chance to use it for a few weeks.
4.0,loved the color and how it drapes in the front to hide tummy
4.0,"I thought it was a sharp looking tie, but my husband was disappointed that it didn't resemble the picture more closely. He felt the color wasn't as vibrant in person. We returned the tie, but it was very well made."
4.0,"The color was great, just like it was pictured. I liked the dress but it ran way small! I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 148 and had ordered a size large and it was too tight. I might reorder it in a XL because it is really cute."
4.0,Fabric is nice. Color is rich. Bust is tight
4.0,Love these pants. I bought these to play pickleball but would wear them out during the day.  I do not like the tight yoga pants. These are straight legged but a little loose which is exactly what I wanted. Zipped pockets in the front do not stick out and lay nice on my hips. Material is lightweight. Bought a Xl. Usually a 1x and they fit perfectly.
4.0,SOOO SMALL SO UNLESS YOU ARE a true small.. like size 4 and under this WONt fit so cute tho
4.0,"Confortable, thin, single layer masks that are surprisingly breathable.  I am happy to report that these were hot when wearing.  However, this one single layer doesn't appear to provide much protect for germs, so I will stick to different masks for germ prevention and save these for dusty events and/or minor face protection in windy weather.<br />Colors as pictured.  Comfortable with good stretch."
4.0,You never know really what you're going to get when you order clothes off Amazon but I was pleasantly surprised with his khaki jacket! A really nice fit and slim in the arms which gives it a more tailored fit. I ordered a Medium and I am usually small. 5'6'' 130 lb. My only complaint is the pockets are pretty worthless and that matters to me as a mom! They've very awkward and my phone kept falling out.<br />The stitching on the hood is hot pink and I actually really love it.<br />Definitely slightly narrow in the shoulders but that worked for me. My sister bought this after seeing me in it.
4.0,It is TOO warm for my needs but it is pretty and stays put
4.0,"Light weight. Looks good on any day, can definitely hide that food baby. Careful when washing, my polkadots aren't so white anymore."
4.0,"These are my daily beaters and they do a good job keeping my eyes protected while looking cute. The only thing is that the lower part of the eyeglass sits on my cheeks because I have high cheek bones, so they leave lines after a while. Other than that, great product and even greater value."
4.0,"awesome color, very warm, thin sole, but hard as rock. they are good."
4.0,"Great mirrored lens, great elastics-- don't snag hair, very good seal against leakage. Lots of good qualities, though they are way too tight across the bridge of the nose, making the fit too uncomfortable for me.Too bad though, a great product."
4.0,The glasses are good for the price. The lenses are clear. Overall good value.
4.0,"I LOVE the “brushed” version of this legging. They are soft!  Bought some for PJs and some to wear in public!  I purchased the plus to be sure of size.  They had stretch, but felt tight against the body-no baggy knees!"
4.0,Dress fit perfect and looks great.
4.0,"Excellent time delivery. I love this watch, looks good and I received lot's of  wow''s for it. We'll see in time how good it is. The only &#34;problem&#34; I have is that the band is too short for my wrist. Can I get an XL or XXL from the seller? I would greatly appreciate that."
4.0,Great colors and fabric. Constantly have to pull down when exercising.
4.0,My son is very comfy in these. I like the quality.
4.0,"I have skinny arms for a male, and although they looked a little short, they did fit me. May need to buy all the colors"
4.0,Luv the size and style
4.0,Nice weight to the shirt and nice design.  I think the size runs a bit small.  Fast delivery
4.0,runs a bit small but ok
4.0,cute as can be - I just have a big head - but it fits great - just looks smallish with the curved front - but I love!
4.0,Love the protection ..  the clipping them on is a bit cumbersome.
4.0,"These were great for the economical cost, but ran small."
4.0,It looked high quality! Someone else also had the same bag but in a different color. It held all my items and easy to carry.
4.0,I bought this for my 3 month old son and it fits well with a small amount of room for growth. It is very soft and covers everything including his neck which is what I wanted since he gets buried in his snowsuit if I zip it up all the way. I live in Brooklyn and walk a good amount outside to/from daycare. This will be perfect to keep him warm on the bitter cold days.
4.0,"Great, comfortable shirt. I use this shirt at the gym and it wicks away sweat very well. Purchase one size up. I had to reorder a larger size because my normal size didn't fit."
4.0,I like how light they are<br />Wish the soles had better grip
4.0,cool...
4.0,excellent product and not false advertised
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty and looks like the picture. I like how delicate and small it is. I am not a fan of big gaudy jewelry. Is it worth the price ? I'm not so sure. It's very pretty and the quality seems nice but I have seen so many companies manage to pull off nice looking jewelry similar to this for much less. Honestly,  I feel like I could find a dupe for less.  But it is Lovely and it is exactly as advertised."
4.0,Nice way to add a colored accessory without doing too much. Good fit on the band and it’s small enough to not stick out from your shirt collar.
4.0,This jacket is plenty warm on the bike. Did not even wear a leather jacket over it. Just a leather vest and I was plenty warm in 50 degrees riding at 80 mph. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because there seems to be no heat in the front of the jacket. Only on the back.
4.0,"Love the material, nice and light. Color better in real life.<br />Sent me wrong size.  Package said small, but shirt is large.<br />Not going to waste time ordering again to see.if they get it right. As it is, the fact that I have to travel 20 min to the Amazon return drop off place is annoying."
4.0,This hat fit my 16 month old with an average size head. I do wish that it had a chin strap because toddlers have a tendency to pull hats off. I sewed on a thin piece of elastic myself to fix this!
4.0,"I bought this for a Halloween costume. It fits my ample figure comfortably. There is plenty of net fabric, so it feels substantial enough. My only quibble is that the elastic waist sometimes rolled with bending--not to an uncomfortable degree, though."
4.0,Kinda big. Thought it’d be thicker. Way cuter online than in person.
4.0,"Purchased as a gift, they were very happy with it"
4.0,"Awesome hat! Was a bit tight on my head at first and gave me a headache-and I don't even have a big bell, lol! But after a few days of stretching it out, it's my favorite hat!"
4.0,My stepson loves this hoodie! He loves the mask that's attached too! He loves it so much that he wants another one!!!
4.0,"It fits a little tighter than I expected, but it it very comfy!"
4.0,The bomb. I love different.  Super cute
4.0,"Feels so good, but rungs larhe. I should have ordered a m, but wear it any way.. runs large."
4.0,I like the dress is a oversized dress. I love wearing it around the house
4.0,"If you have tiny wrists, this will be loose. I’ve got it as tight as the decoration will allow and it moves around on my wrist. We all know the Apple Watch needs to be snug to get an accurate reading, so this will be something I don’t wear often. Cute for the money spent, but I’m not too happy with it."
4.0,"I couldn't find the cap locely and the order responce time was grate. I did notice that the cap was made in Vietnam, now why can't we do that here?"
4.0,It's a great hat but not the color I ordered. I ordered the hat shown but received the solid straw colored hat.
4.0,Comfy but see through. Which they were a bit thicker.
4.0,"This product has a premium quality although the material is a bit stiff, over all a thumbs up!"
4.0,Hurts a lot but looks nice
4.0,nice guality crucifix and center pieces for making rosaries using 6mm beads.
4.0,expect better fabric
4.0,I got one in every color because theyre soft and adorable. But the straps are very long and not adjustable. If you aren't handy with altering clothing with snap buttons or something maybe a safety pin will help.
4.0,these were a favorite of my travelers
4.0,Read their size chart before you order. Super cute. Love mine!
4.0,"Great replica! Wasn’t sure what the material would be like. The shorts are almost too loose since they are similar to ball shorts, but I think I picked the right size for everything else. Could have had instructions for yellow straps but I figured it out by looking at pictures."
4.0,"This shirt is comfortable, soft, and has great little details with the buttons.  I’ve washed it twice and so far it’s held up well also."
4.0,"I don’t consider the shape of my face to be small. I typically use average size masks. This mask fit large  around both the face and ears. It is lightweight, which is nice."
4.0,I like this necklace.  The quality is good.  It is a longer length chain.  I ordered the Love one.  It looks nice and the chain feels strong.  The script font is very readable.  It shipped and arrived in 2 days with my Amazon Prime account.
4.0,Looks exactly as pictured. Will definitely keep you warm when swimming in cooler water or when you are in enjoying a fresh water waterfall.
4.0,Nice and thin. Perfect when u wear a normal Hoodia under it. Only thing I found weird was the little Bill on the hood. I understand why it's there but was just in the way.
4.0,"Came on time, great quality would give 5 stars but had a dirty mark on it when arrived. It was a Christmas gift I did wash and it did come out."
4.0,Cosy and warm
4.0,Not as stretchy as I would have expected. Ordered normal size and it was too small. Returned.
4.0,Cute little purse for a small child.
4.0,"Love these little rings, some were too small, all and all just fun!!"
4.0,I love the quality and look of it but don't like that its shorts than I thought.
4.0,The shorts fit well and have the perfect length. The pockets zip up nicely. I don't need a gym locker any longer.<br />I will purchase a another pair to use as day time shorts.
4.0,Absolutely LOVE this dress but its too small to clasp at the top. Otherwise fit good. A little see through but not bad
4.0,"Great Sunglasses, these are our new favorite.  I would like for them to be a little darker.  Seems like the really dark ones are hard to find, but these do fit us really well."
4.0,"I was looking for a stocking to put with the rest of our family stocking for my grandson's first Christmas.  By my own error, I overlooked that it said ""oversized"".  I just looked at the picture and it looked average.  I could have fit the baby in the stocking...lol.  other than being to big for what  I needed, I feel that the print on the stocking could have been a little bigger so it filled more of the area and didn't leave so much blank space. Just make sure you read the description.  I put toys in it instead of regular stocking material so it didn't go to waste!!"
4.0,Cute gift. Really cute. Stainless steel...not silver.
4.0,"Somehow I lost my long time trusty travel umbrellas, so bought these as a replacement. They are  difficult to close and a heavy gust of wind caused the one I was using to blow inside out.  Keeping them, however."
4.0,Good product - it was what I expected.  Fit my 15-year-old daughter and my 11-year-old son.
4.0,"This does not have an eye hook to keep it closed, I had to order up another size even though this should have fit me fine because the zipper kept unzipping. It's a great skirt though, I highly recommend it!"
4.0,I have received compliments every time i wear this piece.!
4.0,"Fits perfectly in my locker at LA Fitness. The instructions could be clearer (like insert the cardboard things into the shelves...not sure it will last FOREVER...but what does these days. Also, the zipper does not function smoothly. But overall I am pleased...I do wish they made a larger version which provided space to carry shampoo, deodorant and hair gel...but...I am being picky...I 6'5&#34; and 240...I need all that space to hold clothes, shoes and a towel."
4.0,I don't know if the are blue or black.  But they are nice.
4.0,Little long but great fit!
4.0,The size runs small. Extra large gives me a little room to spare. So I ordered double X. It is a little tight but with just a T shirt but I can where it.  So it is good for summer and I will have to get something else come winter time.
4.0,"Love the look! The bar is a little long for my ear, and I’ve noticed some green discoloration when cleaning with Q-tips. It went in easily and the bottom ball screwed on quickly, very little fussing. Otherwise I’m very happy with it!"
4.0,The purple color is exactly what I expected and I like it. the frame front fits correctly over my glasses but the arms were too tight and gave me a headache. I held them briefly in boiling water and stretched them around a pot and now they fit better.
4.0,"This dress is sexy but it shows every crease, wrinkle, dimple.. I advise u not to work spanx it will show thru this...I suggest a nice pair of panties with no lace on them.."
4.0,I was expecting it to see more of a cotten instead of the workout material. It was very comfy and a good fit.
4.0,I ordered one set before Christmas and it was too small. Returned and ordered a size bigger.  Seems like they will suit the purpose.  It took a while to get my refund on first order and shipping of second order took a little longer.
4.0,"exactly what you see, very nice ties"
4.0,Really like this dress add on to my work attire.
4.0,In love with this dress! If it wasn’t for the belt it would’ve been a no for me
4.0,The hat is great at shielding my face from the sun.  The strap and its attachment clasp are a bit flimsy.
4.0,"The product came in two weeks, and I'm happy about that. Despite it being cheap, I like the quality, as it is true to the description. It fits perfectly, but the the chain is too long, I might cut it down some, which is no problem. To those thinking of buying the product, please be cautious when purchasing as the seller does not provide a tracking number. I'm only lucky it came as fast as it did."
4.0,Very comfortable and sporty looking<br />Makes walking great again
4.0,Will use for a wedding. Ver comfortable.
4.0,Felt great immediately. Heading g to beach that will be the test.
4.0,"These are a bit small but look great.  I can't wear any earrings unless they are 14k gold.  Have an allergy to other metals.  As I stated, they are very nice, with one exception.  The tips of the posts are screw on and the screws are way to small for my fingers to work with.  They came with a plastic back that most likely wasn't meant for use, but for package stability, but the plastic backs work ok."
4.0,"It's an okay top but I bought what I thought was green ,but the color is more yellow than qreen. A bit disappointing. I might return"
4.0,The bigger the size the bigger the hoodie gets going side to side. Not longer.  Love the color though. That is exactly as pictured
4.0,Prolonged walking makes ankles sore from rubbing. If your ankles don't protrude then you might be okay. Maybe a sweatband around your ankle will solve this. Otherwise fine.
4.0,"Very thin chain, but I like it!"
4.0,Kind of flimsy. Two of them were broken when they came. I think only children would be able to use these which is why we got them.
4.0,"Super cute hat! The only issue is that the fabric under the frontside of the bill is starting to detach and droop down a little. Other than that, I really like it."
4.0,"Once u get the glasses on the hook,  its a doozy. Haven't its been almost 1 week had to adjust yet. In the packaging there was a card that gives additional offers but the website don't work😕"
4.0,Fits my long torso great.
4.0,This skirt is advertised as a midi but is actually a floor length maxi. in reviewing pictures of the models wearing the skirts I noticed that the bottom pattern of the skirts have been cut off and the skirts shortened. I will probably do the same. If you don't sew or aren't tall you may be disappointed. I was surprised but kept the skirt because it's cute and was inexpensive.
4.0,Cute color. A little short
4.0,"Material soft, pants fit nicely. Order size up as pants run small."
4.0,"Very nice tie! I love the design, and the pocket square is a nice addition, even if I don't plan on using it that much. The pocket square and the tie come sewn together, but the threads are easy to cut without damaging the pocket square or tie, and come out cleanly. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I expected slightly better craftsmanship at this price range. Nonetheless, it is still a very well made tie, and I do not regret buying it in the slightest. I have never seen a tie with a design this cool, and when I stumbled upon this, I knew I had to get it. (I also got one in purple.)"
4.0,This dress is very thin. So make sure your under garments are proper and decent. It fits loose around stomach. Material is very soft. This dress comes very long. I washed it twice in hot water and it’s just right now with some flat sandals but still may drag a tad bit.
4.0,Dope for pix not for talking lol
4.0,I wear these under my scrubs so they do great for that. And I love the colors. My only complaint is they ride up constantly. But tucking it in helps. Great for the price tho! Also I'm usually a medium but I didn't want a super tight fit so I bought the large. I am happy with the large. If you like a looser fit I'd go up a size.
4.0,"Great pin, but bigger than I  imagined."
4.0,Love these bracelets. If you don’t want to pay a lot and just want some cute accessories this will definitely work for you.
4.0,The necklace was just as pictured however I broke out around my neck from it. Won't be wearing it. :(.
4.0,Somewhat longer than expected.
4.0,Very good quality. A bit small. I'm size M and ordered a size L after reading reviews. Fits perfect but because I went up one size. I love it though.
4.0,These are fun to wear since they are different than most sunglasses..  I love the blue color.  They fit well.
4.0,shirt is nice quality.  was comfortable and covers nicely.
4.0,Hard to put on.  Helped with legs.
4.0,"I purchased the gray bolero. Quality fabric, professional sewing, drapes nicely. Definite &#34;hand wash only&#34;, to prevent snags. Being an experienced seamstress, I want to point out that the front & the back, do not have the same layers of fabric. The front is lined, two layers of fabric. The back & sleeves are NOT lined, having only one layer of sheer fabric. The front & back should match & should be sewn in the same manner. For most of us, if we need coverage in the front, we also need it in the back! I was looking for a shrug to wear with a spaghetti strap, maxi, dress & did not catch this detail prior to my quick purchase."
4.0,This is slightly larger than expected but my daughter loves it
4.0,"A very attractive and functional watch at a great price. The tourbillon and the sub-dials all work perfectly. The bezel rotates very smoothly and overall the watch appears much more expensive than what it is. The only disappointment was the watch band, which has a very dressy look to it, but is of low quality. It's a shame, because the band has the attractive Jaragar logo on it, and looks nice from afar, but was difficult to adjust to a smaller wrist and the buckle mechanism fell apart rather easily. I was able to make it hold, but am not very confident it will last long. Nonetheless, the rest of the watch is awesome looking and well worth the affordable $25 I paid for it. It came in a nice storage box with a tool and cloth. It did not bring instructions, but the buttons are easy to figure out. The top-right button adjusts the date. The bottom-right adjusts the month of the year (1 - 12). The recessed button located on the bottom-left side of the watch adjusts the day of the week (1 - 7); the included tool will help make the day adjustment. Again, a worthwhile timepiece at an affordable price."
4.0,I like it ! Material could of been better use to heavy duty shirts but awesome and comfortable shirt.
4.0,Nice swim suit for the price. Can't beat it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the panty liner stuck and left goo.
4.0,Pretty and decent looking. The belt hook is on the smaller one and is not changable which makes it a bit awkward. But if i was attaching to like a bag or other ring it would be good.
4.0,(nice hats) piss pour custmer service .WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.
4.0,"I wear these often, even though i was disappointed to see they were slightly different in size. Most likely people don't notice with my hair in the way, but I wouldn't order them again."
4.0,The sweater is really beautiful and plenty long. Only thing that bugs me is the knit is not very tightly woven so it tends to get caught in everything!
4.0,"Fits true to size. I ordered one size bigger (they were too big) thinking they may run small but they worked great! Tad long on me but I'm 5'2"" so that's normal!"
4.0,"The color is pretty and it fits pretty well, the pockets do lay a little funny creating bumps in the skirt. I'm happy with the dress overall."
4.0,Nice wallet..more pockets then you'll ever use...a real good deal for the money...
4.0,"This umbrella collapses to around 18 -- 20 inches! This is borderline 'compact' -- so if you are looking for something<br />you might pack into a briefcase, don't buy it -- otherwise, it's a nice large umbrella!"
4.0,I purchased this suit as an extra for a trip to the beach.  It fit as expected and was a great bathing suit for the price.  I did not try swimming in it.
4.0,I am so entirely in love with this sauna suit. I have been looking for a waist trainer that targets the muffin top or fupa area and this is it. I have been drenched after workouts.
4.0,The look and frame weight is awesome.
4.0,"Like that it has a band as a watch, the clap is hard to open and it’s a big tall so it stand a bit high in your wrist but looks pretty"
4.0,"I loved these, though I think they would be better without the little gem. I am sure most would not feel that way though - my gift recipients are a tad on the gothy side :)"
4.0,"I've had this necklace in my shopping cart forever, because I really wanted it! I finally ordered it, and it is adorable! The only thing is that I wanted the red one, and somehow I got pink instead - even though the package was marked as red. It is still pretty, but I was disappointed to not have gotten the red one. My birthstone is Ruby, and my name is Rubie, so red was important. I just don't have the time or patience to do an exchange."
4.0,"Print is clear and colorful, but fabric is somewhat thin and a third of the waistband is elastic, while the rest of the waistband is smooth. Fits well and does not shrink. I've gotten many compliments on this skirt."
4.0,"Beautiful, and they all come with a cleaning cloth too"
4.0,"This shirt is cute but it is a little thin. I can wear a grey bra with it and it is fine. It isn't super warm because of the thinness but it's fine. The elbow patches also are a little low on the arm. Overall, I like this shirt."
4.0,"So far so good just opened it up, it has nice weight to it & is a nice design. Adjusting it is straight forward, the instructions are in both English & Chinese(made in China). Digital screens look clear, the band “leather” is same as other retail store quality & stiff. Maybe a weeks worth of ware will loosen it up, so far satisfied. Seems similar to $25 humvee & Swiss watches I’ve had."
4.0,"I got exactly what I was looking for after reading customer reviews. Definitely way too large for a toe ring, I suspect it's a size 7.5 Initially, it looked &quot;cheap&quot; because the silver looked like it was just cranked out of the 25c machine, but after a week it's settled in nicely and looks like the rest of my silver."
4.0,The dress is very pretty and soft in person.
4.0,Fun for Halloween
4.0,"the legs stay in place, and the padding is good, but walking around in them feels like a wad of something huge between your legs. Also, they stretched out and I had to take in the seam."
4.0,Look exactly as pictures and I like that they are super short so I don't have to worry about anything. They are a little small in the waist for me though and I am 5 ft and always wear smalls or 0-1's
4.0,Purchased for my daughter as a flower girl for a wedding. Coordinated well with the brides’s dress. It’s not the best made dress but very pretty. For a dress you’ll use once maybe twice can’t beat the $28 dollar price. Looked like a more expensive boutique dress. Also you will need to steam before wearing.
4.0,"Relief the back pain,but it flattened my breast too much."
4.0,Shape and style was really cute! Really comfortable! Its definitely transparent though a d I had to wear a tank and pants underneath. (I purchased the black one)
4.0,I wish i wouldve ordered up a size..too tight
4.0,"These earrings are very well made--and very comfortable.  The images are not easily identified, but the colors are nice--and they make a very nice accessory.  Very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"This is super cute! It shrunk a bit in the dryer, which I was hoping for since it was a bit large to start. But now it fits out 7 month old perfectly."
4.0,Very modern and simple key chain for my keys. I dont like alot of stuff on my key chain so this helps me not lose my keys and is cute. I also like you can pick between yellow gold or siler finish for the metal portion. It will wear overtime. Scratches on the metal and the leather part will fall apart. Had mine for 2 years before that happened
4.0,"Clever, fashionable and transforming for different ways to wear. This pretty fringed plaid blanket wrap is great and one size will fit many different sized women. There are no armholes. You have a neckline that leads to an open front. You can wear it with a belt, as a wrap or however you want to manipulate for your personal preference. This is made of 100% acrylic, which can be machine washed in a cold, gentle cycle and then you can hang to dry. You can use a cool iron if you need to. This wrap is a lightweight material, so it works perfectly for early mornings and evenings, when the temperature is lower than during the day. It goes with so many solids, Looks great with jeans and a tee."
4.0,Fits well on my Pandora bracelet .
4.0,So cute but I am normally a medium... I should have gotten a small. Comes a little large.
4.0,So far so good. They fit fine and are comfortable. I have purchased alot of the 5.11 taclite pants and these are compatible. The only thing I would change are the Velcro flaps on the back pokets. I prefer open slash pokets with Velcro at the seam. No need for the flaps. Feels fine well made. I got two pair and will buy more
4.0,"I would get these just for the lenses.  Style wise, they look decent with nice metal accents.  The rubber I don't really care for as it feels kinda cheap.  All things considered, for the price I don't think you can go wrong buying a few sets like I did so you will always have them in convenient places.  I like driving with polarized lenses and I also boat and fish so they really come in handy.  As a review club member, I received these glasses at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I have been looking for a plain clicker for quite a while. I wanted the closed hoop look for my septum, but I also wanted it to be easily removable. This clicker is very hard to get in, but very easy to take out, I recommend loosening the hoop with pliers."
4.0,Nice material comfortable to workout in.
4.0,Very beautifl. But a little bit yellowish. I wish they can make the color lighter as the pic.
4.0,"We purchased this set to be my wedding set as we are low on cash and I did not want something expensive for fear of losing it, etc. This set is absolutely beautiful! I absolutely love the setting, and the cut of the CZ. To me, it doesn't scream fake, but if you get close to it and really want to analyze it, you will probably be able to tell its a CZ, although I think it sparkles and shines just as well or better than some diamonds personally. The only thing that I think could be a little better is that it could be a little more scratch resistant, but that could be the plating as I have had other sterling silver rings that weren't plated that didn't scratch as easily. Gem Avenue is a great seller and extremely helpful and quick in response time and shipment! I will buy from them again! if you are looking for a great looking set at a great price, this is your set!"
4.0,"Love the shape and size. Down fall, the loose nose pads that make some noise. My hair will definitely be getting snagged."
4.0,"WIDE IN THE TORSO, IT IS SILK AND I COULD FEEL HEAT, I NEED doing A COUPLE OF CLOTHESPEG."
4.0,"Not quite as nice as I was hoping, but it was cheap."
4.0,"Love it. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but the details of the image was good. Did  receive a default chain with it, nothing that I can't fix though."
4.0,"I normally wear a 32C and bought a medium. It fits and is comfortable, but does start to feel tight after a while. Wish I had bought a large."
4.0,"I love this dress. Unfortunately it was one size too small at the time of purchase but, I still love it!"
4.0,"Stone is gone, after only less than 4 months wearing it."
4.0,product was exactly as advertised with no surprises.
4.0,I was expecting there to be a little more depth in them. The image is flatter than I thought it would be.
4.0,Love this dress but it runs a little small in the chest. I'm a 36c and usually wear a 6-8/M and this fits on the small 6 side. Not a big deal and I will keep it. It's flattering and the color is a very bright pink.
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty and dainty. I really like it. The only thing is that the chain had extra links at the end. I have not been able to clasp it closer to the end, so there's a lot of extra links that just hang loose. The lightning bolts on the front are so light that the whole chain rotates so that the extra links end up in the front instead of staying in the back.  I have to keep adjusting it all day."
4.0,Great for vactions and trips where you don't want to carry a big purse.  I bought this for two relatives that were going to Vegas.  They both loved it!  Good construction and great price for Dooney and Bourke.
4.0,"Depending on the lighting this either looks real, or like cloudy glass. Any chance of deception fails if the bracelet turns and you see the Dollar store clap. For another few pennies they could've used a lobster claw, what a shame.<br /><br />I'm going to keep it, but am disappointed in that oversight."
4.0,"Hello, my name is Zack.<br /><br />With this being my first steel watch (i'm used to the digital velcro ones), I really enjoyed the jump in aesthetics and quality. The watch just looks down right awesome, as it's got that sleek and simplistic design. The metal feels heavy and durable to me, despite other reviewer's claims of it being cheap. Sizing the watch was a bit of a pain, as I had to learn how to take some of the links out - but once you get everything good to go, you've got an inexpensive, great looking watch! I've had the watch for around 20 days now, and haven't come across any serious issues. My only gripe would be that it's difficult to set the minute hand to a precise number (this could be on all watches like this), as the wheel was not very sensitive - meaning that I would accidentally add too many minutes forward when scrolling the wheel. Eventually I got the time that I wanted, and now i'm good to go! If you're looking for a watch that looks and feels like the really expensive and premium ones - here you go!"
4.0,"Item looks just like the one pictured.. would have preferred the metal to be of better quality, its a little lightweight.  But, you can't beat it got the price. Someone  will love it for christmas, and I'm not complaining!"
4.0,"Save the duck products are of superior quality, you'll never have the issue of feathers popping out and poking you. I think the length of the sleeves for the small size could have been a little shorter but that's just me. Their clothing is expensive no doubt but I'd rather pay once and be satisfied with my purchase than pay less and be poked by feathers. All-in-all a good purchase and a satisfied customer. I would definitely recommend their products."
4.0,"This bottle is really cute and travel friendly. The bottle itself can fit into a jacket pocket or purse without weighing it down.<br />It is also great for the office. When you have your hands full with a laptop, cellphone, notebooks and pens. This bottle will easily swing from your pinkie and not bend it to a painful position.<br />It does not give the water any sort of metallic taste which is nice as well.<br />If you are used to a 32 oz bottle though you maybe a little disappointed that this leaves you dehydrated, but other wise an aesthetic bottle with good functional use"
4.0,"Nice, finally got them thanks!"
4.0,I do love this hat but they do run a little large. I have it all the way on the smallest setting. Surprising because most of the Jordan hats are the same design. At least the ones produced in the last few years but I still really dig it. Beautiful navy/royal blue with an excellent stitch design on the 92 logo.
4.0,Great size to carry all my things to and from my classroom.
4.0,"Very nice feeling leather. I've used it on two foreign trips so far and it has worked out really well. Holds enough credit/debit/airline etc. cards and provides perfect space for passport -even the 52-page size. It shows a pocket for bills, but I also stored less frequently used currency in the two larger pockets opposite and under the passport. Since I always stored my passport in room safe, there was no danger of money sliding out when removing passport. RFID a bonus, if it really works. Needed a small change purse, but foreign change is what you try to avoid, I suppose.One point off because it could use an extra credit card slot or two. Would really like to see a version with a long flat sealable pocket for change/receipts, though it would thicken the size."
4.0,Bigger than anticipated but nice. Chain seemed weak but is holding up. Bought as a gift and justvrecommended moving it to new chain.
4.0,very good and big enough for day to day use
4.0,"Un reloj genial, no puedes pedir más por 10 $ ; su punto débil sin duda su correa es bien pequeña y se me hace que para alguien de muñeca gruesa le quedaría a las justas"
4.0,"I got this to take on vacation with me, very comfortable and it didn’t wrinkle in my suitcase.<br />Only 4 stars because the material was just a little thin around the chest (but to be fair I am a little busty)"
4.0,My son really likes the shirt
4.0,"Nice quality shirt, just too small.  Reordered."
4.0,"I love these, but I have reservations about how long the zippers will last. If you tend to stuff your bags full like I do, the zippers don't seem like they are very sturdy. I feel like they will go off track soon, and I haven't had these bags only for a few trips. The material of the bag is great though. I love the way they look and roll. Handles are nice. If the zippers were more heavy duty, they would get 5 stars. For the price point though, they aren't a bad buy."
4.0,It was just what we were looking for.
4.0,"This is adorable. The straps are a bit small, even when they're full lengthened, but I have a really long torso so that's more my problem than the suit. There's also slight ruching on the sides that I didn't realize was there, which made it extra cute!"
4.0,Super cute earrings. A little disappointed that the green ones on the bottom are just green and don’t glow in the dark.
4.0,I thought these were cotton and spandex but I was wrong! the size is true! the material is silk!
4.0,"I am very pleased with my bracelet, It's well worth the price."
4.0,fit a little weird ad the pockets were too show-y but still cute
4.0,"So these are very pretty pajamas. The pattern is lovely. They are lightweight and cool. I got the pink with the white and brown flowers. The material is soft but it’s not a fuzzy cotton it’s more of like a super soft button up shirt material.<br /><br />These must be from an Asian supplier because the sizes are way off. I am usually a size extra small or small in American brands. Thanks to the other reviews,  I chose a large in American size which is extra large in Asian size. I am almost 5 foot one and 105 pounds. So I basically ordered two sizes larger than I usually would. That worked out perfect for me. The pants go all the way to the floor, the Tank top fits nicely and has adjustable straps. And the cover up Sleeves don’t go all the way to my wrist. But they are stylish fitting three-quarter sleeves."
4.0,"This fit my daughter somewhat largely, which is fine since feet do tend to swell on long hikes. Once broken in, she said they are comfortable."
4.0,Nice earrings came with plastic backs.
4.0,"Cute shorts, great length- not too short or too long! Love the pockets. I wish they had more patterns to choose from, and wish they didn’t ride up my leg so easily when I walk/run/move."
4.0,"The dress was very cute and it doesn’t look cheap or of bad quality. The feel of the material is a little thin and harsh but once on it was flattering. I am 5’1 with a 36D bust, 30” waist and 38.5” hips the medium was very loose everywhere except the bust. I normally wear a Medium in tops and size 8 bottoms. I would recommend ordering your normal size or sizing down."
4.0,Fits fine. It was damaged BEFORE it was packaged though so I'm pretty peeved about that.
4.0,I bought these for new frenum piercing. They are perfect. My only issue is they are so small that putting the ball back on after putting the loop thru the piercing is a challenge with mens hands.
4.0,Cute and fits perfectly. Only issue is the front part of the bottoms (where my legs are) likes to roll up a little when I walk/sit. I'm a pretty fit person. It's just a little annoying to have to adjust.
4.0,"I’m 5’6” and 120 lbs. I bought the medium thinking they would give me just enough extra room but they were still pretty tight. You could see the outline of my fishnets really easily. They weren’t uncomfortable, just snug. I still wore them but a large would have been way better for me. They’re long enough in the front but if you have any bottom, they definitely are short in the back."
4.0,slips a little
4.0,Cute Tutu. Made a good Tinkerbell Costume. Waist band is a bit bunchy.
4.0,Smelled funny... the packaging was nice. Washed up fine and i have wore it several times. No issues.
4.0,My kid loves this brand. They are a little pricey but worth it.
4.0,nice fabric and comfortable design.
4.0,"Very good quality, so cute. They are a little bigger than I expected and leave indents on my nose but I would defintely purchase again, great buy"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:73d07db6782a88d18aa6b9e45de26371]] This is ONLY the one piece mini dress, it doesn't come with the panty hose.<br /><br />The tutu comes suuuper flat, but! All you have to do is rub the layers together and they will poof out like it looks like in the product pictures.<br /><br />The skeleton print is the print that will crack if you put it in the dryer, so I would suggest that if you wash it, that you do it by hand and let it air dry so you don't ruin that. Its really cute when is a glowing in the dark, but now I feel like I have to find some glue in the dark skeleton pantyhose. Just to kind of bring the whole thing together. But, if you are looking for just a mini dress, this is it. And it is suuuper mini.<br /><br />The body part is a super stretchy elastic type of materials, so this will fit any one. The elastic band that's a the top is really small, but it won't take into your skin or make you feel like you are can find. I have to pull mine up a lot because it slides down, & I am a 36 DD. Weird.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided to review."
4.0,These gloves fit smaller than expected. I ordered an XXL and they were a bit small. They seem warm and will be waterproof. The inside fabric is a little noisy and sounds a little like a plastic bag. Overall I give them a four star because they will fulfill their purpose of keeping me warm and dry on a cold wet winter day.
4.0,This is pretty cute. It stays in place underneath your shirt. I get lots of compliments
4.0,"Fits well, I am 5'7, 125 lbs., so it is a compression tank on me.  I think it may be too tight on a large busted woman.  I wear 34B bra!  The tanks are cute, and perfect for working out, or in the sunshine.  The lime green one was a bit too fluorescent for my taste however."
4.0,I have normal/NOT thick or muscular calves; and these fit ‘snug’ but DO go over my *skinny* jeans. The yarn doesn’t seem to have a stretch quality to it. I wouldn’t recommend washing warm or drying.<br />Would be nice if they had an ‘elastic’ element to them and could be slouched rather than tight/smooth over pants.<br />I also find that I have to pull them up to an odd height so that they can be seen over my standard/calf-high ‘riding’ style Fall boots.<br />The little balls: you need to be somewhat careful with them. I try to tie them up neatly before washing them so that they don’t get pulled off you also have to be mindful of that when walking and wearing them. Ideally you turn the whole thing inside out to wash them because the string and balls can’t be taken off since they don’t fit back through the holes where they’re fished through the ‘sock’.<br />Hopefully that makes sense!
4.0,"Beautiful pants, and I love the high waist to help show off my hourglass figure. If you are on the shorter side you will have to have these hemmed. I'm 5'3 and had to have a good 6 inches cut off. Even with my highest heels these still drug on the ground but otherwise super comfy and very classy."
4.0,Loved the matrial and the way it fit for a heavy set lady. But the fastener on one leg came completely off of garment. But that mite be me. I always have a hard time getting the hose to fasten and stay fastened on every one I've ever had. So it's not this one. I loved the way it felt and fit.  I am most diffently going to buy another one from the same place.
4.0,prettier than expected...Wish the band was a little bit longer...but does fit okay
4.0,The dress is beautiful .
4.0,Made it 16 games. I accelerate and hard stop a lot but have a hole in the Achilles now.  For that same reason that is why these are awesome and feet don’t slide within the cleats. For the price I give it 4 stars because it worked well at a low cost. If it was $50-60 I would probably go with a 3 star.  I will need to get a replacement of just the socks. The over shingaurds socks are compression like and will probably last forever.
4.0,I get so many compliments when wearing this jersey.  It is asian sizing so order up 1-2 sizes. I am buying another one.
4.0,"Received on time, as advertised."
4.0,"Darker than I expected, but works fine."
4.0,"Attractive watch, looks professional/classy. Difficult to remove/adjust links (reason for 4 stars), it did include small tool to help with removal, but I also needed to use a hammer (gently) and pliers.  Overall it seems to be a nice watch, especially for the price. I've had it about 2 months without any problems."
4.0,"I liked this, but was disappointed when it broke not long a few weeks after I had been wearing it.  I'd like to buy it again, but am not sure."
4.0,"A beautiful dress but too expensive. Cheaply<br />made.  After one wash, it fell apart."
4.0,"Actually love these, I didn't use them as earrings. I used one as a charm on a rose gold beaded bracelet and my friend adored it."
4.0,To wear under low cut tops
4.0,These are so cute & super comfy!!! I measured my foot and based on inches chose to not get the large but wish I did. I'm a perfect size 8 shoe and these are good to a tiny bit tight without socks. They have a nice bottom though and are super cute & soft. I do love them!!!!!
4.0,"Pretty fabric, classy and comfy, and the length is perfect for me.  Inseam 30”"
4.0,Fits good! A little bigger than I thought but I still like it! Perfect for camping! Material is a little odd and not super soft but that’s okay
4.0,"My husband uses these shoes to cut grass on a hillside.  With the shoes being plastic, it really helps with cleanup."
4.0,I received all sizes in good condition before the expected delivery date.  You get the quality that you pay for. Some of them aren't seemless though and they are very light weight. Its also kind of hard to distinguish the different sizes because they all come in one package.<br />Reminder that acrylic is very bad for your ears and should only be wore for a limited time. Acrylic is also not ideal for stretching. If you plan to stretch with these I suggest glass or quality metal instead.
4.0,"These glasses look great and have some weight to them, so they feel like they will last, the only problem is they have a very dark tint to them, so it makes it hard to wear them all day. Along with when you look at a screen with them on it makes things look distorted."
4.0,It’s lovely - great with a skinny jeans or a pencil skirt - the color is vibrant lots of compliments from both men and women
4.0,It is a bit big and must be worn with heels for the full effect as it I am 5'3 and it almost hits the floor.  It is cut nicely.
4.0,This bas fit my suit with high quality.  The size is just right.
4.0,Super cute but too small!
4.0,"Great for using with masks,  just the right length and very inexpensive"
4.0,A little awkward on my face but it did the job
4.0,"With the mixed reviews I was uncertain but decided to purchase.  The fit was fine (went with what I consider a medium), ordered short and have a ""Ballerina"" length robe, the fabric is soft and washed well in COLD water, LOW temp dry.  The only con I have is the placement of the pockets, for me they should be about 1-2 inches higher.  The colors are soft, the shoulders are NOT too broad,  well stitched.  Bottom line, I am glad I made the purchase."
4.0,"In general I like the product. The weight is perfect. Kind of a mid weight sweater, not too bulky but very warm. My only complaint is that the sizing is very off. I am often between a large and a medium and I first ordered a medium which was a little tight on me--I am 5'9 165 with an athletic build. I ordered a large which fits great above my waist but it is super long. If I stretched it downwards, it almost hits my knees. I wear it kind of bunched at my waist which is not terrible looking but it could easily be improved with a small design change."
4.0,Very nice material<br />Outfit was open on the side but if fixed it
4.0,Good but light
4.0,didnt realized the chain was too small its not long enough for an adult need 16&#34; lenght can i exchange pls let me know thank you  Gilda Witkin
4.0,"Pretty good for the price!  I haven't had any fogging issues.  I have a smaller face and these fit well...which is what I was hoping for, I look stupid in large goggles."
4.0,Fits great. Son loves it
4.0,There pretty good :)
4.0,"The dress was a lot better than expected.  I normally wear and XL and the XL fit great except in the boob area.  I wear a 36D/38D and it was definitely tight but not unwearable.  I have curves in the booty and belly area and the dress fits perfectly in that area where you wouldn't be able to tell that I have a little belly haha.  I am 5'5&#34; and the dress comes about 1-2 inches from the floor to where it would be perfect if you wear some cute sandals.  The dress is super cute, but the fabric is a bit sheer so I might wear a light slip under.. especially since I would assume most would wear this on a sunny day, you can definitely see right through in the light."
4.0,"Very comfortable, well-fitting and cute dress."
4.0,I little small and it doesn’t fit well. But I like it
4.0,"Once you figure out the fit it's a good teddy.  The medium fits me but if I had to buy again I would definitely size down to a small. This is just for my preference. For reference, I am 5 ft 3in, 34 C bra, and 137 lbs."
4.0,this is a very pretty top. straps are adjustable and material is medium weight for a tank top.
4.0,"These earrings are very cute! However, the posts are very thin. When applying the back, the posts will bend."
4.0,Fit true to size.  Great for hiding my mom muffin!  Cute for dressing up or dressing down.
4.0,Super soft! Has 2 full size pockets and high waist. Not much of a roll down issue
4.0,Good belt and much higher quality than your average belt from a store.
4.0,"Not a bad replacement, wearing well but a little thick"
4.0,Good quality but too long.  I'm 5'5&#34;.
4.0,Very comfortable. Good length. Like having the pockets!
4.0,a bit pricey. Cards don't eject evenly. They are on an angle and look stupid. It looks like the picture but just seems cheap. Just my opinion though.
4.0,"My 10 year old LOVES how they look, was so pumped when he saw them... He says when his feet get sweaty they are uncomfortable. But he continued wearing them so I say that's a win."
4.0,Really stretchy so you could size down!
4.0,They are comfortable but fit a little smaller than listed.
4.0,"Shirts fit fine I just wish the stitching of the shirts was the same as the color of the shirts instead of grey. But they definitely fit well, they are form fitting i wear a large normally and they are snug, so if you like a looser fit, you may want to size up"
4.0,"Cheaply made, but lightweight and comfortable. Yoy get what you pay for. I'll probably buy another one for the summer."
4.0,I couldn't give it 5 stars because my granddaughter is receiving it for Christmas and she hasn't tried it on yet.  It looks like it will fit and the quality is what I expected.
4.0,"Good shirt for the price.  Chest pocket is too small to hold cell phone and wrist opening is small, but it's a nice color."
4.0,Ordered this for a 75th zoom birthday party. The hats arrived flat which was great because I mailed them out to family to wear during our zoom birthday party. They were easy to put together. Sign needs to be assembled which was easy. Product looks just like in the picture.
4.0,"While it looks really cute, and the band itself was comfy, it just wasn't  wide enough to hold the weight of the watchface in place on the outside of my wrist.  After about 2 hours the watchface would slowly get pulled to one side of my wrist.  It might do better on thicker wrists, but not on my boney wrists."
4.0,Good quality. The colour is perfect not too garish. I didn't get instructions with mine fo different ways to wear it so I'll have to look it up
4.0,"I received this ring for Christmas after it was on my wish list for ever. I was completely happy with it.<br /><br />It was a bit big for my right pinky, which was measured professionally as a 4. It didn't bend or anything and I wore it everyday to school and color guard practice, and everyone always complemented on it. No green marks or tarnishing as far as I could tell.<br /><br />I ... lost it outside somewhere, but I'm getting another one!"
4.0,"These are great for my outdoor winter walks listening to my audio books. My music actually sounded great, too. Sometimes it takes a few pinches to get it to power up or down but it hasn't failed yet."
4.0,"Okay.....so the issue with this bathing suit is that you cannot look at the one size, as in small, medium, large, etc, but rather at the number size listed.  I originally ordered a Medium, which is pretty accurate most times, and it came in a size 12!  So, I had to order another one, an extra small, in order to get the size that would actually fit..a size 8.  Otherwise, I do like the bathing suit, now that I found one that fits!"
4.0,"Love this coat. It’s the perfect level of warmth and so so cute, but would definitely recommend sizing up."
4.0,really love this belt
4.0,Insoles slipped around and came out in a week and pretty heavy but I really like them after replacing insoles wether gels.
4.0,"Very soft material, a bit thin for lounge wear, but very comfortable to sleep in."
4.0,Exactly as described.  Arrived early.
4.0,Very comfortable fit and they didn'the slip down
4.0,It's a really nice dress for the price
4.0,"perfect starter pair of goggles for child, well made for the price, look and fit nice, fast shipping, no concerns"
4.0,"Pendant is great the chain not so much. Chain moves around, hard to move back into place."
4.0,"It’s a really cute pajama set! However, the sizing is more on the juniors side than women’s. Felt like good quality! Bummed it wasn’t my size."
4.0,That's pretty good
4.0,Looks great on. Def gives me a nice shape.
4.0,"When I opened the package, I was sure I would send this back.  Folded, it looks like a blob of lightweight fabric (yes, it IS somewhat see-through so you'll need a bralette or cami).  Once I tried it on, I loved it.  It is loose and flows and I'm looking forward to wearing it.  It does run a bit large, but I like the looser fit.  I am 5'2"", 105 lbs, and ordered a small."
4.0,Pretty nice dress considering the price. I would say it looks better on less curvy girls.
4.0,"Comfortable and fit exactly as expected. Says There was fleece on inside but there is not, however still seems warm."
4.0,"This is the third pair of bamboo viscose boxer briefs I have ordered. These have a slightly higher percentage of bamboo viscose than the other brand I have tried (95% vs 92%). It doesn’t sound like much, but I can really tell the difference. These are softer and breathe a little bit better.<br /><br />As with the other brand, the ColofulLeaf brand are very comfortable, lightweight and breathable. Much more comfortable than 100% cotton in hot conditions. The band does not roll. I had an issue with the other brand’s sizing chart so I ordered too large. I should’ve trusted the ColofulLeaf sizing chart, because this time I ordered too small. Had I followed the chart, I think they would’ve been the right size.<br /><br />The real issue I have is with the legs. Every pair I have ordered, the legs are not near as long as they show in the pictures. The legs do not extend below the crotch anywhere near as far as depicted. Because of this, they do tend to ride up over time. I wish I could find a pair that actually matches the pictures they show.<br /><br />Even though they are a tad too small, they are still very comfortable and I much prefer them to cotton. I am 6’1”, 205 lbs., and have a 36” waist and 34” inseam (in Levi’s, anyway). I should’ve ordered the large."
4.0,They look good it's a cool product.
4.0,"The robes are perfect. Great quality and a great price. The only reason I rated it 4 starts is, all the sizes were not available the day I purchased it. Immediately after I put in my order all the sizes were suddenly available. I needed 6 for my bridemaid and was only able to purchase 5. I place a second order for only 1 and it's coming at the end of June that's passed my bridal shower date where I wanted to give my girls thier gifts. Otherwise, I'm really happy about the robes. Some people said the robes were short but I didn't think it was too short, I think it looks very sexy."
4.0,"The dress is a great length for a teacher (I’m 5’1 and it went a tad past my knees at the longest point). It fits well in the shoulders and waist, but I just wish the fabric was a bit softer! I think it will be a “hang dry only,” dress. Overall I’m pretty satisfied for the price!"
4.0,i ordered a size s but i recieved a size m<br />i wanted an oversized fit and a small usually is too big on me anyway so as you can already imagine the medium fit even looser. i was annoyed at first but i don’t mind too much as i am a big fan of oversized hoodies in general.
4.0,Does what its intended to do
4.0,Good quality but too tigth
4.0,not bad but we will see how it will last
4.0,These were adorable and well made. My son and his friends loved them. My only complaint was that they were a little small even for three-year-olds. The elastic string  helped but we wished they could have secured them on with the Velcro and really fit as a crown.
4.0,Highly recommend when it comes to quick labeling and labeling items in the house. But its a workhorse when it comes to christmas wrapping and when labels are needed! I give it 4 out of stars due to limited software capabilities but its a still an awesome tool for general use.
4.0,Loved it! Looks like the picture.
4.0,"I usually wear between a small and med, depending on cut and length but I wanted this to be flowy so I purchased a Large and it was still too small. I still do love leprechauns though!"
4.0,"This is a replacement for a similar credit-card sized wallet I finally wore a bit ragged. It's even lighter than my original but seems very sturdy. It holds bills in the middle and six cards — three per size. It fits discretely and without bulk in a back or front pocket. If I'm feeling paranoid about pickpockets, it's great. On another personal note, switching to such a limited version keeps me from carrying cards I am unlikely to use, photographs and receipts."
4.0,Haven't had this watch for long but seems to be a great watch for the price
4.0,I can only wear this for a short amount of time. It’s very cute but it’s  very heavy for me.
4.0,"Based on the size chart, I ordered a medium and it fit well but felt just a little too big for my size. I think a small will fit my frame better. Very nice material, it’s soft and doesn’t feel cheap. I’m 5’0 and it’s the perfect length for a long summer dress on me. Will be returning for a smaller size!"
4.0,Love it. Arrived early.
4.0,Very nice and comfy shirt--looks EXACTLY as pictured. Ordered an XL and fits as expected. Only problem--the back closure button fell off before wearing it! : (
4.0,"Easy to wear studs... I have them in yellow gold and purchased them in white gold after some time.  Great, no frills staple in a size that is always appropriate for an adult woman... sweats or silks."
4.0,"I have purchased a few dresses and a skirt from Wellwits, fast, reliable shipping. Perfect dress for summer- cool fabric that is forgiving with wrinkles. Easy machine wash and hang dry, and it's really a cute pattern. One thing, that is minimal, the zipper tab broke off and I had to improvise. I have worn this cute dress a few times and look forward to wearing it all summer- Happy Summer!"
4.0,"I bought this for the MOTS7 concert &lt;/3 but it is a really good bag, I sometimes use it when going out with friends. Well made and sturdy enough to hold a lot of things."
4.0,"Got this for my daughter..a big WHO fan (as am I)<br />For this price, this is actually really nice quality. It has a beautiful silver tone to it, and is actually fairly heavy.<br />My daughter loves it, and so do I.<br />I would even get an extra one just to hang from the rearview mirror!"
4.0,"Very stretchy, not super see through.  I actually really lived this dress.  I was so close to keeping it, but the back didn't come down low enough to cover my bra. I'm a 32DDD do I can't go without, so I returned it."
4.0,"The belt was a gift for my husband and he was very happy to get it. He said he's been looking for a belt like this and didn't know where to find one and his name starts with M so it is even more appreciated. The belt itself is of good quality with a very nice embossed M on the buckle, I have no doubt that it will last for years."
4.0,"The fabric was so soft and light but not see through. It covered where I needed covering. It did not fit like a regular X-large. I usually wear a large in brands like Kim Rogers, so it runs small but the xl did fit. It had a nice loose fit around the stomach and hips. The design was great. Looking forward to wearing it at DW."
4.0,The watch is simple but elegant.  I didn't like the fact that the pin that closes the clasp on the band was out of place.  It was difficult being able to place it back into place.
4.0,Liked everything about this dress.
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised that this turned out to look as good as it does. The price was very cheap and usually get what you pay for....
4.0,I was sent the wrong size but it was actually a good fit I like it
4.0,"Vision wasn't the best.  They weren't uncomfortable.  However, they did leave marks on my forhead."
4.0,Not as big of a pendant as I expected! But it came with a beautiful cord and the pendant is so lovely! Definitely recommended and will buy another color soon!
4.0,Really nice style & good quality.  Four star because i was looking for something of a little lighter weight--no fault on the brand.
4.0,"This dress is really cute! I'm 5'3  and a size 16 and the style of this dress is very sexy. Nice for going out with that special someone. The only issue was the material is very thin, nice for summer, but if your worried about imperfections such as cellulite or rolls. This dress is not for you. This dress shows everything!"
4.0,"My boots just arrived and they are gorgeous!  The leather is beautiful.  I have a wide foot, so I ordered 1/2 size larger.  The fit is just right, allows for a sock too. The calf is very snug when zipped.  There is not much plush in the insole.  I will add one for comfort when wearing to work. I am happy with this purchase."
4.0,"This package came well protected in the box, and everything was just as pictured.  I really wanted this to work for my roaring 20's party and mainly purchased it for the hat.  I wasn't able to find another one that exact color.  Unfortunately it was waaaaay too small to work.  It would be great for a girl's party or if you have a very small head (size measured 57 on the inside of the hat).  Just didn't work, so I returned it.  Quick and easy."
4.0,Very good clip with beautiful design and look that works very well with USAF Uniforms. Too pricy for me to recommend or repurchase.
4.0,Makes the galaxy watch less masculine looking.  I wear it daily and I have no complaints.  Not sure about durability since I have only had it for a short time.
4.0,"I have not yet used the watch that just arrived, because I'm still using my current watch (the exact same model).  However, its band has half broken, and it won't be long before it breaks completely.  This seems to be the weak point of this watch: it has happened to the last three or four that I've bought.  And I've found no easy way to obtain and mount a new band.<br /><br />I never use the light, and never get the watch wet, so I can't comment on those features."
4.0,"The dress fits very well, but a bit see through in the back. Great stretch, nice velvet material"
4.0,Got these for $2 directly from China. For the price these stockings are a grest deal!
4.0,These earrings do have a hand made look. They are fish hook earrings and have a lot of beads. Nice looking. Make sure you remove them daily and wipe them down to keep them new looking.
4.0,"Great top for my summer office job. I am 5'7'' and 200 pounds. It was a bit longer than I expected (goes almost to my knees) so i find myself tucking it into my pants for business attire, I plan to wear it casually with leggings during the summer."
4.0,They are very comfortable and run a little small to size
4.0,Love this shirt. Good quality and fit as expected! I always get so many compliments when wearing this.
4.0,this skirt is nice but it run large can go one size down
4.0,"I ordered &quot;this&quot; product in gray a week before I ordered this one. I only ordered one so that I could be sure that I liked it before I ordered another. I really like the first one. However when I received this one it was different- materials, neckline and tightness of fit. This is a little loser and I preferred the tightness of the first. I'm am not happy that the company delivers different products. I may decide I like it later. Also, it was advertised as Prime but when I selected it the second time it wasn't handled as Prime. The final price of cost plus shipping was the same but it was not delivered in two or even three days.<br />UPDATE:<br />I have ordered 3 different sets of the underwear. The first was great. So,I ordered another in black. It was actually another vendor who took over the order. I didn't like their product. After working with Tesla, I was able to order the real product. It was like the first and fits snugly, gives me added warmth and is comfortable. I wash and dry it with other clothes and no damage done."
4.0,"These are some nice socks.  First I would like to say I was impressed with the quality once I got these socks. They are nice and thick and well made. They are not some &#34;cheaply made socks&#34; like I have purchased before.<br /><br />I wear a size 10-10.5  Mens shoe based on the fit of the shoe, so I ordered the large size sock which is said to fit 10.5 -12.<br /><br />This was my first experience experiencing compression socks, and all I can say is wow.  It made my feet feel like I was a little kid tucked snugly into bed.  There was good compression all the away around my foot.  I can see how this would be quite beneficial for supporting your foot and can help with swelling as the sock provides some gentle resistance against your foot.<br /><br />The material of the sock is good. Generally, I prefer cotton socks and am quite Leary of synthetic fibers, but I was surprised to find instead of a &#34;paper thin&#34; polyester sock, this was a quite thick, reinforced with cushions in all the right places.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend this to people looking for a compression ankle sock as it is probably one of the better quality compression socks out there.<br /><br />I was given the opportunity to purchase this sock at a discount so that I could try it out and share my opinions with you about it."
4.0,"used this for a few months. was a bit loose on the wrist and then one of the collars pulled out and now its just lying in a drawer waiting for me to have the time to fix it. in hindsight, i feel its a bit pricey"
4.0,"These are cute but up close look pretty cheap, almost like the “stone” is just a sticker (I think they are in fact painted on.) From afar, however, they can totally pass for designers and let’s be honest who really gets that close to inspect your earrings?! The color really pops and goes with so many of my outfits, giving them the perfect finishing touch."
4.0,"I do really like this bikini, I think it's very cute and simple. The top fit very well and is flattering, although be warned that it is extremely skimpy, so if you're wanting more coverage this probably isn't for you. The bottoms are very cute, but run a little bit small. I'm not even that well filled out in the rear end, but this was a bit small on me. The material is very soft and comfy, and dries very very fast. The cups do need some playing with to lay right, I'm not sure if this is just from how it was packed or not. The pads almost seem a little bit large in size for the bikini, but I did get them to sit right after some adjusting. The straps and rather stretchy, so if you're very well endowed on top, this won't provide very much support. But small to mid size it's great. I would recommend this.<br /><br />I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,They are gorgeous!  i am afraid that my daughter will pull them off so I have not put htme on her yet.
4.0,I bought it for my husband and I love it he loves it
4.0,A little small....no cord in hood
4.0,"not as clearly detailed as i had hoped, but overall a great jacket!! the sleeves were just a tiny bit short. i'm usually small so i ordered medium hoping it would be nice and loose, and it was, just wish the sleeves were longer."
4.0,"Got these for my son.  He won't wear them, because he says they don't fit right.  He says they don't cover the bottom of his chin.  Otherwise, they seem fine."
4.0,Nice price it's not over price and that's a good thing.
4.0,Great fit and comfy too
4.0,Would rather have a cotton top
4.0,"These house shoes are very comfortable and the price point was decent. My only complaints are that I wish they were wider and longer. They seem to run small. Also, they don't feel super cheap; but not the best quality either. But, again, the price was ok for what I received."
4.0,"Is perfect for a Harry Potter fan, but no matter how you tie the cord it stays a bit loose. Do not get this wet, as it's that thin leather/pleather stuff."
4.0,"Comfortable to wear, very easy to resize.<br /><br />After about 1 month of ownership, the paint is already starting to show signs of wear on the under side of my wrist."
4.0,"I really like the way this suit fits and it is very flattering. The top doesn't give much support though, so if you're looking for something that holds your girls in place well, this does not."
4.0,"It's nice, just a little small. Not too small to wear, however. I am a US size 18 and it does fit, but a little tight on the chest."
4.0,The hat is lovely but a little large!  Very well made.
4.0,These socks are very comfy and the material is very soft.  The socks wash and dry well in the machine.  I wear them around the house since we have hardwood floors.  They grip well and are definitely skid resistance.
4.0,Too big definitely buy a smaller size!
4.0,"It’s a little long, I’m about 5’2 and it was definitely down to the ground on me, had to wear wedges but overall pretty comfortable dress"
4.0,"Very pretty. Real silk. Unsure if it's real or synthetic zari, but the look of the saree is very rich."
4.0,"First the positives!<br /><br />These Ocean Blues leggings are adorable. The little 'ruffle' at the bottom is a cute detail that gives me something different to wear for my workouts.<br /><br />The blue is quite pretty.<br /><br />The fit and color is just as it is in the Amazon image--I have a small and I'm 5'2"" about 117 and fit. These are tight so if you don't like a tight fit, you may not like these.<br /><br />They almost feel like compression leggings, but they are comfortable. I wore them all day after a long walk then on some errands and they felt great.<br /><br />--except....<br /><br />I have one negative. It's a pet peeve of mine that when you have a wide waistband and then have a skinny piece of elastic inside it at the top--why? Whhhyyyyyy? It ruins the whole idea of a wide waistband! While it's not really that uncomfortable, the leggings would have been much better and more comfy without the skinny elastic. Stop doing that legging manufacturers!<br /><br />If not for that skinny elastic, I'd have given these 5 stars."
4.0,"Great service and shipping. These are very cute, but they do not stay on. I lost one the first day I wore it and found the other one in my hair. I will use a cylindrical earring back from now on with the other pair I have left."
4.0,I’m 5’1 1/2 and 197 bls I got a XXL<br />The dress is just below the knee on me. It’s dry clean only according to label (which is unfortunate) The sleeves are too long for me. The collar GIRL THE COLLAR IS STUNNING. The skirt has a natural flare no petit coat needed. The top is soft but not too soft.
4.0,I should have ordered a larger size because of my hips. It's a great garment and is durable. It's lightweight but has a quality weight from the sequins. Great buy. I'm pairing the tunic with all black.
4.0,"Fit was a little off. Arms were too tight, yet body was shapeless and baggy. The longer length is nice to pair with leggings. Fabric is silky soft and should hold up well in the washer."
4.0,"I love the feel of them & the color but I had to get 2 sizes larger than expected, and they are still a little tight"
4.0,"Good quality shirt, stretched, fit as expected."
4.0,These are fairly well made for the price. They feel normal width and fairly comfortable but a bit too firm. I wish they didn't shave the top edge all the way around and I find your balance feels like your leaning a little forward. The balance issue will probably correct itself once worn in. I like how they won't slip as much as others I've had when getting wet. The toe strap is a little uncomfortable on one side.<br />UPDATE: After 4 months heel portion is now only about a quarter inch thick due to wear and permanent squished down state.<br />UPDATE: Completely worn out after 10 months.
4.0,"Not bad, but having trouble zipping them all of the way up, even with the XXL. Other than that, they're really helping."
4.0,Fit is loose color is nice(grey) price is so good should get another color.
4.0,Really loved the style of this but was just a little to big for a large. Also the color seemed to be way off. Would but again a size smaller and different pattern. Material was great
4.0,"These are not as comfortable as the foldable, earless glasses that I have previously used but in the week that I have been using them seem to be a whole lot sturdier and have no pieces that will break."
4.0,It's cute. Wanted it to hang like the pics. Should have gotten a bigger size or loose weight lol
4.0,I really like this clutch. A little pricey
4.0,The Disney Store didn’t let me in with this mask because of the vent. But I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to breathe without the vent.<br /><br />🤷🏻‍♀️
4.0,"I don't even have a year using it and the left upper button doesn't work, the light doesn't work either. But besides that is a great watch, very comfy and the other features work really well!"
4.0,Nice socks (I really like the other styles) but these seem to have baggy toes.
4.0,"Son really liked them but a little hard to get on.  My son has narrow feet and had some trouble sliding into them.  Liked them overall, however."
4.0,"I like this dress.  I ordered one size up, and it fit perfectly."
4.0,Not the real thing. It's an attachment to your explorer frame and not a Google design frame for Glass.
4.0,"The bands are very soft and pretty, but the flowers are bigger than I expected them to be."
4.0,bought these for my husband. He wears them every day and loves them
4.0,They look nice and are strong but it was a little hard for me at first to pinch it closed. Totally worth it if you wanna have a piercing without putting another hole in you.
4.0,"I thought it was going to be a little bit thicker material, judging by the picture, but I live in Arizona so I was happy that it ended up being a semi- thin material.  The picture makes it look like a burnt orange but it is actually closer to a true crayon Orange.  Overall I am satisfied with the product and I have worn it once; receiving numerous compliments.  I am 5 foot 1 and the length was perfect for me."
4.0,Fit great. Felt great - fabric is soft and stretchy. I loved the lace edging at the sleeves and bottom. Just felt a little too covered up with the high neck and long sleeves.
4.0,"Very comfortable, not made of linen. Looks great!"
4.0,"These are great for the price, however they scratch super easy. Don't take them out of your car if you are using them for transit, or you'll probably scratch them."
4.0,Comfy like a thick t-shirt but not particularly warm. Comfy for a night in.
4.0,"Material a little thin,  can see through the blouse"
4.0,Fit and color matches shown product
4.0,Other reviews were true:  large band was small.  Although I could get it on with lotion. It was also heavier than it looked.
4.0,Wife-<br />Wore ok.  Feel like they may stretch out.  Time will tell
4.0,The back has a pretty big slit so that you can cut cover your neck which is nice. The paint job is pretty good doesn't look as great as the picture but still looks pretty realistic and has done the job a few times already when it comes to scaring people. The eye holes are not very big so you have to squint a little but other than that it's a great product
4.0,This is actually a good watch to wear for almost all occasions dress and work.
4.0,"These leggings are great! Very comfortable and stylish.  I don't usually like print patterns, but this is subtle."
4.0,"They sent a different color; it's bright and happy.  The fabric is extremely soft, the flowy top of dress hides my pot belly be and the bottom of dress has slight elastic to hug legs slightly.  I'm 5'2"" and length of dress is better for me... It's been slightly shorter which I like."
4.0,Nothing to dislike about this. Comfortable to wear and seems to be holding up so far.
4.0,Love it however the beaded chain didn’t come with an eye on the wood piece sadly.
4.0,good little one-season sandals for the price!
4.0,"This is a cute, decent quality and funny shirt for the Harry potter fan. It fits well, it is a little on the croppish side. I got the tie-dyed to make it a little more fun. My 9 yr old wants this shirt badly and we are on the hunt for one for her."
4.0,I am 130 lbs 5'2 and it fits roomy. I bought a size small.  Its really long A little lower than the calf but not down to the ankle. Its very comfortable and packs well in suitcase because it doesnt wrinkle
4.0,"The part fit in perfectly, and appears to be identical to the factory part. No instructions were included."
4.0,This is the cutest suit however mine came with an unfinished stitch at the bottom of my right leg ....glad I can sew
4.0,The caps are nicely made but more of a silk material which moves around a bit on your head.  They are too big for my head but tie in the back but this makes the buttons too far back for my mask loops. Still they work for what I needed
4.0,Love how dark the black sunglasses are! My eyes are so sensitive and it really blocks out most of the sunlight.  The pink ones are so cute too!
4.0,"A little large for me-- but otherwise, gorgeous.  I'd like them better if they were half the size, moe understated would look more expensive.<br /><br />I got two pairs because I tend to &#34;lose an earring&#34; too often and the price is good."
4.0,"I ordered an 8, but probably could've done a 6 with the corset style backing. I worried about it running small, but it fit true to size I believe. I am 5'6"" & 140 lbs if that helps anybody else with their sizing. I just need to have a few inches taken off the bottom. My dress was expected to arrive in 4 to 6 weeks time, but it only took 9 days! Very happy with the dress in general. Color is also exactly what I expected.<br />I put 4 stars because my sash (for the corset) has a raw edge that I will have to fix, otherwise it is perfect for the occasion."
4.0,"It's lined which I didnt expect, very nice, soft and warm."
4.0,"All belts were nice but didn't receive the correct size in pink one. Was sent medium instead of extra large as ordered. Since belts were very inexpensive, will reorder and give wrong sized one to someone who can wear it. Have ordered and received all others as requested. Price is very good and quality is excellent. These are real leather at very affordable prices so can't complain too much over one small error that isn't worth the time and effort to rectify. Otherwise would give five stars."
4.0,"Socks are on the thin side, but the length is just right."
4.0,"My son is 6'3"" with a regular but not husky build.  Gloves present a problem as his fingers are long.  I tried a 2X in hopes the fingers pushing up would use the extra width in the hand to fit the digits - seems to work.  I didn't buy real Talls as the loss rate doesn't yet justify cost (usage walks, shoveling)."
4.0,"No hassle installation, easy on or off as need be.  Definitely worth it if you have a smart watch and that stupid uncomfortable bands."
4.0,"I bought these in size large (i am a size 8 jean), and they are slightly big. Not sure I'd want to go down to medium though. They are very comfortable. I would give five stars, but two pairs had torn seams that i needed to sew. Very soft fabric though."
4.0,Does what it says but the toe post was coming unglued. Other than that it’s a good slipper
4.0,The body fit perfect but the straps were a bit big. Otherwise the dress is great.
4.0,I like it in that it is figure flattering but it does tend to run on the large size.
4.0,We bought these for our grandchild we are not positive of the fit yet because she will not get them til we go over there. They all looked as nice as they did in the picture when ordering. My wife said the fit will be a little bigger.<br />But that is the way she ordered cuz they grow so fast
4.0,"Super cute and easy to pair with crop tops my only issue with it is it looked like it had a little bit of stretch or give to the waist and it does not so, order a size up from your normal size in my opinion"
4.0,This is super cute!! Sometimes my toe gets pinched by the opening but it's not irritating at all. Super cute for the price!
4.0,"I love to top half but the bikini bottoms were not full enough across the seat for my preference me. For my age, I PREFER a fuller bikini bottom. The medium size fits a women's size 8/10 as expected."
4.0,"My granddaughter says it's very, very warm.  She loves the design."
4.0,Nice product.  Speedy delivery.
4.0,"Love the look of these on and they give the appearance of being more expensive then they really were.  However, I do not like the clasp to much and I doubt they will stand up to lasing a long time, especially because I wear them<br /><br />I love the looks of these hoops and wear them often.  However, I feel that the clasp is very fragilel and will probably not last long, but hopefully I will be wrong. The price was right so I can't expect to much."
4.0,"Very cute dress. Only thing I did not like is that the arm sleeves rub against my arms a tad too close. Still wearable. Got a size M , 5'5&#34; 165lbs , not busty for reference . Fits well and not too tight."
4.0,I ordered a medium and it's a bit tight. I'm 5'9&#34; 145lbs
4.0,"cute but fabric isn’t very soft. Similar fabric you’d get from a boutique, cut but stiff."
4.0,"I wanted to use it for a time, so I could give you an honest and complete review.<br />So far for the most part I like the bag, it is a little small for my liking for daily use. The thing I think I dislike most is the straps, the bag itself is made well but the straps are almost plastic and it seems a shame to use them on an overall nice bag, also I have long hair and the clasps for the straps get tangled up in my hair and it is painful. Also when unboxing the bag the straps were completely wrapped up in plastic, already installed on the bag, and it was hard to get the plastic out.<br />Now for the good news, the good news is that the main body of the bag I like very much so far, it is nice quality leather and the compartments are nice.<br />My main fix for the things I do not like is I will be buying new leather straps for the bag."
4.0,Fits and looks great would buy again.
4.0,"It's smaller than I thought. It's also kind of thin, but still works well"
4.0,Perfect!  A little baggy in the fingers but otherwise great
4.0,"Great product! However, the size runs small."
4.0,"Tight in the biceps, but it's cut for a slimmer individual. Still great elsewhere."
4.0,The earrings are beautiful.  Just a little longer than expected so will  try to remove a small section on my own.
4.0,I was surprised on how much I like this top. It is made of a stretchy material that is not too thin. It mostly does a good job of staying in place with the exception of white trim flipping up but that is easily fixed with a safety pin. This top accentuates my chest and shoulder area while not poofing out at the stomach so it is definately a win.
4.0,"I love this! All the positive reviews were right! Exactly why I read all the reviews before I purchase anything. So yes it is VERY soft. The fabric is grown and cultivated by humans...And it is a fungus, not a regular plant. We are more closely related to Fungus than other mammals...well I saw that On National Geographic. Any ways enough about science. It fit perfectly. It is loose where is should be loose. And tight were it should be tight. and it hangs off of the curves very nicely. I was afraid that it wouldn't cling to the good and bad right. But it has. I was also worried about the shoulders and the lack of arms...But it actually came out looking better and its way better when u are hot in the sun...with all the black! The belt isn't an actual belt I was pleasantly surprised. It looks like a belt but it is just another kind of fake leather and studs. I look HOT! Like sexy! The shirt is a Little bit to short for me...just because i have a big butt. BUT I don't think any one will complain...well my boyfriend didn't! So i will have to wear something like leggings or really short shorts...Like probably black Brief Underwear...or boy shorts...U know the really short shorts...men's undies...any ways i think that would be OK....well where i plan on wearing it...there is a lot of skin showing so i may just wear it will some undies and say hell with it. I Understand why it was so expensive now....Because it is actually a very nice outfit!"
4.0,"This bag gets 5 stare for being the perfect small size with multiple compartments.  Wallet, phone, sunglasses and whatever little things you need would fit perfectly.  UNFORTUNATELY the jingle of the zipper was so annoying to me I had to send it back.  I’m sad about it."
4.0,Looks great but it is a bit snug on the chest
4.0,It's super cute! Fit great! Love how the hands go up when you squeeze the button. Only thing is that it's too hard to squeeze. My kid can't hardly squeeze it himself. Lol.
4.0,"I absolutely love the bottoms, they fit perfectly and the waist isn't too tight and goes right above my belly button, its a little tight on my butt at the bottom, but it's alright. My boyfriend thinks it's very sexy bathing suit perfect for vacation.<br /><br />The top however is not supportive. I got the 1xl and I wear a size 38 C, it's not too big or small just isn't a supportive hugging material that you would want while swimming and playing in water. I will probably find a different top to go with the bottoms."
4.0,"This dress is adorable just know you need to size down at least one size. I'm 5'2, size 14/XL, sometimes XXL, large chested (DDD) and I got a large. Hoping it shrinks a bit because I'm almost wondering if I should have gotten a medium.<br /><br />Came back to add that it did shrink and fits great now but if it were a hair shorter in the front it would be too short. It shrunk a lot so if you're taller I'd be careful about that."
4.0,"I think these shoes are so cute, they have a bunny face and ears on the back of the shoe. However, my girls hated these from the moment they saw them. They could give me no real reason why. Had to return these; not a battle I'm willing to have."
4.0,These gloves are great. I used them in the middle of winter in romania. I was outside doing most of my work but my hands stayed warm. My only complaint is they are a bit thick so it’s hard to grab small things. Other than that these gloves are amazing.
4.0,Fiting 7/10<br />Quality 9/10
4.0,"I really like this top, I could of had it just a little bit bigger. But all and all I love it"
4.0,I'm 5'6 170lbs I usually wear a large I ordered a medium based off of other reviews and it fits nicely the only issue is it rides up so be careful with that
4.0,Funny.  Produce more of these types of movie/TV references.  The only other one I saw was Binford.
4.0,"I love this style of nightgown and you don't see this style very often anymore. It's just enough to keep you warm and not ride up all night as you sleep. It has pockets, which is great. It also has a v-neck and high slits to the thighs that make it seem a little less matronly. I ordered in mint green and it was pretty. The fabric is standard cotton - not incredibly soft on first wear, but might improve over time with a few washings. The main issue is the odd cut of this nightgown. The cut in the front is actually very flattering in the way it falls; however, the back of the garment has a strange pleating in the middle of the back that isn't flattering. It causes the fabric to gape and gather in weird places and it really isn't necessary. I ordered my standard size and it fit as expected; however, if I'd sized up for a more roomy nightgown it probably would have hanged better in the back. Overall, though, nobody really sees the back of my nightgown other than my bed, so this really shouldn't be a deal breaker as much as just a strange design feature. Otherwise, I really like this nightgown and expect it to be in my nighttime rotation regularly."
4.0,I like that its velcro fastened and I can make it as loose or tight as I want. Also with the other band that came with my Fitbit my arm broke out.
4.0,Sneakers look great! Red color looks awesome! My son loved them when they came! I look forward to getting him another pair.
4.0,I love these dresses for the comfort and they can easily be dressed up from casual to dressy
4.0,"Fits nice but is pretty sheer. You will need something under it. I'm 5'5"", 155lbs, I got a large & it fit great."
4.0,Sapphires look real!  I think its a great choice for those that don't want to spend a lot of money.
4.0,"Belt seems sturdy without being too stiff. So far I really like it. This one has a thin layer of leather stitched onto a stiff layer of webbing. It looks good, but I’ll have to see how it holds up over time. The edc buckle is great and easy to use, but the fitting instructions are conflicting: the print on the box says cut at 2” longer than your pant size where the instructions inside the box say cut at 4” longer than pant size. I chose to go with 2” longer and it turned out perfect. If this holds up well, I’ll probably get the brown version too."
4.0,"I'm a woman with extra long fingers. So I had to buy men's gloves so they'd fit. I just got them yesterday and wore them this morning. They kept my hands warm and they fit. The thumbs are just a bit too long. But other than that, they're great. I'd say they are just about perfect."
4.0,Suit was perfect except I have boobs and there is no support.  So I'll probably never wear it.
4.0,Good inexpensive bag
4.0,Arms fit a little tight.  Overall very cute!
4.0,"Great dress, good material.  Just a tad shorter than describe, but still a good fit!"
4.0,I have not used it long. Just received it. It looks ok. nothing seriously unexpected. People say little heavy. yes but not that much. two compartment design has extra padding in between them and it results in volume loss. But it should organize laptop+folders and food and some minimal clothing (rainjacket etc) separately fine. Will update my review after use. The fraying issues are the most worrying to me. Will let you know.
4.0,"The YUGSOUL High Waist Yoga Pants, Workout Leggings for Women with Pockets, 7/8 Squat Proof Tummy Control Leggings are decent quality. They are not see through and they stay up all day with little adjusting needed. The pockets are good for your phone. I don’t think they had much more tummy control than any other leggings I have. They washed and dried nicely. They are a nice product for the low price."
4.0,Good deal for the price .
4.0,"cute, seems sturdy, but the &#34;volleyball&#34; in the center looks like a cutout that was glued in."
4.0,Fit nice and warm.
4.0,"I wore this American flag infinity scarf yesterday for the Fourth of July and it made a perfect accessory.<br />The fabric is very thin and airy sort of like a cheesecloth. It is very wide so it can be wrapped around your neck twice and look very nice. When laid flat the scarf measures 36 inches wide and 35 inches long.<br />Upon opening the package I was a little bit surprised because the colors are not what I thought they would be. The white is not white it is more of a cream color and the other colors look distressed as well. Personally, I like this sort of vintage look better than bright colors with white stripes but this is definitely something you should know if you're considering ordering. Also, it does not appear that the seams are so evenly or straight. Since it is an infinity scarf, it is meant to be wrapped around you so you probably wouldn't notice but again, something to be aware of.<br />I got several compliments on this infinity scarf and it makes the perfect accessory for when you need that extra bit of patriotism. I love that it's not too thick and it was not too hot to wear in July."
4.0,"ITS VERY NICE, THE ONLY REASON WHY I DONT GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT MORE TRANSPARENT BUT ASIDE FROM THAT ITS GREAT!!!! I GAVE IT TO MY MOM BECAUSE IT WASN'T SEE THROUGH ENOUGH AND SHE LOVES IT. IF YOU WANT A COVER UP THAT REALLY COVERS YOU UP THIS IS GREAT. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. THE LENGTH OF THE SLEEVES ARE PERFECT AND ALSO THE LENGTH OF THE COVER UP, IM 5'4 AND IT REACHES MY ANKLES."
4.0,"What can I say? Its the blue replica. Plastic stones and polyurethane strap. It is what it is in the $300 range.  First things for improvements is re-leather the strap,  swap out the thin side bars for thicker wider set and you have a decent replica.  The ultimate would be re-stone with cubic zirconia."
4.0,"I love a good lightweight dress and this dress didn't disappoint. The pattern is beautiful and the dress is well made. For the most part the fit is good, it's a little small across the chest but I think it's the size of the chest vs the dress. I also think because of that the elastic band does sit in a bit of an odd spot but it's not so bad that I would stop wearing the dress. I would recommend line drying the dress or no heat on the dryer, I think it did maybe shrink just a tad when I dried it on delicate setting. I would buy this dress again, maybe trying a size up."
4.0,"This is really cute, but when it arrived, it had a little smell to it.  I hand washed it & hung it up to dry & noticed that it shrank.  Not a huge amount, but noticeable.  It is a 1 size fits all, so if you are a tiny person, it shouldn't be an issue, but for a 6' tall woman, I don't need things to be any shorter than they already are."
4.0,Fits well slightly different than the black one j bought this the reason I bought blue one.  I still like it just a tad more slim
4.0,"This is a great watch,  the band is too thin and not flexible enough for me"
4.0,"Not too bad. Kinda thin and obviously cheap material. Probably not going to last much longer. Bummer, it's freezing here."
4.0,Still getting used to them
4.0,"Well made. Only order one size up, people said to order 2 sizes up and that's was way too much for me. I returned only because of the size and got a size smaller."
4.0,Fit my wife's bundle of hair quite nicely. Kept her warm and dry
4.0,muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a
4.0,"I bought this for my son. It looks great but it is a little hard to keep on his head. The ribbon that it is tied with is nice, I wish it had elastic."
4.0,They're comfortable and made of great denim quality. I wore sneakers and a t-shirt for a very cute look 😍
4.0,"Runs VERY small. Bought it for my husband. My five year old grand daughter loves it.  See photo. Super nice hat, but I would need about a 3X for it to fit an adult head."
4.0,Love this dress used it for my belle Halloween costume.. it was a little loose at the top .
4.0,"Why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? It's not them, it's me. The top is just short enough that a little of my belly shows. It is super cute. Super comfy. True to size. I just don't like my belly showing as I am a plus size girl. Trying to get better about that.<br />Very well constructed and great fabric. Bottoms are full coverage."
4.0,"I also have this headband in black, and while there are minor differences they are pretty much the same. My review for both say the same thing. This headband is pretty, artsy, and charming. It has a sturdy metal band inside a detailed and durable feeling decorative shell. The turquoise  satin material has a variety of green, blue, and turquoise embellishments  (beads, rhinestones, sequins) laid out in a rather non descript pattern. The underside is a coordinating turquoise cotton canvas material. Well stitched, everything well attached.<br /><br />""turban"" style. I like that the top of the head band has pinched material then flares out to the beaded area. Basically what I see when I have purchased head bands labeled as ""turban"". Look for the knot or pinch at upper center.<br /><br /> It makes for a nice piece of flair for the hair. I have long, medium thick, wavy hair and usually need teeth on a head band for it to be effective. This does hold my hair back, though from preference I would rather have the teeth to help anchor it. and to allow my hair to poof behind it. As for adding it in when I wear my hair up in a sloppy bun? Super cute.<br /><br />I think this is appropriate for any age, any style, and overall for any hair- this last part is more on your preference. I see it as jewelry for the hair. As with any headband, the fit will vary. The sturdy metal headband may create pressure over time, or it could be too loose. I have a large head, and am more apt to meet headbands that feel too small. This fits, but I can feel the pressure. I usually wear stuff like this for short periods of time- I like it enough to want to wear it and recommend it.<br /><br />I also have this in black, which I think is pretty, but much more subtle against my dark hair. This turquoise color makes for better contrast.  I like the jewels/beads design better on this black one. Slightly more classy, where as this  turquoise one has a slightly more casual boho vibe to it. I like both equally. I'll include a few pics.<br /><br />I think these would make fine gifts if you know someone who likes stuff such as this. The quality and overall look makes it worthy.<br />Black headband: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08B3NQTKY"
4.0,"I love it but, I should have ordered an X-large as it fits a little small. but, it's so pretty and I like the fabric lot. Nice for Summer to keep cool!"
4.0,I love this outfit but I did have to alter the top it was a little too big but the skirt fit just right.
4.0,The length is a bit shorter than I wanted. I’m 5’7 and it hits around my ankles.
4.0,Quality and fit just great...
4.0,"I bought this for an Electric Run and it worked great.  It is as pictured.  The unit that houses the batteries is a black box on the top so if you have light colored hair, it shows.  I made a colorful bow that I attached to the top to cover it up but even if you don't cover it, it's fine.  The batteries that came with it lasted the entire night.  I would definitely recommend it."
4.0,"Can't beat these little gloves--and I do mean little, they are designed to cover just half the palm. Saw them on Sex and The City, so thought I'd pretend to be a NYC fashionista. They're pretty comfortable right off the bat, and I suspect they may stretch a bit and mold to the shape of my hand with time. Happy with purchase!"
4.0,Wish it came in a larger size.  Nice pair of earrings.
4.0,"Very pretty, but I don't care for the way the ends curl upwards instead of laying flush against finger.<br />It does sparkle nicely."
4.0,I liked that the band was adjustable. But I wish the closure was adjustable as well. I needed to remove links which was easy to do on my own with tool provided. One link made band a little loose but two links out made it pretty snug leaving imprint on my wrist of the back of the watch. If the closure had the extra adjustment available that would be the ticket. But over all it's nice for dressing up a fitness watch but it being plastic and the still loose fit I don't think it will be my everyday band.
4.0,"I like these socks, but I thought I was getting one of each color.  Instead, I didn't get one of the colors I wanted and did get 2 of the color I least like.  And it costs $3.49 to return.  Didn't realize that."
4.0,"The quality is good and my daughter loves that the liner can be worn as a lighter jacket. I think we may get a lot of use out of this jacket as a rain jacket, a fleece and a winter coat. I will say though that this fits really tight. I would buy up in size."
4.0,"Love the pattern & fabric, shorter than I thought and I hope it won't shrink much with washing.  guess cold wash and hang  dry would be the key."
4.0,I didn't know the earrings were not square gems . They are just flat and they are not gems. They almost look like a heavy plastic coating with color. Pictures were deceiving.
4.0,"nice printing, very clear. bought it one size bigger and it's still tight in the chest"
4.0,"This is a very nice watch box! The fit and finish of the box is great, everything lines up and has a nice feel to it and looks great. The only ding I’m going to give it is that the pillows I guess you call them don’t fit snug enough to hold the watches in place, so they do tumble around a bit. It might be just mine, but they just needed to be just a smudge wider that’s all. I am happy with it and do recommend it, it does fit the different styles of watches that I have."
4.0,"The glasses are very cool looking, but I had to take them to an eye glass shop to have the arms adjusted as they were too big.  It seems like the weight of the lens are too heavy for the wireframe. We will see how the wireframe and the reflector lasts."
4.0,"The dress looked nice, but the material was odd. It felt like something that would be used for athletic pants. I ended up returning it.<br /><br />I am 5’5” and the small fit well, hitting just below the knee."
4.0,Beautiful necklace!  Received many compliments.  Very unique piece of jewelry.  The only thing that I would change would be the chain other than that I am very happy with my purchase!
4.0,I like that its a nice yellow
4.0,Standard quality shirt with the logo being well printed and looks good. Have not washed it yet so cannot say anything about the shrinkage or color change.
4.0,Beautiful dress! It was a bit long for me but I had it hemmed and it’s perfect. It’s snug in the waist but perfect in the chest.
4.0,The dress will be perfect for the occasion i purchased it for. The zipper struggles to pass where the sash attached. I like the way the fabric drapes
4.0,"This is super cute, and very flattering on! The material is a little thin which is why I am giving it 4 stars. But this is a great purchase for the price!<br />I am 5'7 145lbs and I ordered a M."
4.0,I wish these socks had less top. For me they are hard to get on without assistance. Otherwise I do like Wigwam socks.
4.0,The puffs are a good size and true to color but I don't like the white elastic band used to hold the keychain part. Other than that they are perfect!
4.0,Thus dress fits me everywhere except the fact its so short my rear isn't covered. Idk how it fits everyone else but I'm not considered tall or dont have long legs at all.
4.0,"I'm a but curve but it fits pretty well. I'm 5'6 and 214lbs and it fits, riffles and sewing are fantastic!"
4.0,"Just arrived, pretty nice watch for the price. A few notes:<br />-The tourbillon is purely decorative. That's stated in the description but worth mentioning.<br />-The band is a bit thin for my tastes. I was going to replace it anyway for color reasons.<br />-The specs say 2cm for the band. I say not so: I tried a 22mm band and it was a tad small fitting; probably more like a 24mm I'm thinking.<br />-Maybe my perception is unusual as my former watch was very heavy but this watch seems very light weight. Nothing wrong with that, some will probably prefer the feel.<br />I'm not expecting miraculous longevity considering how much it cost but I'm pretty satisfied."
4.0,Fabrich is thin but light
4.0,Travel on airplane
4.0,They look a little different than photos. Still cute and comfy
4.0,You get what you pay for. The quality is not terrible but then gems/pearls or not secured on there very well. But for 20$ it’s worth it great size and looks good. Works for pictures.
4.0,"The skirt is somewhat small. The fabric is very nice, and the pockets are handy. This skirt definitely gives the retro look if that's what you're going for. The skirt comes in a package and is wrinkled when you open it. 4 stars for the look. 3 stars for somewhat small and wrinkles."
4.0,"My son thinks these 'SKYWAY Aviator Polarized Oversized Sunglasses for Men Metal Frame' are really cool, but what do kids know, right? The lenses are polarized and that makes them more effective at blocking glare, but the metal frames are kinda soft like pot metal and will undoubtedly bend or break quite easily. The style doesn't quite ""do it"" for me, but my boy wears them with joy."
4.0,"Love the color, but definitely prone to cameltoe if thats something that bothers you -- good with oversized / long tshirts"
4.0,My son loves these. They are a bit snug though.
4.0,Wish the underlay was a bit longer
4.0,Love all the pieces that came in this I just wish that the info on it explained thren
4.0,"Love em for riding but they are a little thinner that the original.<br />For the price, you cant beat it."
4.0,"Sigue siendo el mismo diseño práctico y resistente de siempre, pero elegí la opción negro y lo que recibí es un color plomo humo."
4.0,Bowling shirts
4.0,"Had to send back, she couldn't walk in them:)"
4.0,"Loved this dress for my bridal shower! I ordered in white. I’m 5’5 and 125lbs and ordered a small. Only downfall was it is see through, with a nude slip underneath it was perfect!"
4.0,Looks great just but could use better material.
4.0,"Pretty emerald green but, the sleeves were 3/4 quarter and not full sleeve as pictured. Also runs a little on the small side."
4.0,I absolutely love my bracelets I gave everyone in my family one. They tend to unravel at the end but a quick fix by burning the knot will keep the bead from falling off. I will be ordering more soon.
4.0,Fits description and works well.
4.0,"It looked nice, did not understand what the emblem was. had thread on my sons head as he wore for the first time. overall, nice product."
4.0,overall these are good eye covers. the light does shine through a bit on the bottom at the nose.  the problem I have are the elastic bands are cheap feeling and they are a little sharp. one actually cut my ear similar to a paper cut so be careful when adjusting while wearing. I still use them every night though.
4.0,Very nice and practical.nice
4.0,runs small. they don't fit my grandson. I ordered 32x30. They are nice material. good price but Now I have to find someone to give them to. We have to were uniforms in La. So these are good for that
4.0,Very pretty skirt got loads of compliments. Can be worn with a t shirt and sandal for a more laid back vibe or dressed up in heels
4.0,Works well but doesn’t hold power long .
4.0,"Can't beat Russell quality in construction and comfort.  I compared my new large Russell crew with a favorite vintage Russell crew and was satisfied that the size is almost identical. I did notice the recent Russell is cut slightly different in the shoulders allowing more room to move around in. I would say the newer Russell has a fuller cut.  Inch for inch, both crews are almost identical in size.  I highly recommend the Russell brand and would not hesitate to purchase another.  They makes great gifts."
4.0,Love!!! Perfect for every Halloween and literally everyone thought it was adorable. The eyes were at about stomach length so I pinned the top but the green thing covered it!
4.0,This dress is cute and is also short and has an elastized waist. The sleeves are bell and the neck has a keyhole that is tied to bring the V neck together. This is a very sweet dress and can be dressed up for special occasions or worn with flats for a more casual look.
4.0,Cool novelty item.  Fit well.
4.0,This shirt has great graphics and the material is Really soft. Kind of like Bella canvas. My only gripes are that the shirt just isn’t as loose as I wanted. It’s actually kind of snug for a large. I wanted this to fit kind of like the comfort color tanks. It’s also somewhat tight up under my armpits. It’s still cute I just wish it was a lot looser. I usually get larges but I should’ve gotten this in a 2x
4.0,"I'm 5'9, and ~165 lbs. A medium fit me very well. Besides that, the actual costume itself looks great! It would've been nice if it came with something to hold the hood above your face, but oh well. I highly recommend this outfit for anyone trying to be an evil wizard for halloween."
4.0,"Exactly  what you see in the picture. I ordered small. I am 32 chest, and 29 waist. Material is soft and comfortable."
4.0,It arrived as advertised. A leather cord and silver necklace were included. The owners sent me a nice email about the properties of the stone and how to cleanse it before wearing. I did not know about that so it was good information. I am enjoying wearing it.
4.0,These are very good. I read the comments and noticed a lot of too small remarks so I ordered the next size and am glad I did. I wear 8 or 8 1/2 and the Lg/Xlg were a little difficult to get on but made a big difference and much better for my shin ache due to arthritis than the hospital compression socks. Only gave it 4 stars because of the size discrepancy. Would order again.
4.0,"Purchased last minute for a formal night on a cruise. It fit exactly as expected, packed well (no wrinkles) and looked great."
4.0,Cute choker but needed an extender as it was very short.
4.0,Light weight yet sturdy to carry many items. Haven’t washed yet so not sure how they will hold up after washing.
4.0,I didn't realize it was hard plastic until I opened the package.... the ribbons were attached securely and the cutout designs were crisp and clean...  its not as flexible as we thought
4.0,"Initial review, waiting on replacement watch, so I have not been able to put this into use yet.  Appears to be well stitched, thick leather, decent casting on the metal with nice finish on the buckle.  Received a extra pins, Apple Tubes - so this should be easy to use on any watch.  The Length is true to description, which is great for me, I have big wrists, and this really limits the watch bands I can buy.<br /><br />Band came in a presentation box, nothing special here, but at least something to wrap if you were giving as a gift.  I did not require any communication, but instructions were included (simple, but adequate).<br /><br />I typically give 4 stars for very good, easy to recommend items, reserving 5 stars for those truly outspending products (a rating scale should have somewhere to rise to, shouldn't it?).  Initial examination says easy buy, easy recommendation, especially for the money.  When my replacement watch shows up later this month, I will update this, if performance warrants a revised opinion."
4.0,"My daughter loves it,  she put it on right away ! I really liked it to."
4.0,These are a great price. I love them.<br />The only complaint I have is that the shipping time is standard. I wish they were Amazon Prime shipping.
4.0,The only reason I gave a rating of 4 is because it is a buckle back and it does not make it tight enough (actually it didn't work at all).  Otherwise I love the cap. Was looking for a pink cap & this  Looks good and supports my team.
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter she loves the feel of the material, it's great for summer and she can throw a cardigan on for church she claims it's very functional"
4.0,Smaller than I thought. Guess I need to read fine print.
4.0,"Arrived dusty, beautiful, with minor stain flaws. Great boot for the price."
4.0,Cute but they seem a little thin. They were for our raging teenager's birthday and she seemed to feign interest so maybe they are okay. I haven't seen them on her fingers because she has a metric butt ton of these stick on things so I can't tell you what they look like on.
4.0,"I like the design of this shirt and that company donates＄0.10 to OutRight Action International for each shirt sold. I love that! This shirt is stiff, even after laundering. It was more fitted than I like for a shirt, so you may want to order up a size. It seems well made and the t-shirt material is thick."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and the fabric is good quality for the price. I am 5’6, 127lbs- I ordered the small and it was to big, I’m returning it. If you are lucky enough to have it fit properly... it’s a beautiful dress."
4.0,"Only negative thing I can say is that they are not left and right socks.  So rather than them being on the outside of both socks they will both be on the left side of your ankle.  But other wise I like them, they are think and comfortable."
4.0,"Super cute, but they run small. Will be returning and purchasing the next size up because I still love them!"
4.0,"Cute dress, decently made, great price."
4.0,"I bought the red one. Color is gorgeous, it is snug (I love it), but if you want looser fit buy the larger size. I gave it four stars because I don't like the feel of it so much (feels too synthetic). I have wool-casmire sweaters  from the same brand that I love, for similar price. I wish they make this model with natural threads."
4.0,"This dress was great for the value. I wore it took work. It has a professional appearance and fit as expected. The only downfall is the material is very spandex so it did fit a little tighter than what I’m used to for my preference of work dresses, however if you don’t mind something hugging you a little bit (not too tight if you get the correct size) this is a good fit. I haven’t tried the dress on since I washed it, so I’m not sure if it shrunk"
4.0,"I can't wait to wear this for summer! Very flattering and forgiving cut, and the print on the dress is so pretty. The dress also has a built in slip so it's not too sheer and has adjustable length straps. The slip is a stretchy, thin material, but the overlay dress does not stretch at all. The bust is not generously cut and at a 40C the XL fits well for me, but if you're larger I might suggest you size up. I typically wear a 16/18 pant and the XL was nice and roomy at the hip for me. My only complaint is that it was extremely wrinkled out of the package."
4.0,"Feels great if you love to collectables or doing cosplay. WARNING, Not made for actual combat play if that's the idea. Looks great!!!"
4.0,Using it all the time. Wish they would make different shapes that conform to todays styles. But happy to have the smaller size.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, I just didn’t like how it looked on me"
4.0,Very pretty and good quality. Hard to unscrew and get in the ear but def worth it
4.0,"The socks are great but I would encourage you to get some type of grip to hold them up if your on the thicker side. The packaging was pretty good, the lace came a little folded up and feels rough sort of like sand paper. But overall the quality was great the socks themselves are soft! Nice and stretchy material."
4.0,"Looks just like the picture & came promptly. It is a little smaller then I expected it to be, but it is still nice looking."
4.0,"Husband liked this gift. It's a little darker gold than pictured, but still more interesting than other earrings. Has a nice long post - as needed for his ear lobes. The little rubber backs that come with these are ok with hook-type earringwires, but not sufficient for these. Once he added different backs, all is good."
4.0,"These are helpful for if you are planning on taking your mask off and on frequently, but they are a bit short."
4.0,"Absolutely adorable!! However, one of the three (the gold one) was impossible to open without tools, and I have small fingers! So that kinda sucked. But for the price and the two other being perfect and I'm satisfied."
4.0,They look great but I ordered the pink ones and received the red ones. I ordered the pink again so fingers crossed 🤞 I'll be returning the red ones
4.0,"I probably didn't read the description carefully enough, but these are large cubes- will fit more than one outfit when packing. The laundry bag is useful for short trips! Other packing cubes I've purchased have had more support in them- these really are just fabric square bags with zippers. They will work, just not what I was expecting."
4.0,"This product seems to be made very well and of much better quality than hanes or FTL but compared sizing, I wear 2 XL hanes, ordered these in 2XL and compared to Hanes they are between a L and XL...so very small sized compared to size charts... however compared to the recent lack of quality in both hanes and FTL these are a much better product..I can still wear them just not comfortably. I am though very happy with quality of this product.. These are priced at just over 4 dollars a pair and in my Walmart hanes are over 5 buck a pair at my size and are half the quality they were at 3 dollars pair..The Jrambo are of much better quality so I am keeping them as motivation to loose few pounds...would give them 5 stars if sized more accurate in 2xl ..if offered in 3xl I would def purchase them again.."
4.0,I think this shirt is well worth the price. Kinda fun.
4.0,Not as sturdy as I was expecting but very pretty
4.0,"Love it, it fits amazing"
4.0,Nice top good quality but a little tight.
4.0,Great shirt. Use as an undershirt for work in Florida. Loose fit and keeps you cool.
4.0,Gorgeous evening jewelry & watch
4.0,"Only giving 4 stars because material looks a little cheap, but for price that's to be expected. Wore with leggings and was cute!"
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet! Not sure I'm going to keep it as it may snag on the mesh of my wedding dress, but it's very lovely."
4.0,The watch is pretty much as described in the reviews.  My only complaint is that the light is worthless ... hence only four stars.  And one more thing ... I can't recommend this watch for a real small child ... as it is too easy to press buttons and mess up the time.
4.0,"What a pretty anklet!<br /><br />PearlPlus Vintage Antique Silver Coin Ankle Chain is really a well made anklet-  It was delivered in a sealed bag, that was in a velvet pouch-  how great is that that you get a storage bag with it?<br /><br />The anklet itself is an antique silver, with 12 'coins' so you get a nice jingle when you walk.  This is definitely a nice addition to your jewelry box, great for an evening out or a day at the beach.  the 'lobster claw' clasp lets you size it to fit any sized ankle.  It is not a flimsy piece of costume jewelry that will break 1st time you wear it, it seems to me to be very well constructed and should hold its elegance for a long time.<br /><br />Read the description carefully-  they send you exactly what you are ordering, the anklet-  all the other silver pieces in the picture are only additional props, this is clearly stated and I appreciate that!  I knew I was just getting the anklet so I am not in the least disappointed.<br /><br />I have to disclose that I did receive a discount on this item in exchange for my review.  However, my review is based on my experience with the product and in no way influenced by discount I received"
4.0,Product is fine. But the lower attachment with the sound hole hook should also be adjustable for taller people.
4.0,Good product as described.  Fast shipping.
4.0,"After reading reviews, I bought both a medium and a large for my small 9 year old (who wears an 8 or medium at Old Navy). The medium fits him well though I will note that the arms are on the long side for both sizes. Quality is good, happy with my purchase."
4.0,works better than i thought
4.0,"These glasses look great, but are a little too wide for my head so they fit loose"
4.0,"I ordered these with the expectation that they’d be a bit longer. They are hidden behind my hair. I do like them and my husband and daughters love them, so I’m keeping them for when I wear my hair behind my ears. One other thing, I was upset to see these fun fashion earrings in an Instagram ad for almost half the price I paid. Shop around. Be wary. Be smart."
4.0,great fit and true to size..
4.0,"This is a nice sweater, soft material. Very strong odor upon initial opening of the bag. Definitely have to wash it. Haven't worn it yet but it washed up pretty good then put it in the dryer for just a few minutes on high,  just to knock the wrinkles out and then hung it up. The arms are a bit snug but they stretch. Definitely fits like a cropped cardigan which works really nice over sleeveless dresses. I plan to buy more in different colors my office gets cold! Ordered an<br />XXL and normally wear extra large tops"
4.0,Nice print and comfortable
4.0,It's hard to pull them apart without splitting them... Wasted 3 of them. But I have worn my earrings for 2 days now :)
4.0,"Watch winder arrived promptly as advertised. Sleek clean lines of attractive wood case blend wherever it is stored. Attractive price as well as attractive case. Looks as good as many at much higher prices. Easy to set speed, but who knows what speed is best? Perhaps watch manufacturer will suggest guidelines. For now I am starting low , going up slow."
4.0,"This is the same size as the original band on my 0100 night series. However, the polymer band feels &#34;stickier&#34; than the original band and is slightly lighter. Its also more of a matte finish whereas the original was shinier.<br /><br />Overall happy with the purchase, but wished it was a little more exact in its match."
4.0,Great! What a deal!
4.0,"This is a super cute monokini. The only down side is that it has no lining or pads on the top. I'd rather not have things show there but this is the only down side. If you don't mind that, then it's a good suit."
4.0,I love this. The only issue I have with it is the chain kins of irritates my skin (but i have sensitive skin so) and the flower doesn't always stay facing front.
4.0,"This is a nice blazer, single button, for sorta kinda formal, but not too formal, occasions. Pay attention to the sizing charts when ordering and you'll be fine."
4.0,Feels cute! Listen to reviews and order 1 size down
4.0,Not to a bad charm for the price.
4.0,Fit was great. Material of shirt was great. The logo material was inferior. Even in just air dry I the dryer it stuck to itself. This was disappointing and running the Captian America Shield logo.
4.0,"This are great socks!  One issue - one of the back edges has come un sewn.  It won't impact the sock - but shouldn't have happened on just a few wearings.  I will contact the manufacturer about this.  I wear a size 10 women's shoe - the extended size fits great.  I don't feel the seam above the toes, hold my food nicely, no moving around.  I would recommend these socks.<br /><br />Update: within 15 minutes of emailing the company (on a Wednesday night!) I already had a response that they would be sending me a new pack of socks.  That is EXCELLENT customer service!"
4.0,"They would have got a 5 star if I had gotten all 7. Costumer contact is great though. They are sending me out my missing one. These are a great product, so don't let my little misshap detur you from a good pair of underwear."
4.0,"It’s a great patogonia product, love the color, just not crazy about the hood/collar system, kinda weird"
4.0,This was part of a few dresses I bought for my niece. It is a nice print on a decent quality fabric. Good for occasions. My cousin liked it for her daughter.
4.0,Love it. Great length! Stone is smooth. Really pretty. Only does size is the chain color does slightly change
4.0,"Although I liked it, I found it too fat for my travel purse.<br />It will work well when I use a larger purse when I get home."
4.0,"I love these!!!! I was skeptical about them bc they were only $25,  but they are SUPER comfortable and they are so cute too. I got the purple ones. I might get the green ones too. The fit is perfect. They feel like you're not even wearing shoes."
4.0,Exactly What my Dad Wanted.
4.0,This watch is pretty much perfect. It's slim and lightweight and it displays both the day of the week and the date. The only drawback is that the band is really short. Like if my wrist was any bigger it would be kind of annoying. I think have a smaller wrist and I only have like 3 or 4 holes left on the band. Besides that this watch is great and I love it so far. Would recommend.
4.0,I ordered gray - it said gray......but it was BLACK!
4.0,I like it and it is great!
4.0,Fits great and are cute. The only thing I wish they had were pockets which is why they only got 4 stars but if you don’t care about pockets then definitely a 5 star pant.
4.0,"This is the first item I have bought from this company and wasn't sure what to expect. Quality seems good and I did not find the fabric to be see through. The fabric is kind of a slinky material and does not stretch. It fit perfectly in the upper body but I am petite and it's a little too long and wide at the waist. I am 32A, 97 lbs and 5'0&#34; and bought XS for reference. It hits just slightly above my knees. I bought this to use as a swim suit cover up and it will be fine for that. Would have given 5 stars if it had been a touch smaller."
4.0,Lovely dress. I minused one star because I detest such a short lining. Will definitely get it tailored to a full length lining.
4.0,The size of the shoe is pretty true to size but the opening to the shoe is snug so we had to size up.
4.0,"Great quality, decent price, but runs large compared to the size chart. I had to take it in 2 sizes. Not enough time to return! Fast shipping was a plus!"
4.0,"Ordered size 4 in 'red'. I am 5'1, 112# & a 34C.The fit was right, not tight at all, but this is a thin material that will show ANY little bump or dimple not to mention undergarments! Spanx never work for me w/ dresses like this because you can see the line where the spanx stops. Pretty color and lovely neckline but not the dress for me. If you have no bumps/bulges/cellulite then go for it! :)<br />Also, at 5'1 & I would definitely have had to have the bottom hemmed even in my 5 inch platforms! But didn't knock any stars off for that as is to be expected at my height."
4.0,"Looks great, however part of it literally fell off within a week.  Had it repaired by a jeweler and it's working great."
4.0,"I bought the white dress with pink flowers. I am 5'5&#34;, 36 C, and normally wear a women's medium, or sometimes a large depending on the style. In dresses, I usually wear size 8 or 10. Due to reviews, I ordered this dress in a large.  Here are the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The fabric is flowy, and has the feel of soft sheer curtains. (not the scratchy kind).<br />2.  I like that it's long.  It's hard to find long dresses that aren't either a Bohemian style, or too formal.<br />3.  The white/pink floral print is feminine, and the pattern is not too busy.<br />4.  This wrap-style dress is beautiful.<br /><br />But there are a few issues.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  I wish the built in slip was full length.  Because the white dress is see-through, it's very noticeable where the slip ends, and the slip is too short. It doesn't make sense for the slip to stop mid-way.<br />2. There needs to be more coverage at the top.  I knew the wrap dress would have a deeper v-neck - but it was way too deep. I was hoping it would just be a matter of adjusting how tight I made the wrap, but it doesn't help.  Even though I ordered a large, there still wasn't enough fabric to pin it shut.  A cami would be needed, thought I'm not sure if it would detract from the style of the dress.<br />3.  The sleeve opening is too tight.  I do not have big arms - I am an average sized woman. Being that I ordered a size up, I would have expected the sleeves to be looser.<br /><br />I'm not sure if going up to an XL would help with the neckline and sleeve openings. The large already came to my feet, and concerned that an XL would be way too long.  I only took off one star because I do love the style, length, color, and print.  If the above issues could be fixed in the making of the dress, I'm sure it would be a consistent 5-star rating from customers."
4.0,"Great royal blue dress--the color is just as gorgeous in person as it is in the picture. Definitely designed for a tall person (I am 5'11&#34; with a 33&#34; inseam, and the back came down to my ankles). Note the fabric stretches up and down and NOT side to side, which means it will eventually stretch out to be even longer and not give you the design ease if the fabric had been cut on the correct grain (i.e., stretch side to side to accommodate a larger bust). Still, the fabric is beautiful and soft and definitely good quality."
4.0,"These are really cute nfortabke underwear. They run a little big, so keep that in mind."
4.0,"Good bag.  The inner pockets kind of get in the way but that might be my issue with the way I pack it.  Shoulder strap seems like it's not going to last very long at all.  But for the price, it's a solid purchase."
4.0,"This tank top has a cool design and is made from smooth material. The thing I don’t like about it is that the arm openings are very deep, exposing most of your sides. Could be worn with a black sports bra or over another tank."
4.0,I love this dress. Super flowey. The white is see thru and it ran a bit small. Its the perfect dress to wear over your swim suit at the beach!
4.0,"Cute, fit ok. Normally size 10 US. Pretty wrinkled but sent back because it wasn’t exactly what I was looking for"
4.0,These are flexible luggage tags.  I choose these color so it is easy to see.  Your can write your name permanently on one side.
4.0,It’s cute but the color does fade after a couple of weeks of wearing it.
4.0,"Good for school, my son loved it"
4.0,"Tells time, nice design and the Tritium works. I'm giving it 4 stars because the band is overly complicated. Took the band off and replaced it with something simple."
4.0,"The band was very easy to replace after a moment or two to figure out exactly which pin was correct, and sizing it was a snap. The band is a bit lighter than I am used to, but it is dependable and metal, which I prefer. The housing protector, in the other hand, was not at all what I was expecting: it is a bendable lightweight plastic and would not fit on the watch no matter what I tried. All in all, the price is still great even for the band itself; I think they would do better just not even including the face/housing cover because it is useless and detracts from the quality of the band. But I'd buy it again if I needed another band."
4.0,Material feels it may snag.
4.0,Really a personality hat.  Fun in Sun!
4.0,"These arrived nicely packaged and I was very impressed with the quality for the price.  They are seamless and smooth.  I knew they would run a bit small, so I ordered one size up.  For reference, I am a size 6 and would typically wear a medium in underwear, but I ordered a large.  They squeeze a little too much on the sides as they are low rise, so they sort of ruin the smooth seamless effect in the hip area for me.  Perhaps if I had ordered two sizes up?  Otherwise, great quality."
4.0,"I like that they are beautiful and sparkly. I do not like how large they are, adult thumbnail size, a bit gaudy or too much for me."
4.0,"Very nice fit. Modern / European cut, I’m a fairly thin seminarian and this shirt fits well. Not like the “roomy Toomey”. Stays neatly tucked in. The stitching on the inner neck band of the collar is a little abrasive but not too bad. Comes with a very comfortable rubber collar but works well with my fabric collars. Comfortable under a cassock. The material is high quality for a poly cotton blend."
4.0,My daughter loves it! But we've had to repair it twice because the ring that holds the charms was loose and the charms came off.
4.0,Just like picture. Cute nice size
4.0,"Bought these for my seven year old, his face measures just shy of 4 inches from the bridge of his nose to the underside of the tip of his chin. These were too large for him to wear. They actually almost fit me and I measure 4 5/8” from the bridge of the nose to the underside of the chin.  Other than being a little too large, they are lightweight and comfortable and I appreciate the adjustable nose."
4.0,Really nice for the price. So sparkly.
4.0,I got this top because I am going to a Tea fundraiser for the local garden club. The table theme for where I will be sitting is Scotland. I thought it would be fun. It is a little flimsy but good for what I wanted it for.
4.0,Good hiking shoe
4.0,Very nice alternative 2 wearing the same black band. I wish they had actual buckles instead of snaps for the closure. But it looks really good when working out and matches your clothes. Sometimes initially they are hard to get onto the watch but once you have it on taking it off and putting it back on its just fine.
4.0,"This dress is great, but it is definitely NOT bright yellow as pictured. It is a mustard yellow at best, very dark golden mustard. I still like it though and the fit is fantastic due to the stretch in the fabric."
4.0,Runs big.  Material is similar to a regular classic sweatshirt material.  Not thin not thick.  Goes well below my knees.  Color is nice.
4.0,I wear S but based on reviews got L.  Top fits just fine but the bottoms are still too tiny.  Love the top so I will keep it and donate the bottoms.
4.0,"I bought this as a replacement for my old All-Ett that finally had started to wear out. This one seems to be the same, though the material seems different, so I'm hoping it lasts as long as the previous one."
4.0,This pair of Nike is so light that it is prefect for running and walking. My son loves the neon yellow color that stands out in the dark.
4.0,"This is about a size smaller than expected, it fits, but it is a little tight on my stomach. It looks pretty and feels very soft. Of course, the pockets are great."
4.0,lightweight & clear to see through.
4.0,The dress for pretty well ; I wore it to a formal dress and although it’s a simple dress it’s really easy to dress up. And i’m pretty tall so it was a great length
4.0,"Just the right size and color.  You can use them for earrings and necklaces, some might be a little large for charm bracelets, but overall a good buy."
4.0,"Before purchasing this watch, I did a little background check and my theory was confirmed - it's actually a Chinese maker posing as a German company (more or less). Knowing that, this watch is pretty much exactly what I expected. It looks good; it keeps good time and may fall apart at any moment.<br />The only true cons I've noticed are that a) it's really easy to hit the date and month buttons. I've pretty much given up on it keeping the correct date, which is okay because b) the date display goes up to 39.<br />So if your concern is keeping the right date, you should probably find a different watch. If your concern is a really inexpensive watch that looks good on your wrist, I say go for it."
4.0,This bathing suit is super cute! It does run small so I would definitely get a size larger. I normally wear a size 10/12 and I got the XL.
4.0,"Overall, satisfied with variety of charms.  However, some were hard to figure out what they were.  I was interested in a the more nautical themed and there were a nice selection."
4.0,Great shirt and great material. Fast shipping. Be sure to order TWO sizes up from normal though. They do run smaller.
4.0,"Worked for its purpose, because I had lost mine, but the frame is slick and doesn’t curve behind the ear which causes it to fall off, nothing that can’t be fixed with simple ear silicon but that’s an extra purchase on its own. Otherwise easy fix to lost frames"
4.0,Very comfortable cheap and fun only problem is I'm a 32 waist and have slightly above average size and needed to order an xl and still could barely fit into the sheath but definitely worth the price just order a size or 2 up
4.0,It’s very pretty but I bought the small when I should have bought the medium. The material is thin but add a slip<br />& it would be great.
4.0,"I like the color, the fit could be better."
4.0,"Not as transparent as I hoped, but they’re comfortable & works fine at my job."
4.0,"I use this belt for when I go to work and it has a nice stretch to it, definently worth, but if youre a lady, like myself, that likes to wear skinny jeans and halters/ crops, this isn't for everyday use."
4.0,Super cute but noticed only after i wore it several times that instead of saying Fir it says FIN. Haha!
4.0,I thought an XL would be perfect. But no. Color was very cute tho.
4.0,"This case is excellent for it's quality and simplicity in construction. The button feels good and natural on both the volume rocker and the power button, the metal is relatively light, and install/uninstall is easy and pretty quick with it's simple design of a slide top plate.<br /><br />Given all of this, there's a couple flaws that I must mention, the biggest one being the cutout of the USB port, I can understand that it the design team has already left as much space as they possibly could for the plug, but USB cables these days feature bulky rubber to protect the connectors. Your standard charger from Samsung will work fine, but don't count of the standard USB cables you pick up from say Monoprice.com, I happen to use a USB car socket and a USB cable to charge (from said place) while working, and I have to slice the portion of the rubber off the top of the connector for it to fit. The only other gripe I have is that the sliding mechanism sometimes slides out while in the pocket, if the top piece happen to have caught up to something in your pocket.<br /><br />Despite the minor problems, this is a great case, and having dropped the phone and cracked it's glass twice (it is the most fragile phone I have ever have, but I digress), this is one of the few inexpensive and quality protection out there you can get for this phone."
4.0,This T-shirt is very soft but very big and baggy. I ordered a small. I will only be able to wear it with leggings lounging around the house.
4.0,"My face is wide, so, for me, they're not over-sized. I have to adjust the arms so they won't put pressure behind my ears.<br />They're very nice looking glasses! I'm surprised, I like the embossed, faux leather, and other ornamentation on the outside of the arms;<br />gives a classy look. The tiny repair kit which has both phillips and straight edge screw drivers, as well as, the fabric carrier, is a plus!"
4.0,Had to purchase a half-size smaller than my son's normal shoe size
4.0,They fit as expected.  Feel good on the feet and don't slip off.  These are shorter than I expected ( not a bad thing).  I wear them with my Vibram FiveFingers and they work nicely.  I haven't had them long enough to comment on durability.
4.0,Very nice.. It could have been a little bigger. Cannot beat the price for them.
4.0,"Great design, nice fabric. Use a short jacket or a blazer and it perfect for the work environment."
4.0,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it needs to have leggings under it as it is super short.  I haven't washed it yet, but am thinking it might be line dry only, in which case my 4 stars is too generous.  But it is a cute dress for the holidays."
4.0,"I was looking for a dress for semi casual wedding - I loved the back and decided to try this dress. I bought two sizes - small and medium. I am 5'9"", 149 lbs. Most of my weight is in my stomach area so small size was perfect fit - lose fit covers any lower body flaws. The only thing to consider is the length. At my height, if you want it to cover your shoes, medium size will be better. It is very nice dress - seems more on 'dress down' side but since the quality is good you can easily dress it up with some accessories."
4.0,This is a really good head wrap.
4.0,Very useful insert in my wallet & the quality looks durable.
4.0,"great waterproof material, flexible, reversible. everything as described. Its a bit awkward trying to smooth it out after being folded up, but cant wait to use it in the pool!"
4.0,"SO flattering and cute, however the top doesn't stay as structured as the pictures appear and it's a lower cut than expected. I have to wear it with the strap, but it's still super cute and get a ton of compliments. I'm 5'4, 125 lbs and ordered a M."
4.0,"Love it, it’s somewhat tight but sexy. Date night dress for sure!"
4.0,Love the flip flop. Perfect for massage which is what I needed most.
4.0,Color and material were good. Smaller to size.
4.0,"Beautiful color and fit! Decently sewn, not allot of noticeable errors."
4.0,"This watch is very functional and has most of the features you'd want. It is stylish, not too big, but due to the dark design is not the easiest to read."
4.0,"Small letter charm, but nice chain."
4.0,Great for the price. The roses are squished from mailing and I haven't been able to fluff them back up but they're still really cute!
4.0,We absolutely love this product! It saves us so much from gettin hair under our clothes. I do think it is overpriced. If I would have saw it in person first I probably would have paid $5 max because of the quality and flimsiness of fabric. I do love it overall though!
4.0,My family loved these pjs.  I ordered a size up for everyone and they did fit. For a heavy person i might up 2 sizes. They smell like glue before washing.  They have been washed once and didn't shrink much. Overall they were ok for the price.
4.0,"I love the colors of these buffs. I also love the variety of ways you can wear buffs, which is why I purchased these. These came with a fairly strong chemical odor, but it washed right out. It also seems some of the colors are more stretched out or are larger than others, which is a huge bummer for someone with a small head like me. Perhaps it's just a fluke."
4.0,"Was a very pretty dress, but was not for me. I had to send it back and get a bigger size, then return again as it was still a little tight in the arms (mine are not very big) but it just wasn't comfortable and it felt a little matronly. The service was awesome though and they were great about the returns. I would try them again if the occasion arises!"
4.0,I see this a s more of a lounge dress or out to the farmer's market on a Saturday morning.<br />The color blue is very nice. It is quite a relaxed fit and is a pretty fabric.
4.0,This dry fast fit good just know if ur shorter like me they don’t fit as good as the model at the bottom little long but not bad. I’m 5”2 130 got a small size.
4.0,The dress is cute and a good fit
4.0,"Received the wrong size, but love it anyway."
4.0,"This is the second time I purchase this silk scarf, not as thick as the first one"
4.0,Followed reviews on fit and got it right! Nice dress I felt sexy in it! I’m a size 6 for reference.
4.0,"I've worn this twice in two days, so I am happy with it, but there are some cons. The pockets on mine are super small. Perfect if you have abnormally small baby hands, which I don't. It's also longer than I expected based on the photos. Not really a con though because I still like the length. It's actually better because I never have to shave my legs again. The outer skirt fabric is like an old school polyester. Not my favorite, but it will due. Notable pros: it is lined to the knee. Nice! It is true to American sizes so I could have actually gone down a size. It matches well with a lot of different tops. Have fun styling!"
4.0,"The material is very soft and comfy, but the sizing runs big I am normally a six 18-20 in most brands and I was swimming in this dress."
4.0,"Excellent material and quality. I like them a lot - wish they were a tad longer, other wise would be a 5!"
4.0,FITS perfect on my galaxy 3 watch.  Glitter is beautiful and I've gotten a few compliments on the band. I have not noticed the glitter coming off but I've only been wearing a few days.  The glitter side is textured and the underside is smooth (leather). If you are expecting a solid leather band i don't think it is.  Looks like a strip is glued on the underside for comfort but for the price it's good
4.0,"This locket was much bigger than I expected and I ended up returning it. Just too clunky for me to pull off. I still gave it four stars because it is well made, and looks just like the picture. Unique rose bronze color. The description does say 1.5 inches but be aware that is very big! Three dimes can fit on top of this locket without touching each other, for reference. I would recommend this necklace if you like larger pendants."
4.0,"It is a good dress for the price. The fabric is thin and breathable, which allows the wind to catch the skirt. I have to keep readjusting the top so that my bust stays covered without seeing the seam from the panel underneath. I will wear this dress often, it can be dressed up with accessories or kept casual."
4.0,"Stated it fit true to size, but ran smaller.  It is also shorter than my taste.  Colors are bright and same as photo"
4.0,I like the quality but I should have bought the largest size. Not made for my shapely female hips.
4.0,Delivery on time.  Good product.
4.0,"Great looking ring, but I'm giving 4 out of 5 because its not really black. Its more of a dark gray. Still a beautiful ring but the metal is not the color I was expecting."
4.0,My husband like these as much as I do.  I got in a large so loose and comfortable.  I would actually wear a medium but I like loose.  Perfect length for my 5ft. 4”.
4.0,"Decent quality workout shirt, looks great. It’s really not worth spending huge amounts for name brand workout gear that is just going to get sweaty and dirty anyway. These shirts look great and fit perfectly.  I’m 5’8” 156lbs, I bought a small that is a little short in length.  The neck line is also lower than I like."
4.0,This product is great the double flared parts of the plugs is a little big so it can hurt your ears but once you get them in you hardly notice them.other than that these are great I love the colors and how they look
4.0,"I loved the dress! It wrinkles pretty easily. But I ordered up and it was quite large. For reference, I'm 5'3&#34;, 140 lbs, waist 28&#34; and I had to return it because it was very baggy. Just reordered a small, hopefully it fits better!"
4.0,This glasses were better quality than I had anticipated I wish they came in different shapes with the same frameless lenses
4.0,"Hard resin a top quality piece, if you are into collecting mask i suggest hrad resin like this one or better yet the paydays...4 stars only because the Keychain was missing"
4.0,So I normally dont do product reviews like this. BUT they have helped me a lot for sure. When I was ordering it took me a while to find the right size since the sizing wasn't American sizing. I'm 5'6&#34; and 215lb. I ordered this in a 3X. When I first opened it i noticed how soft the material was and overall it's so comfortable! The only bad thing is the top came a bit big for me and if i could have ordered the top in a 2X i would have for sure. Overall though im very happy with my product and the colors are actually brighter than the picture is showing. I feel I have a lot of confidence in this and even if the top doesn't work for me that much the bottom does for sure and I'm always trying to find decent bottoms. The top being too big was the only reason I gave 4 stars. But I do recommend this!
4.0,Keep my hands nice and worm
4.0,"I like this suit a lot!  It is retro but very stylish and I love that the skirt goes down just a bit more than the normal skirted suit,  Not too far, but just enough.  When sitting at the beach, the skirt can go down enough for a lot of coverage or pulled up slightly to tan your legs, if wanted.  I did have to tie the ends around my neck instead of using the closure because it wasn't quite snug enough to support my bust otherwise.  All in all, very nice suit and glad I got it."
4.0,Love The Fabric
4.0,First impression is good.<br />Has not been used yet.<br />Hopefully it will hold up
4.0,This suit is super cute. The top is a little awkward and I felt like my boobs would fall out the bottom. I love the high waisted bottoms. I typically wear a 6 and the large fit great.
4.0,Loved the boots. They were too big tho.
4.0,Wish they were a bit softer.
4.0,I like the design and the fabric is soft and not too thick.
4.0,"Sizes run small, quick service though... thank you"
4.0,These slipper socks are very warm and comfortable.
4.0,This is my favorite thing to put on when I get home. I love everything about it EXCEPT for the tag sewn in at the back neck. It is super itchy. I must remove. I will buy 2 more once they become available.
4.0,"Fits as expected, however the dress hits just below the knee on me (I'm 5'6"") so it is not as flattering. This dress definitely need to be worn with an accent belt/sash"
4.0,"Cute<br />Fit fine<br />But not as supervenes as I hoped<br />When I hook my phone on the waist band , they tend to sag a bit"
4.0,"The glasses are fine quality wise, but they are large even for kids size.  My six year old had a problem keeping them on her nose."
4.0,Worked well and it was exactly what was expected when I purchased this product.  Great item for the price. Worth it
4.0,"The fit is great and it’s very thin, perfect for hot humid weathers. But after you wash they must be ironed or else the dress will not look crisp."
4.0,The yellow color was exactly as pictured.  It was just too short on me - 3-4 inches above my knee - so I returned it.
4.0,"My daughter loves these, I just wish they were 14 kt gold instead of just gold plated. They are bigger than I thought they would be."
4.0,Shirt fit is as expected and the quality of the fabric is good.  My only complaint is that the bird pattern looks like “shrimp” from a distance.  Multiple people have made a comment about the design...
4.0,Very pretty hopefully will be sturdy and hold up well<br />It was a gift for a friend. She loved it!
4.0,Can get alot in them.  They don't like to stand up until you get something in them I can get 1 weeks of groceries on the 5
4.0,they are super comfy and not see through which is the best part! I do wish the legs were longer (I'm 5'5). The waist band may be tight for some because it is a thick type of band.
4.0,Shorter than shown
4.0,Great top! So soft and perfect for hot summer nights. I like the double V-neck on both front and back and love the way the shirt flows without being super fitting and tight. The cap sleeves keeps me cool even during those hot days and night and it's very comfortable. I will say the only issue I had while wearing this shirt all day was that one side of the shoulder would fall down more than the other each time. So I had to keep readjusting it to stay in place center.  I ordered a large so maybe a medium would have been better fit for me.
4.0,Cute skirt. Definitely shows the curves
4.0,Groovy socks -- kid digs them.
4.0,Very cute but it runs about 2 sizes larger than what you typically would wear.
4.0,"I love the color of this bag. Although it bens pretty easily, it’s a really nice purse to wear every once in a while."
4.0,"Overall I love it. Sometimes it is a little too tight, right when it comes out of the dryer."
4.0,"Decent looking buttons, but they feel a bit plastic."
4.0,Beautiful! The packaging was amazing and the color is beautiful. I recommend!!
4.0,"This is a Braided Leather Belt.  The length is just right for my husband. He fluctuates between 32 and 33 waist.  The has a solid, sturdy look to it.  It doesn’t look like he’ll wear it out for many years.  It has a gold colored buckle."
4.0,Long enough to cover one's lap as well.  Easy velcro closure.
4.0,"Nice sweater. Soft. A little short & tight around the waist, but not bad enough to return."
4.0,It was ok.  Little small.  Other than that a nice shirt
4.0,It did fit me was to long. But the dress was beautiful
4.0,"I would give it a 5 star if the straps were adjustable.<br /><br />That aside - I love how confident I feel wearing this bathing suit. Typically, I loath beach days; I do not hesitate to join my kids in the water wearing this suit."
4.0,"Love all the color choices (I picked yellow) and it feels just like leather. I just wish it had a clasp to keep it shut because it won’t stay closed when I put all my stuff in it. Otherwise, I love it. Just got it today so I can’t comment on durability."
4.0,"I like the fact that this wallet protects my cards.  I miss having a place for a tissue, otherwise this is a great replacement for a purse."
4.0,Stretchy fabric  Very comfy beach cover up<br />True to size
4.0,"My son wore this as a Halloween costume. It kept him warm during the evening. The sleep mask for a small kid is questionable and doesn't get any use. The hood may not be a good idea for a sleeper unless it's cold or your cold camping. If its not up, it's just in the way while 💤 ng."
4.0,"Takes forever to arrive, but that's why its so cheap"
4.0,"As soon as I got it, one of the insert snaps broke that attaches to the purse. That was disappointing. So, I just took the insert out altogether. Actually, I think I like it better without the insert anyway because it only attached in two places anyway so it's not easy to open and retrieve anything. That could be a good thing if you don't want anyone reaching down into your purse but it's a pain for daily use. And also the insert seems much smaller than the purse itself. On the flip side, without the insert, it's easy to grab something but also easy for someone to reach down into if you aren't watching your purse closely. Other than that, it's a great, simple, everyday, casual/dress style that makes it very versatile."
4.0,"This is a very cute shirt/body suit. I bought it to only wear around the house if you know what I mean. If I were to want to wear it in public, I would order a size bigger. It’s sexy and my husband LOVED it."
4.0,The pendant is beautiful but the chain looks like it is cheaper than the pendant.
4.0,My kid loved it for the 50th day party
4.0,5’10” / 150lbs / usually a size 6-8 / ordered a large<br /><br />Runs a bit big and was gappy under the arms on me. Also pretty see through but the fabric is nice and the arms were long enough! I returned it though because it just didn’t fit how I wanted it to.
4.0,"So I got this in the cutest little cotton drawstring bag. The gold color is FAR darker and yellow than the picture depicts. The charm is SHINY and the engraved letter is deep so it is not as 'soft' as the description picture. The chain was thick and was similar to gumball jewelry in appearance so I threw that away and placed it on a more delicate gold chain I had. Now it doesn't seem so bad and I do wear it daily. I love the size of the charm. It is tiny and, given the color, it isn't as overpowering as it could be.<br /><br />PRO: tiny size charm. cute.<br />CON: color is 'off' and chain is very 'fake kids jewelry' looking<br />BOTTOM LINE: recommended.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />As a fellow Amazon buyer, I know how important it is that reviews are honest and I always spend time using a product before reviewing it.

4.0,Gave to my grandaughter as a souvenir
4.0,"The medium was good for me and the fabric is comfortable. Cute and soft basic nightie, great for the price. I haven't washed it yet so I can't comment on the durability."
4.0,Much nicer than expected.  Has weight to it and a nice chain.
4.0,I was tired of wearing my normal baseball caps during my runs so I went to Amazon and found this one.  It is light weight and fairly comfortable for an item that I only paid $12 for it.
4.0,It stays in place and there's no alligator clip and spring to break. I did think it was a little longer though.
4.0,Very comfortable and soft. I just wish they had more support around the belly.
4.0,"The color, fit, and fabric were as expected. Soft and stretchy but not cheap looking."
4.0,This dress is so comfortable.  It really doesn't have any shape unless you use the belt and tie it a little tight.
4.0,My boyfriend is a great Duke fan! He is going to love this hat he has many. It doesn't look cheap thank goodness.
4.0,Nice top to wear with jeans. Very casual.
4.0,I'm a curved girl and ordered according to the chart. I would have gone one size smaller if I would have known. But it's cute. Also the lacing is cheap.
4.0,Decent product but zippers are cheaply made.  It works for me but I wouldn’t recommend if you’re planning on using regularly/often.  I use once every couple of months and it does keep me organized.
4.0,"This dress was gorgeous, but I ended up returning it for a few reasons: 1) I bought it for a wedding and ended up feeling it might actually be a little too sexy to wear to such an event. The back is more open than I thought and the lace on the side is more see-through than expected. 2) the back zipper didn't work, it was stuck when I got it, which wasn't a huge problem because I was able to get it over my head, but I was terrified I was going to rip it or snag it in the process. And 3) the back panels of the dress actually puckered out a little bit which I believe is due to me being so short-torsoed, and the lace collar around the neck was beautiful but sometimes a smidge too tight.<br /><br />Other than that, it fit really well, I'm 5'3, 130lbs, with slightly wide hips and athletic thighs and the small was perfect. It was comfortable and form-fitting, but not too tight and the slip underneath was really soft. Color was a true wine/burgundy. Definitely a great buy for the price, and would be perfect for an event like a cocktail party, or bachelorette!"
4.0,Have been wearing this brand for years because it gives me the support that I need.
4.0,"4 stars because no bow tie was included. And suspenders do not fit a size 2T. But will keep and use when grandson grows into them. They are good material and clips. They should last for a long, long time."
4.0,"I really like this shirt! It is tshirts material not sweater though. Also, it’s kind baggy.  I’m 8 months pregnant and it fits even me a little loose. I can’t decide how it will look when I’m not pregnant but I hope I can wear it then too. All together I feel like I look super cute in it and will for sure keep it!"
4.0,The belt loop ripped off quite easily. But that's an easy fix. So cute. Just as pictured.
4.0,"I use this around my neck all the time, as where I live in Mexico is pretty cool most of the year.  It rolls up really small and fits in the side pocket of my backpack.  My only complaint is that after a few uses, it has gotten a bit baggy...I wish it fit a little better around my neck.  But I'd buy another one again.  I have used it around my head and face as well and it worked well."
4.0,Love them. Very light but sturdy. Will order more.
4.0,Super cute. Fits great but the sides of the dress are a little lower than expected. The sides come down the sides partially showing my behind…So you probably wouldn't want to wear a thong because you would see the straps. Its a very sext dress and its longer than expected but Im tall so I like it. I would buy again.
4.0,"It is fun and not too exaggerate, can be both of daily wear and party dress. It will be my costume for next Halloween party, yes I will be a batwoman, or I am whatever Gotham needs me to be. The skirt is soft and light, however, I am not sure whether it is durable or not after several times washing. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Love this suit! Size up 1 or 2 sizes!
4.0,"I bought this for a friend to use as a swimsuit cover-up. She's about 5'5"" and wears a size 8 so I bought the medium size. It fits her well, not too tight and the hem falls about 4 inches above the knee. The fabric is light and a bit see through (I bought the pink color), so it works well as cover up. I think it's too see through to wear as a dress, but if you get the black color it might hide a bit more."
4.0,"Will it stand the test of Time, idk but I'm willing to find out. It's beautiful and better than I thought I would be. It's well made and feels sturdy. Its a simple piece but just enough not too small."
4.0,"This shawl is a big piece of semi-thick, soft black material with no knitting at all.  The ends are fringed.  It's nice and looks good, and it wraps around my shoulders nicely and feels good.  I will be wearing it this fall to football games.  If I machine wash it I will place it in a mesh bag and use something like Wool-Lite in cold water.  Then it gets laid out to dry."
4.0,These are great pants and I really like them.  They came on time
4.0,I actually ordered a extra large which is about a USA size 12 so if your think your getting a size 14/16 for extra larger forget it. One think that happened to me was that I had organically ordered a extra Large and they send me a medium. My daughter wears a medium and this was tight on her. So I contacted the Amazon and the company said not to send it back just keep it and they would send me an extra Large. I am a size 12/14 it fits a bit tight in the chest area. I have lost a bit of weight and now it fits me just right. Its a pretty good size 12.. Its a nice dress light and airy a good summer dress.
4.0,"So comfortable, I have to check if I’m wearing my watch bc I usually can’t feel it. Downside is it stretches out really fast, so I have to keep sliding the band closer in, other wise my watch moved up and down my arm. So, I’ll be surprised if this lasts 6 months."
4.0,Excellent to wear with your casual clothes Or urban wear out on the town Shipping came really fast which I'm happy about All in All I give this 4 stars as a cute piece of costume jewelry?
4.0,"The shirt fits fine, but the pants fit weird. They kind of have a high-water feel at the bottom."
4.0,"These star earrings, earcuffs were really unique.<br /><br />They were pretty. They are pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people.<br /><br />I thought these were unique. They came packaged nicely. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />They were very comfortable to wear. They were flattering on. They felt secure on my ears. I thought they were a reasonable value. I would recommend them.<br /><br />It is nice that they are real sterling silver."
4.0,"Love the fabric but sized a little large... I like the tight fit, this size was just a little off... I just gotta make sure to down size on next order..."
4.0,Feel cheap but hopefully they’ll hold up because they’re super cute! Very light weight.
4.0,"I chose this keychain for my sister's bday since she loves Nintendo stuff. I liked the size and look of this keychain, but I wasn't sure of the quality and how long it would last. Regardless, for the price it was great and she loved it so it was well worth it."
4.0,Its a very nice dress elegant and great fit but you need it on the right size. I order large on usa size. And fits loose very loose on me. For reference i am 5'7 174 pounds
4.0,I loved these boots but they were smaller than expected. If you order I’d just ordering a size or two bigger.
4.0,"This hat fits good, it's  a quality made hat. Not enough sponsors on it though."
4.0,"Not bad for less than $14. It's made of a slick material so it does slide easily. It's a mid rise though, so nothing falls out if you know what I mean. I showed in photo. I just went to the gym and did leg workouts with it. Stair step, squats, leg lifts. I was nervous about the seams splitting in my rear with the strange fit. There's not a lot of stretch so don't undersize. I went by the size chart and ordered a small. 5'7 135lbs. It works for me but I could see some people not liking the fit."
4.0,"Look and feel is nice. Very fashionable necklace chain and bracelet chain.  Black color Plating really adds to the richness of these two pieces.<br />The chain itself is well constructed, very thick and strong. The clasp on both pieces doesn't look as strong or durable as the chains look. And is held on by a small o ring that is not soldered closed. So I would feel that these two pieces are an occasional wear, something you would take much care in wearing. Not something to wear when playing sports.<br />A stylish pair that will wear well with any occasion, any clothing.  The chain is 20 inches in length,  so a good length for a man. And the bracelet is a 8 inch length, fits a little tighter than normal 8 inch because of how thick the link itself is.<br />A pair that will stand out because of the beautiful byzantine link and the great shiny black metal. Unique and fashion forward. Not a pair you'll see on everyone out and about, but when seeing it on you, they'll want to know where you got yours.<br />Expensive lookin, without the expense. And yes, great for a gift too.<br />I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Cute, worked for the occasion and the budget.<br /><br />The band around the waist is kind of a cheap silvery velvet strap, but could easily be covered up. The top is a silky finish but has to be tied tight to keep shape. Strings in back were a little weird how it tied over your skin.<br /><br />The length was great and light/flowy; felt that it was a very flattering cut as I have a larger bottom half. Did not feel restricted at all, it has some give to it. I wear generally a size 12-14, ordered an XL and it fit like a glove."
4.0,Love the shirt! Bummed out it’s too big but I’m going to keep it since they don’t have the volcanic in L.
4.0,Super cute. Nice size. But I had to glue back together after trying to get out of packaging. I'd cut them out instead of sliding out.
4.0,somewhat cheaply made but it served its purpose for a party
4.0,Very pretty.  True to size.  Great party dress.  Not sure how the fabric will stand up to multiple washing.
4.0,Great fabric. Looking forward to wearing this beautiful dress.<br /><br />I especially love the zipper
4.0,Wore this to my Bday dinner and I loved it. Recieved many compliments
4.0,"Ordered a size up after reading reviews, should’ve stuck with normal size."
4.0,the perfect shirt for the hot California summmer!  this is my favorite shirt for the summer.  Keeps me cool and fit is just right. I normally wear L/XL and the fit a little small so I went up to XXL in case it shrinks in the wash.
4.0,"Comfortable, fits well, but it's squeaky. After several washes it still squeaks when I move certain ways."
4.0,I bought these pants as a gift for my friends birthday and she loved them🥰 They fit her perfectly. I bought her a size large. The joggers also looked just like the photo.
4.0,Beautiful blouse But itrun small
4.0,"These are great. Everyone at work loves the look of them. I have 3 pairs, they haven't stretched out a bit. They have kept their shape being washed and dried. The only thing I wish was different is that the compression in the calf is a little less than I expected, but I have really small legs so that's probably a factor."
4.0,"I ordered this for my bday and my Mom,who is a seamstress had to take in,and she advised this fabric just stretches ALOT so be careful. The print isn’t as vibrant as I’d like too."
4.0,"Great purchase! The paint was a bit smeared on the top and you have to put it together yourself, but other than that it stays on your head, looks great, and is totally worth the purchase."
4.0,"I like this dress, the color works well for hot weather wear"
4.0,"I've been returning several items and having to buy smaller lately but this product fit true to ""US custom"" sizes as of now. A little high waisted and not much give for size so be sure to buy up a size if you can't decide."
4.0,Good boots for $10. I haven't used them for long hours so I don't know how long they will last but overall they are nice decent boots.
4.0,nice hood for turkey hunting in the blind.  Thin but warm.  Has a bit of a &#34;commercial&#34; smell before washing a few times
4.0,"My 9-year old son is Aladdin for Halloween so I purchased this ""Mini"" Fez hat to complete his costume. It's not quite mini and would say this is definitely more for an adult, but it still served its purpose. It comes as a wire headband with the hat attached so the hat stays on which is great. The wire headband stays hidden in the person's hair so you can't really see it. Overall it was a good buy and would recommend if you need this for an Aladdin costume."
4.0,"Super comfortable, but the material is definitely a little more thin. You have to be careful, it's not super durable but I would recommend them. They are the most comfortable pair i've ever worn."
4.0,"I am a teacher and my little ones thought this dress was so cute. I bought a Halloween one from the same company before this one. They both are very cute, comfy but a bit thin."
4.0,The shirt is comfortable; but it is a bit short. I use it untucked so it isn't a big deal. I wouldn't wear it tucked in.
4.0,"I thought the legs would be longer. I think I ordered a 3x but sent me a 5x, which turned out to be a blessing anyway. It has the feel of linen which isn't all that soft, but that's what I wanted"
4.0,"Overall I like it. Im 5’2 130lbs and size Small fits just right.<br />The ONLY item that bothers me is the plastic adjustment right behind the straps? They’re not as smooth, quite a bit rough so its a bit uncomfy I keep scratching my back."
4.0,"This is a gift for my teenage son. I ordered a large and glad I did he is 5'8"" and 150 lbs. After washing a few times I think it shrank some but still plenty of room.  I think could be a little heavier made but overall happy. I suggest order size up.  I did and glad I did so."
4.0,Love it. Use it daily. Easy to load up with office-tech-pc items and throw into briefcase. I bought this to not only keep my items organized but to prevent loose items from scratching my laptop<br /><br />Only reason it's not a 5 is because it doesn't fold. I have to be cautious about which way I place it in my bag so nothing gets scratched.
4.0,"I received mine. All in all these are very nice earrings, but my pair has two scratches on one of the pearls. I contacted the company. They responded very quickly,and will be sending a replacement. Very good customer service. I will update when I receive replacement. Thanks Rakumi.<br />Update-<br />Just received my replacement. Thank you so much. Truly a stunning pair of pearl earrings. Classic and contemporary."
4.0,"Love them, but they are very small."
4.0,"I like it, but I bought it as a gift so I hope she liked it.  It's very pretty."
4.0,I love it 💕 only thing I wish is for the waist band to be wider to cover the whole midsection. Other than that great purchase!
4.0,Gave it to my wife and she loved the style and looks .
4.0,I always take size 10 and this sandal definitely runs small. Loved the sandal but had to return and larger size not available
4.0,"The pendants are very pretty, the chains to go with them are what I was looking for for my wife.  I would definitely recommend Gem Avenue products, especially with the free shipping incentive if you spent $50.00 or more."
4.0,Runs just a little big
4.0,"The dress is very pretty and very well made. Nice A line cut for curvy and pear shaped women. Unfortunately, the red us more orangey than it appears on the web picture. It is more brick red and I was hoping for ruby red. Not sure if I will keep it or not."
4.0,"I ordered the medium blue and it is so much lighter than what is seen. It's like a sky blue and I ordered those kinds of jeans from another seller. Im guessing they're a linked company because they gave me two different jeans with the same color. Yeah, not cool but fits alright well a bit tight actually. The colors aren't accurate so be careful."
4.0,Heavy fabric
4.0,such a light and summery dress. it's great for the summer hot weather.
4.0,"Feedback from: 5'8&quot;, US size 18 (just barely), 38g chest, proportianate hips, high waist, long legs. Suit: High-quality, thick and stretchy fabric, well made. Integrated shorts and skirt a little longer than expected, and crotch area is well-lined, all of which are plusses! Fit: True to size, but the ruched midriff  design didn't flatter me. Sadly returned (after trying on briefly with underwear!) in favor of another model from same brand and seller. Overall: Seller and brand are both top-notch!"
4.0,Great belt. Stayed clipped over a dress. Was a little more gold tone than I would have liked but it worked
4.0,"Needs to be double to use as a mask. Purchased Large size, a little tight around the nose. Does not fog up my glasses when using."
4.0,"This is a good onsie, material is soft, comfy and stretchy! Mama loves it!"
4.0,My mother  loves the shoe.
4.0,Exactly what it looks like. Size was right. It did come with a smell but once washed it was great
4.0,"Nice frames, great looks for the price."
4.0,Super cute I wish they were a tad looser like the pic but I got alot of compliments and they are comfortable. Wear em ladies!
4.0,"Very nice watch, the band is a little hard but give it time to break it in."
4.0,"I like this style of watch band because you can set it to your most comfortable level of tightness instead of deciding between too tight and too loose. The downside is the magnet isn't very strong and it does require adjustment throughout the day. This is fine if you have a desk job, but I would avoid this style if you have a very active job.<br /><br />It fit my Galaxy Gear S3 perfectly, with no issues."
4.0,You have to love the moo-moo  over-sized look. Its not too thin or thick or sweater like. Its more like a cardigan that's shirt material. I love to be wrapped up so i like it. Its tight around the holes where your arms go through and no stretch but I believe that's what gives it the mid arm length look.
4.0,I like the fabric. A bit too boxy. I will have to get it tailored to get a better fit.
4.0,Nice color. Fits well on my 8 inch wrist.
4.0,Very light did not pull on my ear lobes.
4.0,"This sweatshirt is a good value, excellent quality which should hold up for years. Nothing fancy, just good solid value."
4.0,I just thought it would be all pleather. But I love it
4.0,I like the boot a lot the leather very comfortable a bit more soft than the Mellissa they would have won if the back zip on mellissa didn’t allow the fit to be more snug
4.0,"I like that everything is not in yellow, some of the headlights do show yellow, where others show up as white, glare has been reduced but there is still some glare but it's better than seeing all yellow!"
4.0,Great little bracelet and nice story card. Not the best quality but still looked nice.
4.0,"I think these gloves are going to be OK.  They seemed tight and small at first, but are beginning to feel more comfortable as I wear them."
4.0,Very nice design. Nice price. Good size. Matches other Jewerly I have.
4.0,"Based on the reviews, i bought 1 size up and the fit fine."
4.0,"I purchased Adult Size Small (I'm 5'4"", 117 lbs.) Should have bought Med.  While there are snaps on crotch, no snaps on neckline which made this a challenge to get on and off.  Fits like a second skin!  Lined with a soft almost jersey lining.  Very stretchy so while it is extremely close fitting allowed me to move in multiple directions without pulling or feeling tight.  Think it will be warm in the ridiculously cold rink I've been skating in.  Gave it 4 stars only because I thought it was a bit small and should have opening at back of neck.  Otherwise looking forward to my skate tomorrow!"
4.0,"Odd sizing, so I had to guess based on other reviews. I normally wear S or M, but orders an XL.  Well made, substantial material. Took about 3-4 weeks to arrive. Will work if I never put it in the dryer."
4.0,"Kind of a weird fit in breast/ chest area. Very narrow, compact,not meant for someone w/ a broad chest. Like they put an extra small top on an extra large bottom."
4.0,The dress is lovely I just need to lose a little around my mid section.  I like the style and would recommend to others.  I am going look stunning.
4.0,Looks good and really cuts through he glare.
4.0,Ok for the price!
4.0,"Over all a nice shirt, but it does snag really easy. Good price ."
4.0,"I've worn this dirndl for Oktoberfest celebrations two years in a row, and it's both comfortable and attractive.  My only complaint is that the apron I received with it is a bit shorter than in the illustration."
4.0,"The fabric was good quality, not super warm but perfect for a chilly day out. I love the ear holders. My daughter is a petite 5 year old and it is a little big for her tiny face. I am happy with the purchase overall."
4.0,"Not bad quality for the price, however I did have to reorder as the large was to big.<br />I’m 5ft 10 and weigh 142lbs<br />The medium was a perfect fit."
4.0,Not as described but love it. (description says white but it is off white)
4.0,Love that they can hold cards and money.  Yes it may hang a bit with a phone or keys but its material.  I bought some for my daughters who are traveling abroad to visit me.  Just wish they had more fabric styles.
4.0,"I was surprised by these leggings. The feel of the pants are nice. They go up on my waist and don’t feel tight. They make my bottom look nice 😬 I really enjoyed wearing them they were comfortable.<br />Im thick, 5’3 162 lbs, thick thighs, thick bottom. I normally wear a medium and I purchased a medium and they fit just right.<br />That all being said I haven’t worn them for a workout, so I can’t speak for how they hold up during the workout. Either way, they’re nice leggings to have for lounging or casually going out."
4.0,cute but fabric looks cheap kinda
4.0,Better than just the seat but still a little hard
4.0,They came in a very nice box. Well packaged. They are a little bigger on the ears than expected but they do have beautiful texture and look wonderful. Also purchased the necklace to match. That was a little bigger as well. But again a beautiful look. Perfect for any occasion.
4.0,Very cute. Reasonable price for product but one needs to be much longer than the other -like a layering effect. I hooked one close and one farther down but they still looked the same length.
4.0,"It looks like the description, several people commented on how unique it is. A decent value for the price of costume jewelry."
4.0,Fit as expected look great but shinier than I prefer
4.0,Fit very well. Nice and stretchy and comfortable.
4.0,"I love the patterns on these and so do my boys! They’re almost 4 years old and about 35 pounds each, but have pretty small waists/thighs. The waist seems to fit alright but the legholes are definitely loose. Also, the “fly” in the front isn’t actually a hole. My kids had just discovered that with their other underwear and thought it was cool, so that was a little disappointing. Other than that, we love them and I’m sure they’ll grow into them better!"
4.0,Fits good!!
4.0,"Quality isn't great, but I wasn't planning on wearing this weekly for work.  I think it's perfect for special occasions.  Fit is very flattering and the length is really classy.  I;m 5'8&#34; and I rarely find dresses like this that hit just below the knee.  t"
4.0,"This is SUPER soft! However it is almost too small. I normally order a size or 2 larger just so I can 1) ensure proper fit and 2) I really like a big hoodie. I ordered 2 sizes to big to give me a big, soft hoodie to lounge in during cold months.  It arrived and fit perfectly as if I didn't order something too large. So needless to say this will never go in dryer."
4.0,"Funky Christmas socks, Although since the Xmas design is more at the top these still can be worn all year.<br /><br />The red pair  is all red with white like snow  poka a dots, cute Santa st the top,and on both side of the top.<br /><br />Navy and green with Orange is cute, has the orange poka dots, on navy, and green with orange poka dots, and zigzags in orange ,<br />At the top is written Merry Christmas , with some leafs, pattern is all over..<br /><br />Then Red and green color Xmas sock, and the red looks like a big Xmas tree against the green..<br />All cool looking holiday or all year socks..<br /><br />These socks are not real thick , but do look good with shoes are wearing around the house.<br />There big on me, although I have not washed them yet!<br />I wear a size 6 1/2 to a 7 narrow shoe, and hubby wears a 10 1/2 shoe wide..these fit him good.<br /><br />Would make a cute present."
4.0,Esta muy bueno y cómo dice el artículo gracias
4.0,I purchased this as a gift  She liked it.
4.0,Very pretty but also very short!
4.0,"I have a 33-34&quot; waist and ordered the XXL size. I prefer a loose fit over a stretched-spandex fit.The material weight is well suited to my gym workout and the fit is comfortable. Left pocket is shallow and has no zipper - my wallet fell out during a workout. Right pocket is deep and has a zipper - holds my cell phone with room to spare. Wish the left pocket were like the right pocket. There is a small flap on the back that looks like a pocket, but it isn't - not sure why it's there?? The bottom of the legs hits me right at the middle of my knee - looks good and doesn't bind during a deep squat. I will likely buy another pair of these."
4.0,This is my second pair. My normal cup size and it fits wonderful.
4.0,"It served my purpose, but it isnt look like the image. There are no pockets whatsoever."
4.0,"Color is good, fit well but fabric seems on the cheap side so I'll see how they hold up. Don't care for iron on butterfly but easily covered up with a top."
4.0,Nice fitting and very comfortable in the sun.
4.0,It fit well but when I washed it it shrank a little
4.0,Didn't like the extra large bill on this hat once I tried it on.  Sent it back.
4.0,Nice and pretty seems like they could break easily though
4.0,"I love adjustable knotted brsfelets & necklaces. And I really wanted a white leather one for this past summer.<br />I thought the $ was reasonable. I wore it all summer long , even in the swimming pool a few times. I was really worried it would fall apart or lose it's shape after getting wet. To my surprise it held up very well. The photos I took were taken today just before this review, NOV. 7th, 2015. The leather even kept it's bright white color .<br />I have a size 8&#34; wrist and there is plenty of room for a 9 - 9 1/2&#34; wrist easy , at least the white leather bracelet I received . The adjustable size all depends on the length of cording used for the bracelet.<br />The width of this bracelet is  1/2&#34; in diameter. And the braiding of this bracelet is fairly tight. I probably wore 90% of the summer, most of the time simply forgetting it was even on.<br />I'm going to keep my eyes open for more colors. 4 out of five simply because I would have liked to see the adjustable cord on this bracelet white like the bracelet itself.<br />THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄"
4.0,"Great material. Great fit - with one exception. I usually get XL or XXL. In this, I got XXL but it fits tight across the belly and chest. I can wear it, but it's on the tight side. Basically, it's a ""fitted"" cut, but it claims to be ""regular"" fit. With that one warning, it's a great shirt. Just a tad bit of stretch, mid weight cloth. great colors."
4.0,They are a little see through but not enough to expose you hehe
4.0,"The pink is a light pink, I was hoping for hot pink."
4.0,"This BASUDAM shirt is generally nice overall. It is well made, and the fabric itself is especially nice. I like the raglan sleeves because they’re flattering.  I do have a few complaints though. The shirt is exceptionally long, so for someone on the shorter side like me, I have to bunch it up at the waist/hips otherwise I look even shorter. And bunching it accentuates any extra poundage around the middle. My only other complaint is that the neck opening is a bit wider than I like. As you can see in the photos, I’ve worn a dark tee shirt underneath to show just how wide the neck is. When I’m out in the sun for an extended amount of time I want my neck to be protected. This is going to look a bit sloppy on me when I don’t have a tee shirt on. And I’ll have to make sure to apply plenty of sunscreen on my neck. Otherwise this is a great shirt.  And many of you won’t be bothered by the length or neck."
4.0,Great fit on the first try but not so much on the second.
4.0,Very excellent raw
4.0,"Surprisingly nice-looking, given the price. Recommend."
4.0,I received the order on time and well packaged. They were ever thing advertised. Sill I have to deduct one star because I did not receive the Calvert Covert authenticity card. I still recommend them as they look incredible!
4.0,My wife really liked this Mother's Day present.
4.0,I love the softness of this tunic. I can weary with leggings. It is thin so you must wear something underneath unless you are an exabitionist. Would buy again
4.0,"They are fine. Simple, as expected."
4.0,Works as excepted.
4.0,"Cheap material, but really fun dress"
4.0,Fit great. Not as tall as I thought. They slip down on my heel when I wear my work boots. So they are good for other shoes.
4.0,"I have a feeling this band will outlast my watch.  The watch outlasted the band that it came with. The band was a bit wider than what I imagined, and I had to cut away part of the plastic on the watch with a jewelers saw to make it work.  I could have reordered from the company to make it perfect at no cost, but I made it work and am happy with it."
4.0,I chose these earrings because I like the full picture of the sock monkey but I found the &#34;button&#34; to be rather cheaply made.  I enjoy wearing them.
4.0,Lindos y comodos
4.0,I loved the shirt but the material feels a little weird.
4.0,For my Granddaughter. She likes it.
4.0,Love how these make it easier to breath and are not bulky under the mask.
4.0,"I like the styles, quality and value. The window doesn't fog up until the first wash. I washed gently by hand and hung to air-dry. (It started to fog up after that. So I bought a small bottle of windshield de-fogger and carefully applied a thin layer to the inside. This helped much. Let it dry really good or there's an odor).  The mask is on the larger side (adult female, medium build)."
4.0,I love the bows but it's tight for my 2month old head. I didn't get a chance to let her wear it.
4.0,They're not quite the colors I expected but they are still nice.
4.0,Bought this for Halloween at work.  It worked out amazingly and could work in it easily
4.0,Love love love!! The I my problem I have with it is that it's a bit big in the bosom department. I don't have much boobage so there's extra there but other than that I love everything about it! arrived very fast! 3 days from ordering.
4.0,Beautiful  for the price. as shown in the picture. Loved it!
4.0,"First time I ordered this coat, I received a robe instead...  had to order it again and return the other.  Finally received the right item today and although I am a bit disappointed, I do love the look of this coat.  I normally buy L or XL in wool coats.  Per their measurements, I had to get the biggest they offered, XXL.  My measurements are 48&#34; bust, 35&#34; waist.  If you are big busted, this will not fit your bust area.  I could not button the bust area buttons at all, not even close.  The placement of the buttons in the bust area were too far over, I don't even think a 40&#34; bust (per their measurements) would fit...  The shoulder area was also snug.  Like another reviewer posted, I am going to relocate the buttons.  It does look good leaving that area unbuttoned though.  As far as wearing sweaters underneath, it won't happen with the way it is.  But, I love the flow and design of this coat and for the price I am going to make it work instead of returning it.  Point being, if you are big busted and/or a few inches over their waist measurements, this will not fit unless you adjust it.  It runs very small compared to 'normal' US measurements.  Adding a tip:  there is plenty of room to move the buttons inward, from top to bottom.  If you want to make this work for you, this is what you'll have to do.  Top bust buttons have 9&#34; to move, waist area has 8&#34; to move and the lower buttons have 6&#34; to move inward.  I recommend doing a simple button relocation if you love this coat and need a few inches give.  For the price of $36 you pay for this coat, it is worth the effort in altering to make it fit."
4.0,"Really nice color, a little small across the chest of I order again I would get a medium"
4.0,"I am writing this because I always try and read the reviews before I purchase! The skirt is super cute and looks like the picture. I am 5'3, 120 lbs and I ordered a medium. It was a little bit to big and I would have returned it but they were not offering a small. I will be able to wear it but it would have looked a lot better if smaller. I do think it is well worth the money, good quality!"
4.0,"Its do not fix,but its nice"
4.0,"This pillow cover is pretty much as pictured, and is good quality. The actual cover is a bit more green than yellow, for those who are trying to gauge that aspect."
4.0,It was perfect as a Christmas gag gift. The person who got it loved it. It was a big hit.
4.0,Awesome my son loved it !!
4.0,A little bit thinner fabric then I hoped but the price was very low.
4.0,It was a perfect charm to represent my nana who was an excellent baker
4.0,Cool shades for the price good deal
4.0,Cute dress for the price. I do wish that I would have gone up one size but I’m still satisfied.
4.0,True to size.  Perfect length. Super soft.
4.0,For reference I'm 5'2 and around 125 pounds normally wear medium/large tops and size 7 bottoms. I bought the medium and it fit good but was alittle tight in all the places that shouldn't be revealed as much! I would suggest that you order a size up so you have room to breath! But was great material and NOT see through. I wore it to work (in a lab) and it was acceptable for work attire. I added a tutu skirt to hide in the revealing areas. Everybody loved my costume! Highly recommend! Only gave it 4 stars for being just a tad tight!
4.0,I really liked but durability no good. Zipper broke after 4 months and the material inside the backpack reaped in some areas.
4.0,"These are good clear lens glasses. As my preferred style, I like the way they wrap around the head and stay on easily."
4.0,"They arrived a couple days late. I bought them for my 4 year old. He loves them!!! They fit perfectly. Only down side, only one of the shoes lights up."
4.0,Great watch. My ONLY concern is that the gold plastic scratches off pretty easily.<br /><br />You get what ya pay for.
4.0,"Good every day product.  Fit as advertised, cut is comfortable.  Would purchase again."
4.0,Seems to be heavy material. Buckle works good.
4.0,Got it in time. It looks great. I adore the colour though it's a little bit lighter than on the picture.<br />I guess potential customers would be happy to see more photos of the product.
4.0,"You can fit a large tablet or a very small laptop plus many items.  The bag itself is light but durable and very well priced.<br /> It's a good value.  I gave it away for aesthetic reasons only, and the recipient is very happy with it still, even after some 18 months."
4.0,I have really been enjoying this wallet. It is leather and kind of a greyish color. It holds 16 cards and has a clear slot for your ID. The wallet has RIFD blocking and has a small spot to hold change. It easily holds everything I need and is fairly slim. My only complaint is that it is a bi-fold with no snapping or strap mechanism so it frequently doesn't stay shut in my  bag.
4.0,"These things don't last forever, but they are fun for the price."
4.0,"In the bodice--some fit--some were too tight, but all long enough.<br />Until I washed them. Then they all shrunk.  BUT-- they all were still long enough to cover my rear end, which is why I bought them.  I'm only using them as an under shirt to pull over my b#tt when wearing leggings. And they have stretched back fairly easily in length.<br />I'm 5'7&#34;, bust: 44, hips: 42, waist: beer belly  :)"
4.0,"These are perfect for around the house, however too light-weight for outdoor use."
4.0,"This was very pretty and well worth the money that I paid for it.  I think a better chain would have made it look a little better but for the price, it was well worth it.  The seller was quick and had it packaged very well."
4.0,Smaller than expected<br />wife like it but unless use more that one get lost in you wrist
4.0,This shirt is really pretty. The shirt has a weird line down the middle but everything else is like the picture.
4.0,The first one I order got lost in the mail but when I ordered this one it was wonderful. It came in early but the important part is the design on the side is notice if you put it in right. My boyfriend loves it.
4.0,"Like the softness of both brushes; however, few of the strands keep coming off when brushing my shoes. I hope this is just part of the breaking-in phase because at this rate there will no more hair strands on the brushes after months of use...time will tell."
4.0,"I have not used yet, but I will say they look beautiful. I wanted something bright and they meet that request. The only reason why I didn't give them a five star is because these suitcases don't have the expander. What I was most impressed about being their customer services. I was having trouble with the TSA locks that are built on (love that). They got back to me the same day and a nice video to explain how doing it. Altought the instruction included explain, I for some reason missed reading it. User error not the product. So far super happy. I can't wait to use them."
4.0,"Although I like the cotton fabric and the fit, they wrinkle a lot. Also, they look about the same when they are short-shorts as when I let them down with the -one- side button on each side, unlike a bermuda length which should be a few inches longer. Also, the only way I can describe the pockets is: weird. Each has a half-covered button that is hard to undo and must be intended as decorative, as it doesn't fasten the pocket or open other smaller ones. I like the light grey color, so I'll keep them, but still looking for some really convertible length shorts."
4.0,I really like that these are inflatable. I plan getting another pair for the office. The low ones are fine with knee high boots as long as they aren't super soft.
4.0,"Nice and cute hats. One hat looked like it was missing a tassel of beads. Arrived fast, packed neatly, and they are what I was expecting. The white satin headband is a little slippery, but I ordered a similar set of hats from another seller, and their straw hat had a white satin headband as well."
4.0,"It looks cheap (as it is), but it is very pretty"
4.0,"This was used for a wedding party ! Very comfortable. Low cut in the top FYI. Great for work , parties, social events."
4.0,"Over a year a go, i went to vegas with my previous white time, and lost it in the club, i bought this one to replace it, came in fast, and is actually a better quality than the other one. Check it out if you're looking for bowties"
4.0,"The blouse is  nice  but what an odd color they sent me. I don’t know what the color is. I thought I ordered brown but it is not.  I thought I would try it bc I like the fit.  The only thing i can wear with it is white shorts or pants. It came with so many wrinkles.  I washed it and it still needed to be ironed. I wish I had turned it for a different color.<br />However, it is very nice material and plan to get another one in blue."
4.0,"If you are on the fence as to size, round down. I have ordered these exact shirts from another location for nearly twice the price, and round them here. They are exactly the same, but the large from there was slightly bigger than the large from the other place. I am about 5'7"" and weigh 180 lb.  The other reviewers are correct about the huge size. The medium was a much better fit than the large (I ordered one of each). I will order more, but will stick with the mediums."
4.0,"I loved these and do not have to worry about them falling out.  However, I was missing one of the little<br />tiny pieces that go in the ear."
4.0,"Based on previous reviews criticizing the durability of these shoes, we purchased these shoes for special occasion wear.  The shoes look great, and our baby looks adorable in his fancy shoes.  I have no complaints."
4.0,I thought that the bags was like hard but it's not. Anyway is very spacious and looks pretty nice.
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, and actually better built than I was expecting. Thanks Amazon, you came through once again ."
4.0,"Top fits small, bottoms fit as expected."
4.0,I love my ring!! It is adjustable and really pretty!! It fits perfect and I like the design and the style of it  the moon stone is gorgeous!! A great gift idea!!
4.0,"This is a much more adjustable and more comfortable band than a regular Fit Bit band. No holes, so you can adjust it exactly where you want it to fit your wrist."
4.0,Did not like the conrast between each half.
4.0,It's nice. But little expensive.
4.0,"The fit was perfect, the waist was where it should be and the length was just right. Other than that, my only complaint is that the fabric is pretty thin and I expected a thicker fabric given the price."
4.0,This top is great but I bought a size larger and it's huge.
4.0,The item came as promised. Good quality and a sound clasp. I would recommend this item it's a much more cost efficient way to achieve the same results.
4.0,Work well!
4.0,Fits good<br />Cooling<br />Like it so far
4.0,I did like the purse a lot. Unfortunately I had to return it because of the ring for the shoulder strap to connect was missing.
4.0,"I think I did order this a size bigger than I normally would, just to be sure of size, but it fit so well! This dress is a great casual dress and I'm looking forward to wearing it. So glad it does NOT highlight problem areas, as some dresses do. The color and fit are exactly as shown in the picture, very satisfying."
4.0,I purchased this product because the insides were NOT fluffy. I like that because my feet are not getting overheated while wearing them. The insoles are very comfortable.
4.0,"Seems like decent quality. The colors are very muted, olives and not quite what was expected, however, does the job!"
4.0,"I loooooove Maven Thread headbands- how they manage to be as absorbent, cute, and comfortable as they are is absolute magic. But with this 4-pack specifically, the color you see online isn't exactly what you get for the golden-colored one. It's more of a rusty brown. For that reason, I'll be returning them, but I will 100% be ordering more in different colors."
4.0,"Prwhen product mentions T-shirt,it should be the fabric of a T-shirt. I still like the way it looks on but not crazy about the clingy Jersey material Product exactly like description Received on time"
4.0,"It's great knowing I've added an extra bit of safety when walking the dog's at night.  One of the dogs is smaller so I like the clip feature so it doesn't weigh heavy on her neck since I remove it when we get back home.  It was a hoot watching them chase the lights at night the first few times they wore them, an added bonus."
4.0,I LIKE THEM. BUT I GOT A SIZE TO BIG. I WISH THEY WERE THICKER.
4.0,My son says they are super soft & comfortable
4.0,"These pants are a worthwhile, if specialized, addition to your wardrobe.<br /><br />PRO<br />-Very lightweight, foldable<br />-Belt included<br />-Zippered pockets<br />-Slant design of some pockets<br />-""Sheer"" fabric feel<br />-Quality metal button is not sewn in - nice button, too, assuming it stays put<br />-Button looks good (if anyone notices)<br />-Fast drying, good for kayak outings<br /><br />CON<br />-Lightweight fabric, not for working or skidding on your knees<br />-Some pockets are a little shallow (it's tolerable though)<br />-When your pockets are full, they will bulge a bit (a tradeoff for lightweight)<br />-Ask about belt before ordering (see CAUTION)<br />-Needs modest attention in cleaning and drying vs other items you own<br /><br />CAUTION<br />-Not for heavy work; I don't think these would hold up to our blackberry vines or pick-swinging activities with mud and debris flying.<br />-You may need to look up the universal icons for laundry (I didn't know them)<br />-The photo suggests a belt is included; I'm not sure as none was provided in this evaluation item"
4.0,The Tint are amazing but i left them in my car in a sunglass clip and one of the metal pieces on the front came off.
4.0,Super cute. I wanted something that would hide my weight. I am 5'2&#34; and 165lbs. I think it looks pretty slimming
4.0,"They are a little small overall and ride low in the back. Overall good, but you might buy a size up."
4.0,My son loved this though the gems are already coming undone after a week. Thick quality and fits just about anyone.
4.0,Not very comfortable but they work well at night.
4.0,"I bought this because I figured after a decade with an Italian charm bracelet I should have one. It's the sturdiest I've seen and shipping was quick, but I put 4 stars since I still prefer to do it by hand and am beyond clumsy using this tool."
4.0,"Originally bought this dress for myself for Halloween to dress up as Wendy Darling. It was perfect for the costume, however, not really my everyday style of dress. Its a wrap and the size is adjustable because of it being a wrap dress. Material was somewhat thin but overall good quality."
4.0,Fun!  Won't add too much weight to your current keychain.  My only complaint is that they only offer the guy-pilot design!
4.0,Works well for me. I use it when I'm jackhammering and it does well to keep the tool oil off my clothes.<br /><br />Suggested upgrades would be stronger buckle just in my case and more room to adjust the waist strap smaller in my case also
4.0,"A little big, but the quality has held up through several washes. I am pleased."
4.0,"I would give these a 5 star rating other than they run very small.  I ordered a size up after reading other reviews, and they are perfect.  They seem durable, and are WAY more comfortable than regular cotton boxers.  I don't think I can ever go back!"
4.0,"I purchased this product for my wife for Christmas.  The picture is a little misleading in a couple ways.  First, the pendant is no where near that size, approximately 1/2.  Secondly, the pendant itself is not as shiny as it seems in this picture either.  The pendant itself has a dull and unpolished finish.  The pendant itself is very pretty and seems to be sturdy.  She was very pleased and surprised with this.  I would recommend this pendant, but only if you are looking for something humble and classy.  If you are looking for something gaudy and that screams from your neck, I would continue to look elsewhere."
4.0,"Form fitting , rises up a little when u walk (if u have curves lol),  comfy dress though , can be worn with sandals or heels."
4.0,"This is a really cute dress. A small fit perfect but the top is cut way too big. Unfortunately, there was not a way to cinch it tighter. I am 5’6” 120 lbs and wear a 34B."
4.0,"Very comfortable and nice darkness on the tint. But the hinges are not heavy duty like the expensive ones the optometrist sells. Must be a different model. Otherwise, they are identical."
4.0,It's very comfortable I like it as a dress or with tights and a belt
4.0,Nice bracelet for young women.
4.0,"I used tea tree oil to deodorize, and orange oil I used, because it smells good. I used a cap full of tea tree oil 3 seperate times maybe 15 minutes apart with the zipper opened rub the oil in, in the inside of the purse, then I used 3 caps of the orange oil 15 minutes apart zipper open rub the oil in. I closed the zipper on the last cap of orange oil to lock in the orange smell over night, these oils did not leave any stains or film in the purse if you try it do a patch test first. The next day I opened the zipper , and I will keep it open until I carry it. If you decide to try this you can use whatever kind of oil you like, but I can say these 2 oils got the job done. The next day it just smelled like oranges , but it will go away after a while. I like the purse, its roomy, it has a nice long adjustable strap, and it is darker than the picture to me. Over all I like it... I hope this helps!"
4.0,So far it is exactly what I needed. Slim enough to fit in my back pocket and my large wallet when i dont want to carry my purse.  Right now it is a little tight holding cards but I expect it will loosen up as I use it.
4.0,Size small is TOO small. Size women’s 7.5 and they were way too small and are in the trash. Would have benefited from a med. I never saw a size chart so had to guess in size.
4.0,"Looks great, only issue is it smashes my nose and not comfortable to where for any real length of time. Other than that its great! I added some chains to it and the I.V. tube... PERFECT!"
4.0,Bigger than expected but worked ok for beach vacation  would order a size down next time
4.0,The product was as expected. Good value for the price.
4.0,Worked well for my multi-country trip! It definitely came in handy keeping all of my monies straight.
4.0,Good product but a little bit high in price.
4.0,"The jacket has stretch to it but isn’t flimsy, and the print is very vibrant. It looks accurate in the picture. I’ve received compliments on it and am satisfied with the purchase and price!"
4.0,Smaller than I wanted--1 1/2 inches--but very lightweight and nicely made.
4.0,I wear mine constantly and have noticed the outer color wearing off. I work at a desk on a computer so I am not sure how it would hold up to rougher use.
4.0,These don't go up high enough. Took these camping and they worked out well. Stayed dry. Just wish they went up higher on my leg.
4.0,"Cute, clear, easy to open and close. Folds nicely. Clear material could be a little thicker I think."
4.0,"OH, is this what I bought? Because the belt I bought works very nicely. It's a big three inch belt with velcro insides for adjustment and a secure buckle. But it's not the belt currently shown in the images, with the holes and all. Mine is just a plain belt with no holes or non cloth parts except the plastic buckle."
4.0,It fits really well!
4.0,It was a little short but she had on shorts underneath. I loved the dress
4.0,"The length of the chain was not as it was described.  It was about an inch or two shorter.  The owl watch itself is very cute.  A little on the small size, but very cute."
4.0,"super cute and not bad for the price, my only grip is that the bag is too small for my wallet so i had to use a coin purse and the seams holding the straps had a little fraying but nothing major. i used this bag for a solid 3 months before i noticed the seams fraying!"
4.0,"Really liked the socks, but a little tight around the ankles"
4.0,interesting print. a bit thin
4.0,This was a great gift for my husband.  I sent them to him during his deployment and they fit him perfectly.
4.0,Travel souvenir.  Works well.
4.0,Very good fit with just the right amount for f give. Generous crown. Fabric seems best for cool weather. Worth the money.
4.0,"Cute, but they have a &#34;dull&#34;/gunmetal look about them. I more than likely wouldn't have stopped my search for the perfect pair of tassel earrings...but paired with the right necklace, you will definitely be pleased with this product!"
4.0,I ordered a small. It fits like a medium on me. I wear mostly small but can do extra small.
4.0,Nice button but man it is small. You really cannot make out what it says unless you have a magnifying class.
4.0,They don't last very long.  They ripped quickly - but the color/picture was pretty.
4.0,A little big but if I put a bandana on then it fits ok.  And I thought I had a big head!!
4.0,"The problem is the sizing systems. My son had me order the next size up, and within two 'wearings' they are too small. Other than that it's a cool looking shoe and does its job well. He has worn them on indoor turf and outdoor grass and mud."
4.0,"I got the 7 inch and it was still a little snug around my wrist, which I didn't feel like I have large wrists. Might want to consider getting the larger one if you want a little more room."
4.0,I’m a medium and I went up sizes I ordered a 2x fits me fine
4.0,"I'm 5'9"" and the length of this shirt is my greatest dislike.  It's a drop back, so the length in the back is long enough to cover your booty.<br /><br />The length in the front is considerably shorter!  It just barely covers my crotch, so I don't really feel comfortable wearing it with leggings, which was my intention.<br /><br />Other than the length, the fit is good.  The shirt seems well made and the fabric is thin enough to wear during the warm months, but not see-through."
4.0,"I am not a purse person, I'm a backpack person. These thin glasses with the case included are perfect for slipping in my bag. The glasses are light weight and comfortable."
4.0,"Just what I was looking for! A fun pair of steampunk style sunglasses made my day, perfect to complete that steampunk outfit!"
4.0,"finally, a pack big enough for all my stuff. Only drawback is that the phone holder is a little too small to hold my Galaxy S4. good quality, lots and lots of zippered compartments. four weeks of use, no problem with zippers or anything . It's a good buy."
4.0,I like the glasses they were not damaged even though the package had been opened when they arrived - had a nice case and they now have a very expensive eye prescription in them
4.0,"I bought 3 pairs, all regular Small (not Tall); pewter, indigo, and charcoal.  First, the positives.  Very comfy, high cotton content, and unlike other pull-ons, there is a cord on the inside to adjust them (almost like a sweat pant) them; a big plus if you have wider hips and smaller waist.<br /><br />The pewter fit perfectly, including the length, with a low 1-2"" heel shoe (I am 5'3"", but petite pants are too short for me).  The indigo and charcoal fit smaller, especially through the rise, so more on the 4 side than 6 side.  The charcoal was shorter, and would have been too short after washing and drying.  The indigo was a good length and would have worked with boots after washing and drying.  A medium would be too big as they fit through the hips and legs (but not through the rise).<br /><br />I am very bummed only one pair worked as they are good quality construction, design, and material.  If they all fit like the pewter pair, I would have stocked up!!!"
4.0,For the money theses shorts have held up well. I wear them everyday and have had for a few months and they are good shorts. Cooler and dry fast. JB
4.0,"I love the tie dye design on this jogger set. The material however, is super cheap and thin. I really like the cropped hooded top. The fit of the bottoms is kind of odd but I'll probably still wear these to bed. I'm 5'5"" and 125 lbs, ordered the size small. Fits fairly well for my size. Since the material is more on the thin side, this set is great for the warmer months. I do wish the material were a little more like a thick jersey or sweatshirt material. It is, but it isn't... kind of stretchy. Still overall, a super cute set."
4.0,Nice band. Would have been better if the black strap had a gold tone buckle.
4.0,"i love that it has pockets.  gave 4 stars because it's not very flattering, makes me look and feel bigger than what i already am"
4.0,It's a very pretty dress.  Looks like the picture.
4.0,"Fits perfect, true to size."
4.0,I like it but it seems to run on the small side rather than large
4.0,Great material!<br />Sort of a small fit (wasn't able to order it in larger size)<br />Definitely feminine while sturdy.<br />Approve!
4.0,"Accurate color, soft fabric, but developed a hole. I just sew it up and keep moving."
4.0,"I am very happy with this shirt, although I have not worn it or used it. I hope it is made from quality material.  I ordered another shirt from this seller and they were hard to make contact with.  You can get these shirts in V neck or round neck but there was no place on the seller's page to indicate which  version you wanted. I hope they have added this to their page.  Huge variety of pattern.  Be sure to use their sizing chart.  Shirts seem to run a bit large.  I usually wear a Large, the Medium fits just right.  JIM H"
4.0,Dislike the fact that it's taking days for these to dry
4.0,Different than what I am used to. I think I am going to like it.
4.0,"Love the color, feel and fit. Thank you."
4.0,It was so nice and beautiful.
4.0,Love the shoe size up if you have a wide foot.
4.0,"Decent quality, really cute glasses."
4.0,The sash and crown are great and perfect for pictures but be careful with the crown it is fragile and don’t let the 4yo play with it for long it will snap
4.0,Comfy but runs a little small
4.0,"Very cute! My only complaint is that the sleeves run too short. I purchased a size up (medium, I'm 5'8&#34; 110lbs) and the sleeves still come two inches above where they should rest but are still too long to be passed off as 3/4ths. Aside from that it fits quite well and looks great if I push the sleeves up, haha. If you're taller than 5'6&#34; or have long arms I recommend going two sizes up."
4.0,Yellow is bright so I ordered the blue
4.0,This is awesome love the material
4.0,Good<br />Little brother liked it
4.0,feels warm and cover full face and head. Quality could be bit better.
4.0,Super nice just not near as long as pictured! It will still be a staple. I was just disappointed it wasn't longer.
4.0,"Pretty cool, large statement ring. Stone is a little cloudy looking, but nice. Setting is NOT silver, but for a costume piece its holding up very well. So far no green fingers or anything...."
4.0,"This watch looks much nicer in person than the in the photos . The only problem I have with it and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the plastic band is too long for my wrist and  cannot be adjusted like in the case of metal bands"
4.0,"I bought this for my mother's birthday and it is gorgeous, but I wish there was a longer chain."
4.0,"husband found them uncomfortable, only warms toes"
4.0,"I like the overall look and quality. I really like the quick release function. However, the buckle does not allow you to remove the belt unless you take the loose end out of the clamping part. It is a great belt, especially for the price. It looks and feels like it could tow your car if needed."
4.0,It’s really cute paired with a cardigan..
4.0,Good and comfortable mask
4.0,So far so good. Breathable Material.<br />Nice fit.
4.0,These are great lanyards for the price. I do wish that the clips were a bit larger to open wider to accommodate masks.
4.0,"Looks great in person, good quality.  It reminds me of NVGTN leggings. I was recommended for a size medium and the chart said medium too. They fit but i have some lose areas by the bootie crack and in the front below waist. I could have done the small for a snugger fit. Overall i love them, i want more colors"
4.0,Material is different  and the red is a bright red not a deeper red like the picture. It's comfy.
4.0,I love the colors but thought the material was more cotton like but was silky like .
4.0,Met my expectations. Looks exactly as in the photo.
4.0,Looks good like the picture 👍👍
4.0,"I love how this hoodie fits and feels. I thought it was kinda funny that they used a shoe lace for the hood tie, but I pulled that out and I am very happy."
4.0,Cute but the shorts scrunch up when you sit down making the outfit look not so put together.
4.0,"daughter loves them, look tuff!"
4.0,grandson likes to wear it for his gamma
4.0,"From the reviews, I had read this ran really small so to get up to 2 sizes bigger. I'm normally a medium, so I got the XL and it was too big! I was going to exchange them but their policy is a little weird so I didn't do it. But they felt nice, just didn't fit around my thighs (22-23&#34; thighs) as they were too loose.  I'd probably try again at a later date."
4.0,"The material is as expected. Nice, breathable and lite. Fits a little on the smaller size,"
4.0,These came as expected. Not the best quality boot but as always you get what you pay for. They were perfect for my office position that requires me to have steel toes for when I walk out onto the warehouse floor. These are light and easy to put on/take off. 2 months later and they're still in tact without any issues
4.0,Perfect for the price- good lenses. i was hoping they would be a little darker tint but not a deal breaker
4.0,"I got this coat in a size 38 which id say equals to US size 4or size small or between S and XS depending on a brand. Kooples sizing is supposed to be french but it is off. Definitely runs small! I could've gotten 40 to wear with thicker sweater and i get tops italian size 38-40. So id say Kooples is much closer to italian sizing than french. Their chelsea boots also run super small. At least 1 full size, maybe more. This coat has 4 pockets in a front and each has leather piping. Also buttons are leather which im not that crazy about how it looks in person. Shoulders have leather details on top. This seller is very good. Coat comes on a hanger, in a plastic coat bag and in a box. They accurately listed fabric content. It is 70% wool, 10% cashmere, 20% polyamid. All the leather parts are lambskin. It is made in Romania (this info is on the tag inside of the inside chest pocket). Original tag is attached, price on it is $795. It fits really well. Classic peacoat silhouette. Sleeves are long enough although my arms are quite long."
4.0,"They are perfectly comfortable, but  of course, they don't keep their whitey brightness very long."
4.0,"It's a little bigger and fits a little different than I thought, but overall love it."
4.0,"True fit, I was expecting more the color in picture only reason returned"
4.0,Super cute but after a month starting to look a bit shabby
4.0,very nice comfortable strap. not fancy just plain. I just hope that it wears well I use my strap every time I play or practice.
4.0,Love this set. Got it in two more colors. Cozy yet flirty. Only thing I’d change is elastic on bottom of crop top and looser elastic on shorts.
4.0,"Good material, fit as expected"
4.0,"Ordered these to wear around the house and work out. The shorts stylish and look good. I'm 6' foot 220lbs, athletic build. My waist is on the smaller side and I ordered the large. Usually large is a hit or miss for me but these fit well. The annoying part is that they tend to slide down your butt and you're constantly pulling them up. Tieing the drawstring does help, but it still happens. Overall these are great shorts for the price and I would not hesitate to buy them or recommend them to friends and family."
4.0,"Yes, had to order one size up my self, but nice ring!"
4.0,"The material is soft and comfortable, and warm enough for our Wisconsin winters.<br /><br />I ordered it in the Apricot color, and it is a much lighter color than it appears in the product photos.  It is what I would call an off-white color, which does not go well with my very light skin tone.<br /><br />Sizing seems to be correct.  I ordered my regular size, Small.  I'm 5'2"" and 99#. It fits just right.  Overall it is a very basic sweater; no 'wow' factor to it."
4.0,Love the colors and how it fits
4.0,I like this product - a perfect fit as discribed. I like the design as well.......a little tight but okay.
4.0,"Loved it, very soft, a nice green color. Would recommend."
4.0,"The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating is because the box it shipped in was only slightly too small and created 4 corners on the brim where they were compressed against the sides of the box for shipping.  It is not extreme and will probably round itself out with some time and wear.  The hat looks just like the picture, the elastic sweatband keeps it snug on your head without being tight and the material feels sturdy.  Very happy with the hat overall."
4.0,Fit perfect didn't care for the weighty material used for the sleeves. Got tons of compliments even from other women .Wore for a Halloween birthday party and a little bar hopping<br />😉
4.0,"I ordered this item and was so excited to receive it! When I opened the package my first response was absolute happiness. The quality is fabulous. ZERO complaints about that! However, when I really looked at it, it appeared to be on the smaller side. I did read the previous reviews so I ordered a size up, but still to small. When I tried it on it was not even a close fit....... I will possibly order it again in a bigger size, because it was beautiful and well made. The only reason I say &#34;possibly&#34; is because I was ordering it for a special event, and the event will be over by the time it is returned, and reordered. I definitely recommend.................. Just order several sizes larger than you would normally wear! I am a small normally, I bought a medium. I would probably need at least an x-large."
4.0,These are really lovely and have been very beneficial to my meditations.
4.0,"I love this dress.  It is so comfy, and cute!  Am busty so ordered a large, fits perfect.  Quality is ok, haven’t washed it yet, but will probably wash on delicate and line dry."
4.0,I hope they work ok .We use them in our face mask for the corona protection.<br />No complaints.
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This necklace is very dainty, simple, and elegant.  The chain is very thin and short.  The green crystal is very vibrant.  The necklace provides a lovely, minimalist look.  The only thing I don't like is that the green crystal is fixed and doesn't slide across the chain.  So if the crystal is not in the right position you have to move the whole necklace rather than just the stone.<br /><br />The necklace comes in a little black velvet pouch and is suitable to give as a gift."
4.0,"These are great. Very cozy, but they do tend to slip down after a while of wearing.  I started wearing them over my workout pants and that helps them stay up, but on bare legs they slip.  Super cute though"
4.0,Love the dress just super see through
4.0,It was pretty but one of the feathers fell off but you get what you pay fir
4.0,"These are very pretty strappy platform front tapered slip heeled silver sandals.  Just the right height, but could stand a bit more cushioning in the foot bed (these feel very hard).  They are also a bit 'pinchy' across the toe front where the straps come across the front of the foot.  Going to return for a 1/2 size larger.  Since these were to arrive locally after I would have departed for the event these were to be worn at, I'm having it delivered to the event hotel.  Switching to a different location (from Florida to Texas) suddenly makes this Prime Delivery available on Mon 7/23 vs Tue 7/24, which is so odd!"
4.0,It fits great but sleeves are a tad shorter than I’d like.. good quality shirt
4.0,Nice and funny looking
4.0,"Pretty and practical! It's a little heavier than I expected, but I suppose that keeps the glass from breaking easily. This weekend, the magnifier came in handy while I was assembling an intricate photomosaic puzzle. I was glad to have it!"
4.0,"Polish arrived with some product on the outside of the can. After initial clean up( not too bad) it has been just fine. I have used Kiwi brand polish for years. I like it. I think Lincoln wax shines a lot easier, however in my opinion Kiwi leaves a “darker” shine, if that makes any sense. They are both black. So personally, I use both. If and when in a rush, definitely will use Lincoln Wax. .Don’t worry about the “white stuff” in the photo"
4.0,"Very cute girls trench. So many compliments! The sleeves were a bit long, but we were able to cuff them. Looks more costly than it was."
4.0,"This bathing suit is adorable. It looks exactly as advertised in the photo. I was interested in it because of the high waisted bottoms and they are awesome. They are pretty low cut with good back coverage. The rouching across the stomach covers my personal trouble area after having a baby via csection. I feel comfortable and confident in this suit for the first time in a while. I rated this suit 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of support and coverage on the top. I'm definitely going to buy cups to sew in because the cups that pop/slide into pockets don't really cut it. I probably would not be able to wear this to chase my son on the beach as is. I wear a size 14 and L/XL top and I ordered a 5X. I don't like my bathing suits super tight though, so I probably could have gotten away with a size down. I was able to purchase this suit at a discount to try and give an honest review. I am always genuine in my feedback about products and all opinions expressed are my own."
4.0,"It’s a really amazing hoodie, but I mines a tad to small"
4.0,I didn’t like the material and it sags in the crotch. Pants were really long and I didn’t like the feeling of the material.
4.0,Looks great across ample boobs.
4.0,Just an inexpensive printed shirt. Cute for Valentine's Day.
4.0,Great running belt for early mornings.  I really like to be safe while running and this is a perfect item.
4.0,"Love these! They Are a bit heavy, even while lying down. Understandable, but prolonged wear causes discomfort."
4.0,"They are very uncomfortable and heavy, but I can wear them over my glasses and watch my welder do their thing! Great for brief moments.  Auto darken is sufficient to protect your eyes from flash burn."
4.0,"First, I want to talk about the fit. I am 5'2 and weigh roughly 129 lbs.  I normally wear a medium. But I had to exchange it for a small. The medium was too big and fit in an unflattering way. When the small came in, it fit like a glove. I wore this to my really good friends wedding. She is highly religious and so I wanted something classy with a bit of flare. This dress was almost perfect. The material does not feel cheap and the lace felt smooth against my skin. The material on the skirt is pretty thick. Maybe a little too thick for an out door summer wedding, but perfect for and indoor one. The style is elegant and the dark navy color was what I expected it to be. The issue I had that made it lose a star was that the pleated look on the skirt has to be done at home or by a dry cleaner. I did not have time to go to the dry cleaner since I had to exchange the medium size that initially arrived. Thus I had to iron it myself which was a little difficult because the pleats are in the front of the dress and the back of the dress. I am not a professional by any means, doing this at home was unnerving but necessary. If you skip this step, the dress will not be identical to the one advertised as the pleats will be barely noticeable from the shipping and packaging. Overall, I love this dress and will recommend to others. I will keep this dress in my closet, I like it so much I may end up using it again at a later date."
4.0,looks very expensive can not tell by looking at it that it is man made.  The colors are fiery . Reason for 4 is the chain is not of good quality in my opionion.  Easy solve I put on a different chain
4.0,Looks great on.. the pockets do tend to make it look like you have a little love handle action going on.... Other than that and the material being incredibly thin it is pretty on!
4.0,Great shirt for Holidays!
4.0,I loved the Pyro so I bought a Cryo but the vision isn’t the same
4.0,"Bought as an xmas present for my daughter. Color and cut is great. Material is not too heavy, but also comfortable and good quality. Love Moana; nice t-shirt."
4.0,Cute but kinda hot due to the material is very thick and heavy
4.0,"Band size is appropriate but cup size ran large.  Cute design. 30J or 32HH in Panache and in Fantasie, depending on the amount of stretch in the style. Cup was way too big in Freya."
4.0,Nice piece of dress up Jewelry
4.0,"But I only use them when I am driving, out in public they look to bulky when placed over my regular glasses and I don't like the look that is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars"
4.0,"Not soft, rough material"
4.0,"I originally purchased this for myself, but wasn't wild about the fabric.  It has no body, and is very soft. I should've read what the fabric was, but it turns out that my granddaughter really liked it, so instead of sending it back, I gave it to her. I bought a size L. She's about 5'3"" and around 160lbs, and busty. Fits well."
4.0,"Smaller than i thought, but is a cute pin for dachshund lovers"
4.0,"Just got it and can't wait to use it! It did have a packaging smell, so airing it out for a few days before using. But it looks better in person and the size is perfect for a day excursions, flight carry on, lugging around kids stuff, running errands around town...too many situations to list! I recommend it!  Giving 4 stars for the smell...and I hope the straps and everything hold up over time."
4.0,"I had already bought similar pajamas from this company in a small.  They were a little too small so I ordered these in a medium.  I love the feel of them, but they are a tad too big.  I will keep them because  I like them baggy.  I am 5’2”, 115 lbs.  Can’t  beat the price!  So comfortable to slip into in the evening after a shower.  Cuddle up with a warm blanket, a lap cat, and a good movie.  It don’t get any better than that!"
4.0,"Very cute socks and a fun variety too.  These are great to wear around casually or in work shoes but probably wouldn't be great for a lot of walking or if you need comfort and support for more extraneous walking conditions.  But if you want a light weight, comfortable and cute sock, they are a pretty good deal!"
4.0,Very nice. Not too big. Very simple yet glamorous.
4.0,"Ordered in a Medium per previous reviews.  Had to return for a large because the Med. was too tight in the shoulders.  The large was a bit too long, but made it work.  Very pretty on, flowy and comfortable.  Received many compliments."
4.0,Nice quality and beautiful gift for my friend
4.0,This bag is beautiful!<br /><br />I am useing this bad on a daily basis to go to and from work.  In it I carry the following items.<br />1. laptop (in a sleeve i bought separately)<br />2. 2 notebooks one for work notes one for workout planning<br />3. shoes<br />4. gym clothes<br />5. lunch box<br />6. Small purse<br /><br />It holds everything wonderfully and my only criticism would be that the over the shoulder strap doesn't have any padding which can be uncomfortable if you have a long way to travel or walk.
4.0,Normal fit with no complaints.  Nice stylish shirt which is a hit anytime worn.
4.0,"The boots are warm. I like the fur lining, it's very soft."
4.0,"Very soft materials, i was e xpected mid rise but arrived high rise 😢"
4.0,The outfit was so cute but there are pink stains that look like fabric dye in the white section. Very cute other than that.
4.0,"For the guys ordering this, it fit me [6 foot, around 150-60 lbs, and between average or slim build, idk] the size that converted to XL [I think I ordered an XXL?] fit me well, but zipping the skirt did take assistance.<br />Also shirt was tight in some places but decent when not sitting down, also keep in mind the skirt is a bit revealing if you're a dude"
4.0,"Usually need xs size in women, ordered M, should of got L."
4.0,Was just as pictured just writing was super tiny. Almost hard to read. Other than that its super cute.
4.0,Short on me. But I’m 5’9
4.0,"I'm a tall, slim guy and 8/10 medium is the right size for me... This shirt ran a little tight in the shoulders and short in the sleeve for me, but besides that, the chest and taper felt great. Returning for a large."
4.0,Great price and cute shoe!
4.0,my three year old son loves them
4.0,A little flimsy material wise but works great.
4.0,"These are very high quality tights with a good weight to them. They are not scratchy at all and my daughter says they are comfortable. The 140, which is a size 10, are quite a bit big on my slim/athletic build 9 year old who generally wears an 8/10. The waist fits ok, it’s the length that is too long, and she is average height."
4.0,Excellent dust mask
4.0,"After previously buying some shirts and being happy with the fit and quality, I decided to go for it and purchase this shirt. Again, pleased given the price  it will not last for years but get me through the season with multiple washings. It fit as expected and love the beautiful coral color. The material is softer and thicker than I had expected. Thinking of ordering another in a different color. All in all, a decent puchase Thanks Amazon"
4.0,"Bulb fits nicely, no issues with it coming undone or being too loose. My main issue with the earring is that it likes to flip around a lot. Since it is quite big, this can prod your ear or get caught on things. In my experience, it is often getting stuck in your hair or twisting around your ear. However, that is expected with a stud earring. With these minor issues, this earring looks great and is a cute addition!"
4.0,"These are adorable for the price, but the waist was soooo high for a short girl like me. I had to hem them too, but again, I'm only 5.2  The stretch and overall look though is very nice for the price.  Just know you'll have to wear a top over the waistband which fits more at the bra band level."
4.0,Shirt closes very high up; would have been nice if it was a bit lower. Otherwise very flattering. Will have to wear a camisole underneath because opening on belly is that big.
4.0,Like the shoes but a bit narrow.
4.0,These goggles were perfect for my kids!
4.0,Light weight. Cute cord. Good deal for the price
4.0,A couple of links were kinked or skipped but for the price it's a nice quality necklace.
4.0,shoes work great - warm and waterproof.  the unadjustable strap near the ankle was too tight and had to be cut off-- but now foot slides in easily.
4.0,"I'm 6'0 and 185lbs and These are tight and firm around my calves, but just not as much as I was hoping. I have another pair by Physix, and another, merino blend pair, by Wanderlust, and the Physix are the tightest and provide the most therapeutic value IMO. The Go2Socks are nice and pleasantly firm around the calves, and also some firmness around the feet.  I work Conferences and I'm on my feet some days for 16 hrs and I want the big guns! For days like those I'll use the Physix every time. But these I will use for travel and maybe lighter days, but if you are looking for even better socks at the same price point, go with Physix. I ordered all three pairs to see for myself what was best. If you can I would recommend that. It's possible the Go2Socks would be perfect for you and the Physix just too tight."
4.0,Happy with the product!
4.0,"Love the shirt, it's great quality just too big! Originally bought for my son but since it's too big, I gave it to my husband."
4.0,Toó small but they cute ....
4.0,"Only thing is I'm more of a 12 petite. It's snug on the arms and the waist is high. I think I should have ordered XL. But I will still try to wear it, no time to exchange. I'm 4'11&#34; 135 lbs 38/34/36."
4.0,These sun glasses are just a little too dark for me but otherwise they are well made and the frame is made of a plastic that is very flexable and should never break. I am a big man and they fit me ok.
4.0,These are really pretty and stay on really nicely.  They do run small though.  I wear an 8.5 shoe and they are really tight.  My toes broke through one of them the first time I wore them.
4.0,The table is perfect for our needs and matches our chairs from Nags Head Hammocks. My only complaint is that it is a little expensive for what it is.
4.0,"I got this sweat shirt because of the fine print. At first when I saw the stickiness behind the print, I was worried that they will eventually come off after a hot wash or dryer session. I haven't washed it yet, but i'll keep you updated. It definitely attracts attention because of the straight forward wording. The only thing I would say about this sweatshirt is that it comes it basically children sizes. If you're like me (i'm 165 lbs and have a 34 inch bust), I'd recommend going to the highest size they provide. I got an extra large and it's basically perfect  unless I gain any more weight.  Other than that I love the rich black color."
4.0,"For the price, these are great.  Long enough, and survive the washer and dryer."
4.0,Although it's cute as a dress my butt was hanging out when I bent over so I wore it as a shirt...Still super cute!
4.0,Not quite as pictured but still pretty.  They look better in the picture but still nice.  I wear them quite a bit.
4.0,Really good quality leggings.  They are a little saggy on my though.  I normally wear a small in leggings. I will size down next time.
4.0,A little tight on the arms but nice
4.0,It hugs your beautiful very beautifully
4.0,"This bra is absolutely gorgeous !  BUT you have to order at least one size larger than you are normally.  I now own two, and am sending one back, the one that is too small.  Otherwise, such an exquisite piece."
4.0,"I would almost say they're closer to teal than Jade Green, but it's not too far off and still a beautiful color."
4.0,"I couldn't wait to receive this shirt!  When I first saw it, I fell in love!  It did not disappoint!  Not only is it sexy and beautiful, but it is SUPER comfy!  I only wish that it was a little smaller.  I ordered a US small, which is what I normally wear.  However, it is a little too loose. I am hoping that it will shrink a little when I wash and dry it.  It says not to dry in drier, but maybe if I tumble dry low, it will shrink up a bit.<br /><br />The packaging was basic, as you can see from the picture, but that didn't bother me.  There is also only a small S sticker as the tag on the back of the shirt.<br /><br />Other reviews commented about the length of time it took to receive the shirt, but mine came within the guaranteed two days time with my Amazon prime.<br /><br />I also read other reviews that said the quality was poor and there were loose strings throughout.  I did not find that to be the case with the shirt I received.  As stated earlier, it's SUPER comfy and looks great.  Most importantly, it makes me feel great wearing it!<br /><br />I would have given it 4.5 if I could.  The reason for the 4 stars is the sizing issue.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.  I do most of my shopping online and rely on reviews, so I would never falsify or upsell something I wasn't completely satisfied with."
4.0,"here is an update I love the darkness of this lens I love the sturdiness of this lens however it is polarized and I can't wear polarized because they just give me migraines. So I had to get a non-polarized lens I wish they had the exact same lens with the exact same shade in a non-polarized so I could enjoy them since I work outdoors all day long and need a good dark lens......They are larger than the original oakley legs, so they sit on the cheeks/face. Lens is very dark. Wish they made a mirrored version also."
4.0,"Nice gloves.  The first pair was too small, despite measuring before ordering.  The replacement pair was delivered in 3-4 days and is much better.  It is still not a great fit, but I think it will be OK when broken in."
4.0,"I am wearing this scarf today.  It is very pretty, but much more purple than what it looks like in the picture."
4.0,Love this shirt. Will buy more!  Very comfortable.
4.0,"Little fraying around embroidery, but easily trimmed up. Flows beautifully, fits well. May grab in black."
4.0,Look as pictured
4.0,It is very soft and the person that received it as a gift liked it a lot.
4.0,"Cute, fit is slightly small"
4.0,The product is as I assumed.  Fit is perfect and the price was very reasonable.  Would order from this supplier again.
4.0,Looks nice on my husband but the fabric is very thin
4.0,These earings are nice and can be worn with almost everything. The design is very simple - a silver rectangle with 3 peàrls each. The design could be more graceful but nice enough.
4.0,"Great value. Easy to install. The rose gold shade is not a perfect match to that of the Versa, but for the price you can’t complain! Wish it came with slightly shorter size. My wrists are small and I have to practically double the band. But magnet works great so far. Stays in place well and very comfortable."
4.0,"I can't believe there isn't a light pink.  With lots of use, a few have fallen apart.  But they're a good size for my barely 2 year old."
4.0,too small had to return but of nice quality.
4.0,"I would give this strap a five star if the links on the ends weren’t so big. The left side always hits my live viewfinder. Other than that, I’m happy!"
4.0,Pretty and inexpensive gift idea.
4.0,Fits as expected and very soft. I had to cut my strings from hood part since then hung passed my waist
4.0,"My daughter likes and wears this shirt but the sleeves are a bit looser on her arms than she would prefer. For the price, it's a fine shirt."
4.0,They fit well and the quality is what I like
4.0,Smaller then I was expecting but I'm happy and it is pretty
4.0,They are ok but I was expecting something more like 3D something like that
4.0,"About what you would expect for the price. Fit well, fairly comfortable, but not sure how long they will last."
4.0,"I loved the quality of the this hat. The colors were pretty, the hat seemed to be made quite good and would last for a long time. I would definitely recommend this."
4.0,I ended up buying two. They were to different manufacturers. They were both awesome.
4.0,A bit see through in the mid section. A very nice fit otherwise and it is a quality made garment.
4.0,"I received mine today. First thing I did was wind it up to make sure it worked ok and kept proper time. Next I changed the band to a Speidel twist-o flex metal type (a personalized choice.) I really like the overall design of this timepiece and the simplicity of it with the ""Soviet Look"" about it. 8^)<br /> The only issue I have is, it's advertised as having a rotating bezel. I did not get that feature but probably would not use it much anyway but still. These are reconditioned watches with new cases. That might explain the difference but they should omit that feature in the description."
4.0,"Very cute necklace.  Adjustable and very comfortable.  It seems a little too light so it doesn't ""lay"" against the skin evenly.  Hoping it will lay better after many wearings.  I love the combination of ""pearls"" and ""gold""."
4.0,Very cute and light<br />a touch narrow through the shoulders<br />synthetic material gets stinky if you sweat in it
4.0,Great dress!  Plain and simple.  Zipper got stuck on loose threads.
4.0,Cute but the bridge is very small. Might be best for smaller frame faces or young teens.
4.0,I like the watch but the photo showes a brown leather watch band and I got a black one which I do not like as much
4.0,little short for a big man
4.0,It's very cute!
4.0,This dress is very pretty and has a cute bow detail tie around the neck and a flared Hemline. It came to me in an extra large so it’s hard to talk about sizing because I normally wear a medium. Probably runs a little small because the extra large isn’t that huge on me I probably would’ve ordered a large and I usually wear a medium. Falls right above my knee. It is not lined and the material is a little cheap feeling. The color green is very pretty though! I’m 5’6” tall 145 pounds 34 B chest.
4.0,The skirt actually looks the way that you see it in the picture I just expected to look different on me but the product was well-made I give it 4 stars
4.0,My mom liked them as a birthday gift :) . Very well priced.
4.0,"This is a cute long cardigan. I like that the material is thin enough to wear even on warm days. The length is perfect and it is flattering. The only bad thing about it is that the pockets are too far back, making it unnatural and uncomfortable to actually use them. I'm still keeping it though because other than that it is very nice. Good quality."
4.0,Definitely for your knuckles not your main fingers. Works well for pinky rings and for top of the fingers.
4.0,Doesn’t draw together very well
4.0,"This robe is very soft and cozy. It will be nice and warm over the winter. The fit is a little boxier than I expected from some of the photos, I was hoping it would be slightly more feminine tapered from the armpits to wider at the bottom. Instead it goes mostly straight down. I am 5’8” And 130 pounds. I ordered the light grey hooded one in XL, but even so, I was hoping it would be a few inches longer and closer to the ground. The sleeve length is perfect, (but I do have long arms, someone with shorter arms mat swim) But neither of these critiques are enough to make me want to return it because it is so soft and cozy. The models must have been pretty short in the pictures! Overall i am happy with my purchase, but was just hoping for a slightly more feminine cut. Maybe if I get motivated enough, i will alter it."
4.0,"Like other reviews, they are not compression. Bra is needed to. They are just cheap work out tops, good quality for the price."
4.0,I loved these socks but the metal clips that hold the socks together in pairs kinda &#34;pick&#34; the socks so be very careful when undoing the clips
4.0,It's nice. The buckle is a little on the big side but the leather is thick so it works.
4.0,Its fine. Fits okay and accepts filters
4.0,"I love it, yes it is short, and you have to be careful bending over, and wear clean panties, but I like showing off my legs an this Skirt shows all of my leg that the law will allow here in Michigan, if you are careful on what you do when you have it on. But it does turn heads walking the Dog in the park, an am not sorry to say I love it."
4.0,"Pretty hat, good value."
4.0,"A little big, but after a couple washes they fit better & have some room to grow."
4.0,This brace is very good at performing its main objective which is protecting your ankle.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of how long it takes to get the thing on and off.  If I was to suggest an improvement it would be to ditch the lace up and make it all velcro.
4.0,Got this to slip over my bathing suit nice soft fabric perfect for the use that I intended has pockets and is well cut
4.0,"The bezel is beautiful and works fine.  The only problem I have is that I bought it for a 1889 Morgan, which it should have fit according to the product description, but it's loose and the coin moves around in it."
4.0,Good quality and they look gourgeous but when I received the belly rings one of them had pieces missing to it :( also the dangling part falls off a lot .
4.0,I liked the product other than they went up to high.  They went just above my knee but I need an XL sock.  Overall it is a good compression sock.
4.0,"These socks are exactly as described - cushioned footbed, cushioned shin area, comfortable banding that stays up and isn't too tight, and nice feeling fabric. The merino wool blend washes well without shrinking. So far, these are wonderful socks!"
4.0,"Love the material- nice weight for tucking in a pocket or purse. Fit over my rings and manicure without catching or snagging. Worked well for driving. I was not able to use my touchscreens with the gloves, but still gave 4 stars because they are a nice glove overall."
4.0,These are a gift for someone else.  But I do like them.
4.0,"I am quite pleased with the quality of this umbrella, however it requires a lot of force to close/collapse it!<br />After struggling, in some awkward situations, to close it, I discovered that it is much easier if the top is placed against the ground or a wall, and the handle is firmly pushed until the sliding ring on the shaft has locked in the closed position. This method is much easier than trying to grasp and pull the ring down the shaft to the locking mechanism, especially when hands and/or the umbrella are wet and slippery.<br />This method is possibly well known to many, but it was a welcomed discovery for me! : )"
4.0,Very pretty but that is it.  I wish I still had the packaging because I would return them.  When I didn’t like them I thought my granddaughters might like them.  No one wanted them.  They aren’t practical.  They are sewn right up as close as you would probably dare go to the face.  I really wish that I’d never purchased them.  I guess I will just throw them away.  Didn’t cost a lot but a total waste of my money.  The only reason I gave the stars that I did is because they are really pretty.  A waste of my money
4.0,"I really love everything about this jumpsuit except how quickly it wrinkles. The color, the fabric, how lightweight it is, and the fit - all of these are absolutely perfect with this jumper. The only thing that is a little bit frustrating is that it wrinkles so fast, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to get them out. This creates its own unique look, but I am not a fan of that look. However, the jumpsuit itself is so adorable and fits so well I might have to get over the minor annoyance 🥰"
4.0,"Was a bit tight, but overall very lovely coat. I always get compliments when I'm out in it."
4.0,"These are one but sort of small for. The xl ratin.i will, however be keeping them returns are too much of a hassle..."
4.0,This lived up to to Russell brand.  Has not been washed a bunch of times and that is the true test.
4.0,"The cap is comfortable,soft,light.It worth it's money."
4.0,So far rso good nice band
4.0,For the money this is a nice little shirt.
4.0,The piece for your mouth is a little to small.
4.0,"I’m 5’ 8” and 175 lbs, 36D and ordered a large. Definitely lots of room and flowy, just like on the model. Length dusts the floor, which was a pleasant surprise - this is definitely a good one for the tall girls. The straps cover my bra straps, which I was happy about. (Looks like some other reviews were looking for skinnier straps.) I think I could have sized down to a medium and would still have had plenty of room. The fabric feels like it’s going to grow, so not going to hang this one up - will be folding as I don’t want it to get any longer. Color was exactly what I was expecting."
4.0,"Fast shipping. A bit cheaper on quality than I expected but overall, a decent buy."
4.0,Great product. Nice and warm. I would order again in a different colour.
4.0,I like the color which is called Texas Orange or something like that - not blue as listed.  Fit is fine after wash.  It is thinner than other sweatshirts I have bought so I am hoping that this one will work out.
4.0,"I like the overall design of the shoe. I was hoping for the shoe to be a little more stretchy over the toes. Otherwise, I like the soft and quick-drying fabric on the top. The length of the shoe is exactly right, but the toes are a little snug if your child has wide feet."
4.0,"The material is absolute soft. I loved them and I always get compliments. However after a few hours, I do notice they feel tight and hurt my head a little."
4.0,Nice swimsuit. The bottoms are a little loss in the but. But at that price
4.0,Fits comfortable and the pockets fit my iPhone 12 Pro max perfectly. They com up above my belly button and aren’t sheer at all.
4.0,Loved these!  A little roomy but so soft and comfy!!
4.0,"This is an awesome looking collar. It has some scratches in the metal part, and the ending chain is a bit short."
4.0,"I'm 5ft2, 160 lbs, and a 40C.  I ordered the XL but it is a hair snug.  I can wear the dress, but it does feel a bit snugger than I would prefer.  I also purchased the Halter neck version with this same print, which fit great, however in that dress I purchased a large.  That dress has a stretchier back than this one does.  The colors are vibrant and the dress is very pretty. I was not a fan of the hook closure that hooks into threads in the back.  I would have preferred buttons."
4.0,Took a while to get shipped and the quality is what you'd expect paying $7 but it's cute!
4.0,"Fits well and the Velcro is nice and sticky. I don’t feel like it’s going to fall off. The parts where it connects to the watch wiggle a little but not in a way where I think it would fall off or break. For the price, I’m satisfied."
4.0,Owl is about the size of a quarter. So far keeps time well. I wish the face was upside down it would be easier to read on the chain. I can read it but I have to flip it around to see it correctly.
4.0,I love these pants. The fabric is great. They don't attract much lint or pet hair. You can dress them up or down. I wish there was some more room in the crotch area. I am a small and wasn't sure about sizing. I almost ordered a 4 but I ordered a size 6 and glad I did. I'd recommend sizing up! For ref I am 118Lbs and 5'4.
4.0,Could have more definition<br />Hard to see the paws
4.0,I have been very satisfied with the watch.  It has roman numerals instead of normal numbers on the dial but it is not a problem.  Dial is large enough to see.
4.0,"Needed these earring backs for all the wire earrings I own. Once you find the hole, they slide on slowly for a snug fit. Happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Doesn't for the greatest on my head but for the price, they are we'll worth it. The blue lenses are probably my favorite for cycling so far."
4.0,The fabric is thin and I have nails so I ripped them getting them on. I did go down a size due to other reviews and I would agree that sizing down is best.. only thing with that is the band. I had to cut my band out cause it was uncomfortable.
4.0,Did not realize that the matieral was ribbed (not my favorite) but the sizing is true to form and the cut is very cute.
4.0,"Great pair of leggings for this price. Very comfortable. Cannot see through them when I squat. I saw another reviewer comment about the looseness at the ankle. They are looser at the ankles than the rest of the legs, but not enough that it bothers me. These fit as expected."
4.0,Very loose because it has little dainty strings that hold it closed. So I recommend something to hold up the girls like a bralette or something. Really cute and sexy though!
4.0,It's very shapeless. I don't think the fabrics blended well. It works for wanted to wear conservative shirt to family or church events.
4.0,I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. The only thing wrong with the product is that the watch doesn't stay wound for a long length of time.
4.0,"Little on the big side for a large. But the good is thick, it's soft and the arms are nice and long"
4.0,Fit a expected.
4.0,"I love my wanna be Pit Vipers. They didn’t cost an arm and a leg, they look cool, and they fit my big head. Haha"
4.0,I love the feel and look of this dress but be careful.  The picture shows a black dress and the color says it is blue and also vice versa.  I wanted a blue dress and received a black one.  I am 5'3&#34; and an XL falls just below the knee.
4.0,Definitely order up a size but looks pretty good
4.0,"This product is just fine for someone who’s trying to save some money, but still look good in the gym."
4.0,This is a cute bathing suit and is good quality the sizing is a bit smaller then expected. I read to order two size up so I ordered a 2xl and the top fits perfect but it was tight on my hips others then that it's a great purchase
4.0,I like these! They are a little short and ride up but they are great for working out in.
4.0,Very adequate.
4.0,"LOVE this top! Actually, I love all the PattyBoutik items I've purchased.<br />The only problem I had with this particular purchase, and the only reason why I couldn't give this purchase 5 stars, is the seam in the arm pit  opened, plainly visible, after only 1 hour into wearing it.  I was out and not able to get back home to change which made the following 12 hours a little embarrassing and breezy on a  cold winter day.  It's an easy fix as it is on the seam and nothing unraveled but no fun the first time out and a little pricey to have been sewn poorly.<br />This is so far the only less-than-thrilled experience of the many purchases I've made from Patty.  I'm really hoping this isn't the beginning of a downhill slide."
4.0,The waist and tide trainer fits really well. It was easy to put on. It is great to use when you're doing squat. It really helps you sweat in the areas that you really wanna sweat. You will be sweating all over your lower stomach and also your thighs.
4.0,"I like the look of these, the only complaint is they are a little heavy. Can’t wear them all day."
4.0,Exactly what I expected. The dress fits my daughter beautifully but the shoulder straps are too big but I can sew it to fit her properly. The material is thin and perfect for our Florida weather. Two thumbs up!
4.0,Got exactly as seen online
4.0,THe enclosed insoles were a good feature for a better fit.
4.0,This set is very nice for the money. My guys looked great. Would buy again.very nice patterns.
4.0,I think these work just fine for the price.  Easy to put on and change out.
4.0,Like the colors a lot . Have tried one on . Seems a bit rough and tight but maybe washing these and wearing them a few times will help .
4.0,My daughter really wanted glasses so she picked these out. They came a few days late but after she opened the box she forgot all about  that. She wears them everywhere
4.0,"Quality is good. I just wished they have different widths for skinny or chubby kids. My 2 years old has average weight, and these fits my skinny 14 years old. I don't return. My 14 years old daughter likes them."
4.0,Decent material and looked good until the logo melted together in the dryer.
4.0,"overlook is good but zipper is very acerbity. mid-long sweater can cover my fat belly and buns. the only bad is zipper, feel so cheaper"
4.0,Love it fits great and looks good.
4.0,Colors were as expected. Not quite long enough for 5'9&#34; wearer.
4.0,"The whole thing is cool and cute. It's a bit too big for my little are/wrist, but cool. Price good."
4.0,"A little big for me, even though it size S, but it’s exactly how it looks and feels on the picture!! ❤️"
4.0,cute earrings for the price
4.0,"they are a little bit tough to get on feet - with this level of compression - but once get them evened out they do feel good .  i like that they are not too thick, and no bunching at toes, so they fit and feel comfortable in my sneakers. thought they 'looked' short at first, but do stretch and cover over calves.  feels like a nice even compression.  and i like having socks that look fun<br /><br />i wear women's shoe size 6 or 61/2 - i got the small size."
4.0,Little red item broke easily and tore I’m upset it only last few months
4.0,I love the pattern it’s really cute but it seems cumbersome and doesn’t fit correctly. I still wear it but I would not buy again
4.0,I got these initially for running but they roll up in my inner thigh but they are cute as athleisure  wear
4.0,Excelente  calidad lo único que si fue un lío ajustar la correa tube que llevarlo a un relojero  por miedo a dañar el producto
4.0,"The shirt is adorable, I love how long it is. Wear tucked or untocked.<br /><br />I am 5’3” and about 138 lbs. I wear a 32DDD and have a 29” waist. The shirt was very tight around my chest, and very very loose around my waist, like a baggy t shirt. It does not have enough curve for my body. Which is sad because it’s very comfortable and cute."
4.0,"I ordered this as part of my daughter's Easter outfit, she loved the color and the sparkle. She didn't care for how long it was, its much longer that the picture would lead you to believe. Overall, I am happy with this purchase."
4.0,Bought this for a red hat lady golf outing.  Put a purple flower on it.  Everyone loved it. GGlad I bought it.  Fit well.
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry for sure.  I bought one for each ear.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is actually 10 mm in width instead of 8 as stated in the description.  It would look and fit better had it been the correct size!!!<br />I'm pleased to say that I haven't had any irritation at all with these.  They may seem like they would be loose or come open easily, but they do stay in place and clasped securely.  I wear mine all day everyday and haven't had it come loose even once...not even when I leave them in while cleaning my ears (and flipping the clicker up).  Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />Update:<br />I've been wearing these 24/7 (4+ months) ever since I got them...even in the shower.  They haven't caused any irritation at all, and they still look brand new.  Others that I purchased in the past that were similarly priced as these started to irritate my ears and show wear within a few weeks.  These are great!"
4.0,pretty silly but strangely attractive.
4.0,"These boots are fabulous! Not once have I worn them that someone hasn't told me how great they look. The top is narrow enough to not flop around on my calf, and low enough not to be excessively hot in the Florida heat.<br /><br />They fit as expected and are very comfortable now, though I did have to have them stretched along the top seam (arch, under the strap). I also sprayed them with a water repellent as they are distressed leather and I didn't want them getting dirty or losing their already perfect look."
4.0,"These are the warmest gloves I've ever owned. They have two layers, which really helps. I have very small hands and they fit well. The only problem I've had is the Velcro that holds the mitt flap back when using your fingers came off. It was an easy fix though. I just sewed it back on."
4.0,Nice for the price. The rope is a little more plastic then leather I feel. Using them for a wedding. They will work for the day.
4.0,It looks nice but not sure if the lava rocks are real
4.0,"This was great for my 6 year old who wanted to be able to pretend to be a butterfly. However the handle broke off the very first day. I am handy with a needle and sewing machine, so no big deal for me. However, I know that this could be a gift ruiner for others."
4.0,I have loved Vuarnet products for years... I just wish these fit a bit snugger..
4.0,"My teenage step daughter loves these. She says they are so comfy and easy to put into her ears. She is allergic to nickel n cheap metals, so she loves that they r made of stone."
4.0,"I did not get to see this item being used, but I was told it was a great present! My granddaughter is only 2, but<br />she loves Abby. I can imagine the look on her face when she saw the wings and put them on! I also bought the wand, and I know she loves it! The wings looked like they were made nicely and were secured by a nice elastic. I think if the. wings are not abused, they will last! As far as I am concerned, they looked great, were made well, came earlier than expected, and were a good price."
4.0,Fits ok. But the golden is more of a rich yellow.
4.0,"Does nothing for pain, very stiff. But looks nice."
4.0,My girlfriends review -  Reading past reviews I see a lot of people recommending going a size up from your normal. I'm glad I didn't because I'm naturally very slim so mine fits me pretty much perfectly (the hem line on the bottom doesn't hug me like my other crop tops do but that's neither a pro or con because it still looks great and adorable!) I love the material and the colors/pattern are amazing :)
4.0,It's sexy and a good choice.
4.0,This dress is nice but runs really large. I am a size 6-8 and bought an M. It was huge. I would need an XS. Other than that the dress looks fine.
4.0,36&#34; bust is snug in size large.
4.0,Great soft shoe for around the house.
4.0,Got an XL and it is a tiny bit smaller than expected but it is of a nice material and really like it so far. :)
4.0,I love this dress ..i thought it was more drop waisted but still good fit
4.0,"Size was right, but I'm short, so they are long.  Other than the length,  they are perfect.  It would be nice if they were offered in petite sizes."
4.0,it is a very sexy c string
4.0,It fits nicely for my wife
4.0,"This was honestly a really good sports bra, comparable to some I’ve gotten from Victoria’s Secret. I took a gamble buying it since there were only a few reviews and normally I only like to buy products with at least a dozen or so reviews. I was impressed with the build and quality as well as the price. That being said, it didn’t work for me, because it runs a little large. The cups worked perfectly but the band was too stretchy even on the tightest hook.<br />For reference, my underbust measurement is ~30 inches and my bust measurement is ~34. I usually wear a 32DD or 30DD bra. I bought the small. The small, like I said, fit well in the front and was comfortable. I liked how it doesn’t give me uniboob and instead keeps the boobs seperate. I also bought it most of all, because it has adjustable straps. I am  short at 5’1” and like to have the ability to adjust the straps because otherwise things are just too long in me, so that’s nice. But it’s just the band was too stretchy because I had it clasped on the tightest hook and it still rode up a bit on me, and I want my sports bras bands to be very supportive and snug.<br /><br />Overall, I’d definitely recommend. Even though there are so few reviews sometimes you ought to take a chance! Just know that if your underbust measurement is 30 inches or less, the small will likely be a bit loose. Maybe it would work for low impact exercise."
4.0,Great quality for price! Very cute 😊
4.0,"This hat is really cute. Fits a little bigger than I expected, but definitely serves it's purpose."
4.0,Can't wait to see the results on some of the less warped facility cuesticks.
4.0,Really like them so far.
4.0,I ordered a size bigger as suggested and it fit snug. Loved the fabric and the deep pockets.
4.0,"I ordered these to wear on extremely cold days. With previous reviews saying they run really small I had ordered a large. I am 5'2"" 120 lbs and usually wear a small, size 26/27 or a size 2/4. I like how soft they are. There is some stretch and the waist is big on me but that normally happens because my waist is extra small. The thigh area was comfortable. I think if I buy again I will try the medium instead. Maybe if it was a little snugger it would keep me warmer."
4.0,"Cute, but bigger than expected."
4.0,"But please be careful - I bought two, both marked 2X but one was actually 5X.  I had sent them both to my dad who lives in the UK as he is really infirm now but he's not a 5X so he had to throw that one out.  So double check both the packaging and the actual size of the pants."
4.0,"Really great suit for the price! I am a little too long in the torso, and my boobs aren't as perky they were before kids, but this suit is still pretty sexy. The straps are adjustable which is always great. It is unlined, but I don't have an issue with that. It's not very supportive or smoothing and definitely won't suck your belly in for you, but it's sexy, simple, and cheap.  My husband likes it, so it's a winner.<br />I am 5'6&#34DD, 135 lbs, size 4 (US). I ordered a size Medium. It fits great, except that it is WAY higher cut than I expected, still not an issue, more of a modesty thing. Won't be wearing for the family shindig, but I do feel covered enough to wear with my kids."
4.0,"Got this for my mom, I already have one in navy and love how comfortable it is even on days I feel bloated!"
4.0,It’s a great watch for the price.  Very comfortable
4.0,It fits great and works good for what I needed.
4.0,The sizes run really small so I had to exchange it for an XXL for my daughter who’s a size 8.
4.0,"I do like this Beanie. I actually ordered the purple one as well. It is thick & no, at first, it does not look like the pictures but if you pull & tug at it to stretch it out to work it to look like the pictures,  it is a good slouch Beanie.  I paid like $3-$4 for it originally before the price went up. So, I'm not complaining.  Just work it in to your liking. It does slouch if you stretch it out right."
4.0,"Ok, so I needed a new case and this looked like it would meet my needs.<br />Pros - price is excellent, it arrived quickly, love the clear display for 3 slots of cards, feels great, looks good, and I like that the bottom is open so charging is easier because phone  doesn't need to be removed from case.<br />Cons - the part that holds the phone is only sides so it's not a secure hold, the magnet doesn't hold it closed so when I close the cover it doesn't cover the phone"
4.0,"Fit well, hold up to washing"
4.0,could be slightly larger. Fits tight.
4.0,This is super cute but it is definitely see thru it is now a bathing suit cover up
4.0,These are very small post earrings. They are pretty tho!
4.0,"Well, it is quite bulky in both the sleeves and the body.  I like arms to fit loosely, but this is VERY loose.  Also, the body is large as well.  Since I'm 5'10"", I usually order a large so the sleeves will be long enough.  They are definitely long enough.  Since I had already cut off all the tags, I'm not returning it.  Will probably tie it at the waist, so it looks somewhat fitted.  Oh well.  Material is nice."
4.0,Appears to be well made with very nice features. It will probably take awhile to break in but it is was just what I was looking for.
4.0,"Really great fit.  Not too tight, not too baggy. Super comfy."
4.0,"Have you ever tried to pack a straw hat in a suitcase to bring with you on vacation; I made this mistake once as I didn't feel like wearing it on the plane. And although I took good care to pack it nicely, I arrived at my destination only to open my suitcase and find my hat crushed. Well this adorable foldable hat by accsa is the ideal solution to always having a hat to protect you from the sun wherever you go. Whether it's an overnight bag, a beach bag, or even your handbag, you'll never be without some shade and style when you want it! Personally I think the style is one that would suit a woman of any age with it's open weave and medium brim. My Grandma used to crochet doilies and dip them in a sugar mixture to stiffen them and this hat reminds me of them with it's lace like delicacy. As far as size, I have a large head, or at least I've been told I do, and this hat fits me comfortably. It has a ribbon sewn in the inside brim should you need to adjust it to a tighter fit. As far as the sun protection claim the manufacturer makes ,I trust that it will do it's job in keeping me cooler and more comfortable. I use sunscreen so I will not be solely relying on this hat for total protection. The only thing I suggest is choosing a color that suits you best. Mine is a lovely carmel shade and I like it very much. I've posted some photos to give you an idea of how flat this hat folds and how it easily returns to a structure shape by adjusting the hidden wire in the brim. I hope I helped you a bit in your decision. It's a very cute hat."
4.0,"These shirts are nice but expect to get what you pay for!  As others have said, they are sized small so order up.  I usually wear an XS and the small fits me fine.  The material is very thin and somewhat rough.  I expected the fabric to be really smooth and soft, but then again for the price I guess it's to be expected.  Also, the material is very thin and I was hoping for something a bit thicker and warmer.  If you just need some cheap basic undershirts, though, they're great and overall I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,"A little short for people with a long torso so beware, maybe order a size up if you have a long torso."
4.0,Very nice earrings and not at all too small.
4.0,"The color wasn't exactly like the picture, it was shades lighter. The material is nice. The sizing is a little small. I normally wear a small, I ordered a medium and it fits...but not the way I expected/wanted. It fits a little snug and isn't quite long enough to cover my torso if I raise my arms. If you like your hoodies a bit baggy and long enough to touch or cover your butt go 2 sizes up."
4.0,I love the color but it’s rather small. I ordered the 2T-5T and it’s fits my 2 yr old but it’s a bit snuggly
4.0,Nice feel to the touch.  Nice fit for smaller ears.  Delivered on time.  Nice colors.
4.0,exactly what i needed to complete a collection of jewelry. does not look like costume. the only drawback is the loop that goes through your earlobe is a bit too thick in my opinion. they are beautiful none less!
4.0,Some missing pieces. But good quality.
4.0,My 15 year old daughter really loves the watch. It's very cute & stylish. She's gotten lots of compliments on it. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review
4.0,pros:<br />-cheap<br />-lightweight<br />-highly water resistant<br />-keeps good time<br /><br />cons:<br />-fragile wrist strap inevitably breaks after 2-3 years and a replacement band costs as much as a new unit<br />-night light is weak and barely illuminates half the screen
4.0,Haven't worn it yet...but arrived on time..looks nice..fits right... material is little more transparent than I expected but it's still a sexy look
4.0,I love this top. It fits perfectly. I purchased a large and I a D cup
4.0,"Very nice handbag. But the wrist strap broke on the first day. Glad it wasn't more pricey. I'm still able to use the shoulder strap which is why I didn't rate it lower. It fit everything I needed, including all of my cards. I'd recommend it, but maybe not if you plan on using it for years. It's a good short term bag."
4.0,Working well bit heavy.
4.0,"Dress feels a bit on the cheap side, but it fits great and I received a ton of compliments when I wore it! Love the baby blue color!"
4.0,"This is such a pretty color and the fabric feels great, but it's way too small. I always check the sizing charts and read reviews and follow the advice for sizing so this was disappointing. My daughter sure is enjoying it though!"
4.0,Infinite adjustability and doesn't feel clammy.
4.0,This is not the same pair I bought before. CAN I RETURN FOR EXCHange?  They won’t fit<br /><br />  I use these because I lost one of my 2ct diamond earrings while camping using the traditional screw type backs. My earring was in my sleeping bag when I unrolled it.  Using these backs I have never had them drop from My ears.  Bought two more pairs for my daughter who always loses her earrings.
4.0,"Super cute and did not fade but the only problem is the metal rod that the pearls are on is getting sorta worn down, so im scared it might break"
4.0,Very cute. The color is navy blue and white thought it was black and white  but still cute.
4.0,I ordered a size up because I wanted it to be long enough and it still hits above ankle I’m only 5’4” I do have long legs but a medium should have been long enough according to the size chart disappointed
4.0,"Super cute top, flattering cut, looks great on your shoulders. This top has no stretch at all, order a size up if you are busty."
4.0,Purple is my favorite color live the sunglasses and I will enjoy it .
4.0,Would be 5 stars but material has no stretch to it.  Will be cutting and tying like a crop top.
4.0,"This is really cute and comfortable. It would be much better in a rayon challis instead of polyester, but it is still very easy to wear."
4.0,"Great shirt but definitely runs small, usually wear a s/m in shirts but ordered L and it fits well!"
4.0,"just another hat for my collection. Good quality, wears well. Will buy it again when it dies."
4.0,"Ok here we go, I really like this glove.  It’s a really cute gloves, only thing I didn’t like was that they didn’t trimmed the two fingers for the touch screen properly so it’s a little bulky at the finger tip  .. So I have to restitch and trimmed . I did it myself Because I will be traveling in two days and need these..<br />Touchscreen works great.. overall no regrets"
4.0,"The shoulder straps are too short to feed baby well. I need to push the strap off my shoulder to be able to pull the cup fabric under my breast enough to feed. Otherwise, it is comfortable and I think it looks great on me as well."
4.0,These are very thin but work well for party favors.
4.0,Love this dress I brought it for my daughter high school homecoming dance. She normal wear a large or extra large but I decide to purchase a XXL glad I did it fit really good on her. The color is red or wine I will be purchasing more of Missmay.
4.0,"Reasonably priced. Thin material, but comfortable."
4.0,Was a bit bigger than I had hoped for with no shrinking
4.0,Its a beautiful watch and unique compared to all my other watches. Love the color and the design. Will buy others like it.
4.0,Great quality! Hoping to exchange for a larger size.
4.0,Very nice and unique cufflinks. Was a gift for 10 year anniversary so the real dime was especially meaningful. They were a bit more expensive than most cuff links but likely due to the use of dimes from the 1940s.
4.0,I only gave 4 stars because the swimsuit has a vinyl picture on it and when it came it had melted in a few spots and stuck to itself. The company was FABULOUS about it and refunded me instantly without wanting the product back. The suit itself is nice. The zipper being in the back is great because normally it’s under their chin and that’s annoying. The hat is super cute as well.
4.0,Nice style but very thick fabric for a capri.  Was expecting it to be more for summer but kept
4.0,I got so many compliments! Love everything about this except last time I wore it I was outside for hours and ended up getting a mark/bruise on the back of my neck from the metal neck piece.
4.0,"Good for motorcycle riding keeps dust, bugs etc out of your mouth. Good UV protection too. Easy to breath through.<br /> Not meant to be used as mask for Covid19 because of thin material."
4.0,"Pretty basic, I expected more comfort using this product"
4.0,It is better quality than I thought it would be. Excellent deal!
4.0,"The top fit well around my ribs but the cups were a bit small, which is to be expected for me, as I am 32D<br />The bottoms fit very well up over my hips, but is way cheeky.<br />Overall, it’s great!"
4.0,Nice sweater however I sewed the turtleneck down as it wasn't two sided pattern and showed the it.
4.0,"These shoes are cute and easy to get on and off, but they run big."
4.0,Runs large  I thought these were daredevil tho I don't see daredevil on inside tag like my others do  I know they don't sell daredevil in Guess stores.  Still fit was good
4.0,I like the variety of pens’ nibs but some came without been cleaned or correctly sharpened. It is still a good value for 10 of them.
4.0,Everything I expected. I just wish I had choose a different shape. My fault. Other wise very nice.
4.0,"I bought these for my swollen feet as I am pregnant and can’t really wear most of my shoes. Amazon account is under my husbands name lol. overall a comfortable and warm pair of slippers for a cheap price. only downside was that the insoles in the shoes seem to shed. so ever so often i would have to pick at them and get, what i can only explain as, fuzzies off them. but if you wear them with socks you cant feel them. it might just be a sensory issue for me but i thought i would include."
4.0,"The reason I bought these was to be able to wear the nude one with my thin white top. It clearly didn't help, as you can see the shape of the bra underneath.  But it works well with tops that have a pattern or even with plain dark colored ones."
4.0,"I buy these dresses for corp. interviews. They fit true to size, I order about 1x too big, just to be sure everything fits comfortably and it does. I am 5'2&#34; and 185 lbs. I ordered a 3x and it fits comfortably with a little give if needed. If you want a snug-er fit Id vote for a 2x depending on your e=measurements. The outfit is super comfy btw."
4.0,Cute. Holds small charms nicely
4.0,No cpmplaints
4.0,"These gloves are just a little too long for my hand. They are very warm, just a little long for my hand"
4.0,My Grand Daughter loved it!
4.0,Pretty nice for the money. It looses about 5 min every 8 hrs or so but it doesn't matter to me.  I have one that my father gave that is broken and can't get parts to fix it. I bought this one because I think I just like to wind it and feel the weight of it in my hands.  It can't be explained.
4.0,The tool for the adjusting is very cheap ! All broken . Look the picture
4.0,Product looks sturdy and the material is really nice. My wife loved it and fir the price it was a steal!<br />Only thing she wasn't crazy about was the snap in the front. It's more like a magnet than a snap. If it had a snap it would have gotten 5 stars.
4.0,Really well made and fits great
4.0,"It's beautiful! I gave it as a gift. However, the chain looks cheap and I'm not sure how well it will hold up."
4.0,I don’t feel fits true to size . Bought 1 if size I normally wear -too small. Gave it to my daughter and bought another one size up and again too small. Seemed to be the same fit as the previous one. I would suggest to buy at least two sizes up . Other than that- has absolutely BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT colors - soft material- flattering if in right size .
4.0,"LOVE ""Starry Night""!  Face covering is comfortable and lightweight; great for Florida summer!  I come from a family of big eared people and it fits no prob!"
4.0,Really pretty! I love the double chains with a big heart and little heart. I would rate it a 5 if the chains didn't get twisted so easily.
4.0,Lovely top.... somewhat larger than expected due to not being Chinese in origin I guess... only disappointment is that the embroidery is machine made and not by hand... so it lacks a certain love in the creation.
4.0,What is there to say about fishnet stockings?  This is a nice variety pack with four different styles.
4.0,"So this is beautiful! But the sizing is HUGE I got the ""six"" and the sizing is chosen for you, not much can be done there. But the shirt fit my big 7 y/o comfortably. We are going to have to take it in significantly for my soon to be 6 y/o, for reference though she  barley fits a size 5.<br />Would have gave 5 stars if I could have chosen size."
4.0,"Decent quality shirt with a really fun science print. The color is nice and the unique way it arrives is perfect for gift giving. Stickers are great if gifting to someone who likes that stuff. Fits perfectly and love the cuffs of the sleeves.<br /><br />My only dislike is that the material is a bit rough. It’s not sandpaper rough, but not that super soft tee material I crave. Hopefully it’ll soften up the more I wash it"
4.0,Perfecto diseño
4.0,"If you wear size 9, I bet these would fit great. But, they have a tendency to fall down in my shoes. Otherwise, they are exactly as described and are great for summer walking."
4.0,The is a beautiful shirt.  It fits larger than I expected
4.0,These tall riding boots go with nearly every outfit. They will however loosen up a bit on foot and calf once broken in.
4.0,These items are hard to find at any reasonable price!  My grandson was very happy with this high quality item!
4.0,"Is a nice item, just as described. I ve used ir for a while, and i Wish it was a little wider"
4.0,"Light weight and good for summer. The tongue and white part of shoe aren't made of canvas like regular Converse - this is lightweight synthetic and doesn't have the normal Converse label on tongue ... probably so you can wear them sock-less? The sole looks like Converse and we looked them up online - not fake, just different. My kid loves the fluorescent accents on these and the street no-tie shoes by Converse. (He has to tie these but he doesn't care.) Fits like Converse - they run half a size larger than your regular shoe size. If you normally wear a 7, buy a 6.5."
4.0,I needed a pair of cufflinks for a dress shirt with french cuffs.  I didn't want to spend a lot in case I didn't like the french cuff shirt.  I have actually received a number of compliments on the cufflinks.  They are solid and look nice and you can't beat the price.  I think I will get another french cuff shirt and order some even nicer cuff links.
4.0,The V-neck is VERY deep. I had to sew mine up three inches so we aware of that.
4.0,"It worked for my Kiki cosplay. The only thing that was weird was the pleats were not in the dress. It worked better for me because I didn't need them. But if you were expecting them, consider another dress unless you want to iron them in.<br />Also, it came balled up in a bag. I had to seam out the wrinkles (Pleats were gone before I steamed it if you are wondering)"
4.0,I like the design of the crochet on the back. it gives it another take. I will say that the shirt has more of a rag feeling. I have big arms and there was some give in the arms but it was snug. I'm hoping it will stretch with wear. I decided to keep it because it hides my arm tattoo well for work.
4.0,I love my glove...only took a few days to arrive and its featured just like in the picture! i cant wait to wear it! came in its original packaging and arrived on time.! thank you guys for such a great product!
4.0,"I've been using this watch strap every day for months now, and the plastic is still in great condition. There are no cracks or discoloration like you might worry about. I mark it down one star because sometimes i feel like sweat builds up under the band and irritates my skin. This is only if it has been exceptionally hot, however - the vast majority of the time I get no irritation from this band. Highly recommend."
4.0,My only complaint is that for some reason the blue color of the top was not the same exact blue of the chevron stripe so it looks a little odd to me but still like it enough not to send it back 😆
4.0,Wish it fit better!  Love the feel and color!!!!!
4.0,"I really like this belt.  You can dress it down or up. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the loop should be placed a bit further from the buckle so that the strap doesn't stick out.  All in all, a nice belt."
4.0,Beautiful color so soft and good quality for sure.  It runs big though.  I ordered small for my daughter and it fits me better I wear a large.  The pic is on her.
4.0,Quick shipping and received what I expected. I've used the ones that clip to the socks before but those I feel ruin the socks and stretch them out. These use your own feet which I feel is a nicer tug.
4.0,"What I like is that they are durable, long lasting, keep their form and shape. Only thing I hate is that 1- wear them to long your feet will get too warm and sweaty. 2- I swear the dryer always steals the socks from me."
4.0,"These shoes fit great and look exactly like the pic (they are white, not ivory).  The quality is definitely on the cheap side, but that's too be expected when they were shipped all the way from China.  A great casual white summer shoe."
4.0,The cloak is awesome. Fits great. I'm 5'0  102lbs and 34b and ordered a small.<br />The sheer top however is soooooooo small. It hardly stretches and doesn't cover my hips. I'm keeping it for the cloak for a Halloween costume.
4.0,"Got the pale blue in large, I'm tall (5 11"") so straps felt like they hitched up a little further than I wanted them to, but the length is great, the weight of the fabric is nice, the buttons are decorative so you don't have to worry about gaps. Unwashed, for the first wear, it looked really nice and served perfectly for a dinner with some friends, after the first wash (and air dry) it's looking a little more ""every day dress"", but an everyday dress I reach for quite often."
4.0,I love this jumpsuit. good quality for the price and I wear it everywhere
4.0,Definitely get a size bigger than you are. Either than that the dress is nice and not too long. I am 5'5&#34; and it reaches my ankles. The color and print is very nice and it can be used for nursing since the buttons in the front are right at the chest. I am wearing it to a baby shower next week!
4.0,Product was good for the price you pay and fast shipping.
4.0,"Very nice Kimono, bright colors, my granddaughter will love this birthday gift."
4.0,"Great feel!  Fit reasonably well. I'm 5'10&#34; and 180lbs. Ordered plus size and they fit great, except the navy blue...strange as it sounds they are slightly smaller. Still wearable but wondering how they will shrink. Crazy soft fabric and not too thin.  Really like these!"
4.0,It arrived 2 days early! The packaging kind of temporarily deformed it but it went back to normal shape easily. It looks good! It is a little darker brown than in the picture but I think its expected looking at a picture online. Its comfortable enough. It won't bother or annoy anyone. If you are searching for something simple then this is a pretty good bracelet for you.
4.0,Very cute retro one piece.  I ordered the green and it's a little between teal and green.  I really like the color.  It's a tad snug but that's because I am pregnant.  Will fit great after baby and provide good coverage.  I usually don't like ties behind by neck because I have a large bust but this didn't seem to pull so hard on my neck. I also figure I could see the ties to the back to make it more of an over the shoulder style.
4.0,"Huge itchy tag in the middle of the mask, I had to CAREFULLY cut it off and luckily did not cut any of the stitches. I knocked one star off for that but otherwise it is a nice soft supple leather. Mine came a little creased from shipping but I think it might come out over time and you do not notice it while it is being worn. It has an adjustable strap and a release if you dont want to lift it over your hair."
4.0,Ladies love them
4.0,"Incredible shirt design. Just like the one in the Agony video. I love it. It fits a little tighter than I expected. So, I recommend getting a size bigger. But, if your looking for the Slaughter to Prevail shirt, this is it."
4.0,Very creepy!
4.0,"Very cute, shiny steel, not too big (about an inch long) but the wire part that goes into your ear is a little thick for me and not comfortable.  I haven't been able to wear them but they're cute so I'll give them another try.  Maybe with some lube.  :)  They're a little heavy, and there is a tiny stamp on the same side of each one, so it will show on one ear.  Not a deal breaker though.  Still really cute for a very low cost."
4.0,Bigger than I expected/wanted but great orherwise
4.0,"So cute!  Great quality, shape, color, and size were exactly as expected.....would definitely buy again!"
4.0,Not exactly the fit I was expecting. Comfort is the key. Does the job.
4.0,Muy caluroso y es bastante corto
4.0,Fits a bit snug and the inserts in the chest area are a little awkward but over all great suit! Very cute and many compliments!
4.0,"I measured my hands and came up with the large. Knowing my hands are pretty huge ( I buy gorilla size vinyl gloves), I ordered the XL instead just to be safe but even these are a bit tight. Everything else about the gloves is fine. I like gloves that slide on and off easily and not something I have to really work at to get on and off."
4.0,"It is very pretty and looks just like the picture, however the chain is not even close to being the best and broke easily."
4.0,nice but not what I was looking for
4.0,Cute shoes but they were too big.
4.0,"It’s okay, but for pricing I expect a better print.<br />If I had to buy I again, I wouldn’t one was alright."
4.0,Got great<br />Only problem I have could be better inner mask material
4.0,Has a beautiful soft feel I am just not sure of its fabric content
4.0,"Really like this ring, but it’s starting to turn color."
4.0,Very soft scarf. The woven design is loose and web-like. Nice and feminine.
4.0,"I didn't wash it yet,but it looks good"
4.0,"This dress was a hit for a wedding I had on Saturday! Flirty, fun and fashionable. Super lightweight and it felt good on. I only have it 4 stars because the top half was way too big. I’m a solid 36C (I ordered a large, my normal size) but the top was huge, it was almost like it has too much fabric. I had it taken in and that worked perfectly. For the price I’d recommend this dress if you’re also willing on having it taken in at the top."
4.0,"Fit just as expected. Nice material, looks good."
4.0,The fabric is a little thin but they still look good.
4.0,"The band is a bit on the tight side for my toddler who's not even that chubby, so some kids might be annoyed by it. I told it down so it cuts on that."
4.0,It's a cute skirt. I like the style it fits a little snug though. Great length not to short not to long.
4.0,"Although it's smaller than I thought it would be, it's a good value for the money.  I think it needs to be bent a little to stay on but for what I paid, it's worth it!  Nice braid detail too."
4.0,Not exactly as pictured but still pretty and worked for the event I needed it for
4.0,Holds my s7 in addition to all the basics.  Both a wrist strap and cross body.
4.0,Very classy and rich looking tie.
4.0,"Look just as pictured. Huge pockets that actually hold things! Initially I was surprised that they weren't softer, but I have been wearing them all day and actually really like them!"
4.0,Love my set.so bought another set different color I take lg. But ordered xlg fits great.
4.0,Fair price and quality
4.0,"This pair of Biker’s shorts are priced just right and the quality is good. Washed instantly to see if they would shrink but they held up. The fabric has a scent that is clearly in the fabric. It wasn’t loud or unpleasant. I know washing them didn’t remove it. Maybe after a few wash, it might dissipate. I think they represent good value and recommend them for those looking for a good pair at an affordable price."
4.0,These look better than the pictures. They are beautiful on.  I got this for a formal party.  Can't wait to wear them.
4.0,"Colour is as shown, but the size is smaller. Onthe website the chain looked like a ribbon but<br />it is actually a plain rope."
4.0,"Very cute, medium was too big and followed the size chart and reviews based on bust size.  Like the fabric, nicely pressed look.  Returned and ordered a small."
4.0,"Lightweight, with lots of roomy pockets.  I wish the cargo pockets were positioned higher on the thigh, because any item with any weight, i.e. a cell phone swung around my knees too much when I walked.  also the hardware on the pockets would be better placed higher up.  Otherwise very comfortable."
4.0,For the power of glasses needed it's difficult to get a clear view.  These glasses have a good clear lens.  Unfortunately the arms on the glasses do not have a bend at the section going around your ear.  They are hard and go straight and cut in slightly which leaves them resting on your head in the ear area uncomfortably.
4.0,"These are absolutely gorgeous.  They only reason I am not giving it five stars is because one of the posts were really bent, when I received it."
4.0,"It is a lovely dress,is just not for short people I got it for my daughter prom, she is 5'2&#34; with curvy body. It was very tight from waist down and way too long. It's really beautiful and does worth the money, but just for this issue we Returned it :("
4.0,"I like it.  As others have stated, the belt quality is nice and I'm confident it will keep my luggage from spilling out.  I have a hard shell Samsonite 32&#34; that it fits around.  As far as security, it's a mild deterrent.  I would go as far as to say that it's not really secure as I can loosen the strap with the adjustment buckle and get enough slack to open the suitcase.<br /><br />For those that stated that it slides off...well duh...the only way it stays in place is to route it through the carrying handle and the tow handle.  If you only have one or the other, it can come off.  The other reviews state that the combination setting instructions are wrong.  There are two sets of locks pictured in the instructions.  One is a TSA compliant lock and the other is not.  Reviewers are failing to read the second page.  Getting the buckle though the loop is not difficult either, you should not have to jam it through.  One side in at a time takes care of the trick.<br /><br />My suitcase has three total latches and that includes the main non-TSA locking latch that I cannot use.  Years ago (as TSA locks were starting to come up), I set the the combo on it and TSA broke the lock to get into the suitcase.  The remaining two latches did not hold up well and my luggage went around the carousel with duct tape and clothes hanging out.  I since replaced that main latch, but never lock it.  This strap is not any more secure than the latch.  We are not talking about lugging a safe around.  The lock is just meant to be an inconvenience to a luggage snoop and/or prevent accidental opening.  For lack of a better statement, it's a child proof cap on a tylenol bottle.<br /><br />Summary:  Buy this if you want a quality, non elastic strap to ensure your suitcase stays closed.  The security aspect is minimal, but will deter inept thieves."
4.0,Keeps me cool and in the shade
4.0,A lil bit lite
4.0,Very soft comfortable and light in weight
4.0,"Looks great, feels like very good quality leather, plenty of perforations so it will breathe fine, blue accent is really cool,"
4.0,"wasn't crazy about the sleeves, but they were easy enough to modify. Also, the tassel around the waist fell off during first wear and had to be reattached. Despite the drawbacks, this is a gorgeous dress."
4.0,Big hit with 3 year old
4.0,The shoe looks good but the inside on top of my large toe hurts a lot. I guess its a  sowing problem. I've worn it twice bit it was very painful and uncomfortable.
4.0,"These boots were very flattering. I’m normally a 6 in size, but when it comes to boots with high heels, I have to go a size up to 6.5, and they fitted perfect! I wore these to a holiday party, I received many compliments. The reason why I’m giving a 4 star is because it was a bit loose, it didn’t feel skinny, especially when I was walking, it would begin to fall a little. I had to keep tying the laces to secure it in place, but it still wouldn’t. I think I’m going to have to adjust it myself."
4.0,"This was a cute idea. The middle straps go all the way around to the back. It's a weird look. I cut them and just tied them around my neck. It was also big in the middle back and sides, I stitched them in. It's a cute one piece now. :) this is extremely cheeky. It's not a little cheeky. It's pretty much a thong."
4.0,Great for running but don't wear for bending over. Can see through
4.0,"This ring is very nice, the only issue I have is that it is smaller than it looks.  My husband likes it, we just wish it was a bit thicker than it is.  Otherwise, its good."
4.0,I recieved this shirt and love the material. The two rings around the arms add a little character.  I ordered a size small and the only reason I am rating 4 stars is because the sleeves are a little short and the bottom is kinda wide. I like my shirts to be a little more fitted. Very comfortable shirt to wear around otherwise. I am 5'7 and 140 lbs.
4.0,"It is beautiful, although a bit on the heavy side."
4.0,"It is a beautiful watch. Its simple enough for work, but its also hot enough for going out. The only thing I don't like if that the color around the clasp is fading. I guess it's rubbing off when having my wrist on my desk. But other than that, no complaints."
4.0,Dress is too tight at the chest
4.0,Para talla S queda muy largo.
4.0,"This bag was a little bigger than I expected, but that was my fault. Very nice bag. Built very well."
4.0,Great for layering
4.0,A little big but still comfy and cozy.
4.0,Not a bad looking time piece..For those of you that are complaining I would suggest a better time piece such as an Invicta but not bad for its cost..
4.0,I wish it was a bit bigger but works fine
4.0,Zipper was backwards
4.0,Good value and stylish.
4.0,"I bought this due to I was having some wrist pain, and my heavier watch was not helping so bought this Casio.  Lighter weight than my other watch and the display is as easy to read. Only issue is I'm not enthusiastic about the band.  It does make the watch lighter, but is somewhat harder to put on and take off than my other watch with an expandable band.  However, hard to beat for the price."
4.0,Thin material very light almost see through but cute dress
4.0,Love this case. Crush proof and drying but weighs very little. I had to take a star away though because of how small it is. My glasses are very and barely fit.
4.0,"Looks good and keeps time, what else can you ask of a $10 watch."
4.0,Not a bad product. Either I'm to big or its to small
4.0,Cute earrings. Great size. Only complaint was that one of the backs was stretched out and would not clasp the earring. Easy fixed with another back I already had.
4.0,Very petite and pretty earrings.  I gave them to my daughter-in-law along with the Daughter-in-law heart collection crystal bangle set in plum.
4.0,Bag did not have a bottom that allows bag to sit up straight.  Bag falls over.
4.0,"fast shipping<br />ring looks exactly like the photo<br />nice weight, substantial but not overly heavy<br />The only setback is the infinity symbol is not overlaid on the band like I thought, it is cut out of the band and if you run your fingers over it, you can feel some sharp edges, but it doesn't affect ability to wear the ring, the inside is fine"
4.0,This is a beautiful but very spandex like shirt.  I would recommend this if you have a skinny body with large boobs.  This is very sexy and will show off every single curve you have.  Unfortunately I am B/C cup and a size 8 so it was too big around the chest area.  I followed the size chart and ordered an extra large but I probably should have ordered a large instead.
4.0,These run a little big in my opinion. I am more apple shape than pear shaped. They will fit pear shaped women excellent - for me it’s a little different but still okay. Personally I do not think these are warm enough for hiking at 35 degrees or cooler alone. And too warm with something over them. At 65 degrees or above it can be warm. I would not wear them for hiking above 75 at all. Just to wear to do whatever they are great.
4.0,"Very nice bag, gave it four stars because I was given the wrong color and it didn't come with the smaller bag"
4.0,"Received my lenses early, thanks Amazon and Revant! Install was easy and the holed bits aligned well with the frames. As a handful of others have said these lenses are a bit thinner than factory. This results in the frames feeling slightly flimsy. I gave my rebuilt glasses a shot outside and one or maybe two others have noticed there was a little reflection of my eyes. This worsened if I looked down my nose. All in all Revant's lenses are a solid, well priced replacement for factory lenses."
4.0,Use for staying relatively dry while bathing my disabled hubby.
4.0,nice jersey but a little thinner than I expected
4.0,Just as I expected! I enjoy their oversized clothing!
4.0,Cute. Just like the picture.
4.0,Very pretty.  A little smaller than i expected but will make a nice gift
4.0,This book is a good balance of rigor and clarity. Very well suited for a graduate level course
4.0,"This set is made of good quality & has not turned on me but the only thing I don’t like is that they are a bit on the heavy side. Other than that, they are great."
4.0,It fits perfect!!!!Yay...super nice suit!
4.0,"This is a nice midweight sweater! It's lightweight and also a little warm. I tend to overheat easily so having something that's a little warm but still breathes is nice. It looks very similar to the picture.<br /><br />For me the neckline fits a bit awkwardly, like it should either be a bit bigger or a bit smaller it would sit a little nicer but that's just personal preference."
4.0,"This is the first neoprene apparel item I have owned, and I really like the material. It seems to hold you in and hide imperfections a little better than ordinary swimsuit material. I would recommend ordering a size up, especially if you are particularly 'busty'. I have small breasts, but still feel as if I could use more coverage. The bikini is very comfortable and flexible, and the picture is true to color. I would recommend hand washing this, and laying flat to dry, because I don't think the neoprene would be good to use heat on, it might permanently crease. But overall I think this was a good item, just size up on your order. :) I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% MY own and I never guarantee a 5 star review."
4.0,Lenses aren't as thick and feel more plastic than originals. They did fit good and they are clear. A cost effective replacement.
4.0,"Comfy, and goes with everything.  Nice alternative to wearing a sweater. Received several complements. Recommend hand wash and air dry flat."
4.0,Nice and blingy but a little large for shoes. But will wear. I can be gaudy.
4.0,I disliked that the size runs small.
4.0,print is great. quality fabric. You'll just have to roll up most of the print if you want the cap actually down on your head.
4.0,"I understand what people say about the smell. It just smells plastic-y and odd but it's not as dramatic as everyone in the reviews says it is. It does it's job and it's pretty hard to where if it falls, your glasses are safe and there's no damage!"
4.0,Gardening use
4.0,THE SLEVES WHERE A LITTLE SHORT BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT WAS A GOOD FIT
4.0,"Good size, generous, soft and lush, just slightly disappointed in the color of the butterflies. They are not a true purple, but a dull reddish brown that is not as vibrant as I expected."
4.0,"I got this spiked collar to wear for Halloween.  It is very well made and good looking.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little bigger.  It said it would fit men and women and it was a bit snug for me.  Other than that, it worked perfectly."
4.0,After I put Glue on the fabric it stayed put...so editing my review....
4.0,Love it but hard to explain what it means!
4.0,"I love these sunglasses they fit my face perfectly. Good quality, very stylish."
4.0,Almost what I expected. I wear these to go on a hike or jogging. A little smaller than I wanted at first but they're stretchy. Now that ive lost a couple pounds they fit perfect.
4.0,I like the colors included in this combination.  At first I thought they might be too small but they have worked out well
4.0,Works great except nose part needs to be stronger to prevent glasses fogging up. Looks great and comfortable
4.0,"I knew they would be too wide because the shoe is the same shoe a man would order.  I am desperate for relief from Plantar Fasciitis.  They have a raised arch and a negative heel, which seems to work for me.  I wish they weren't so wide, but I like them."
4.0,Cute skirt and great quality.  My teenage daughter really like it and the fit was perfect.  It is not too short and the faux suede is nice.  Great skirt.
4.0,"I really like this, I got alot of complements when I wore this."
4.0,"The first one of these that I ordered was too large in the waist, but I like it otherwise. The material is lightweight and dries quickly which I like. So I ordered another one in a different color but the same size as the other. When this new one arrived, it was too tight in the waist which was disappointing. I would say to just try it and if it does not fit correctly, it is simple to return."
4.0,Love the color and easy style.... Not real fancy but attractive.
4.0,muy buenos
4.0,"I like the dimensions of the case.  It's not too square, also there is room in the back for scissors and other items.  I keep a small note book in the bottom.  I do wish it had another 'page' of pencil holders.  It fits nicely in a tote bag.  The price seems a bit high but all in all I like this case for traveling."
4.0,"work goods, but will make your fingers black"
4.0,it serves my purpose i like it
4.0,"I was really excited to get these bras, they arrived in just 3 days after I purchased. Great deal for 2 bras (one nude & one black) if you sweat a lot I wouldn’t recommend them. They do slide off. I ordered a C cup & it fit good. I just didn’t like that they would slip when I’d get too sweaty. I haven’t tried the nipple covers just yet."
4.0,Sickness V high!<br /><br />Yeah you cant see through them super great but they look so bad literally these transform your look and people do take notice
4.0,I love the price and fit. Better than the ones work said to get that we're $68 fall apart shoes. So glad I found these. For non-work I would love a pare of these without the.steel toe. That is how comfortable these are.
4.0,Gift to my daughter she admires this beautifully crafted bracelet.
4.0,the low cost for a nice item which I gave as a gift
4.0,"Nice dress as soon as I lose 10#! Ordered xl I expected to hang a lil loose. Does not. I'm a size 12, xl should be fine. 5'5&#34; tall, hangs long enough (I'm 45 too old for too short :). Good for wearing for errands, & could probably be dressed up some. Might give 5 stars if the fit was truer."
4.0,Nicee shop 2pcs-chiffon Zebra Shawl Pashmina +Fashion Leopard Shawl  -these items were received and will make a great Christmas gift.
4.0,This shirt came really fast which was unexpected but awesome! Ordered and extra large (I'm a bit bigger around the belly and boobs) and it fits relatively well! Not as flowy as the picture but I'm also not as tiny as that girl! It's still super cute on! The only downside is the sleeves are a little short. I like my sleeves a little longer so it's a little disappointing but I'll just try to stretch them out a bit! Still a great shirt for a great price!!
4.0,"Wanted this to double as an eye mask. Looks like it will fit the bill, but it's a little tight."
4.0,beautiful colors and size
4.0,Would easily give it 5 stars if it weren’t WAY too long.  These will drag the ground on a 5’10” gal so all y’all tall girls GO FOR IT!!
4.0,Super nice material! Runs a little big but could just be because the material is stretchy. Bought this dress for thanksgiving and it’s perfect with knee high boots!!!
4.0,"Little bit on the short side, but other than that, I like it."
4.0,Well received by GF
4.0,The company accidentally sent me the wrong ring but quickly fixed the issue and I got this ring a few days later. Lovely ring with nice quality. It is heavy though if that is a factor one would consider.
4.0,Fit perfectly. A lititle too warm for summer. But fall and winter should be good
4.0,I have received this product and feel that the function is normal after use. Works great so far!<br />This product can be delivered on time. Recommended purchase
4.0,Even the smaller size are very wide. I measured using the guide provided but they were much too big.
4.0,I wore this dress to a wedding and received so many compliments.
4.0,"I've used these for working out at home, sleep, around the house and layering. They look flattering (with or without bra) . The fabric is soft, pretty stretchy (not super), color does not run when washed and they did not shrink significantly. Sometimes they do ride up a little but I wanted them snug so it's fine for my uses at home."
4.0,Not real silver and the serenity prayer script is so small can't be read thankfully I know the prayer by heart.The stones looked like crystals on line but they are plastic
4.0,Will be warm
4.0,Not good if you wear glasses
4.0,These are awesome gloves! They are very comfortable and warm while thin and stylish at the same time.  It also works as  advertised. Great with touch screens. My only complaint is they are a little tight around the ring and pinky fingers.
4.0,"I really like this wrap. The only complaint I have is the feeling of the fabric. It does not feel like wool. It’s really cute, though. I have not washed it yet. We will see how it fares."
4.0,All in all they’re a great short! I bought the black first in small and I loved them so I ordered the cream pair and they are much too big. They are worth the purchasing price and good quality.
4.0,I love this shirt. It is a different material than the white so that threw me off but I still love it!
4.0,Bought as a gift. Seems very nice but a little thinner than expected
4.0,Fits well and the color is just like the picture!
4.0,"I really like this unisex head band, not too bulky, fits well under hard construction cap and absorbing sweat. I use it for running, tennis, horseback riding. I think the description also has fitting for women, and it’s okay for women to wear it, even when I clean my face."
4.0,"Love the top, the bottoms are uncomfortable and probably won't ever be worn because they are a thong."
4.0,A little heavy for me
4.0,"I needed a dress with three days notice for a family picture!  My daughter-in-law found this for me, and it fit perfectly. Ture to size.  Material is a little thinner than I expected, but very comfortable!"
4.0,"Its label says cotton, but I believe it's easy care, cool rayon. (Rayon is made from cotton.) Very comfortable and breezy. As always in inexpensive garments, the armhole is a good three inches too deep."
4.0,All rings are cute. Good for its price. The rings turned my skin green after my hands were wet but I wasn’t surprised.
4.0,"I got my pair a couple of days ago--they look exactly like in the picture, have a solid and good-looking heel, but if you are in-between shoe sizes, definitely size up. I will have to return this pair and order one size up, but should the new pair be as good as the one I have in hand right now, they should be perfect for what I need them (a play, no dancing)."
4.0,"super cute and got lots of compliments, but i have large breasts and smaller frame. makes me look a lot bigger than i am."
4.0,I ordered these for my very tiny 5 year old to go with her Halloween costume.  They were perfect.  The only negative thing I could find was the fingers were a little too long... Other than that very satisfied!
4.0,"Cute outfit.  Wish it were cute a little bigger, but it's nice and stretchy."
4.0,Broke after wearing just a couple of times.
4.0,The only improvements that could be made to this product would be:<br />• a wire system to keep the tail upright<br />• a petite option for the very short ladies in the world<br /><br />My daughter is 4'11&#34; and a US Misses size 4.
4.0,Really Nice suit but I would size up two sizes it it snug. Maybe because it’s a slimming suit It runs small. Other than that the quality of the suit seems really nice.
4.0,"I like this choker. Its super cute and sexy. The only annoying thing about this choker is you have to undo the laces to put it on then lace it back up. I can't get the bow to look right so I just tie it in a knot and I think it looks better. Also its a little itchy, but that could just be me 'cause I have sensitive skin. All and all its a great buy."
4.0,A little snug in the upper torso area but my lady likes how it looks on me.  So I'm content.
4.0,"These work for an hour or so before needing to re-wet, but it can slip off of your head in a vigorous workout."
4.0,The jacket is nice but too large for me because I like it more fitted. It is waterproof and comfortable to wear. I'm 5'4&#34; and 130 lbs with an hourglass build and it still runs a but big on me. Size down a bit!
4.0,It’s a nice swimsuit but runs a bit small.
4.0,I bought the rose gold which is a lot better because I have the rose gold watch. I purchase this one and it is nice I wouldn't recommend it unless the watch is black. The face plate is a slight different color it is a little lighter than the watch. But all in all I do like it!
4.0,Really awesome glasses & quality is decent but it transfers black color where they rest on my husbands nose. So odd! But he likes them otherwise!
4.0,Used it daily for work so it has a few rips.
4.0,This was a great party favor/prize.  The kids liked it
4.0,"I needed a dress too match my fiancé’s dashiki for our engagement photos, and this was PERFECT. It’s very nice. The only thing was it was too long, and a little too loose. I had too pick it up every time I walked, and I ordered a 2x sense I am an XL and it was a little too loose for me. Overall very pleased though!!"
4.0,Description says it's loose fitting. But it isn't. Its nice and comfy and true to size. But I rather have went up a size. The design is also VINYL. Not screen print . like I thought. But oh my the shirt is so comfy and I'm obssessed. :)
4.0,I’m a size 12 and the large fits perfectly. Material is a bit thick so I won’t probably wear in the Texas summer heat but they will work in spring and fall months. Colors are very pretty.
4.0,I am 5'6' 160 lbs and this is awesome. The model pictured is petite so if you are my size or taller/larger the pant leg hits higher but still below the knee. The only reason I did not give a 5 is that the leg closures are very tight. I just keep a couple unbuttoned at the bottom and fits fine.
4.0,Dainty and adorable.  Received many compliments.
4.0,"Nice watch - not a high-end conversation starter, but it's a nice watch with a unique character nonetheless. The face looks quite nice and I like the clasp on the band, however, the metal piece surrounding the watch face, while unique, does look a little bit unfinished and 'boxey'. You can definately tell this isn;t a high-end timepiece, but then again, you know that when you're buying it.  This is a unique and casual watch to wear with jeans or for an afternoon out, but it's not something you'll strap onto your wrist if you plan on wearing a suit and seeing a play."
4.0,"Beautiful, added sexy to plus sized wpmab"
4.0,"This cover up arrived just in time for my beach day this past weekend.<br />The material seems a little frail but for a cover up, it is perfect regardless. It isn't hot, it's not too see through, and I really like the ties in the front. All in all, very stylish. I am 5 feet 10 inches, so I wish it was a little longer - but I can't complain, everything is too short for me."
4.0,Super cute coat.  A bit snug around the bust.  Be sure to read the materials in the description and not in the title.  There is NO WOOL in this product but it is priced accordingly.
4.0,"Very cute, must be patient to get it"
4.0,"I ordered yellow and got blue.  I could not figure out how to order the 40 liter size given the confusing single option of 20L, 30L and 40L size -- you were only given one choice, only the multiple size option??  Although I love the bag, it may go back."
4.0,"I bought these compression socks to wear over my ankle support sleeves when playing basketball. Because of how thin these socks are and the material that they are made of, pairing them with ankle sleeves is more comfortable than wearing ankle sleeves with other athletic socks. Though, because of how thin they are, I wouldn't wear them on their own when playing basketball/running/working out or traveling. But that may be a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />I can't say that I have noticed any performance improvements but the socks do keep my feet drier. And I get +3 style points on the court. I plan on buying another pair."
4.0,"Fit is great , just wrinkles easy"
4.0,They were cute!!! If your not looking to get a real piercing I highly recommend
4.0,"It is beautiful. The color, the texture, fits perfect.<br />I will buy more. The only thing that I'll give 4 stars it's because takes a lot of time to arrive. But it's OK, that's come from China, I thought."
4.0,Always a win when your partner tells you your new dress makes your boobs look good lol
4.0,"I like this necklace, but it gets all twisted up due to the fact it's all 1 piece. That is the only complaint I have. I have purchased 2 different styles, so they aren't that bad and they look really nice on."
4.0,"Very nice lapel pin for anyone who has Celtic heritage. The colors are clear, and it is just the right size. It would be a five star  product if the word SCOTLAND, which is written on the little banner at the bottom of the pin, had been in black.  Currently, the lettes are in gold, and do not show up clearly on the white banner. However, up close you can see them ok."
4.0,Love this way more than I even expected.wear them all the time. Wish the buttons were different. I wear where you cannot see buttons and even popped off the top ones.
4.0,It's really soft and comfortable but runs smaller
4.0,"I really like this dress! I would give it 5 stars, but it is cut a little low in the front. I wish the dress was tagless,then I could just spin it around without the tag stitches showing in the front.  I had the blue skirted one first, but the skirt stained really easily from something, so I am hoping the black skirt will hold up better!"
4.0,This is such a clever idea!  How many times I see my daughter with a hair tie cutting off the circulation in her wrist!  I gave her this and she was absolutely thrilled.  It's so pretty and fits a medium size wrist perfectly.  I got her some different colored ties and each color makes the bracelet look like a classy piece of jewelry.
4.0,I thought it was bigger otherwise it's very nice
4.0,"Living in South Florida, it’s important to find sharp looking clothes that can function well with our heat and humidity. This little dress fits all the requirements and more. The price is an incredible value for the quality and ease of care required to maintain the material and shape of the dress. Very little decision time goes into slipping this on with a pair of sandals and leaving the house feeling appropriate for most any occasion.<br />Highly recommend this dress."
4.0,"I just got this shirt in the mail.  I think it's quite cute.  My only problem is that I was so concerned about the sizing difference between US sizes and Asian sizes that I ordered a bit too large.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 145lbs.  I typically wear a medium shirt.  I bought this in an XL because I wanted it to be loose.  However, it's a bit too loose.  I would have been better off just going up one size and getting the large.  That being said, the back opening isn't quite as large as is shown in the picture, but it's still super cute, so I'm not concerned about that.  The material is soft and not as thin as I expected, which is good.  For the $8 I paid this shirt was worth it.  It'll be a great beach shirt (since it's a bit over sized to look good going out).  Plus, it got here quicker than I expected, so that's a bonus."
4.0,"Overall, it's decent for the price. The fabric is pretty sheer in direct light."
4.0,"Was a little on the smaller size but overall pretty comfy and flattering, but also has already torn a little around the neck so kinda cheap material."
4.0,Will work for mom of the brides. Found shoes same color. Miracle
4.0,The gold ribbon that is attached to the horn comes off easily.
4.0,"Great skirt. Super cute alternative to shorts in the summer. It fits great, and the pocket on the inside is so useful."
4.0,Looks nice. Size runs big.
4.0,"I got it on sale for $9, good deal for price. I wouldn’t pay more than $15 for it though. It runs a lil big. My toddler is a petite size 18-24 months, we ordered the size 100 (3T) in hopes it wasn’t too big, it runs a lil large. Thankfully my mom was able to make a few alterations that we were able to keep it. Definitely wouldn’t pay $20+ for it."
4.0,"Cute dress--not sure how fond I am of the material, but overall it's cute. It is form fitting, and the straps are thin."
4.0,I like them.  The polarized thing is great protecting from any glare and the size protects the very sensitive skin around my eyes
4.0,"Good and helpful; night driving is better.  They don't reduce the glare completely, however."
4.0,"I wore this dress for my college Ivy Day ceremony. Was nervous about finding a white dress for my body type, but this was very flattering and lovely. Everyone asked me where I got it. Had to wear it with a nude slip as it's see through at the bottom. Taking off one star because the lace has started puckering at the top after only wearing it twice. I'm 5'5, 180 lbs, got the XL."
4.0,Wasn't sure on how it would look and was good with it when I got it.
4.0,"Quality stitching and strong magnets in the clip section. It’s considerably larger than I had expected, but it’s grown on me. Definitely a nice wallet for the price."
4.0,"lovely, thin,  but suits the purpose"
4.0,Its so cute and soft and stretchy but if I order it again I'm gonna go up a couple sizes.
4.0,"These are adorable and my daughter was so very excited to get these and wear them; however, I ordered according to their size chart based on her foot size and they were about 2 sizes too small. I would not even bother measuring the foot, just order based on the US foot size. They are really cute shoes and the lights make them really awesome. All you do is push the side of the shoe to turn on and change the color, there are many color options."
4.0,Lovely fit. Very comfortable.
4.0,"Not quite as exciting as I had hoped. They are pretty, but not as unique as expected."
4.0,"I wasn't paying attention, and the picture shows silver. I auto shipped it, I ended getting a gold one. look at what you are pressing! it was my mistake but I was a little bummed about it. other than that its a great cheap necklace!"
4.0,"This was super cute! However the glue that holds up the ribbon on the lollipop got loose. No biggie though, I just added some hot glue and voila!"
4.0,Too tight for my little ones thick feet.
4.0,"These are very cute. We’ll made. Detailed and colorful. My don loved them. Would have been 5 stars if the captain America one that my son wanted the most didn’t arrive broken in half. He was happy enough with the rest of them. Don’t know how sturdy, but sure beats buying them in crocs store for $5 each."
4.0,It's pretty. The green isn't as deep as the picture. chain is sturdier than I thought at first. I like it.
4.0,So this is a beautiful swim suit. It's made well and the stiching is straight. So Im 5'4&#34; 190lbs and I ordered a xx-large and it is a little tight a round the bust. I just had a baby so Im very insecure about my belly. I figured that the abstract pattern would distract the eye away from my lower belly. Well I must say that I absolutely love this bathing suit. I am very pleased with this suit all together.
4.0,"The dress is nice, but it had plunging neckline, which I pinned the top of the dress. The dress was a bit short on me. I am 6”1. I paired it with black sweater tights, my wool hat, and my backpack. I will say when I walk the dress rides up in the back, thankfully I was wearing cotton black shorts so no one really saw anything. It’s a polyester material the plus is that it doesn’t wrinkle. The summer I definitely do have to wear shorts under the dress since it’s a bit short. But overall happy with my purchase, received many compliments!"
4.0,this is a cute suit but the fabric does wrinkle under the abuse of a 7 year old owner
4.0,Nice fabric. Order a size bigger.
4.0,"I love this bracelet, it is a good quality bracelet and looks great."
4.0,I bought this coat for my little one to wear as part of his Halloween costume. It is ADORABLE. It's VERY soft and will be very warm for trick or treating. I took one star off because one of the buttons was sewn on a little funny.
4.0,Was going to return it but I decided to give a second shot I adjusted the straps started putting on from the front then turned it around because it can be difficult to snap in the back once I did that I found it didn’t look half bad anymore now in love with it!<br />Give a fair shot before  deciding it doesn’t work for you I did and I’m glad I did plus he loves it and it’s super comfortable to wear even around the house or a night out if ur feeling Risky lol ❤️
4.0,"Update: Reduced two 3 stars. Over time with running use, black on the band wears off and can leave marks on the wrist. Not permanent.<br /><br />This band is very good. The sliding, magnetic mechanism is frankly perfect. The band is an upgrade from the original in every way. I am holding back 1 star due to squeaking during my runs. Not sure what is causing it, the clasp or the hinge, but it is only during a run the squeaking occurs."
4.0,"These socks are very cute and comfortable. They are very soft, feel more like thick cotton than wool, but are warm.  I do wish they came up higher - definitely not boot socks, but I like them a lot despite this."
4.0,"The string has been wearing away, but it is very beautiful"
4.0,"I am 5'6"" and 180 lbs, I was hesitant to order, but figured I could return if I didn't like them.  Right out of the package I still wasn't sure.  When I tried them on, I fell in LOVE. They are so soft and I love the ""tummy"" control these offer. I will likely get another pair but I am waiting to see how they wash up first."
4.0,"The material is light but very soft.  I love that it has pockets, though they would be even better if they were a little bit deeper.  Overall the skirt looks nice and it fits well.  My only actual complaint is how wrinkly the material can get.  A quick spray with some water or some wrinkle relaxer and it is good to go."
4.0,Warmth but a little bit tight on my head.
4.0,"Beautiful earrings.....I received so many compliments for them. Quality is very good and the shine in them is not at all like those cheap earrings. They are clip ons n they don’t hurt .... u can wear them the entire day. However, u have to be a little extra careful that u clip them properly else they may come off."
4.0,"These are very good socks; soft, and not itchy (which I was worried about). They aren't as thick as I anticipated, given the ""winter"" part of the name, but still reasonably warm."
4.0,"Awesome looking sandal overall.  The strap sits pretty high off of the sole, so I would order at least one size smaller, unless you have super beefy feet.  No judging beefy feet here, just giving a heads up."
4.0,"I'm a size 18 with 38 DD and size 2x fit perfectly. Fabric is very soft and comfortable, not to thin."
4.0,"I like this dress. Nice and lightweight for summer. I like the light blue color. Cons- wrinkles easy, and It was a little tight in the chest for me though (34dd). Hoping it wont be so tight soon now that I'm done breastfeeding."
4.0,These shorts are really cute and soft. They fit perfectly not too short not too long.
4.0,"Kiddo loves these. They fooled his friends at school. But the rubber gaskets around the edge come off when he puts them in. Also, it’d be way cooler if the glowed in the dark."
4.0,"Sizing was too small and had to go one size up and order a large. This was part of a costume so I didn't want to splurge too much, but this is a great value for a nice corset. I just needed help tightening the back and everything came together!"
4.0,"While I like this jacket, it is not as thick as the picture looks. It is surprisingly warm."
4.0,Cute light weight dress. I would have liked it to be a little bit longer but that is just my preference.  I sized up to a large. I usually wear a medium. If you don’t like turtle neck style this is not the dress for you
4.0,This bag is very light and easy to put everything you need to gym or for long weekend trip.
4.0,"It’s a cute tunic but ltoo short to wear as a dress, as it barely covers my derriere. In the photos, I’ve pull it down as far as I can and I only run about 5'5&#34;. However, for every day use its much safer to wear with shorts or leggings to prevent over-exposing myself. While this tunic stretchy and soft enough to fit over my 7 month pregnant body, it does runs a little small. Aside from the discrepancy in size, this product is a great simple tunic that can be dress up or worn casually."
4.0,"Generally good for the price… They were a little scretchy, but decent."
4.0,Love this Tank top.<br />Large fits like a Medium.
4.0,Fits well other than the knee area is way oversized even for riding! Could barely tuck them into boots!
4.0,"I like the size and the pretty shade of blue.  I also like opening the umbrella with a push of the button; however, it doesn't ""close"" all the way with a push of the button.  The one I got is a little tricky, to ""close"" it, you have to give it a shake at the same time you push the button.  It then will collapse the umbrella, but you have to hold the handle & firmly push on the opposite end to make it close.  Mine is either defective or the word ""close"" means different things to different people."
4.0,The clogs are very cute and excellent quality.  I found they ran slightly small though and had to reorder in a larger size.
4.0,"My wife loved them, but I was disappointed in the packaging. It would have been nice to have a little box to present them in. I had to just give them to her."
4.0,Came on time. Was pleased with hat
4.0,"I wish it was 3-4 inches longer, but I knew from other reviews it would be a lil short. I got the white & it's cute but I think you're better off getting a dark color & wearing leggings under it. The white is a little sheer but I can get away with it wearing nude undergarments. Wearing jeans or leggings under the white shows through. It's so cheap that it's not worth returning & I think it was shipped from China."
4.0,"Really cute leggings, good fit. Only drawback is they are slightly see through as the fabric is thin."
4.0,"An auspicious Eastern symbol in the traditional colors of Chinese owls: red and black. A very useful combination! The piece I got had a slightly dull appearance. Not terrible, but enough for me to take off one star."
4.0,"Good for the price , a little thin , but helps with dress shirts from getting rumpled."
4.0,The dress is beautiful!! The flowers were not attached very well. Had to use material glue to pit it together.
4.0,"We bought a size small and The pants fit wonderful around the waist, but the hoodie is snug. my daughter is a size small/6. Hoodie size is the only downfall. Very cute outfit"
4.0,The necklace looks a lot better in person than the picture that you see online. I was pleased with the purchase. The only problem I had with it is that the magnifying glass is a little hard to see anything through. For the price though I can't complain. It's really pretty and good quality.
4.0,"Nice material, beautiful color. I'm 5'4&#34; so the pants were a tad large."
4.0,"Like the length. Prefer real leather, but this should work for rainy days."
4.0,Pretty dress. Very wrinkled when it comes out of the packaging. Decent quality.
4.0,Good quality and easy to use.  Would purchase it again.
4.0,Muy linda .
4.0,"It's worth waiting for the delivery schedule, the procut"
4.0,"Ordered a large according to the sizing chart, but it was too big. Use it as a pajama shirt instead."
4.0,I like the color and the terry cloth material.  The only thing that was odd is it is quite wide for my head.  But would recommend.
4.0,The blouse is lovely. Fits a bit small but material and and sewn beautifully!
4.0,Super soft and cute. Have as a gift and she loved it.
4.0,"It fits well, a little loose at the waist"
4.0,"I would say, these are not bad for the price. I wish they were just a little bit longer or had a tall option. I'm 5'8"" and they barely cover my ankles the way I want. If you're taller you may not want to get these. I also wish they were the polyester material. I wore these on a road trip and they were fairly nice. Wasn't so easy with all the fabric using the public bathroom(TMI)."
4.0,very cute tunic dress.
4.0,Thanks🙂
4.0,Very nice for the money!  The only issue I had with it is that it is for very large wrists.  Fortunately my husband is handy with tools and was able to take out several links to make it fit my wrist.
4.0,"I have sent it off to Pop pop, and I am sure he will love it."
4.0,Great color. Cute clasp.<br /><br />It's a little smaller than I expected. I was thinking it would be 3 1/2 inches wide. It's more like 2 inches. Pretty tight elastic. Would have prefered it to be a little more forgiving with the stretch.<br /><br />Happy with what I purchased for the price.
4.0,"I'm not sure if I should give this a lower rating for the fact that I purchased it TWICE and still got the wrong size.  The material is soft and I love the green.  It looks as pictured and really liked it.  It's just very unfortunate that we kept getting sent the wrong size.  We ordered an XL and even though the plastic bag it came in had a sticker that said XL on it, the actual tshirt tag said M. We had ordered another item but in a large to compare sizes and we did receive the L.  It was only when we tried to get an XL that we would get a M."
4.0,"Does what it’s meant to do....just fits a little awkward. Awkward as in, I wouldn’t want anyone to see me in it but it’s not like it’s meant for a fancy dinner so all in all I was satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,Performs as advertised
4.0,Colors and pattern as expected. Is lightweight and packs well. I wear mine as a coverup or casual dress on vacation.
4.0,Fits great very cute and comfortable just a tad short though if you have a bigger bottom lol
4.0,Pretty good. I wanted to use them for hiking and hanging things off my pack and general stuff like that. About 4 in the pack didn’t work. The spring has come out or something but ehh it was cheap for a bunch so I can’t complain too much. Most of them work
4.0,"this is a great doo rag, though for $15 for a $1 piece of cloth i suppose it should be, but it is exactly as ordered and it was shipped and arrived promptly. If I got them cheaper or didn;t have to pay for them I'd order many more.,"
4.0,"Like others who have purchased this product, I am going to state that the color in the picture is a bit deceiving. I ended up taking a bunch of pictures of the bag. I've never taken so many of an inanimate object in my life, but hopefully they will help people see the color of the bag better. The first 4 are taken with crappier lighting or no flash. Point is that it is a lighter brown than comes up in the product picture. Though as of today, I see that the brown is not currently available. Hopefully it comes back for the folks that still want it.<br /><br />I also took pictures of all the pockets so you could see what you are getting and what you can hold in it. I haven't used the bag yet, so I had to quickly gather some things. My ipad mini 3, in its case, fit in perfectly with loads of room to spare, I also put in my wallet which is filled with some cash, a bunch of old receipts, expired id/debit cards, 2 pens and a baby lips lip balm. As I type this I realize, I should have put my phone in, I'm pretty sure it would fit on top of the wallet though.  In the front pocket I put a  6&#34; x 4&#34; Pentalic journal, which I probably wouldn't carry in this bag, but I just wanted something to put in it. And just for fun, I found that the Chernow Alexander Hamilton biography (832 pages, product dimensions: 6 x 1.7 x 9.2 inches) fits into the main pocket almost perfectly (zipper won't be able to close). That should give you some idea about the volume the main pocket can hold.<br /><br />This is a sturdy and structured bag, a bit heavier than I expected. The one caveat I have is about the clasp on the removable strap. Just opening the clasp I feel like it's going to break at any minute. I did receive an email from Ecosusi, saying that if it breaks they will &#34;arrange a replacement without return and any fee&#34; which makes me feel better in case it breaks."
4.0,"It's a gorgeous dress I just wish it was a bit smaller. The small was too loose and I think an xsmall would be too tight based on the size chart. The fit is still ok, just not how I like my clothes to fit but it looks good nice pattern material and everything else. Well made too not flimsy at all.."
4.0,Fits good but hurts the arm hair also falls of easily
4.0,Not as thick as picture indicates but definitely not cheap cotton.<br /><br />It's a nice dress. Not a date-night dress but definitely look better than most around the office on a Tuesday. I'd recommend
4.0,"This is a good bag for concerts & festivals which is what I planned to use it for.  It holds my phone, car keys, small wallet, chapstick, small pill case & would probably hold a small travel size tube of sunscreen during the day.  I would like it better if the crossbody strap was adjustable.  The clasp on one end of the strap also doesn’t fasten well so I’m using the<br />purse with a leather type strap from another bag that is adjustable & will stay securely in place in crowds.  I do like the color & design a lot though, plus the fact that it has 2 separate zippered sections to organize things."
4.0,"Just had cataract surgery, and I bought these to help with close up vision like reading and computer screens without having to take off the glasses when doing other things.  Unfortunately, the. Clear part of the lens is too small, and I have to take them off if I’m not doing close work, or I get dizzy and nauseated.  They do work very well for reading and computer use."
4.0,"These pants are very comfortable the only reason I couldn't give them 5 stars is because they smell like moth balls. I have washed them at least 5 times, placed dryer sheets in the pockets and sprayed lysol on them, but the smell wont go away. I have asked others if they can smell it while I'm wearing them and I've been told no, but I can smell  them and it drives me crazy."
4.0,"Good size, like the padded shoulder strap. Fits sneaker, towel and gym clothes"
4.0,The burgundy beanie was noticeably smaller than the gray one. I had also purchased another 2 pack (yellow and gray) and they came in at the same size. I gave it to my daughter as it didnt sit right on my head being that much smaller.
4.0,"Super easy to insert the pins. They lock in place well. I've pulled hard on it several times and never came loose. One thing I discovered is if you have a small wrist you may want the doubled over elastic part on the inside of your wrist. I had it on the outside and it made handwriting difficult after a bit because of how I write. I flipped the band around in less than a minute and no issues.  When I charged my versa 2, I turned the watch inside out. No issues charging that way."
4.0,"A little long, but I like it! Hopefully it'll look good with some high heeled boots."
4.0,"I was nervous to buy clothes online but the jeans arrived early, fit great, and look expensive!:)"
4.0,very cute a little long but she loved it
4.0,"These are great for my husband, he wears them anytime he goes out in public. They don't fall down on him and they are lightweight enough to not feel too restrictive. The 6 pack allows for easy trade out so he always has one on hand between laundry."
4.0,I like patterns and design of socks. Least like the more stitching on the sock the tighter the sock is.
4.0,Not too bad for the price
4.0,"Lightweight, easy travel jacket, first one was too large so reordered a smaller size. Love the color and doesn't take up to much space in the suitcase!"
4.0,"Perfect fit, true to the photo! Unfortunately, it is SHORTER than described...like it is 3 inches shorter...so I will have to alter the length just a little to fit the dress code for the event that I ordered it for. It is a super comfortable dress and I LOVE the pockets!"
4.0,Very light weighted almost feels like you have no shirt on. My only problem is the shirt had a pulled string on the collar. Had to fix it. On the other hand of that its cool and fits great
4.0,Great for a gun lover!
4.0,Nice and practical to wear.
4.0,Short waisted. I’m 5’8 and it barely fit. But super cute for a rehearsal dinner matching our 2 year old.
4.0,My wife likes the style and the colors. The quality is above average and they have the right width. To be recommended.
4.0,"good product, good fit and good price"
4.0,Nice shirt for the price.  I am 5'3&#34; 140 pounds and I got a size large.  It is very baggy and fits well. super cute and comfortable
4.0,"These are very comfy work pants...my only complaint is that I ordered a Short, and these are still a little too long. I still like them a lot, and this was the second pair I ordered!"
4.0,This wallet is reasonably thin even though I have about six cards in it. It seems to be durable and I am trusting its RFID capabilities.
4.0,"super nice for the loot,a 50 buck band for 10 bucks"
4.0,I love the owl pendant. It is absolutely beautiful. I did not like the chain it was to small and I didn't like the looks of it.
4.0,"Good, but not quite what I was looking for - it’s thicker than I expected it to be."
4.0,This shirt is really cute and well made for the price. Looks great with high waisted shorts. I'm a sucker for all things stripes as well as crochet so this was a winner.
4.0,As advertised. Fits well. Can use touchscreen on iPhone with glove on.
4.0,Fits great good material
4.0,"This is a great watch. Good price.  I would have given it a 5, but the light do not work all the time"
4.0,"Thin fabric, would be really good for a summer wedding in a hot climate. I was unable to wear it for the event I wanted because it was too cold outside, however I am really looking forward to wearing it when it warms up and it was such a pretty and flattering dress."
4.0,color and material are very nice.  Runs a little small.
4.0,It was very cute=)
4.0,Love it but even size small is too big for my wrist.  Wish there is a smaller size.
4.0,"cute, smaller than what i expected"
4.0,"The writing is a little faint in some places and faded pretty quickly with normal handwashing. However, the band is very good quality, and the size is probably about the size you'd expect to fit a med-large female adult wrist or medium male wrist."
4.0,"This is not &#34;Magic&#34;, but it's a nice swimsuit.  I still have a few more pounds to lose for this to look great.  It holds in the stomach a little, but not the magic I was expecting.  It may be that my expectations were just too high.  The price was fantastic though."
4.0,"Very cute skirt, fast shipping. I ordered a 6, which is what I usually wear, but the skirt runs a little small. You may want to go up a size."
4.0,"Really nice value for the money.  I'm glad I listened to reviews and went one size up - now it is a perfect fit. Nice and stretchy material. The front is obviously pretty sexy but the high back and not-too-short length balance the dress.  It's not the type of material that will last years, but it's a good price so if I get a few good wears out of it, I'll be a very happy duck."
4.0,"Only worm once on 4th of July, but it was a nice quality and super soft."
4.0,"Love the concept and material, but runs small I bought a 3 xl and I normally wear in pants a US size 12 to 14!  I would actually have felt a little better in the 4 xl!!! There is absolutely no stretch!!!"
4.0,Very cute but one of the charms fell off on day 2
4.0,"Don't mean to quibble, but the horse is rearing, not bucking."
4.0,This is a beautiful locket. A nice size too. The only thing that a do not love is that in order to change the disc for your essential oils you have to remove it from the chain to open it. It won't just open up while still on the chain. Good value for the money though.
4.0,Tree ornament reminder of a lovely trip to Venice
4.0,"Love the hat. It works very well and goes with almost anything. The neck piece is kind of weird. Alas, it was a bargain,,,"
4.0,Im 5'3 150 lbs and my chest is 36D.  Its tight in the chest but works. My torso is short as well so i felt like it was a little baggy around my thighs. Over all super happy with the look and price
4.0,"Earrings are cute and lovely colors. Packaging left something to be desired as half the studs were bent in shipping. I've had no issue bending the studs back to straight though. The flowers are mounted on the stud in a way that has a small overhang of plastic, that can be uncomfortable on the ears."
4.0,This product is very flattering.....the dye leaks so plan on washing it first or walk around like a smurf
4.0,Great craftsmanship in a watch strap with quick release. I like the embroidery touch on the buckle. My only wish is that there was a much wider color variety to choose from. The blue strap look more like a powder sky blue in the Amazon image. The actual strap color is more of a bolder deep teal color.
4.0,"It's hard to believe they can make a watch like this for so cheap. I mean, $14? Come on! It looks pretty good and keeps good time.<br /><br />However, to my mind, they might have cut corners a little too far to get to this price point. The strap in particular is a little cheap feeling and feels like it won't last too long. That would be bad because it's a custom shape and would not be easy to replace.<br /><br />I'd say, if you can stretch your budget a little farther, there are more interesting and better quartz watches in the $40-$50 range. But if around $15 is where you need to be then this watch is a great option."
4.0,"This is an unusual dishwashing glove. It has silicone bristles on each palm so you can use the gloves themselves to scrub the floor, pots and pans and whatever needs scrubbing. It feels a little awkward at first as you're using your hands directly to scrub, but it does help out if your scrubber is getting dull and you need some reinforcement.  The gloves are thick enough to provide a buffer between my hand and the bristles. I'm still getting used to the feel but this is certainly an innovative product."
4.0,I had one of these before and it came off my wrist a lot. Haven't had that issue with this band. It matches my watch. The only problem is it keeps snagging my clothes on one piece of the band.
4.0,"Good until about ~315 on especially only deadlifts. After that point, these are unable to keep the weights steady"
4.0,fits perfect but its too long. I ordered the large and will have to cut it.
4.0,way better than the cheap band Samsung provides.<br />I thought i lost my Fit 2 cause it feel off and i didn't feel it.<br />With this band It is hard to loose the Fit 2 and it is comfortable to wear.<br />Also it is more distinguished looking.
4.0,Could be a bit thicker
4.0,"Stylish watch. Only complaint is that the ticking noise is quite loud. I like the thin band, it is surprisingly flexible for metal. The band sizes up considerably and I have to wear it on smallest size. Can't assess its durability yet because just started wearing it but seems quite nice for the low price."
4.0,luv it !!
4.0,Worth every nickel. This particular sock seems to fit a bit small.
4.0,"These are cute leggings, but I'm not in love like I thought I would be.  I am 5'1, about 135 and the Medium is a little long and a tiny bit baggy in the legs."
4.0,These ankle high compression socks give great support on the arch of the foot. My only complaint is I wish there was more cotton in the blend of the socks.
4.0,When I first received these I was first impressed with how soft they were. I read the instructions on how to wash them. After one wash they shrunk. I would suggest ordering one or two sizes larger.
4.0,"The bottom fit and the top part was too big,had to alter it. but it was a great wear"
4.0,They do keep blue light out. The fit isn't great but they were cheap so you cant expect alot of quality.
4.0,"This is probably the best watch winder the for the price. Only one thing keeps it from being perfect: You need a lot of vertical space to use it. The unit is about 8.5"" high, but you need at least another 6"" to open it completely. If you've got the room, buy it. You'll give it 5 stars. And, if space is tight, buy it anyway. Anything better will cost a lot more money."
4.0,the bra is just a little too small.  The straps have a hook and eye that hook in front at the shoulders. I just wish that there were two more sets of hooks and eyes.  I'm short and the straps are too long.
4.0,Way small and quite stretchy
4.0,Was expecting a little bit brighter image.
4.0,"Good size stones and settings.  Lighter setting than some others but good<br />for price.  Not sent in box for gift wrapping, just loose zip bag."
4.0,"Very cute, shier but i like it"
4.0,Very pretty ring. So far I will give it 4 stars!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:69f3588c9f7bbd92237ed48d310c6d99]] I was very excited to try on this jumpsuit so please excuse the wrinkles in the picture & video as I put it on right away without ironing.<br /><br />Pros- This jumpsuit is exactly as pictured, fully lined and the fabric feels very nice. The details on the sleeves and overall look are very good quality.<br /><br />Con- The smallest size was a size small, please add smaller sizes for petite women like me.<br /><br />As you can see in the video the jumpsuit is very nice but on my body it's too big so it makes me look shapeless. I'm 5 feet and around 105 lbs, normally wear an xs in clothing but small was the smallest size available. The quality is great and I would recommend this to people that are not as petite so it can have a better fit."
4.0,"I like this dress, but it is a bit is even in the small size. It is also a very heavy fabric so it was not quite as flouncy as I was hoping for, even with a petticoat."
4.0,"bigger than anticipated, but beautiful and like the picture."
4.0,i haven't used it yet but its cute & has enough space but kinda bulky at the bottom.<br />a little bit more then what im use to.
4.0,Great color of stones ... clasp needs side jaws .. lost it 3 times and then I bent the clasp and now seems to stay on
4.0,I am very happy with this purchase.  Sleeves are  fitted but rest of dress is flowing
4.0,Cute and dainty necklace
4.0,"It is what I was hoping for, very fluffy and well made, the fake-fur kinda sheds a little and got my room looking like I had a fight of cats and a husky on my bed.<br />They made this to be used, so I like the fact it is well made.<br />One thing I would like to make clear, you are buying something that was made to be sold for this price, so please don't think you're getting the &#34;best materials&#34; and &#34;best double ultra stitching&#34;, because you are just getting a cute hat made in china. Don't hate the player :)"
4.0,It fit nicely !
4.0,"Update: they refunded my order, and I think they might fit others better than me. Arrived as pictured. Love the concept!<br /><br />Old review. I’m not sure what to do as it is a hassle to return these, but one of the straps that came was definitely not new - looks like someone tried to make a hole, and they just hurt the strap a bit instead.  They also fit too loose around the toe part in general, so I feel like they will fall off as I walk."
4.0,Were they worth almost $12 for 2 charms? Probably not. But are they good charms? Yes. great for Alice in Wonderland fans.
4.0,"Super cute, light weight jacket. Not very high quality and probably won’t last long but for the price, it’s worth it."
4.0,Very comfortable but slightly small for an XL. I bought 2 other patterns by the same manufacturer and they fit as expected. Not sure why this one ran a little small.
4.0,It was thinner than my necklace. But it does the trick. No regrets<br />Thanks
4.0,The hair was a little long for my taste. After a trim though it was the perfect wig for my Raven costume.
4.0,"Love the design, it's comfortable, but unlike other gater masks I've purchased during this time, it's a little on the looser side that I have to keep adjusting it. But everyone's face is diff so it might be the shape of my head or something. Idk."
4.0,I liked it but my grandbaby hasn't used it yet thank you!
4.0,sefweFewe
4.0,Cut small length is extra long
4.0,"I am 5&quot;2', 100 lbs, 32D-25-32 and I got an XL after panicking over the reviews. Wrong choice. The romper was way too big---it's true to its measurements, which I should have listened to instead of listening to reviews."
4.0,"You get what you pay for, the chain isn't very fine and the clasp is kinda cheap. But neither have failed me yet and I love the look of it!<br />If someday the chain or clasp do fail I'll probably fix it with a fine chain, as long as the finish of the metal still looks good... we shall see, it did cost less than $20."
4.0,Love the colors but they don't fit my fitbit blaze
4.0,"it is very cute, i like it a lot"
4.0,"Seemed nicely made but ran very large, wish it came in a small or extra small."
4.0,Beautiful crafted unique style only issue was the pull on the crown to change date it was very tight however with small tool I was able to pull and correct the date.
4.0,I wish the ring were just a little bit bigger.  I have an odd key hook and the ring doesn't fit over it easily.  Everything else about this is fine.  If the ring were 1/4&#34; bigger it would be perfect!
4.0,These are ok but too big !🥹
4.0,His principal really likes the gift.
4.0,I love the costume . I’m a size 4 and I purchased a size medium and I love the fit. Fabric is smooth and not see through. I will use it again. Great buy for me
4.0,everything works very well
4.0,Nice but arms to tight on dress
4.0,It's really cool. Thank you for helping with shipping tracking.
4.0,It id okay
4.0,"17 stones on bracelet, only 4 we're the pretty Labradorite blue in color. The rest very grey. Maybe this Co. receives them already strung this way. It would be best worn outdoors to appreciate. But nice for the price. Fast delivery."
4.0,"Cheap quality, but very good for the price. Makes my nose itchy after a few minutes of wear."
4.0,Great dress for the price. I will say that the stitching at the top. Where it gathers is not the best but I added some decorative clips to cover it and dress up the look
4.0,I do not like wearing any kind of metal and it is hard to find bracelets that fit my wrist that do not look like something a kid would wear. So being in my late 20's this is a great bracelet set. The only reason I gave it a four star is because I'm pretty sure with the material I will break it within a year but I love the bracelets and they are a great fit for any size wrist!
4.0,"I adore the color of this bathing suit! It is absolutely gorgeous. A true HOT PINK. The fit is good, I ordered my normal size. It also has good coverage. The tummy control is a fail. I can see my “pooch” right through the bathing suit. That is really my only complaint.<br />Would not be a problem if you have a flat stomach."
4.0,This is an adjustable trucker hat.
4.0,"Love this print! However, it it doesn’t have any structure to the wrist openings so it is getting a little stretched out around my wrists."
4.0,"Ordered five different L.A. Imprint bikini t-shirts for a theme party.  They are adorable and will be a hit at the party.  The other four ladies (of various sizes) haven't seen them yet but it appears that the Regular M/L (which states on the tag as &#34;one size fits most&#34;) will work for all.  Only gave it a four stars since I'm not sure how they will wash up, but overall very pleased with how they look."
4.0,In the past every time when my toddler went to a baseball field he was upset because the noise. Those headphones help him a lot.
4.0,This set is perfect! I'm 39 weeks pregnant just a week away from my big day and I couldn't be any more happier. I bought it to wear after I go into labor to be more comfortable so that I don't have to wear what they give women at the hospital. It fits great and I'm sure it'll fit even better after my belly goes down a bit. The buttons at the top are perfect for breastfeeding and it unbuttons easily ! The robe is great in length it's long enough ( I'm 5'9) I ordered an XL because I'm always afraid of ordering clothes online that'll fit small. Large would've have been great but the XL with do just fine. I will definitely continue wearing this after my departure from the hospital!
4.0,I really like the dress..looks very korean style dress for me…the only thing I didn’t like is the fitting…it’s a little bit tight for my regular american size dress..but overall the dress is very classy looking dress..good for parties and date nights.
4.0,My girlfriend absolutely loved this neckless for Valentine’s Day and fairly priced.
4.0,The hearts are a size bigger than they are said to be on the packages it’s probably because I the shape but I still really like them !
4.0,Beautiful bag...so many uses. Awesome as a lunch bag.
4.0,"Beautiful dress!!! Initially, I thought the material looked cheap, but when I tried it on it looked really elegant and classy. I received a TON of compliments. I’m 5’6 and 175. I ordered an L and it fit really well. The length was also really nice. I plan on ordering other colors."
4.0,"Shoes are super comfortable, even more than I expected.  They are a great show to spend a day doing a lot of walking."
4.0,"Belt looks like the image. Though its not 100% leather, it was well built. And the swivel mechanism of the buckle is cool and strong."
4.0,It's very cute and well made but the sizing is off.  I'm a L on top and ordered an XL which is skin tight.  I'll give it to my daughter<br />and order a XXL for myself which i hope will be large enuf.
4.0,great with so many different colors
4.0,"Watch band itself is great, nice quality fit and finish..... The pin removal tool that comes with it is terrible."
4.0,"Love the hip, unusual and flattering style.<br />It does hang down straight but I like this top enough to have it taken in so it will have a more feminine shape on my 97 lb frame. Tie sleeves intriguing 👍"
4.0,"OMG! These Tom Ford Nastasya sunglasses are so stylish! The extreme cat eye is so glam and make these the perfect summertime accessory. The silver frame and mirrored lens create such an amazing contrast, and it complements my skin so well. They are a sunglass collection staple for sure. The reason for the four stars instead of five is due to the fact that that the frame and fit is very narrow and thus tense around the temples (and I have a fairly narrow head). The tension from that can be quite uncomfortable after a long period of time. But otherwise, they are great and perfect for any diva!"
4.0,"This is a thin, lightweight hoodie for evening walks or time around the campfire.<br /><br />There are two pockets in front.<br />The sleeves have thumb holes so your hand is covered a bit more.<br /><br />The material is very comfortable and soft. It has 4-way stretchiness and is moisture wicking and breathable.<br /><br />My wife likes hers a lot. She normally wears a Medium and ordered the Large. It fits her very well. She is 5'2"", 125 lbs. and wears a size 10 in tops.<br /><br />Her hoodie is Silver Gray and she looks good in it. I'm glad we got it.<br /><br />Highly recommended and would buy it again."
4.0,"Very small for a child.  does not fit an average 5 year old,  would be great for younger kids.  Quality is nice and soft."
4.0,"This blouse was very light weight and comfortable. I personally did not like the way it laid on me, however that is no ones fault. It has bat-wing sleeves and unfinished edges, as advertised. It is not very see-through, BIG BIG plus and is very light weight and keeps your cool. It is a very nice product I am just hard to sing praises since I couldn't wear it like I wanted to. :( Next time I will purchase a size larger.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount or free for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"It's a decent summer hat for the money. Came with a little ding in the back that won't come out, so that's why not 5 stars."
4.0,"I bought these earrings to match some I'd previously purchased. They arrived early and well packaged. The silicon backs are too long for the short posts and one of the posts was bent when it arrived. Because they are gold I could easily bend them straight again. I've stopped using the silicon backs because they get too close to my earlobe and pinch it, which I believe is caused by the short posts. Other than the post issue, I really like these earrings. They are inexpensive quality. :)"
4.0,Very pretty ad realistic!  Look like true gemstones.  Good design.  Great price.  Would recommend to anyone without pierced ears!
4.0,Look very nice! Christmas gift so I cannot comment on it any further that the looks right now.
4.0,Very cute dress!  fabric is perfect for summer.
4.0,They run big; but they're really nice and colors are great.
4.0,"Cute as a button, my sister will love'em"
4.0,"They were too small for my husband, but they fit me, so I'm keeping them. I wish they came in a bigger size."
4.0,So cute and fun at a great price.
4.0,"Very nice tie! I love the design, and the pocket square is a nice addition, even if I don't plan on using it that much. The pocket square and the tie come sewn together, but the threads are easy to cut without damaging the pocket square or tie, and come out cleanly. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I expected slightly better craftsmanship at this price range. Nonetheless, it is still a very well made tie, and I do not regret buying it in the slightest. I have never seen a tie with a design this cool, and when I stumbled upon this, I knew I had to get it. (I also got one in green.)"
4.0,defintilty worth the money.
4.0,"Well made, but rather large."
4.0,Not good as the pic
4.0,Very cute. I like the fit. Can be worn dressy or casual.
4.0,"Beautiful color but fits WAAY too big, I ordered a large which was too big. Reordered a medium and was STILL too big. I am normally an 8 in dresses and 10 in jeans (38 - 30 - 40) and could definitely wear the small."
4.0,The headband you have to tie yourself
4.0,"Runs a bit small; definitely not to be worn as a dress, but cute with leggings.  Love the unique style."
4.0,"Nice, simple, good quality"
4.0,"Worked great until they broke, they got hot and worped and the lenses stated falling out"
4.0,"I got my usual size (L) and they fit as expected.  I love the color. They are super soft and comfy. One star knocked off because the fabric seems like it will pill soon, the seams might unravel, and that seam going down the front gives you a bit of an unfortunate camel toe."
4.0,Overall it was nice. The wrist band is a little flimsy.
4.0,"My husband wore this as an Elvis costume.  It really stood out because most costumes are white or black.  It was a little snug for his 44 inch chest, but it worked.  You can wear a nude or red t-shirt underneath if you don't want it open all the way to your waist."
4.0,"This is a nice bralette. If you have a larger chest area, I want to note that it does not have any support. This is strictly for coverage. It does not have any support so do not plan on using this for a workout. That being said, it is perfect to lounge around in. As for fit, I would just purchase your usual size. Fit as expected."
4.0,The boots are nice quality. I received them befor I exspected and they came undamaged. They are stiff as can be exspected with new leather. A few days of breaking them in and they will be great.  They do run small so I ordered a size larger and I  very glad I did. They are tight in the toes but I hope after I break them in they will be a bit more comfortable.
4.0,"The fabric is different than the picture, but overall a really comfortable shirt. I love it!"
4.0,"Material is nice, shipping was days after expected"
4.0,Nice watch.  Looks good and works well so far
4.0,This bra is so cute and comfortable! It really makes the girls look fabulous. My only downside is I'm not fond of tying the silky ribbon. The ribbon slipped and is now tied in a permanent knot. It still fits nice but I will have to figures out a replacement. Definitely will buy again!
4.0,"I bought this product thinking that the clutch was completly black like shown on the pictures. However, the inside is orange, and beige and has compartments (2 sections once you unzip it)."
4.0,"Very nice shorts, loved the material, very comfy. My issue with them is the pockets are not terribly deep and I expected either a button or Velcro on the cargo pockets The zipper pocket is very tiny, too small for wallet or keys."
4.0,Cute. Fit ok!
4.0,Cute little coin purse....my sister loved it!
4.0,I have this for a while now despite the price and materials this glasses still look great
4.0,Lovely item love it
4.0,"I take a size 10 typically, sometimes a 12, 5'5&#34; about 125lbs.  The sizing on this was confusing, so I ordered the XXL, a 12 US.  It fits pretty well - the waist is a little big, but a belt or Tshirt tucked in would do it.  The skirt is A line, not a pencil slim type of skirt, which works for me.  It comes about 4-5&#34; from my ankles.  The denim is kind of heavy, and it's not as light a blue as in this picture.  Washing instructions say &#34;hand wash, lay flat to dry&#34; - not gonna happen - I have it in the machine now, then a hot dryer.  The button does seem kind of loose, and the zipper seems cheap, hope these don't fail.  For the price, I'm satisfied, altho I haven't worn it yet except to try it on."
4.0,Nice frames seems quality.  Some lens distortion on the top of lens tho-could just be MY vision.  I probably wouldn't reorder but you may have better luck!
4.0,Nice size . Very blingy.  Rose gold lacks
4.0,It was great till I lost it somehow lol
4.0,I like that the pants are very comfortable and they keep you very warm.
4.0,"Latch to adjust the belt is in an awkward spot, under the buckle. This makes it hard to open sometimes, but nothing too bad. It is cool how you can cut it down to your own size."
4.0,These shoes are really pretty and did look just like the photo. However within an hour my feet instantly started hurting. They were true to size but I think going up at least half a size would be better. Decent quality and can take some time to put on because of all of the straps.
4.0,Very nice colors and easy to use
4.0,"Good size, lint prone."
4.0,I normally wear a L on top and sized up to a XXL hoping it would be a relaxed fit and and it fits the way I was hoping.  The shirt is a decent fabric for the price - the skinny black strap on the shoulder is just a strip of black elastic and I may end up just cutting that off.  Other than that I am pretty pleased with the shirt!
4.0,much darker then pictured. But they're wood and they fit my ears and that was really the only things I cared about.
4.0,Band is a bit short for a large wrist
4.0,"I wish I didn't read some of the other reviews.<br />I normally wear a Med. to Large, but because of others review I ordered the XL large, it is a bit to big I should've stuck with the Large.<br />But wearable anyway. Good for the price.<br />35% cotton 65% polyester"
4.0,Decent dress. But a bit plain.
4.0,"I have a small size. I’m 5’2” about 117-118. These fit me but comfortably so, especially with the high waist and the stretch to them. However, they are a tad loose in the waist (I have a small waist) and tighter in the legs so they tend to ride down a little in a way that’s a little distracting.  It could be these are made for someone taller so that the top fits better.<br /><br />The cargo look is really cute. Something different for my athletic look wardrobe.<br /><br />Though these are marked as ‘casual pants’ the material looks more like workout pants. I wish they were a little less workout-wear look—like if the material were more matte instead of that slight sheen workout pants have.<br /><br />I’d wear these to workout in maybe—if I were doing something where I needed to run errands after a run at the lake and wanted to look a bit more ‘pulled together.’ However for a really intense workout, though they may be comfortable, I’d just not wear them for my more serious workouts—especially with the looser waist making them feel like they aren’t fitting in the crotch area.<br /><br />I wore them to take my dog for a walk and they were super comfy, but I did keep pulling them up a little at the waist just every so often. Since I’d just strolled around the lake with my friend and dog, I kept them on when I had to rush home to work for the rest of the day, and these pants felt really comfortable while I was working, too—my guy liked them a lot. For those reasons I gave them 4 stars instead of the 3 I almost did because of the fit.<br /><br />I’d definitely not wear them on a date or out to dinner or anything like that, more than likely.<br /><br />Overall, a cute pair of cargo athletic-look pants that don’t quite fit me exactly how I wish, and that fit comfortably for around the house or short errands, or for less intense workouts.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps."
4.0,lovely style
4.0,The product itself worked great and my daughter loved it. The packaging was problematic. It had some kind of sticky soap all over the outside. Really gross but did not impact the functionality (unless you really wanted to give it as a gift).
4.0,"This dress is perfect for a night out! Form fitting in all of the right places. The colors are great - a combination that I didn't have in my closet that is a very welcome addition.  The high neckline and length make it appropriate for almost any environment. I feel like I could wear it for a casual dinner, out dancing or to a nice show downtown :-)<br /><br />As far as the fit, I feel it runs pretty small.  I am 5' 6&#34; and 140 lbs. I usually wear a medium, but because of the reviews I expected it to run small so I ordered a large. It fits well, but I think I could have also gotten an extra large and it would have still for well and been a little less form fitting. It just depends on the way you want it to fit.

4.0,The belt looks good. It seems that the buckle is too big and the belt is too long for everyday use.
4.0,Pretty. Only problem is the same with every maxi  dress I buy on Amazon lately. Way too long. Need to hem it
4.0,Fits as expected.  Flattering for any figure.
4.0,What i dislike is that you should have more letters than others
4.0,I get so many compliments on this every time I wear it. But hte sleeves are very scratchy where the embroidery is. Would have really benefited from a liner there.
4.0,"The color is perfect!  Sizing is good. My only complaint would be the pockets.  They don’t seem to want to stay inside.  I found myself pushing the pockets in a lot. I did go ahead and hand tac them down so they would stay in, but, it should have been able to stay in without that."
4.0,Loved these boots but I need a different color. Brown instead of yellow. Fit good comfortable and great price.
4.0,just need a scratch  resistant coating!
4.0,"Close, but not perfect. Nice breathable material that looks good. There needs to be a tighter elastic band on each end so it fits better and holds it up over your nose. Good value for the price."
4.0,Love the dress but the bust is to small
4.0,These a great novelty sun glasses for the Kiss fan.  I've purchased them for myself as we'll as for others and they always get a hardy &#34;thanks - these are cool&#34;.  Minus one star for pricing - two or three bucks cheaper and we'd be talking five-star review.
4.0,Fit perfectly. Just a little extra long. I altored the front part and will post more pics some other time.
4.0,Like.  Gift.
4.0,Very cute shirt. I'd say it fits as expected. Soft material and nice buttons.
4.0,Lovely dress... wish it fit better. it was too big.
4.0,"Accurate to the photograph but this is a very warm hat. Packaged well, was not squashed."
4.0,"good fit, but could live without red spots."
4.0,"I loved the style of this dress. It also had a second thin, dark layer underneath to prevent it from being see-through, which I really appreciated. It felt high quality. My only issues were that the straps were too wide and it was a little too big in the chest area."
4.0,The print is a bit cheap looking but the fabric is nice and it appears to be well put together. Quite long as well which is nice and hard find for tall people like me.
4.0,"Just FYI the original pendant is 5mm smaller in circumference then this one. I got this to try out so if I like wearing it enough I could then spend the money for the real one. It is big and bulkier then I would like but the size difference would change that. Even with the issues, this imitation to the real thing still makes for a nice addition to your collection of costume jewelry."
4.0,The quality was a little better then I though it was going to be. The cane is super cheap plastic. I didn't even use it because it does kind of look really crappy. But the rest of it I was super satisfied with.
4.0,Absolutely adorable. But the backs come off easily. And I already lost one. Haven’t had them a week.
4.0,"This is super comfortable and cute!  The top portion is a little big, but otherwise fits great."
4.0,The grandson loved them. He had a lot of fun playing with them. A good bargain at the price. Had a couple of them that did not work. May have been able to fix them if I had been there longer.
4.0,"These are really cute, and what a great price! Unfortunately, I washed them with a pair of blue jeans and they are completely stained dark blue now. If you buy them, don't wash them with colors like i did!"
4.0,"My son won't take it off... However, the Logo is upside down 🤦‍♂️"
4.0,Pretty darn cute and as expected.
4.0,"Pretty nice for the cost, top opens up. Pretty good color and it’s a one size fits all."
4.0,"Nice dress for the summer. Material is not see through. I’m 5’2 “ and 140lbs medium fit just right. The reason for only four stars is because in has a seam going down the middle front of dress,  not a deal breaker,but unusual."
4.0,I thought it was just okay.
4.0,Wish it came in an xs!  A small fits ok but could be a little smaller
4.0,Better than expected for the money.  Will buy again.
4.0,"My son loves his new &#34;comfies&#34; and looks really cute in them. As suggested by other reviewers, I bought a size larger for my 5 yo and while it fits a little big, he will grow into it. Pants are a lot longer than I expected, but the elastic keeps the hem from falling down and if he keeps growing as fast as he has been lately, they'll be fine. The material is not as thick as other sweatshirts he has, but not the thinnest. We have washed it once and so far it stayed soft inside. Not sure how well it will hold up over multiple washes. If your son is a Kai fan like mine, this is a perfect gift."
4.0,its beautiful.
4.0,So soft and cute!!! Fits differently than shown (shorter) but i received it weeks before estimated delivery!
4.0,"I looove these slippers for their comfort and cuteness.  I have very picky feet, with high arches , and I love to put these slippers on. However, they ripped after a couple times wearing them in the house. So they are perfect if you mostly put them on and then sit on the couch, but they are not made to be worn as house shoes, as they are poorly sewn."
4.0,"I’m having to write a 4 star review only because the hem isn’t a consistent length on the bottom. Saying that, it wasn’t noticeable on and I actually didn’t notice it until I began to steam it. It goes up 3/4”-1/2” probably on the back left side. Other than that minor detail, the dress was in good condition. I’m 5’8” and 110 lbs and the dress was perfect and fit like a glove!"
4.0,Color was a much lighter thank expected
4.0,"This shirt and tie were good quality, great color, but the shirt was a bit long."
4.0,It was amazing I love the size and it fit my face frame just right I'm pleased wit these glasses thank you
4.0,Looks good..good quality too
4.0,Very happy with the earings but the shipping took so dang long. Over a month.
4.0,This was a big hit for my daughter's 5th Bday.<br />The bag that it comes in is very pretty as well and so much nicer than a plastic pouch.<br />Negative is that I had to glue back the big jems (necklace and earrings) since they didn't even make the 1st day.
4.0,"Robeez makes very good quality shoes. It's a bit hard to put on baby's feet though because he is so young, he has floppy feet. I've managed to put them on him a few times and they are super cute."
4.0,Great lens for the price- only issue is that they are not near as thick as lens that come with glasses and when you clean them you can feel the play of the lens in the frame
4.0,I just started doing yoga under a month ago and I've got to say these pants are extremely flexible while still keeping your 'parts' in place. They still get soaked when doing hot yoga but that's expected when you're sweating buckets.
4.0,Perfect size purses for preschoolers.  My preschoolers loved the purse.
4.0,I love them but one of the gold cross came deformed. no irritation and comfortable even when i fall asleep wearing them
4.0,Yhey are quick on and off
4.0,"A little on the small side , nice"
4.0,I love the comfortable material and colors!<br />Wish it was about 3-4 inches longer but still very comfortable!<br />I am 180 lbs and 5’3” I ordered a size Large
4.0,"These are fantastic readers but I do have an issue in that when I put them on top of my head when I do not need them, They pull my very thin, very fine hair out.<br />I have tried using a cord around my neck, but the glasses end up in my soup, or my spaghetti and then I have soup or sauce all over my clothing. UGH! Anything I prep, the glasses get into. If I take them off and lay them down, then I do not know where I placed them..<br />I cannot just put them in the front of my shirt because they are heavy enough to pull my shirt down  Having had my breasts removed, the scar is not a pretty sight. Plus, they make my shirts misshapen.<br />I tried to buy another pair from this company with the plastic frames, but the reader part was set too low and I need to hold them up to be able to read through them.<br />SIGH!"
4.0,"At first I thought the shirt was black but due to my screen having night mode, it made the shirt look black but its actually navy with white stripes. That was my mistake and it was not the reason for the 4 stars.<br />The shirt is too small and i got a large. For reference, i am 5’6 and 160-165 lbs. It fit tight on the chest and i don't have much cleavage. It has a boxy style and sits a little above my hips.<br />The material is pretty bad.. it felt soft and gets static quickly. It felt like swimsuit fabric to be honest.<br />If you’re skinny and don’t mind that type of fabric, sure go for it. But for larger sizes, this ain't it.<br />Only good thing was that it was delivered on time!"
4.0,Very warm and soft and the hood brings comfort and protection for the head.. It's Comfortable and colors stand out. This is a outfit you can throw on and run to the store and still look trendy.
4.0,Love the stretch material. You can wear this belt whether you put on weight or take it off!
4.0,"This is a good quality tshirt for the price. The fabric is  not too thin, the seams are clean, and it has just the right amount of stretch. It is a Junior length shirt, hitting well below my pants waist,  but above the thickest part of my hip. The color is also true,  a nice deep tomato red.<br /><br />As noted by many reviewers, this shirt runs small.  I wear a medium in other basic tshirt brands (Gap, Old Navy, Arizona, Nike, Champion). Based on reviews, I ordered a size up but the large isn't quite big enough. It's very snug across the chest and the shoulders are a teensy bit narrow. It's also snug around my belly, which would probably be fine if I didn't have a little pooch. 😊 I'll keep it for wearing under cardigans,  but I'll need an XL for everyday wear. The quality is good enough that I'll reorder and just go up 2 sizes.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'6&#34;, 138 lbs., 36in bust, 29in waist."
4.0,Love this shirt but it did run a little large on top but fit as expected at the waist. Good quality and material feels nice. I would recommend for casual wearing.
4.0,"I ordered 2 sets of these for christmas gifts. Arrived on time, nicely packaged, and as advertised."
4.0,Kids size medium was more like Adult small - but Grandson didn't care that it went nearly to his knees! Great pattern - very unique.  If sizing was accurate I would have given 5 Stars!
4.0,I ordered this dress in XL thinking it would be shorter than it was. I’m normally a size 8- 34DD but I’m 5’9. It’s a little bigger in the waist than I thought but I can tell if I had gotten my regular dress size of medium it would have been tight in the bust and arms. I’ll take it in a bit so it hugs my shape better but overall it’s cute and the quality is surprisingly good! The length is okay too for tall ladies!
4.0,It a very lovely dress just not if you have boobs.
4.0,"Love this product but wish I'd gotten a different color. I expected dark teal and got green. It fits well and is a well made, also a great versatile piece to dress up or down."
4.0,Great indoor prop. Could be 20-30 cheaper though.
4.0,"Got them to use outdoor, they are very soft and nice but they are thin I don’t think I can use them as mask to prevent viruses. It fit well, not tight not loosen."
4.0,"This clutch is my go-to for church or other functions where I don't want to carry a large handbag.  It has lasted and held up well.  In fact, I would say it looks as good as when it was first purchased.  The pockets inside help to keep items organized and the strap can be added to convert to a crossbody.  I imagine I will be using it for more years to come."
4.0,"It looks boxy but with a pair of skinny black pants and boots it's great.  It's meant to be baggy with short arms, I roll the sleeves.  Got tons of compliments at work too.  The fabric is thick and doesn't look cheap at all.  My only complaint is the color is slightly more cream/tan than white, but very good looking nonetheless."
4.0,These are great! I've been using them since September and they're cheap but none of them have broken.
4.0,too beautiful~
4.0,"I like this bathing suit! The bottoms are a little small but I expect that from most suits I order online. The top is very cute and flattering! I am normally a medium top/large bottom and I ordered an XL. Again, bottoms are a bit snug but wearable."
4.0,"I got this chain for my boyfriend and I like it, it was just a bit bigger than I thought it was going to be but it has held up very well."
4.0,Too loose I usually buy large or Xl. Im returning and reordering a Large instead of XL.
4.0,"It's a bold, big & beautiful,  but not without issues; one  of the problem I found was due to its weight-sort of felt a bit heavy around my neck and didn't stay in the position in which it was clasped. That aside, I highly recommend it, because it is a pretty necklace, and judging from the reviews I may just have been unlucky to receive one with the issues stated."
4.0,"I have an athletic build and this suit is very flattering to that shape.  I got a large and it is somewhat smaller than what most would consider large.  If you have larger bust size (c or larger)  I would recommend going at least one size up.  But for my build, I love the look at fit."
4.0,"Love the shirt, but ordered ""grey"" and it was solid white.  Not sure if it was a shipping mistake or mislabeled, returning for another color."
4.0,They are comfortable and stylish.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:17fb7db46729de3e66058990b2828615]] Very pretty. I got so many compliment but I didn’t expect it to be see through. I thought it would be thicker floating material. I still really like it Just was not what I expected.
4.0,"Great material. However, the shirt is too short. The shorts fit perfectly. I just wish the shirt was a little longer."
4.0,"This outfit is a perfect summer outfit; especially perfect for the 4th of July.  This two piece matching outfit is 100% cotton and very laid back, comfortable look.  This outfit is very cute and patriotic; can be worn out to play, around the house or out and about.  I think that it looked great on my son and he really liked it, especially the shorts. There are a lot of things I liked about this outfit and a few things that I did not care for.<br />The things I like about the product:<br />Shirt<br />+Nice vivid colors<br />+ Big red, white, and blue smiley face on front<br />+It is sporty (skate boards) and patriotic (flags, red, white, and blue)<br />+Fits great, thin breathable material<br />+One small tag<br />+Very soft, very cute<br />+Did not shrink after wash<br />Shorts<br />+Fits well<br />+Patriotic, cute<br />+Very soft, looks comfortable; child says it is<br />+Drawstring to tighten and keep shorts up<br />+Pockets have hidden color (my son’s favorite part about the outfit)<br /> +One pocket is gray and pink in the inside and the other is yellow and blue<br />+The material is thin and loose fitting, child does not get to hot<br /> There are a few things that I do not care for about the product.  The first thing is I think it fits a little small, and wish it was a slight bit bigger.  This way it can be worn a little bit longer.  I would recommend getting a size bigger.  The other thing was that the band in the shorts moved after wash.  This is kind of expected and was able to twist it, but a slight pain.<br /> Overall I am happy with the summer outfit I have received, and my son is very happy with it.  This is a product I would recommend to others as well.<br />I would like to point out that I have received this product for free, for my own honest opinions, experience, and review that ia all my own."
4.0,"These ties look great, but closer inspection you can tell it's doesn't have premium materials or have solid stitching. I give 4 stars based on the value of these ties. They make for great backup ties in the office."
4.0,If a bra can be comfortable then I have to give thumbs up to this one.
4.0,"Would've given 5 stars if not for the screaming, repetitive K-Swiss brand tape on both sides of the pants, they are loud and diminish the quality look of elegance that these pants could have. The material is excellent, overall finish and seams, no excess threads noted which show great care in its production/manufacture. These pants will last, I could tell. Material is heavy but soft and kept me warm/comfortable during my first use in my workout. However, the tape used kind of brushes against my arms and somewhat rough on edges. I can compare these pants to my Nike's that I have been using for over 5 years that are good but cost me >$45 a pair. These K-Swiss pants are of the same material, thickness and serve the same purpose for $29.99. I do highly recommend these pants minus the loud logos, IMO."
4.0,Only thing don't like is it doesn't get warm enough for me.
4.0,"I’m a teacher and was looking for wash and wear clothing for the fall. This dress fits perfectly and covers up my quarantine pounds, too! I’m buying it in four more colors so I can just wear one every day and throw it in the wash when I get home."
4.0,This is a very nice dress. The dress looks the same in person. Whichever size you order that is the size you get. I also have it in the yellow. The material is nice & light. But not too light to where it's see thru.
4.0,Definitely going to seamstress Waterfall didn’t lay correctly. Will need a little hook & eye to keep jacket stationary in center. Material is nice does not wrinkle.
4.0,"Pretty color, material was flowy and pretty to look at, but felt a little cheap against my skin. On me, this cut is not very flattering. Looks matronly because I am wide across the bust line and middle. I got this to wear as part of an outfit for a group dance performance, and it fit the bill perfectly. Don’t know if I wear it again because it’s just not that flattering on me."
4.0,nice looking belt.  Fits well.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the loop on the belt to hold the excess is not attached.  I hang my belts from a hook and the loop falls off the open end.
4.0,I like that its adjustable but it gave me a rash
4.0,"The first time out with only a pr of small readers & money clip with drivers lic, cr card and 3 $20 bills the neck string pulled out without my notice. Fortunately a customer behind me saw it happen and alerted me.  **upgraded to 4 stars. Seller noticed my post and did a prompt refund."
4.0,Too big. They only fall down a little Mom.
4.0,"They look awesome and fit well, but my only issue, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that they are slightly uncomfortable on my nose and could use a little bit better nose pads for the bridge of my nose. Otherwise, I love them!"
4.0,"Washed it once so far and I see some threading coming out but for the price these are pretty good, haven't worn them out yet but from the looks of it they are 4 stars because the price and thickness for fall and winter."
4.0,"Love it !  The only reason I deducted 1 star is it runs a little big.  I wear a 38C in a molded padded non-underwire bra and ordered by the chart which was a 38. The lace is very pretty, soft and well made.  It is stretchy so I reordered it in a size L."
4.0,The blue is pretty in person. The chain is nice. The bead to make the chain to length is something new for me. I tried it on and like the adjustable length. It's a good size when wearing a v-neck top or dress.
4.0,"I like these joggers quite a lot actually.  The color is pretty, the stitching is sound and the fabric is nice.  They're good for light workouts and for lounging.  I think I wear them about once a week.<br /><br />However, they do fit like true joggers.  They are slim-fitting, almost like leggings.  So, I think these pants run just a wee bit small, but not so much that they would fit poorly if you ordered your true size.  If you want a looser fit, I would order a size up, though."
4.0,"This hat was really trendy. The ear mittens were not overbearing, but yet kept the ears nice and warm."
4.0,Purchased these for my 10 year old nephew for Christmas and he loves them but they are a little tight. These are made for a tall lean kid and he's a little chunky. He wears them anyways though.
4.0,"I really like my butterfly earrings, but you may want to put a large back on it so it doesn't droop. Other than that, you could play these earrings any which way. Dressed up, down or on the egde! The bigger cluster of butterflies earring is a bit uncomfortable to sleep on. Easy fix...."
4.0,Materials are good. I hope it is wider so that my feet do not touch the ground.
4.0,Asian sizes again
4.0,As advertised but not delivered in two days.
4.0,It didn’t stick to the cap very well and made it heavy. But I just reinforced the cap with a couple bobby-pins aside from that it was great quality
4.0,"Got this so our youngest could match up with his brother's costume, Batman.<br /><br />Ordered the 9-12 month size for our 11 month old and the fit was fine (he is 18#s).  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that only having 4 snaps means the crotch is open and you can see the diaper, but depending on the angle, you don't really see it in the pictures you take.<br /><br />We have run it through the wash twice and it has held up well, so we should be able to pass this on to someone else in the future.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the plastic snaps, so I took a star off.  But since this is a costume and not something he will wear day in and day out, might be 5 starts for others."
4.0,"I love this lanyard but I wish it was a tad more durable. It's very cute and I get tons of compliments on it, but twice when it's just barely caught on something it has come apart. Easily fixed both times, but I cringe every time it gets caught even a little bit. Given that most people wear their lanyards and they're very long and therefore easily caught on things, I wish it was a bit more durable. That said, I'm going to keep using it if and until it falls apart, and then I may still just get another!"
4.0,"When I first put them on, my feet finally had the right support and padding I needed, as I wore them I noticed they were a bit wide. Next time I order these comfortable shoes, I will get a narrow width for a better support."
4.0,Came very quick from Germany!  Love them.....
4.0,"The item itself is well-made, and especially nice are the clear pieces that hold it onto the glasses.  Other similar clip-ons have black pieces that can look like shadows in the field of view.  With these clear pieces they are almost invisible.  The problem for me was the metal piece that is squeezed at top to put clips on glasses.  The way it is shaped and angled presses it into the top of my nose. It leaves an indentation mark on my nose & causes headaches.  This is probably due to my own anatomy and glasses combination, and not a problem with the item itself.  Unfortunately I had to return these.  I also liked that they were not really dark yellow so they did not cut down on brightness per se, just blocked the blue light from my computer screen."
4.0,Most of the time when the tunnel is used for stretching it's wider and that helps if it swells a little bit in the beginning. These are narrow like one you would use for every day after you had the size you wanted. So if your ear dos swell it's a little small and uncomfortable.
4.0,"Great fit, quality and color!!"
4.0,"It’s a super cute shirt and I would highly recommend it to others. I felt a bit boxy in the upper half of the shirt, but I love the V cut at the bottom and think it fits well. Price point makes it a great buy, just wish it looked more appealing in the top half. While wearing, the fabric folds a bit so print in front gets smushed inwards. Overall, great shirt for a great price."
4.0,"somewhat small when i got the package, but i read the reviews and made sure to order 2 sizes up (XL). gave it to my friend for her birthday and she loves it. Super soft material."
4.0,"Very stylish, comfortable. Ordered my regular size and it came in 1 size larger as I had been informed it would. Perfect with boot socks."
4.0,Cute but thick material
4.0,"Great watch band if you need a replacement. It is nylon, 22mm and fits on men's watches very easily. It does not come with the pins, but if you are replacing, then you already have a pin.<br />It is a nice flexible nylon, not plastic, so it is more comfortable and flexible than a lot of plastic.<br />It was easy to put on and change on my husband's watch. He likes it over all. The spacing of the holes works for him. Over all it is a good purchase to replace an old, broken band.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review"
4.0,Really good quality. Nicely designed.  Versatile wearable. Great colors. Fit well and has a little room.
4.0,One problem is they are a bit big in the hat. Very deep. But wearable.  Just FYI.
4.0,They were very nice nice and warm
4.0,"They tend to leave a compression ring at the top -But, THEY DO KEEP YOUR FEET WARM AND TOASTY, WITH VERY LITTLE BULK."
4.0,"Work fine, great price for 2. Takes a little to get used to it."
4.0,These airings are very nice and sexy and elegant lots of compliments when wearing them
4.0,I by no means have a big head and this hat was a little too small for me. I wound up sewing hair weave clasps inside the hat to keep it on.
4.0,"These are very cute but from the description and pics I had no idea you had to actually sew the single pieces on to your garment, I assumed they were clip on just like the big one is."
4.0,"The vest is great, and I'm wearing it 4 hours per day.  The reason I rated it 4-star instead of 5 is it lacked the sort of clear  &#34;quickstart&#34; instructions that often accompany new items.  The instructional materials spent more time selling the user on the benefits of cold-exposure than on how to properly set up the vest.  It may seem obvious to the vendor, but I went a full day without realizing the shoulder gel packs were still mixed in with rthe packing materials.<br /><br />With that out of the way, though, I really like the vest itself."
4.0,"I love tops that are high neck and different , I mean original, its definitely original and sometimes feels to hot because of the neck line but overall love it"
4.0,"4 stars because it is more see-through than what I'd like. Other than that, it's really comfortable!"
4.0,"These socks were purchased for my son for high school baseball to wear with knee high baseball pants. These do not reach above the knee on him. He is 6’1”. They will still be used, but are not the length we were hoping for."
4.0,Somewhat larger fitting then expected
4.0,The cushion part started coming apart fairly easily but we fixed it with duct tape pretty easily.
4.0,Glasses are really good all around but the one thing that i don't like is when you have them on for 5 minutes or more then you take them off they leave behind two red marks where your on your nose where the little &#34;nose pices&#34; are(i don't know what their called).
4.0,Not 100 %  slip on.  But pretty close.  Comfortable
4.0,"This is ADORABLE. The little seagulls are sooooo cute. I love them. The fabric feels great, and the dress fit nicely. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'8&#34; and about 165 pounds. My only complaint is that it is just a LIIIIITTLE too short for me. If it were an inch or two longer I'd feel so much better. As is, it looks terrific with leggings and I can't wait to wear it."
4.0,Gift for Mom. She loves it.
4.0,I got a lot of compliments on this dress. It's long which is perfect for me. I'm 5'8&#34; and it was an inch or two on the floor. The pockets are a great addition. The fabric is kind of rough and cheap feeling. Still a great fall and spring dress.
4.0,"used these for a creative photosession,  Graphics are a little smudged but unnoticeable unless zooming in 100% into the JPEG picture - LED functions are great.  a really good value."
4.0,Great midweight sweatshirt
4.0,The smallest size it could be adjusted to is still a bit loose for an average woman (I’m 5’4). It does heat up pretty quickly and really help relax up my stiff neck/shoulder. I wish it could be battery operated or chargeable.
4.0,Cool design for those of us needing an MTV shirt.
4.0,"These look like a pasteboard with gorgeous colors.  Fun, though"
4.0,Not meant for new babies but very nice
4.0,"I was looking at these earrings for my upcoming wedding.  I'm always afraid to order online because you never know what you're getting.  the earrings shipped quickly and are absolutely stunning!  The only tiny complaint I have is the back to the earring is huge and I'm afraid it may be seen too much from the front (who knows, I may just have really small lobes, ha!).  Other than that, it is a beautiful product and I couldn't be happier!  I can't wait to wear them!"
4.0,"Nice sweater, not entirely pleased with the quality of knit, but was given as gift and the receiver likes it."
4.0,Love this wallet but it came with marking on it and also left sticky residue on my cards.
4.0,"I love the way these leggings looked on me the first time I wore them. They are a little long, as I am only 5'4&#34; but they fit well. When you have a butt, it is difficult to find bottoms to adequately cover your behind. These leggings cover my whole butt and don't slip down when I bend over. The only downside with these is that they lose their elasticity in the waist after a few washes/wears. I have worn them about 2 or 3 times now, and I now have to keep pulling at the waistline. But, I would probably purchase again."
4.0,Love it! Well made and fits perfect!
4.0,"Still a great color, but I was expecting a little darker shade than the lime I received."
4.0,"My very fit, athletic build 9 year old/10 next month Son loves 🥰 this shirt! says it’s softer than other shirts we’ve tried. All I care is my son will put on clean clothing. He is at that age wear I’ll buy 5 more of these and just be thankful it isn’t a fight to get him dressed in the am for school.<br />This shirt is made pretty well. I wish it was softer but still softer than most shirts. Now if it can hold up till the next growth spurt? That be a Christmas miracle. 10 yr old boys are not gentle with clothing."
4.0,"item is a little snugger then i would like, but the feel is great"
4.0,LIGHT WEIGHT AND EASY TO MOVE AROUND IN  GOOD VALUE
4.0,Fast shipping.  Be weary that the ends are not sewn.  Could eventually tear or unravel!
4.0,Good shoes. Made from high material.
4.0,It fits really cute for a middle age woman.
4.0,"These socks do what they say, they have a gentle grip on your leg. They stay up without constricting your leg."
4.0,The quality of the pin was beautiful.  It was smaller than I expected through.
4.0,The mask looks awesome. It's very sturdy but light weight. Everyone loves it. My only issues are that it fits a bit narrow. Almost feels like it's for a child. And the straps are not great. They stretch so I am constantly fixing.
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. Lots of reviews say it runs big but I had no issue with sizing. Only thing that was off were the sleeves, super wide so I had those taken in which is why I gave 4 stars. Love the fabric, awesome feel."
4.0,"This apron is super cute! Plus it's incredibly easy to wipe stains off of, so I don't have to throw it in the washing machine constantly (yes - I am a messy cook). The pockets are nice, too.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the tie straps are pretty short. I extended them with some simple garden twine, and it seems to hold up okay, but it's aggravating that I can't find aprons with longer ties!"
4.0,I got these scarves for friends. They were thrilled. They rock them in the spin class while wearing and sweating.
4.0,"nice brush, really pulls a lot of dirt out. not sure in which direction it's meant to be used"
4.0,"I used this to re-cement the top band of a wedge shoe that came out from the sole.  The band was jute and the insole was rubber and the bond is secure.  While this glue worked well, I sure could have used the nozzle pictured.  The nozzle was not in the blister pack, and it was not in the box.  I haven't contacted the seller, as it's too hard to find whom to call.  It’s a good product (Weldbond, for instance, did not work).  As for all glues, always clean off the tip and grease inside the cap and tip with Vaseline or Baby Oil before closing it up to prevent it from getting plugged for next time."
4.0,Very little difference with or without the glasses for night driving.  They are well made and fit well over my regular glasses.
4.0,It's a nice summer dress for the price
4.0,"I LOVE the necklace, but the chain broke when I was trying to turn the necklace. It is so small and thin. I only wore it one day."
4.0,I love this dress. It does run small. I am normally a size 2. I read the reviews and ordered a size 4. It fits great but if you don't want it snug you may want to go up 2 sizes. A size 6 probably would have fit also. The light pink is a little see through but with a neutral color slip it is fine. These dresses are hand wash only. I think it would shrink if you put it in the dryer. Overall though the dresses are great for the price. I ordered 3 in different styles and love them all. You can't beat the price.
4.0,"Not true to size, runs a little large. Very comfy. Material is light and perfect for sleepwear. My wife loves them"
4.0,"These are a gift for my daughter. They are cute...look exactly as pictured. I did have to stitch one of the seams closed when they came but other then that, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,These earrings were quickly delivered and well packaged. They are super light and absolutely gorgeous! Really pretty the only reason I gave one star is because the colors are slightly off. They aren’t as blushey as the pictures and more of a dusty rose-ish and light brown. I really was hoping they’d be more blush colored but They are still really pretty and otherwise exactly as described. Will be ordering in a different color.
4.0,Runs small. Great design . Fast shipping .
4.0,"I own a few Waldeal hats. The one seems a bit bigger than the others, more designed for a man's head, but can be worn by a woman with a slightly larger noggin. Its a good bargain, and looks pretty cute."
4.0,"I like the bag, it is light and well made, I just wish I can take phone pouch off the strap. Could not beat the price, it was well worth it."
4.0,mine were a little rough around the edge so sizing up was surprisingly painful. I got through it and it did what i needed to. Just don't be disappointed when you get what you pay for. A cheaper product is a compromise. You got to be able to ask yourself if you're willing to compromise and not complain about the outcome.
4.0,A little bit too big but very nice quality
4.0,"They are beautiful. Just received them, so I don't know how they'll hold up under normal use. The only drawbacks:(1) the swirls that look like the color of yellow gold in the picture actually have a very pale yellow appearance &#34;in person&#34; although still beautiful; and (2) the diameter of 5/8 inch or about 16 mm is small enough to slip through the buttonholes of my French-cuffed blouse. I'm planning to cut 4 one-inch circles out of stiff clear plastic and cut a hole-punch-sized hole in each, to wear between the cufflink and the cuff to keep the cufflinks from slipping out. If you don't do something like that, be careful that you don't lose one while you're wearing them."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ea11877e0aa2f54a6a1255462833eea8]] I would have given 5 stars, but I feel it needs a thicker/wider band for such a large stone. I do like though that the side stones wrap so far around the band. It's very pretty, but in regular lighting seems white and I can't decide if I like that or not. Seems to be well made and true to size. Comes with the certificate and a ring box. When it picks up the best lighting then you can see the warm beautiful moissanite sparkle. My photos are paired with small eternity bands. I like it best with my chevron enhancer band."
4.0,These surprised me because they were actually fitted and not loose whatsoever!
4.0,Not bad quality and looks very cute.
4.0,Afraid when you wash and put in dryer will shrink
4.0,Semi-awkward on the bottom but really nice color. Got a lot of compliments
4.0,[[VIDEOID:c23ef80d9a7fc360c62602f1bb17ef89]] Great bag. Don't like the flap sticker though.
4.0,"Fit super well! Purchased the 2x (5'1&#34;, 225 lbs) for my birthday last year. While it was a bit long, I can't help that based on my own proportions lol. I wore the pieces separately a couple of times - top with high-waisted jeans and skirt with tied denim shirt. It's fairly inexpensive, and while a little thin, the material isn't terrible quality. There were no snags, strings, or tears upon purchase. I was compelled to review this because I've lost a little weight since wearing it the first time, so I wore it for a family event last week. Honestly, it fits even better than before! I had to adjust the straps on the top a bit, but I'm satisfied with this purchase nearly a year later."
4.0,"hermosos, me encantan"
4.0,"I needed some decent sunglasses and I just can't put hundreds of dollars into them.  I've done that and I'm over it.  These are cute, well made, and affordable.<br /><br />Are they as nice as a pair of RayBans or Maui Jims? No.  Are they way better than most things you find in Target or the like? Yes.<br /><br />I would totally buy another pair from this company.  My only complaint is they are gradient lenses and I prefer really dark lenses for being out in the bright sun.  My next purchase will definitely be a style without the gradient.  But they are really great for driving and days when you're not being blasted by the sun."
4.0,My granddaughter wears them every day and they are already wearing out
4.0,"It runs a little large. I’m 5’ 6”, 162LBs. I have a fat tummy, ordered a large, usually wear a large in yoga pants, these fit a tiny bit too big. I probably could’ve gotten a Med, but without ordering another pair wouldn’t be able to tell for sure. I love the cut of these, The design and seam placement show a good understanding of the female body. The fabric while comfortable is a tiny bit too thin not compressing all the bumps and bulges on my rear end, might be eliminated if they were tighter, but if they were tighter they might also pull at the the wrong places causing the pockets to not lay flat and taking away From the sleek design. All in all,  these were a good buy, and  I’ll wear them a lot, and probably will order again."
4.0,I like the hat but the elastic comes up too far and after wearing it for a while it hurts my ears
4.0,"love how it looks, but it needs pads in the bust area. I use size 6 but order 8 considering the other reviews, and I'm glad I dit it!"
4.0,"Cute and comfortable.A bit masculine. The lenses are not as dark as I like, but I recommend for the quality."
4.0,It's nice and warm but small
4.0,"I ordered these socks with my son in mind. He goes through socks like crazy and although I was pretty sure he wouldn't be over the moon about the designs (I really like them) on the socks, I figured he would be happy to get some new socks. When I showed them to him, he did like their appearance but when he tried them on, it was clear they were too small for him. He wears a size 10 shoe. I tried the socks on my feet and they fit me pretty well...the heel is a bit longer but I wear a size 7 to a 7.5 shoe (in ladies). So, if you wear an 8 to a 9 in mens shoes, these would probably fit comfortably. They sort of remind me of compression socks because they hug my calves firmly but they don't cut off the circulation. Even though these are sold as &#34;mens&#34; socks, I will happily wear these.<br /><br />They are colorful, the designs are spiffy and they seem to be made well. I checked for flaws in the stitching but did not see any. These socks are nice because they aren't really thick, which is a plus if you ask me because your feet will stay cooler and sweat less.<br /><br />These could easily be worn by men with smaller feet or worn by ladies who wear between a size 7 & 8 shoe.  If you have a larger foot I would think these would be too tight and small for you."
4.0,nice quality - comfortable to wear - have to be careful when you remove them from the packaging or from a tight back as the wire around the pearl will stretch out.
4.0,"These earrings are very stylish! The only con I have is they are a little heavy, but I purchased some support backs for heavy earrings like this, and they work great!"
4.0,I bought these and they worked great! Great quality for how cost effective they are!
4.0,"While this wallet is slimmer than some, it really isn't all that slim.  Fractions of an inch make a difference, but it really isn't that much smaller than a standard bi-fold wallet."
4.0,Comfortable and good looking. Waist tie is/was about two feet too long and stitching has already started coming apart. That is the only problem.
4.0,The top is great - nice soft fabric!<br />The bottom fabric is a little stiff but has a nice shape visually<br />Curious to see how it washes...
4.0,"The look is nice and we'll made, however, the mask does not fit as wide as shown in the illustration, not fitting far enough over the nose and under the chin."
4.0,"Just the right fit for fitness band,and with accessory tools. Nice, and shipped quickly too."
4.0,These are so cute! My only negative is the assortment could have had more variety.
4.0,"Runs a bit small like everyone said so i bought up a size.  Same thing,  but looks good regardless"
4.0,Could be just a little longer. Nice color.
4.0,the white stons were blue and the light blue stones were white. ok quality wore a few days in a row and noticed the metal coting wear off some but worth the price
4.0,"This dress is very pretty, however it does run big. I am 5&#34; & I weigh like 170 and I ordered a medium but it was to big, so I'm returning to get a small."
4.0,"I like the pants, they fit and wash well, thinking about ordering another pair.  Did order another pair."
4.0,"It is everything I wanted. If I could change one thing, I wish it was made in the USA. Other than that, it's a great wallet."
4.0,"This seems like a nice mask. The nose strip is wide and can be shaped well to your nose to give a decent seal around the top of the mask. I also find the straps that go around the head more comfortable for long wear. Unfortunately, this mask is too big for my face. I gave it to someone else and they seem happy with it. I wish this style was made in just a little smaller size and it would be perfect."
4.0,"These glasses are stylish and affordable. The quality does not compare to readers that I have purchased individually from Target. The fit is pretty generic which I suppose is to be expected for reading glasses. The quality of the lenses is not great, I don’t see as well as I do when wearing more expensive glasses of the same strength. I will keep these as spare glasses in my purse and desk, but since I wear reading glasses all day at work I’m going to find something more comfortable for my eyes and face."
4.0,It was def too small but super cute! The back was super exposed so if your comfortable with that then this is great!
4.0,"I debated between the medium and the small because I'm typically  between sizes. And I honestly think I could do the small but I like the looseness of the medium. Super comfy. I’m 5’5, 145# for reference. The dress hits right above the knee which is perfect. I got the navy and it’s a darker color than pictured."
4.0,"The elastic fit is great but these shorts are very long, way past the knee. I was able to hem them by about 3 or 4 inches, but keep that in mind. Otherwise the fabric is comfortable amd they wash well."
4.0,Nice compact backpack
4.0,Very comfortable and holding up well. The only downside to these boots is that I get static electric shock while wearing them at work. I work with a lot of plastic and for whatever reason get shocked way more while wearing these then I did when wearing leather boots.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:617e2bdae96773586e273bc4902eb781]] Kind of cheap looking but was cheap in cost. Overall I like it and I’d is cute. I tuck the strap behind my head so it looks better
4.0,"Very cute ....perfect for bracelets, earrings, etc.  D<br />Good definition in metal work."
4.0,"These scarves are much nicer and softer than I anticipated.  Since they are coming from China, shipping does take a while but not nearly as long as estimated.  My estimated date was 3-4 weeks and they arrived in about 2.  The only negative I have is that it states in the description that it comes with a key ring and I didn't receive that, but I never would have used it anyway."
4.0,"its like leggings but looks like someone painted it. I will wear this in fall, it has some warm liner fleece inside it"
4.0,"The price of these polarized sunglasses is wonderful! Plus they are sleek and stylish and look wonderful on you while you wear them.  I want a pair of the white with blue, maybe next year, as I just got these. I am concerned about the lenses popping out so easily, even though they go back in I worry when biking it may fall out and get damaged.  Other than that, I have no complaints."
4.0,I LIVE IN AN AREA THAT IS BELOW 32 DEG AND GETS SNOW. THESE HATS ARE ARE GREAT AND KEEP YOUR HEAD WARM. I WEAR IT WHEN I GO SNOW SKIING. WILL BUY MORE FO MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS.
4.0,"Wax Jeans are my go to, I'm a little disappointed in the fit on these. They seem to be less allowing for curves and more designed to a narrow shape. They're still really cute and fairly comfortable and I'm rockin them all summer long."
4.0,"medium usually fit, but is a snug medium. Otherwise the length is perfect. I am  5'2"""
4.0,Super comfy hut it arrived with a sna hole near the pocket.
4.0,Good looking pin. Solid material. Color is very bright.
4.0,"Great hat. A bit on the small side, but overall awesome design would recommend"
4.0,"A little large, but my son loves these pjs"
4.0,"These are really cute and they come in a nice gift box. I'm not sure how they are measured, but they are way smaller than i expected. I'd say they are more like 2 mm."
4.0,"I actually bought this parasol off ebay in 2005. I still have it. It's awesome! If you take care of it, it WILL last you. However, it's really for show. It really doesn't offer much sun protection. I suppose it's better than nothing.. I gave it 4 stars because of that. Though when I bought it I only bought it for show anyway so it suited my purposes. Can't believe they're still around!"
4.0,Super cute necklace.
4.0,"I'm usually a medium, ordered medium, its really big. Where the pockets sit makes me look like i have saddle bags. Will have to do some altering."
4.0,Haven’t worn them yet.  Light weight.  Cute.  Hope they hold up.
4.0,"Not bad, but its loose around the waist if you have big hips, not much curve to the design."
4.0,More yellow then expected
4.0,Super cute. It just fits a little small and runs a little short if you have a larger bottom. And right on the chest if you have a bigger bust.
4.0,Great glasses but lenses smudge really easily - would be nice to have a cloth included for the lenses.
4.0,"It is beautiful, but my niece is too small, I recommend taking one or two sizes of the normal size"
4.0,"Solid frames for great price. Slick look. Could of been packaged better for protection. Overall, I’m satisfied."
4.0,"This is the highest quality low quality item i've received, if that makes sense. When it first arrived I was a little disappointed because I had been expecting these to be nice enough that I could wear them out and about, but they really just don't fit that mold - they look just a liiiittle too cheap for that. However, they are extremely comfortable and make excellent sleeping shorts which is how I've used them all summer. If you lower your expectations then these shorts will fit them."
4.0,"These are great--comfortable, cute, and safe. My mother wears them every day."
4.0,"If you need to remove links, you must have good vision and fine motor skills😳🤗"
4.0,"People who are complaining in these reviews need to jump off a bridge.  Bought this for an ugly sweater party, its cute.  Its more of a sweatshirt like everyone are saying.  For the price I have no complaints. Looks even better with no pants and undies on :)"
4.0,Love this shirt! The only thing that I didn’t like was the sides were a little loose!
4.0,Light weight seems a bit cheap but not bad
4.0,"The only reason I bought these was the color of the frame and lenses, but no way they are worth the $70 price. I purchases mine when they were on sale for around $55. You can find genuine Ray-Ban Wayfarers on the Internet all the time for $70, and they are much higher quality than these.<br /><br />PROS:<br />They are larger than the typical unisex &#34;one size fits all&#34; sunglasses that look too small on many men. If you're a guy who is tall or not thin, these will fit you great. If you're a smaller/thinner person, get the regular Lowdowns, not the Lowdown XL.<br /><br />The Matte Yellow Tortoise frames with green mirror lenses are unique and look very sharp! Much more interesting than the typical black frames with grey lenses.<br /><br />They are light weight, so they are comfortable for extended wear. They also don't slide off your face when you look down, like some heavy sunglasses do.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Overpriced! They are nice $30-40 sunglasses.<br /><br />Made in China.<br /><br />The frames are injection-molded nylon, not acetate, so they cannot be adjusted. Acetate frames can be heated and bent to be custom-fitted to your face, nylon frames cannot.<br /><br />No metal hinges. They are nylon - part of the frame mold - and held together with a screw. Not sure of their long-term durability.<br /><br />The &#34;case&#34; is just a flimsy cloth drawstring bag. While this might keep the lenses from getting scratched, it doesn't offer any protection from breakage."
4.0,Looks great and keeps accurate time. I get a lot of compliments.
4.0,"The first time I put the rainbow one into the watch, it somehow broke the lock for the band on one side!  These bands still stay affixed to the watch just fine, so it made switching bands out easier on that side, but I am not sure if a different (say metal) band will stay on and hope it will as I just ordered one because while I like how these bands are lightweight and sparkly and festive, I don’t like how loose they are because they have to be stretched to fit over the wrist and aren’t easy to tighten really once on."
4.0,"I purchased three of these shirts and love everything with the exception of the collar. It is okay, but needs to be a little bit stiffer/thicker."
4.0,Comfy and stretchy but way too long for me. Will need to hem.
4.0,"U use these shorts primarily when I dip leg workouts in the gym and I like them a lot. The elastic liner does a pretty good job of providing compression and the shorts are well sized if you do squats. The material itself feels a little flimsy and I'm unsure how many washes it might hold up to, but only time will tell. Of course, for the price, you can't really go wrong with these!"
4.0,"Really cute dress but it was a little too boxy for me.  Otherwise, the fit was good and very comfortable."
4.0,Don't care for the fogging up of the lenses every time I put them on.
4.0,They fit the bill and are decent quality for the price.
4.0,They are super cute and good quality but They run a little small. Next time I’ll order a size up.
4.0,it needs a scarf; very bland but fits fine
4.0,I bought these for my friends baby and hey are super cute. I bought the pink ones and they are a medium pink color with a light pink ribbon. They are well made and look like they are very comfortable. I ordered the medium size ones and probably should have ordered the small. That's one of the only things I didn't like about ordering was that they didn't give an age size on the ones I ordered were too big but she will grow into them. I would recommend this item. So cute. I did receive this item for free or a discounted price for my honest review.
4.0,"Followed sizing suggestions and reviews and it fit perfect. Like a previous reviewer,  I couldn't get over how adorable the buttons were.  My coworkers were complimenting me left and right and I think my self confidence gained major points that day."
4.0,"The piece that caught my attention was the bow. When it was delivered, the bow was a lot smaller than in the picture, and it looks out of place. The necklace is still super adorable, and I'm very pleased!"
4.0,"Very cute, lightweight, fun. Actually a little bigger than I thought so they are easy to see."
4.0,FYI size up a size.  Had to return but otherwise it was perfect.
4.0,I like how soft it is. The shorts are real cute and not too short. I love how the fabric keeps me from getting too warm or too cold. I may buy in different colos.
4.0,Great boots ....not  very comfortable  if you're on your feet for many hrs. Over all a great buy
4.0,This is much better of a dress then i thought it would be. I bouggt ut to go under a gorgeous green wrap around dress that is sheer...works perfect but i will wear this solo also!
4.0,"I love it but I didn't realize it was as baggy as it is. Nice, cool fabric. Comfortable and soft. Good for summer wear."
4.0,"Fit great and I do like it. just know, it is not lined and the fabric does wrinkle easily. Needed a cute dress quickly and it served its purpose. Also purchased in green."
4.0,"My 4 year old was able to wear these swim shoes all day in/out of the pool at Sesame Place. She said they did not hurt! However, i had to put the shoe pad in a few time because they kept sliding form the side of her shoe."
4.0,"I love,it. It's so soft and silky."
4.0,This was a gift for 11yr old daughter. She loves it!!
4.0,The material was real stretchy like it was cheaply made if u pull on collar it was hanging but my son said fabric was that soft  wick dry fabric and he loved it sonic looked great also
4.0,I like it but the rose gold doesn't match any Apple Watch. The rose gold fit a bit more with the regular gold sport Apple Watch. Original gold is too yellow.
4.0,You will sweat wearing these and not in a good way. The moisture will make you're pockets moist. Which you can't leave you're phone in you're pockets at that point. The waist is pretty tight fitting. The length is good with wearing boots. So far it's good. I didn't feel any weather wearing these
4.0,I love the way these look but twice in the past week one of the backings came off the star earring. Luckily both times I knew when it happened and I was able to find it and pic it up but I had to replace it with a different backing. The earrings themselves are absolutely beautiful though
4.0,"These are super comfortable and sit right below the belly button. They do run small for XL. I'm 5'0 and 150. I carry most of my weight in my top half so I would consider them on the small side. If you want loose fitting, go a size or even two up. The color was spot on. They were long on me (to be expected) but I would say if you're 5'5 they'll be perfect! They're super soft and don't shrink after washing."
4.0,Still comfy
4.0,Not for newborns
4.0,loved it but it did take a month to come
4.0,"I read reviews and looked at the sizing chart to determine which size to get for our daughter. I went with Small. I ordered 3 different colors and got 3 different lengths!  I even checked my order again to make sure I didn’t accidentally order a different size. These are all small. The purple fit the best and I’d love to have more because they are great, but now I have no clue what size to actually order!"
4.0,"Buy one size up. Maybe size and a half. I bought size 8 because there was no 8 1/2. I should have bought 9. Besides that, the ring is light weight and very beautiful, especially the colour. Complements other jewellery I have."
4.0,"Super cute band, quick shipping! The glitter does not flake off but where it brushes against you does fade. I'd buy again for sure!"
4.0,Great value for the price. Lasted longer than a pair that cost 3 times as much.
4.0,Good lens for my old glasses frame
4.0,Can tangle Fast but with enuf charge; Very pretty.
4.0,I like the bag it's nice. And its something my husband wont mind carrying. I think I'm gonna use it more as an over night hag for trips because its ALOT bigger than I expected but we both like the bad
4.0,"Very comfortable but somewhat small, but the next size up would be too long."
4.0,"I bought SMALL but have to exchange for Medium. I saw someone mentioned the sleeves are short, and it is really true! Now I received the Medium and I compared them together, the length is about same, but the Medium has longer sleeves, and a little bit wider on shoulder. I decide to keep the size M. It is really nice color though, I really like this kind of red. There is even lining inside of the jacket, so it is good quality."
4.0,just pay attention to the US sizing
4.0,very thick and warm
4.0,Item as described. I'm 5'2&#34; and 125 lbs. and it fits great. Slightly on the looser side but it doesn't look bad at all. I prefer the extra room over being too snug!
4.0,"They were super cute, but WAY bigger than they looked. I don't have a small face and they still took up over half of it. It looked more like a mask."
4.0,Is as aspected. It will keep you warm in the woods fo sho!
4.0,"I’ve bought more expensive winter socks before. The positive comments and price attracted me to try these. I needed some warmer socks for the house. They looked small in the packaging, but fit my size 9 foot, and came up above my ankle. Fit a bit snug but that that hasn’t bothered me, and I feel they were worthwhile to purchase. Already washed and tossed in dryer. I’ve worn them outside with my sneakers when walking, and no slippage inside sneaker."
4.0,"The shades themselves are slightly translucent, would have preferred if they were nigh-opaque, otherwise they're still amazing!"
4.0,"No es para niños, es demasiado grande"
4.0,"The fit is a little more snug than I was expecting, but then again my baby girl has chunky feet. The length is okay they're just a tighter fit than I was hoping. Her feet do fit in the slippers without  jamming her toes, and they stay on her feet without falling off. Regardless of the tighter fit, she loves her slippers and insist on wearing them throughout the house all day. They will probably stretch a bit with some wear. The slippers are very soft. We have hardwood floors in most of the house and even though she can't talk yet I think she enjoys how much cushion they have because she's all smiles when she is wearing them. She also thinks they are pretty cute, when I showed them to her she pretended to pet the little hedgehog on the slipper."
4.0,"Beautifully made dress, nice and soft material that flows beautifully. I docked a star because their sizes are way off. My daughter is a 4T and I had to get her this dress in a size 2 and it fit perfectly. I would've preferred a size 3 so there could be a little room in there but for some reason they haven't had size 3 for a while."
4.0,"I’ll be getting a size up, hopefully that will fit my hands."
4.0,I love this dress but I order my normal size and the top was too big but the bottom was too small. The problem is that the top is a moveable fabric and the bottom is not.
4.0,"This item is perfect for the price point! Very comfortable but a little short. I can’t tell if I just have a longer torso than normal or if it’s made a little shorter. I had a SLIGHT camel toe, which didn’t bother me too much. The most annoying part is I felt the crotch area stretched out very bad after about 15-20 mins of wear during my boudoir shoot."
4.0,The clip feature is not great. It rips the plastic and creates a hole
4.0,It's a wonderful product! I can use it to clean all the silver or gold. Nice!
4.0,I got a size 10 for my daughter.  The bottoms are fine but the top is skin tight.  Pajamas are generally tight fitting anyway but she is pretty thin and the top is tight while the bottoms are just right.  She loves them anyway.
4.0,I fell in love with these caps when I saw my co worker with them on! So light and comfortable.  Easy tie to keep my hair in place. Great ear savers!! Masks fits great. Definitely recommend!!
4.0,I bought these because I wanted flat studs I can sleep in because my pierced holes like to try to close but regular studs stab my neck when I lay down. They serve that purpose for cheap. Not the best looking earrings and the black part already fell out of one earring but the serve the purpose I bought them for.
4.0,"I’m normally a size 10, but as advised, I ordered a 12 and it fits  just right."
4.0,Those glasses are nice. My wife likes them I’ll order another pair for he.
4.0,Beautiful dress but something is off on the chest sizing.
4.0,"This dress is nice. It is very comfortable as well. You can dress this up or down. It is made out of a fabric that makes it appropriate to wear heels and wear it out for dinner or sandals for a casual date. I'm happy with this dress. I wish I would've ordered a bigger size, it runs a bit small."
4.0,I like it do much.
4.0,Fun pair of earrings.  True to their description.
4.0,Awesome!  My grandson LOVED his new shoes!!!!!
4.0,These are high quality and seem expensive. The magenta is so pretty: The only problem I have is that they are too big. I'm 5'4 and 145lbs and I ordered a medium but I'm going o return them for a small.
4.0,It is nice daughter was happy
4.0,"I like this plated tie slide. i think o little overpriced but definitely beautiful, goes very well with many colors. very elegant i use it very often and so far is proven to be excellent i gave it 4 starts because i think that the price is high"
4.0,"Picked up the black shirt for under $8. It's an $8 shirt so it's not perfect, and is definitely more cheaply made than the name brands like Columbia, Magellan, etc. However it was a good fit and is a nice shirt for the price comparing it to a $40+ shirt."
4.0,"Not too compressing. I just had surgery and needed some support. These are very comfortable. Easy to get on. I did notice that I ordered 3 sets - and they are all a bit different in color, design, etc. But they fit the same. They do roll down & one pair has totally lost it's strength after one cold wash."
4.0,I love these but they already have tears in them and I've used them for probably a month. Kinda disappointed.
4.0,"The toe area is narrow and does not fit well for wide feet until they have been worn a few times, if then. The compression is good, and so far, the socks stay up well. However, if the lower half of your legs are shorter than ""average"" be prepared to fold the socks back down as these can run a bit longer than you might expect."
4.0,I get lots of complaints when wearing this.
4.0,It was a little too loose but I made it fit.  Thx.
4.0,I like it! Wore it to a family BBQ with denim shorts. Will add photo later.
4.0,Liked the product but packaging was horrible it was rolled up in a ball. Not folded like most items you buy. I needed to put it in the dryer because it was so wrinkled.
4.0,As expected. No complaints.
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE the print, and the fit was super flowy so it hid the parts of me I wanted to hide. That said, I got this after losing 75+ pounds. I purchased based on their size chart, I was 190lbs, 5'6"" and wore a size 12 in jeans. The bottoms were just a bit too big, they were saggy in the rear and they aren't made of the normal material most suits are so there was no body-hugging material to hold me in back there. Still, very comfortable material none the less and doesn't weigh you down after you go swimming."
4.0,Size fit as expected they seem to be very soft and comfortable for my son. Just wish it didnt take two hours to charge and the laces are extra long for a kids shoe. But other than that they are awesome
4.0,"Comfy and fun! It’s exactly what I was wanting. The hat is a bit strange, but looks great without the hat. Even funnier with the hat though! Thick material, not cheap feeling."
4.0,I have been looking for corduroy shirts for several winters and found this shirt.  The color (forest green) is stunning and I have received more compliments wearing this shirt than I have on any other piece of clothing in many years.  Very lightweight but keeps warmth during cold days and I use it in Spring while on my walks.<br /><br />I like this shirt so much I am buying another for myself and another as a gift.
4.0,"I bought the anti-fog spray because, when I wore a mask, my glasses would fog.  The spray helped!  I was worried the spray would hurt the lenses, but it did not.  Overall, I'm very happy with the product!"
4.0,"Aesthetically this watch is really nice looking. Te case size is large and elegant.  The blue and gold case with blue strap is a really nice combination. If viewed from afar, this watch would get 5 stars. When viewed up close or felt, this watch has some lower quality points. The strap though leather isn’t as soft and the quality is so-so. The buttons feel flimsy. The date is a little hard to read. Overall still a really nice-looking watch."
4.0,I was pleased to see that highly creative artistry is still alive. There are those who don't appreciate the skill involved in bringing two dissimilar materials together in fluid manner.
4.0,Bought these for my daughter who is in love with the grinch. She has worn them non stop since Christmas.
4.0,Bought for dad since I got him a machete for brush chopping. We will see if he still has all his fingers by end of the summer. ;-/
4.0,What I like was it was down to my ankles no dragging on floor and I'm 4/11
4.0,"This pendant was quite a bit smaller than I expected. I thought it would be the size of a quarter. It’s more like a dime, but so pretty I decided to keep it anyway.  The included chain is - as usual in this situation - pretty much a throw away. Too thin with a questionable clasp. I wear this pendant on one of my own silver chains.  It’s pretty, just be sure the size is what you want."
4.0,I love the vibrant colors.
4.0,OK 👌
4.0,this is a great shirt.  I was looking to replace my old Lucy workout shirt to find that North Face had bought them out.  This seemed like the same shirt.  The material is very soft and the sleeves longer for older arms like mine..  The shirt is overly long and too blousy out front for me.  When I saw pictures of me in it I was horrified.  Won't wear it again unless working out.
4.0,"I ordered a size medium i am 152 at 5’4” medium size chest. This shirt was sooo nice. Kind of a harder cotton fabric, but stiching was fine quality and everything. It fit perfect except.... the armpits. As one reviewer said it was kinda tight in the armpits. Like i could tell it would either<br />Make Me sweat alot there or rub and make my armpits sore. I dont know if a larger size would have helped but i jist returned it."
4.0,"Well made, but looks smaller than pictured.  Still a nice cap."
4.0,Quality use great but fit was a bit small
4.0,"Bag it's nice,  but toooo small for me"
4.0,I think they are really cute but I wish they were a little bit more bigger/ wider. But got them to cover the feet of my compression socks so I won't wear them out in the feet area.
4.0,I wear these when I have a long drive to do or a long day of walking. Not just for sitting on airplanes!<br />Really helps with fibromyalgia pain!
4.0,"That being said, I do feel it was worth the money, and seems to be well made. I'd buy another one at this price."
4.0,"I’m only 5’, so has to hem this several inches, the top fits great, the hip area is a little snug, but not unexpected"
4.0,"for an inexpensive dress, this is pretty nice! I like the lace covering the top and the skirt is a nice taffeta. The color is just as you see on the site. It is an elegant navy, perfect for a dressy night-time affair."
4.0,"This was like any other inexpensive pashmina. It worked for what we needed it for and the color is nice. It's a little softer green than the photo, but still went great as a wrap for Halloween."
4.0,I got the wrong color shoe so I'm returning them but the shape is nice. The heel does look really plastic-y but I think it would of looked better in all black which was the ones that I wanted.
4.0,Shoes are comfortable...Size runs a little small
4.0,"We hosted a Princess Spa party and purchased these to give to each friend to wear at the party and take home.  All the girls were thrilled.  Several weeks later we did lose one bow, but by that time my girls had been wearing them for awhile.  Nevertheless, I would purchase again."
4.0,"This is a cute and sweet hat. It has fit me well and is comfortable to wear. While it doesn't have the widest brim ever, it's a nice(average) size and does provide some protection from the sun. If you need a great deal of protection(like umbrella protection), you'll want a wider brim. It looks well made and I like the character the flower adds to it. There is also fringe around the edge of the brim, which adds a bit more."
4.0,It clings so I would either order a size up or make sure you wear shape wear. It's cute. I will surely order more in different colors because you can dress it up or down. I ordered a large and I am 5'9&#34; 200 lbs. It came to my feet in length so I could wear flats or heels.
4.0,"Simple, cute and perfect for the price."
4.0,"nice color, good fit, but inside flannel is too puffy & rough, other than that fits very good."
4.0,"These masks are pretty and feel nice against my skin. They are a bit large, but manageable."
4.0,great for swim class
4.0,"Review for: AWLE Pajama Shorts Women, Lightweight Casual Pants Comfy Lounge Sleep Shorts with Pockets Multicolor M-2XL<br /><br />These shorts run at least 2 sizes small so order accordingly. They are made of a light weight stretchy fabric that makes them quite comfortable. They have an elastic waist and are fairly long for shorts. Because of their softness, they make nice pajama pants. I personally would not wear them out because the fabric is so thin.<br /><br />The do have pockets but they are a bit shallow. The workman ship appears to be ok. The fabric is mostly something called modal. I had never heard of it and had to look it up. It feels a bit like nylon."
4.0,"theres no protection if you fall, but they look really cool. i get compliments on them about how cool they look"
4.0,"I love this necklace! It goes great with any outfit, and I get compliments on it left and right. The only thing is that it's a little heavy, but the quality makes up for it. It's definitely not made cheap!"
4.0,"I ordered size larger, as I feel too uncomfortable wearing tight clothes. Unfortunately, this was a lot smaller than expected. Would suggest getting two sizes larger."
4.0,"Fits as described, but know that the bottoms are tiny on the back side."
4.0,"These were great, but would make my legs hurt when already sore.  Maybe that's a common thing with compression socks, but they look great and feel like a nice quality."
4.0,These are okay. Only printed on one side. A little misshapen after a couple washes. Some stitching is coming out. Used these for headbands and they did the trick.
4.0,Watch is very nice. It isn't quite as nice as the pictures. It looks that mic e but gas a slightly cheap feel. But not a flaw on the watch. For the price it can't be beat also looks way more expensive. I will buy another
4.0,Any occasion
4.0,"Falls out a little too big, but very pretty!"
4.0,Royal blue necklace was nice and not heavy.
4.0,Decent belt with apparent quality cowhide -- rough backside makes it awkward to slide through pant loops -- not a majot hitch though.
4.0,Somewhat large but a nice top
4.0,"These are absolutely beautiful. I did, though, have an issue with them sliding out of my ear. But I put the chain through my second hole and that solved the problem. If I decide to wear them long I will just slide one of those little clear backs on them to keep them secure."
4.0,"I am 5'5 153lb. After reading the reviews got a size medium. Dress fits ok, not to tight or loose minus the waist which is surprisingly loose. Kinda wondering if a small would fit better? Hope this is helpful."
4.0,"Really nice footie. Soft, comfortable, mine is held together well. Design just as pictured.<br />However the measurements are kind of wonky- I've purchases three other footies and two kigurumis from Amazon and one other place, this particular footie runs very long in the leg area for a size small. I'm used to the legs being baggy because I am only 4'10&#34;, however this is almost an entire foot too long. It's not overly bothersome but I found it really odd that it would be the only footie I have of all the same sizes that apparently made for really long legged humanoids.<br />I'm always disappointed that Deadpool items tend to cater more to men, but I'm happy to have this item for the price I got it at. I'll wear super big, baggy Deadpool stuff cause I love Deadpool."
4.0,good quality and funny style!
4.0,"Runs VERY big. Other than that, it’s graat."
4.0,This is obviously a novelty.  The belt buckle itself is decent quality. The holder is super flimsy. Good gag gift.
4.0,"Instead of the gauges that look like Tree of life I received the ones with Buddha's head. Sad as i was really looking forward to the one with the tree. Even though the one with Buddha is cute, beware that they might send you not the products you expect. Also I have recently had to re-strech my gauges that started to close but the only gauges I had were bone which is not advised for healing. I put these new ones in and shall see how my ears heal with one of these pairs in and will update. Hope that materials used for these products are ok quality. Update - my ears are healing well so far, no reaction to metal."
4.0,I just got it today and I really like it. Fits just fine but I have small writs. Probably won't fit anyone whose wrist is bigger than 6.5 inches. I gave it 4 stars because it seems a little fragile and I am a little worried it will brake easily but for the small cost I guess it wouldn't be a big deal.
4.0,"Not the best quality, but awesome for the price"
4.0,"Quality was nice. Fit was nice. Wasn’t a fan of the “distressing.” The logo had too much black in it. Didn’t look worn. Just looked wrong IMO. Wanted to like the hat, but returned it."
4.0,"It's a scarf, it's good"
4.0,This is a Very Nice dress! I consider myself a little happier; but this was just a little too curvy for my hips. I altered it and now fits perfect
4.0,Very nice material and fits well
4.0,Okay Item!!
4.0,"I'm not sure yet how the crystals will stay in, often in products like these, the crystals fall out.  I withhold final judgement."
4.0,"Very cute and well made for a straw hat, I have a big head (for a lady)."
4.0,"The blend of 80% cotton, 15% acrylic, and 5% spandex create a soft, comfortable, breathable fit. Higher than no-show socks, these are great with sneakers and sporty flats, staying in place.<br /><br />Four stars for good value."
4.0,Cute dress and flowy! It is a tad bit see through but not too bad.
4.0,"I do love the size, I was hoping it would show more color in different light. This remains pearly white.  I have another rectangular stone that becomes quite blue if the light is right."
4.0,"Delivered on time. Order was doubled due to computer issue however at the price, I will now use both for my event. Thank you"
4.0,"Very pretty, nice length but runs a little bit small. I'm a true medium but should of gotten a large."
4.0,"They are good for hanging around the house comfy and all but I can’t sleep in them, too many zippers and the bottoms were too tight on my ankles. Durning the day they are comfy but too tight at night."
4.0,Beautiful and elegant evening clutch. Only complain is the size. Too small. I considered returning it but it was too pretty to give back. It will make a beautiful gift.  Two words to describe it: Classy and Elegant.
4.0,"I have one of the new electronic keys for a car.  It would not go on the smaller hooks and with the fob or whatever it is called that key hung well outside the key case.  The reason I like a key case is to prevent making holes in my pockets so hanging outside was not an option.  Thus, I put the car key on the ring shown and it has to be snapped in upside down but that works.  The fob prevented being able to snap the key case shut this way so I cut it off.  The ring is on a snap and if the snap tends to come undone (it hasn't yet) then I will put contact cement on it.  That has worked in previous key cases.  It's a shame that the manufacturers don't take this stuff into consideration when they design these cases.  The hooks for the standard keys is this key case are excellent, better than I have seen in other key cases."
4.0,Great belt especially if you’re on a weight loss journey. It’s gives great flexibility to adjust as you lose weight and just an overall great quality belt.
4.0,I have a hard time finding house shoes to fit because I wear half size so that’s one good thing about these and I’m 77 and have arthritis in my feet also have one foot just a little bit bigger than the other but with all of that these are the best I’ve found for my feet and are comfortable enough I can keep them I gave them 4 stars because I just wish the makers would put more memory foam in the bottom
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet!  Not happy with the quality of packaging, as any bracelet I've ever bought on Amazon has always come in a  box so it wouldn't get squished in the mail.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I do still like the bracelet, and it even fits my somewhat large (nearly 8&#34;)  wrist without pinching like some of the other open/close bangle bracelets."
4.0,"Great back pack, only problem with it is the lunch bag is too small."
4.0,pretty and looks and feels nice
4.0,These shoes are perfect for working in an office.  They go with a lot of outfits.
4.0,"I like the color and fit, though the shirt widened my butt a little. Perhaps a bit more flair past the waist would solve the issue."
4.0,"material is very soft and comfortable.  Only issue is sometimes the straps do not hold their adjustment and loosen up so I find myself readjusting.  Perhaps sewing the strap adjustment into place will resolve the issue.  I do like them otherwise.  btw, they come with inserts that can be removed.  they look kind of weird, like they don't belong in the bra, they don't sit normally but not an issue if you don't really use them."
4.0,The material is a little thin but its very cute on and I got a ton of compliments on it. I ordered a smaller size than I normally wear but it still fit me well. I am 5'2 and 135 lbs and got a small. It was a little long but nothing noticeable.
4.0,Wonder FSU socks!
4.0,"This skirt is very cute - however, the different colors of fabric are not joined together."
4.0,Great jacket! But I gave it 4 Stars because it doesn’t have an inside pocket.
4.0,I gave it four stars bc it for a bit big where the rouched part is but over all color is exact and it's a great comfy fit no real complaints about it I would buy it again in other colors
4.0,"the dress fit as expected, true to size but was a little thin."
4.0,"I love this gown. The only annoying thing is the ties in the front. There's a pair of cinching ties that customizes how it fits (which is great) but they are soooo long, get tangled and easily get pulled and untied. When I slept in it, just moving around would untie them. I think I'm going to trim them to see if it'll help. I was concerned about it being see through. But the blue one isn't. I feel comfortable walking around in it in front of my teenage boys."
4.0,"I have 2 different kinds of these hats, this one you can hear when the ears go up a little bit but I would definitely buy another one."
4.0,I hoped the pants would have been nicer
4.0,I love these tops. I recommend using the cold & gentle wash cycle & hang dry to avoid the possibility of shrinkage. I love the side pockets. I just wish more colors had been available in my size.
4.0,"Packaging is great!  The quality is good. Remember that once you remove the bra, you have to do is wash the inside with warm water and let it try!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  I review some products that I get for free or discounted, however all of my reviews are held to a high ethical standard, honest, and  are my own opinions and are not for sale."
4.0,"These are really comfortable, and I give them a lot of abuse; but the zippers on this particular pair have stoped working, but the rest I have from this brand have held up perfectly."
4.0,These are nice. Post length is longer than the listing says but comfortable to wear
4.0,"Arms are a little stiff on them, but it's okay because they stay snug on my face"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a54bce89b7bcdd43245534f65a1904e1]] I wanted to love this bathing suit. I waited and waited for it to get here and when it did I was sad to find the sizing was way off. I'm normally a size 10 top and size 8 bottoms. I purchased the XL thinking it would definitely fit me since other reviewers said it was running small but small feels like an understatement. I could use a size or two larger (but they don't run any larger than this).<br /><br />The style and design of the bathing suit is super cute. I chose the black for the obvious slimming effect and to not be super noticeable. I like to blend in. The material is soft and stretchy which I like. The skirt material isn't hemmed at the bottom and is starting to fray but that might just be the direction of the design to begin with. I was a bit annoyed that the corset type backing needed to be completely unlaced and then re-laced by my husband for me to even get it on. The skirt provides the coverage of my hips and thighs which I really appreciate since I don't have anything close to a thigh gap. The tummy control does just that and definitely minimizes my mom pooch. What really struck out was the shaping of the bra halter. I am a 38DD but my boobs were spilling out all over the place. The side boob is just way too much to ignore. If you look at some of the photos you will see how the top really tapers inwards and that's exactly how it feels when you put it on. If you are one of those &#34;little up there but alot down there girls&#34;, this bathing suit would be perfect for you. The backing lace up corset style is also really cute but not when it runs this small on me. It just accentuated my back fat which is not what I or anyone at the beach wants to see. If I lost a bunch of baby weight and dropped some bra sizes I could see this bathing suit looking quite good on me.<br /><br />I do want you to know that while not associated with this seller I did receive this product for a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
4.0,To know Live Stitch is to love her! Blossomy is best way to describe these maxi dresses. Very long but just tie one hem corner into a knot and walah! ❤️
4.0,"Very cute harness. I wanted to try this look out over button down shirts etc for a chic look I saw from a tiktok influencer. Def runs small, size up but other than that it’s super cute and I have received a lot of compliments!"
4.0,"Pretty darn good, getting ready for another order for my son."
4.0,Very pleased with this comfortable and attractive strap and light colored natural leather look I wanted seems hard to find elsewhere.  I dinged this item one star for a quick release pin that broke after a few weeks - possibly could have dropped or even lost my favorite timepiece. I imagine Archer would have repaired-replaced the part but was easier to just install an existing standard pin. Will likely order again when strap eventually wears out.
4.0,Gorgeous sweater. Perfect for winter and I simply love white sweaters for colder weather. It can be dressed up or down!
4.0,I love this bag.  Tons of pockets on the outside.  The only thing it is missing is a pocket on the inside.
4.0,These shirts were perfect! We love them! I'm 145lbs and 5'3&#34; usually wear a medium so that's what I got. Got my boyfriend a large and he's 5'6&#34; 170lbs could have gotten a medium.
4.0,These look great on! Don’t shower in them though. The shine dulls quickly if you do. Nice for the price!
4.0,"Cute dress, fit nicely...but, has no pockets or sash like it claimed.  It’s just not as cute without the bow at the waist.  If you want it to poof like the photo you will need a crinoline. Also, the fabric is almost see through.  I ended up returning it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The company sent me a new one!  This time it had pockets and a sash!  Looks way better- you still need a crinoline and fabric is still thin, but now it is as advertised and adorable!"
4.0,Very soft. Fit true to size
4.0,A little larger than I expected but I like it.
4.0,I am so happy with these socks. They wash and dry without loosing shape. They are great for my pregnancy yoga because of the no slip buttons. They help you be able to feel the floor which you can't see anymore being pregnant and allow you to focus on the yoga.
4.0,This is nice and I didn't give it 5 stars because the medals on it are cheap.
4.0,"I love the fact that my 4 month only can’t flip this bib over his face, rip it off or turn it backwards but his drool still soaks though and gets his onsie wet. I like using these in the car since I know he can’t cover his face or take it off while in his car seat. Glad I purchased them but have to use other bibs to prevent his onsie from getting wet."
4.0,I wore an XL in the fruit under shirt for a snug fit and am happy with an XL in these for a tight fit like you would expect from compression. Being 6'2 and overweight I was worried about how far the shirts would reach but they have plenty of room to fit under your pants or underwear and don't come out often if at all.<br /><br />Only small annoyance is shoulder straps aren't as tight of a fit and will sometimes slide and can be seen around the neck hole of a shirt. This is probably only after reaching high angles but I got these so they wouldn't show stitch or fabric through a shirt but didn't think of the straps.<br /><br />All in all great for the price.
4.0,"It fits pretty well.  I found the bottom a bit large.  My issue with this bathing suit is the dye.  I had been on vacation, and came home after using my suit several times.  I went and used my pool and after washing it hung it in the shower to dry.  I have just done a full remodel or my house,, the dye dripped on my master shower (new pebble tile and grout), and changed it from the natural light beige it was to color of the suite.  Needless to say. Not thrilled -  I expected more of this brand and given the cost , that is unacceptable."
4.0,Wore this to a celebrity look-a-like party around Christmas. (I was Mariah Carey)<br />It’s cute and comfy but I busted the butt in these by the end of the night. So cheaply made
4.0,"Purchased oversized for pjs top. More like a tshirt. Nice fabric, scoopneck works as I can't handle anything close to the neck. Be aware it will stretch out unevenly. Fine for a sleep top."
4.0,"I'm 4'11, 108lbs and inbetween big girls sizing and adult xs/s or petite. This thermal top is warm and fits me well. 4 stars because I prefer my clothing to be a little loose. The top shows off your figure (not snug tight, just reveal curves) but I plan to wear it under another piece of clothing forvthose cold days/nights."
4.0,Cute but smaller and thinner than I expected.  More like an ascot
4.0,Daughter loves them she said they are comfortable and laundry is easy they are awesome.
4.0,Good lens & durable. Also good fit
4.0,"Came quick. Looks great. Sizing was accurate for a half inch. I usually done like flared guages, because they're always falling out, but I've had these for a couple months and haven't had it happen yet."
4.0,Very interesting set of ear ring
4.0,Sleeves not long enough for me.  Can't throw it in the dryer.  Material not quality I expected
4.0,Was hoping this would be thicker and warmer since I live in the northeast. But its super cute and comfy! Definitely an early fall and spring ensemble.
4.0,Some of the lights were on when I received the package. Kids were happy with them so I got my money's worth
4.0,"Pretty cute for the price! The bottoms fit perfectly, the top fits but it's a little lopsided in the middle I think it's just from shipping! But still very cute great bold colors!"
4.0,"The pendant is perfect! Only gave 4 stars because the chain is not as high quality as the pendant, but what do you expect for a few dollars!!!! My teenager loves it!"
4.0,The scarf is very long
4.0,Had to return because it was to small.
4.0,Good for the price. One pair has started to fray already with just one wear but the other is holding up well.
4.0,"Muy bonitos, buena calidad del material. Medidas exactas"
4.0,"I bought these for my double piercing and they are SO adorable. However I'm giving them 4 stars because they burned a little when I first put them in. But other than that, they're perfect!"
4.0,"This is going to be a fairly long review. I’m going to start with why I needed this bag (how I use it), and then hammer on a couple of negatives that really disappointed me. But don’t let that scare you away. The bottom line is that for around 25 bucks or so, delivered to your door, this is a pretty good bag. I’m happy with it.<br />I’m a Marine veteran, retired cop, now working as a deputy coroner. I like to think that I know a little something about the gear that I use, and I need it to work. When I became a deputy coroner I started hauling lots of gear around in my personal vehicle. But some stuff I really need with me all of the time. Like if I’m out with friends (in their car) and a family member calls about one of my cases. I need my notebook, etc. Plus I carry a gun, a knife, a multi-tool, a spare phone battery, radio, and more. And since I retired I’ve taken to wearing those Nike sports pants without a belt quite often. In short, I needed a small bag to carry all the stuff that I needed to have with me, and have close by all of the time.<br />After looking at lots of them, I settled on this one. It seemed a good value for the money, a nice sized bag, and I liked the fact that it came with the extra pouch included.<br />When the bag arrived I was immediately impressed with the quality of the materials, and the sewing. Always check the stitching on gear like this. Yank on every stitch from every angle. This bag appears to be very well sewn.<br />Then I pulled on a zipper pull. It came off in my hand. So I tried all the others, two more came off as well. That’s no big deal, the metal loops that hold them in place were not closed all the way (see photo). It was a simple fix with a pair of pliers.<br />Then I went to attach a water bottle holder to the MOLLE loops on the side of the bag. If you look at the photo that I attached you can see that one of the top loops is only about 1/2 width. This made it extremely difficult (almost impossible) to get the MOLLE strap of the water bottle pouch through. It’s made this way to provide clearance for a zipper. It’s the same on the opposite side as well. I’d rather have the zipper be a little shorter and the loops be the right size.<br />Then there are the MOLLE loops on the main sling strap. There is room on this strap for two loops, side by side. And yet, they have two rows of a single loop in the middle, with little half loops on the side. See attached photo. This makes absolutely no sense. Virtually any MOLLE accessory that you are going to want to attach there will have two straps and therefore need two loops, including the free pouch that they include with the bag!<br />So, I found those design features, and one quality control issue, to be a disappointment in what is otherwise a pretty good bag.<br />But they can be worked around with adapters, or they might not matter to you at all.<br />As for the good things about this bag, there are plenty:<br />As mentioned before, quality materials.<br />Appears to be very well sewn.<br />Many useful compartments and attachment points. (I even found a rain cover hidden in a bottom compartment)<br />The main sling strap is well padded, comfortable, and long! (Big guys take note; I’m 6’5” and 300+ and the strap is plenty long enough.) (The little side strap was just barely long enough too.)<br />The bag swallows an amazing amount of gear, yet it compresses pretty flat when you don’t have much in it.<br />The bottom line is that this bag is a very good value for the money. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another one."
4.0,"The quality is good, the fabric is thick but it gets little beaded up pills after washing."
4.0,I love the clip it sure holds your money ! It just holds almost to tight lol I’m standing at a cash register pulling my money out and it’s funny sometimes this is a very good product!
4.0,"These would easily be 5 stars but they didn't come in XL and the product description said that the pants were zippered.  No Zipper!  The material is good and the higher waistband keeps me away from ""Low Rise"" embarrassment. More colors and sizes and you'll have 5 stars."
4.0,"fits kinda wonky on me, i'm 5'2 and weigh 120lb and the bottom fitted perfectly but the top fitted a little big (not long but big) but overall it's very well done and the material is pretty could as well not bad at all for what you pay for, shipping was very fast"
4.0,I like my necklace. No it hasn’t changed colors. No green. I get lots of compliments on my necklace.
4.0,Its a good looking chain. Its authentic silver.
4.0,"Think sports bra meets nursing bra. Snug enough to keep the breasts in place, but comfortable enough to wear as an everyday bra."
4.0,"Size is good, fabric is thin and see through."
4.0,Nice bags but I wished they were just a little bigger.
4.0,"I had to order a size up (I'm a large and ordered an XL) just because so many others said to do that. The dress fits very nicely, and is flattering. It's a beautiful dress(good quality), and I'm excited to wear it. Only thing is it came a day late, and was frustrating because I was going to wear it that day that it came so I'm not going to lie I panicked. Definitely a good buy though!"
4.0,worked well for my son's ROTC uniform and is much easier then many of the shirt stays we looked at. Very similar to the ones I used to wear when in service.
4.0,"Nice item, very useful and looks great in my watch"
4.0,"I usually get medium, but it was loose in all places. Returning and exchanging it to a smaller size. Hope that would work. Other than that, the cloth feels soft and nice."
4.0,Very comfy and loose. Mine fit longer in the back than on the model. I am just shy of 5'3&#34; and ordered a medium. I love how it looks. Not too thick and not too thin. Just is not as &#34; chunky&#34; looking as it is in picture. Took exactly 3 weeks to arrive.
4.0,"I bought three different folding bags in order to compare. This, the Roundrock, and the Bogo. This Dot&Dot is the keeper, it is the only one with a 3 sided full flap opening, you can fold it all the way back making it much easier to load the bag. The other ones both take the cheap way out and have a straight zip opening down the middle. Far harder to actually pack the bag that way. I plan to use this as actual normal weekender luggage for the car, not just as an emergency pack-along bag for excess shopping on the way home or something. As a family of four, we now have three folding duffels similar to this and can pack them all away inside one small wheeled carry on and thus store 4 suitcases in our bedroom closet. A real space saver. Our nice wheeled luggage for airport travel is so bulky we have to store it in the basement, so we don't like to use it as often for car trips.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that folding the bag back up for flat storage, you have to put two zipper halves together, a bit more inconvenient than the way the other just kind of fold in half with the zipper already started.<br /><br />I would buy two or three if they had different colors. It's much easier to tell whose bag is whose when there is something different about them."
4.0,Cute eye catching top
4.0,"This costume is great. Very appropriate and not sexy. I didn't find the arms too tight as others mentioned. I bought the Standard size and was a bit nervous about the fit. I am 5'3 and 135lbs and have a pear shaped figure. I took the waist in about 3 inches and added another button, otherwise the fit was great. I also wore capri leggings underneath and a white tank top as it has open gaps with velcro to make it easy to put on and take off. Already wore it to a costume party and got TONS of compliments. Can't wait to wear it tomorrow to trick or treat with the family."
4.0,Awesome band.  Color is a little off and the band pops open but very rarely.
4.0,Good price on a good product...buy it .....thanks
4.0,Nice wallet and it's holding up well. Color is neutral and quality is good.
4.0,"Decent,  but not as sturdy as they are portrayed in the picture. Still warm and comfy though!"
4.0,"The shorts were way too short for my liking, so I wear it with a different, longer pair that I already owned. The top is adequate for keeping &#34;things&#34; embraced during water exercise. I do not particularly like the &#34;uniboob&#34; look it gives me but I'd rather have that look than have spill out."
4.0,"Está bien, aunque se ve algo menos agradable a la vista que en las fotos."
4.0,"We got this jacket for our son who has needed a cold weather jacket for awhile.  It's actually a decent jacket, and will keep youwarm and dry.  It has a very soft interior that is very comfortable, and the removable hood is a plus.  I have no doubt this jacket will keep my son warm.  A few things, first the zipper is reverse, like a woman's jacket.  This bothers my son a bit because it's backward from every other jacket he has had, but he's figured it out.  Next, there seems to be a couple strange patches on the jacket that are a bit noticeable.  Kids are always concerned about how they look to their friends.  My son said something about it, so I'm mentioning it here.  Finally, we got a large, and this seems to be sized somewhere between a large and an XL.  Possibly to accommodate layers, but it seems larger than large. Otherwise, a nice quality, warm, jacket."
4.0,Cute top! I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. Very comfortable. Soft material.
4.0,"Update. I have increased the rating to 4 stars for the fact that the sellers customer service is commendable. They were very quick to remedy the issues I was having. Hopefully the issue is resolved completely, time will tell. But thank you for reaching out and making things right.<br /><br />The webbing part of these belts are fine. The problem is the buckle. I received a 2 pack, and both buckles do the same thing. When the 2 haves are attached together, the one side does not ""latch"" in place. Very disappointed in the quality."
4.0,Nice looking bangle. Pretty much what I expected.
4.0,A little heavier than I expected. But it’s super small. It fits in the little storage in the trunk. 4.5 stars
4.0,Very good stylist jacket
4.0,"They look a little cheap from the side, but otherwise they're nice! I've been wearing them for a few days and don't have any complaints"
4.0,the quality is good but i have some trouble with the clips staying in my hair which is something thats a little annoying
4.0,Beautifully made with great detail.  Runs big and long.
4.0,"Got this vest set for my husband's tux. Everything was nice, matched and was a decent price for everything.  But my husband is not a kid, and instead of having a smaller waist than chest, he's a little backwards.  This was an XL, and according to the size listed should have fit.  His suit is 44 and his pants are 38.  If you are over a 36 waist, I would go up one size.  I would certainly recommend this set in the size that fits."
4.0,They are just what you would expect.
4.0,"For some reason, they aren't as cute in real life. But don't get me wrong, I wear them a lot!"
4.0,"Shorts are great. Nice amount of stretch and not too long for short guys. I'm 5'6&#34; and still above my knees.<br /><br />They run large. I always buy 31&#34; waist jeans and they are almost always snug then perfect when broken in. I got these shorts in 30&#34; and they fit perfect, not snug."
4.0,Longvdeliverybtime
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but runs small even on my little girl who is tiny."
4.0,"I like this scarf a lot, but when I first got it, it was a bit smelly. I think it may be the dye used. The good news is that it washes very well--little fading and no shrinking or fraying. I've worn it with sweaters and tops, casual and business attire. It's thin enough not add bulk to my chest area, but not so thin that there's no flair."
4.0,"This one is tough. I really like the look of the hat but it is border line small. The sizing appears to be a little off. As of yet I have not returned it because I am afraid of the next size up being too large. This fits me, a little snug. The quality of the hat and its appearance though are very good."
4.0,It’s a cute shirt. I got size SMALL with the “ navy A “ I hate people design. I like that the sleeves come rolled (they’re sewn like that) I think the shirt is bigger than I expected. I am 5’2” and 130lbs and wear a 34DD and the shirt fits me a little loose. I like it a lot tho. It’s a flattering fit and comfortable.
4.0,A bit bigger than I thought. Fun and holds a ton of stuff.
4.0,If you like a beanie with plenty of slouch. This one is for you!
4.0,"Loved the color and comfort but sleeves were way too long, returned  it"
4.0,Fit is a little tight.  Not sure if next size would be too big.
4.0,"The watch is more for younger girls, not really a &#34;women's watch&#34; as the description says, so it's a bit smaller for women but it's still nice."
4.0,"Pants fit well, but are a bit long.  I'm 5'8&#34; and they were long on me.  Have to wear them with at least 3 inch heels."
4.0,The sizing seems to run big. I ordered my regular size (M) but it's big but I'll wear it . I ordered small and it fits better.  They should also have petite size. The dress is a little long.<br />Really like the dress tho!  Sift and flowing.
4.0,Beautiful quality material and beautiful flow. The colors are vibrant and there is a lot of flow to the skirt. The bodice does fit a little snug for larger chested women. There is no give in the material so fit is and sizing is really important. I am a 36DD but have a medium waist to sizing generally is difficult for me. If you are more proportioned than me the fit will likely be fine.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a075b44f589b0fe5c0139f147cb9d5e2]] I ordered this top based on the photos which made it look like it was a batwig sleeve - it's not :( . So the expected flowiness I was looking for was not there. So this top is not a hit in my book... But that doesn't mean it won't work for you. The fabric is soft and thinnish. The length is good for leggings. Can be tucked in, but the sloppy tuck looked better than a full tuck. It has 4 large tortoise shell buttons on each sleeve. The sleeve length was good, but I found them a tad tight when pushed up. I'm 5'9 and measure 45-45-50, wearing XXL.<br /> -<br />*Thanks for reading my review. I hope it helps make your decision easier*"
4.0,"This is a cute shirt that I will be wearing once the weather gets nice. I got my normal size (medium) and it fits great. There is one tag at the neck with the size (M), but no tag with washing instructions, so I had to return to the Amazon page where it says machine washable, so I'll just go with washing in cold water."
4.0,Runs a little small but I gave it to my teen she loved it
4.0,32dd here. The cup size on this is much more for smaller girls. But it fits around the torso.
4.0,I really liked these. But I received the wrong color. It was supposed to be beige and light jean blue but I got light blue and beige light blue as seen in the pictures. It also fit big around the crotch.
4.0,"Love the fit and comfort of this capri! The only thing I hate is the back pocket insert that goes way down my hamstring on the right side. It's way too long of a pocket! Still, I bought 3 of the colors in my size."
4.0,The item was of good quality but was a little big but would purchase again at anothe size.
4.0,"Cute, decent fit.  Normally wear a size 14 and these fit quite well.  They are very cute.  My only complaint is that they sag in the crotch area.  Otherwise, they're great!"
4.0,"It’s nice same as picture but I’m taking one star because it came smash , they need to work on the packaging, I fix it and I’m using it ."
4.0,"This top looks great with cuffed jeans and wedges.  Despite the fact that the colors are strong, I like the possible versatility allowed.  It goes great with natural shoes and jewelry, but it's also really easy to spice it up with black accessories and shoes.  It's very flowy and fun, and the high low style makes it very comfortable to wear to gatherings and casual events."
4.0,This is a fun neck scarf that can be pulled up over the head for ear and head protection. Nice neutral color.
4.0,Nice bag it’s cute
4.0,"This is such a cute dress.  I wear a size 8, so I ordered the medium and it fits perfectly.  The color is as what appears on my computer screen.  Although, the seams are not sewn very well.  After one evening of wearing it, the seams underneath my arms were coming apart.  I will need to sew over the seams again, but other than that, it's a comfortable summer dress."
4.0,"For the most I like the shoes but it would have been better if a12 1/2 size would have been a option, I order size 13 thanking I would use two inserts in each but that caused my heel to come out, still I really like color and feel and by wearing two pairs of socks made them fit better"
4.0,Such a lovely skirt. The fabric was thicker than I expected but was so beautiful. I really liked the hints of silver. Unfortunately it was too large for me so I had to return it.
4.0,"I like these but the size was way too small I mean there’s no room for your man junk down there. But the quality is good, good workmanship."
4.0,Glasses were better than I expected for such a low price.
4.0,"I really liked them because they are super comfy, but they make my feet sweat a lotttt. This could just be because I have sweaty feet in general."
4.0,"I bought the red pair for my 2 1/2 year old daughter to wear for the holidays and am very happy with my purchase.  She got a lot of compliments on them and they polished off all her Christmassy outfits!  The patent finish makes them really stand out.  They are true to size (got her size 7) and she seemed to be really comfortable in them, even wearing them around the house for fun!  They stayed on at all our holiday events, so they must be comfortable.  The velcro strap holds well.  I subtracted one star because I wish the bows were bigger.  They're definitely not as big as pictured and they also do slide on the strap (they are not set in place)."
4.0,My husband loves these short. Easy to move around in.
4.0,"This purse is so cute! But, it was way smaller than I expected. That was my fault though as I measured wrong. I'm in the process of returning it. I do recommend it though, if you are into small purses or are looking for a small purse. It was adorable!"
4.0,This dress worked for me as a vintage costume. I wore petticoat to make skirt flare 1950s style. It does run small. Pretty flimsy fabric but what do you want for this bargain price?
4.0,Shorter than expected.  I'm 5'5&#34; 135lbs.  I'm also a 34dd and would need a bandeau to keep things in place
4.0,Really nice shirt however it was pretty big on me.
4.0,"These were really cute, my daughter loved them.  I only had one complaint, a couple of them are skin color and you can't see them very well."
4.0,"Love this, wore it as a dress. I'm 5ft 6in. The length was questionable when I lifted up my arms to hug bf, be careful. But it fits well. I'm about 145lbs."
4.0,Breast area fit a little tight but overall I received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"This is a very functional time piece that is a great addition to my collection. This does need to be wound, like all pocket watches, but once done it keeps time perfectly. The face has bold and precise numbers that are easy to read. This has a nice heft to it, but it isn't heavy. The window in the center gives you the ability to see the mechanical inner workings of the piece and add great detail to the watch that the outer face might otherwise be lacking. The chain on this isn't as strong as I would have liked, so I'll be replacing it, that is why I knocked off a star. I was sent this product at a discount in exchange for this review."
4.0,This is a really pretty cover-up.  It is not an obsorbent cover-up but it is great for sitting by the pool or walking on the beach.  I am a size 12 and it is snug on me but wearable.  I'm 5'4&#34; and it goes almost to my ankles.  I gave it 4 stars becasue of the whole &#34;one size fits all&#34; thing.  I would not recommend this on anyone over a size 10
4.0,not really tapered more boot cut
4.0,Did not order blue I order black
4.0,Very cute. Just sleeves are too narrow.
4.0,"Muy bonito todo, sólo que la blusa es un poco pequeña"
4.0,You can never go wrong giving a north face beanie cap. I give one to my son-in-law every Christmas!
4.0,Fits right on only issue is with the clasp. Likes to come loose.
4.0,"Cute but small, much smaller than a dime."
4.0,12 year old son gave it to a girlfriend for her birthday. She loved it. Doesn't appear cheap and a great for kids.
4.0,"I love these beautiful little little earrings. They are exactly what i wanted.  They are large enough 2 b easily seen but small enough that they don't overwhelm my ears. The only reason i didn't give them 5 stars is that they are fragile, but as long as u aren't 2 rough on them, u will love these earrings, just like i do.  :-)"
4.0,"house shoes, very cushy.  wish the arch support was better, but it beats sandals having nothing."
4.0,"Good quality, material is nice and it washes nice."
4.0,"Good length and fit, just wish it wasn't quite so sheer."
4.0,"I love this necklace but when I received the cross was not shiny so I had it shined up by my jeweler. Otherwise, I love this."
4.0,Nice fabric made well but not to cheeky
4.0,"I wish the lenses were bigger. If a photo of the glasses being worn by a real person was provided, it would've been easier to gage the size. Can't beat the price, though."
4.0,Arrived quickly. Exactly as picture and fits as expected.  Comfortable and very cute.
4.0,The color is pretty but the waist is a white material that can look awkward. The zipper was also very hard to zip.
4.0,I ordered the size I normally wear and it fit just right. Product came in great condition
4.0,Great Mask! Fits Well! Only One Question! Where Can You Get Replacement Filters To Insert Into the Mask?!
4.0,"These are really beautiful and have a nice weight to them but not heavy. I do wish they were bigger, although I bought them as a gift, if they were for me I would want them to be about three times the size."
4.0,I really like this purse. It's bigger than I thought it would be. ( I'm pretty sure I could fit 2 pair of shoes in it ) lol. But it's very nice and pretty.<br />My only complaint is it has a bad order .. hopefully it will go away soon.
4.0,"Okay, item one: this dress is NAVY. I don't know how the product image looks on your monitor, but on mine it looks black. I rarely wear navy, so this is kind of important information for me. I really like the dress, but if I send it back, it will be for this reason. I took a couple pictures (with and without flash) to try to show a comparison but even then it's hard to tell. Just take my word for it. Navy.<br /><br />The dress itself is very cute and well-made. The shirtdress cut is flattering, and the elastic at the waist is great for either emphasizing or creating curves. I would definitely say it runs small. I normally wear a size Large, ordered XL in this, and the dress fits but is tighter than I'd like across the bust. The skirt isn't too tight on my hips, though, which was a shocker considering my pear shape! So I'd say the skirt has a lot of leeway, and you should choose to go up at least one size but maybe two based on your bust. I'm a 36D and the buttons pulled pretty severely across the chest. I'll probably end up wearing it with just one or two buttons done up and show some cleavage for summer I guess! As for length, I'm 5'2&quot; and the dress hit a few inches above my knees.<br /><br />The pattern is adorable, obviously, and looks the same in person as in the photos. The great thing is that from a distance it just looks like some kind of dot pattern. It's only up close that you realize it's cats! Yes! The fabric is both great and awful. It's light and drapey, almost silky, and I love that, but it also generates its own impressive static field. The dress isn't lined but you'll probably want to wear it either with a slip or leggings or it will cling horribly. You could also use Scotch Guard or a dryer sheet rubbed on the inside of the skirt.<br /><br />The belt is fine considering the price, but it's pretty obviously cheap and there are no belt loops on the dress anyway. So I probably won't use the belt. But overall this dress is flattering, high quality and the print could not be cuter. An excellent summer purchase.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I’m leaving a 4 star review because the cap is more a salmon color not pink. And for me is was a tiny bit big and I have an average head.
4.0,"I am 5’1, 120-125 lbs. Small fits as expected. It is slouchy/oversized, but not long. It is a heavy weight and is warm. It is soft, and does give a cashmere feel. 4 stars because it has mild pilling just from wearing. Still, for price it is a good sweater. Many compliments on it."
4.0,"They took a very long time to arrive, but now that they're here I can tell you I really like these slippers... maybe more than I expected. I hope they stay together and last a long time."
4.0,These are just what I was looking for in a simple hoop earring.  The rose gold is lovely as is the silver tone.  They are comfortable and easy to put on.
4.0,"Gives you space to breathe easier, however I still have foggy glasses to deal with.  It helps but does not eliminate."
4.0,The dress was a little tighter on my hips than I would have wanted. It was also longer than I expected. It was really cute but I couldn’t justify keeping it for myself. It would be cute on someone less full figured.
4.0,Very pretty but the black color faded a little in the first wash.  The design if gorgeous but shows off a little more cleavage than I expected.  I wear a tank top underneath for any mishaps.  It's very comfy and I like that it's longer around the waist.
4.0,A bit small but other than that nice. Just a note it is a bit thin material. The waist is high so a belt helps to define the look.
4.0,I love cole hann shoes.  When i saw this shoe for 44 dollars i couldn’t purchase fast enough.  Like all cole hanns it runs large so order a 1/2 to full size down.  My only negative is the sides are mesh so you can clearly see my foot thru it and sometimes i wear sneakers like this without socks.  It looks really weird to clearly see my foot so i must wear sox.
4.0,It's cute. The bottom is too big though. It's not tight at my waist which I like. The image on the crop top is flawless though. :) I enjoy wearing it.
4.0,"Very comfortable, a bit over priced, but comfort is important."
4.0,"Unfortunately it was not fit as I expected, and also the fabric was not stretched. However, it was so sexy and pretty!"
4.0,el diseño es igual cómo se mira en la imagen solo la tela es diferente
4.0,"It is lightweight, so it works well for those sort-of cold days as well as colder weather. It washes well and is fast drying. Doesn't shrink. LIghtweight, so it works for early fall. It runs a little large."
4.0,"They are nice and stretchy, very comfortable and wash great. I was hoping for a little thicker material. Colors were great and shipping was very quick! I didn't find a lot of marled socks out there, so I was glad to find these!"
4.0,"I LIKE THESE GLOVES OKAY, EVEN IF THEY ARE THIN. BUT THEY ARE UNRAVELING A LITTLE ALREADY, AND I JUST GOT THEM 4 DAYS AGO."
4.0,"I bought this dress in wine color first. I LOVED IT with leggings, boots, a long necklace and a sweater vest. When I ordered it again in the teal color, I should've tried it on before laundering it. Same dress in the same size, but not the same dress at all. It's likely a quality control issue. Teal dress is 2 inches shorter, neckline doesn't fit quit right and sleeves are a littler narrower. I love the bright colors of both dresses. Overall--with layering, it is still flattering and I received several compliments. I have a curvy figure and a tummy due to an extra 50# or so. I'm 5'4"" and the wine was middle of the knee. Teal above the knee. I ordered an XL both times."
4.0,"The bra is extremely comfortable. For me, the straps are just way too big."
4.0,These dresses and I say that because I have a handful of them in different colors and tanks.....are very comfortable. Wash and dry nicely.
4.0,"The quality seemed fine for the price, but it didn't really work with my schnoz and just seemed to fit to narrow across my face (I've got an average size head for a dude).<br /><br />Again, I'm impressed with product for the price paid even though it wasn't for me. I gave it them my sister and she likes them."
4.0,So cute but order 2 sizes up.
4.0,The quality of the set is nice but the shirt was cut short.  I find it hard to tuck it in unless I hike-up the shorts.
4.0,Very sturdy and well made but bigger on my face than I expected them to be.
4.0,"Beautiful work, good price, ideal as a gift."
4.0,Cheap .Funky Fun. Perfect.
4.0,"I love the shoes, they are not bad. very comfortable, lovely style and good looking. I can running in my shoes comfortably without pain.  Am loving it."
4.0,String tie waist with no elastic. They are really long but can be cut off to fit length
4.0,Great as a trinket. You get what you pay for. Don't expect it to be durable.
4.0,"I bought this for a halloween costume and it was great. It was a little tight in the waist - I should have bought one size up. Overall a great purchase, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again!"
4.0,"The colors are beautiful and vibrant. The material is a bit stiff and doesn’t have the soft sway I was hoping for. However because the material is stiff, the dress holds it shape nicely especially around the chest area. It fits true to size bit the waist felt a bit large on me. I paired it with a belt and it fit great."
4.0,Very good ring for the price
4.0,Wore them on my trek through Great Britain.  Dried overnight on the towel racks.
4.0,Cute lounge wear..u can wear out…not cotton..a poly-lycra blend…comfy.
4.0,"love this to just grab out of my purse to run into the store.... or just to carry at one of the Theme Parks Galaxy S5 fits tight, but probably due to the protector case on the phone."
4.0,"They are a wee bit tight, hopefully it just makes me that more determined to get in shape, lol!"
4.0,The purse is canvas like heavy material with a soft satin like material inside. It is beautiful and well made. The purse is much smaller than I had expected though.
4.0,"These anklets are beautiful and I mean every single one! I, now, have both gold and silver. The gold is a tad bit off but, it’s still cute! You won’t regret buying it."
4.0,Fits my wife's smaller face better than all others we have tried.
4.0,"I bought small, had to return was a bit large and too long for 5'7"" @ 200lb. Not really curvy as anticipated.  Awesome material, nicely designed"
4.0,Great value. The belt was a little misshapen after wearing it all day but you can't tell when you're wearing it so not really an issue.
4.0,"This sweater is an attractive option for a winter wardrobe.  In terms of sizing, I requested a Large, and at the time of this review I am 5' 4 1/2&#34; tall and weigh about 138 pounds.  The Large fit perfectly.<br /><br />The feature I like best about this sweater is the fabric-- a blend of acrylic, polyester, and wool.  The end result is a material that feels very soft.  It's not scratchy the way pure acrylic sweaters can be, and it holds its shape well (unlike cotton sweaters).  I've put it through the washing machine (cold water) and it didn't shrink or pill at all.  It lays flat to dry, and when it was dry it didn't seem stiff or wrinkly at all, unlike other sweaters I've had.  The cut is nice and long, too, which makes it a good choice to wear with leggings.<br /><br />The style is an attractive pointelle, but that comes with one disadvantage:  The weave is fairly open, and thus transparent:  Unless you don't mind exposing *a lot* of skin, you will want to wear a camisole or some other kind of layer underneath it.  That wasn't immediately obvious from the (small) photos on the website, so I suggest you click on the photos and/or enlarge them to get a better idea of the sweater's texture/styling. The open weave, of course, also means it won't be particularly warm, but that's less of an issue considering that I will be layering it.  I also recommend strongly placing the sweater inside a mesh laundry bag before putting it in the washing machine; I see a huge potential for snags if it's not protected."
4.0,My son actually wears it and we had to get a different chain as it got rusty very quickly.
4.0,"Love the color, but a bit baggy"
4.0,"I like it, but the belt comes out every time I wash it- even after I put knots in the ends.  It’s a pain putting it back in."
4.0,"The only issue is pretty much unfixable: it's just too small for people to even know what it is unless they ask and get really close to see it. Otherwise, YOU know what it is, and YOU know that it's awesome. A little pricey for a pin, but if you have the money, it's worth it to me."
4.0,"I love these shoes for my son, they go on easy and fit his narrow foot. I only wish the velcro was  a little better. Oh, and if you get them wet they stink!"
4.0,"Great dress, fits perfect."
4.0,I am 7 months pregnant at about 180 and 5'3 I ordered an XL and it is the cutest thing ever! Can't wait to wear it
4.0,"I tried both these and a longer pair of lederhosen and prefer the cut on these - they looked a bit more feminine!  That said, although these are thick leather, they will NOT keep you very warm in typical late September weather the way longer lederhosen will, so keep that in mind.  They do come with the traditional suspenders, but I did not bother attaching them for these photos."
4.0,"This review is for the brown iLoveSIA Sandals. Sandals are of good quality materials and seem to be worth the 30 bucks.  Though I can wear them and do, the shoes may not fit every foot comfortably.  Even though you can adjust the straps, top and back, the top straps on my right shoe had to be pulled so far over on the velcro that it left a lot of the strap flapping, especially the one near the toes - and it still left space between the strap and foot - left shoe was fine.  I might say it was just my foot, but I haven't had this problem before, and besides the straps are designed to adjust to different feet - so, narrow or flatter feet may still leave too much space - but it may just have been my pair - or more specifically one of the pair.  However, I am still able to wear them relatively comfortably.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />- Quality: They seem well made, good double-stitched leather, and a perfect shade of brown (not too dark or light)<br />- Sufficient sole thickness to absorb shock (but would have liked an extra 1/4th inch)<br />- Velcro straps seem sufficiently strong<br />- Foot size of soul (length/width) is about right<br />- Comfortable enough for casual walking<br />- Easy on/off, once adjusted<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Velcro straps on top of shoe (as said above) may leave a loose space - a quality control issue?<br />- Not an &#34;athletic&#34; shoe as pitched - in the sense you would want to go on long exercise walks<br />- Allow two or three weeks - evidently, they are shipped directly from China<br /><br />For the price, I got most of my money's worth considering you can easily pay $100 or more for sandals.  One shoe is about right, but a perfect fit on both would have moved my rating to a five. You might want to keep these shoes as a second pair.  I am using mine almost daily and will post an update later. At the time of this review, they meet the basic standard for price. Note that if you do buy these shoes, adjust the heal strap first, then the top straps for best fit.<br /><br />Update: Aug 3, 2015 - Still wearing these shoes.  The ability to take them on and off quickly is a real plus. They are a little more loose than they were when I bought them - still, they are very convenient and comfortable.  Velcro has held up with minimal wear.  Still have a good six months to a year left on them. So I will move my rating to four - now if only that one shoe fit properly and the straps were not quite so long. Oh well - for $30 (at the time) they were worth it. Am considering trying my luck on a second pair of a different shade.<br /><br />Update: Apr 27, 2017 - AND STILL WEARING THESE SHOES!  I live in Florida, so I wear these much of the year. The soles are still great; very little change in looks - leather still like new.  Other than the slightly excessive strap length (mentioned in review), everything else has been fine.  The underside of the straps did wear off where the plastic adjustment buckle contacts the leather covering - but no effect on outward looks or function. I have more than gotten my money's worth out of these shoes.  If it wasn't for the strap, they would earn a solid 5-star rating."
4.0,"Very nice watch! Sturdy, watch face is very beautiful. Bought is for a gift for my husband and he seemed to really like it. The only issue I has was the band seemed a little more redish brown, then the chocolate brown I expected. Overall great product!"
4.0,"Very nice but if you have big arms order a size or two up. The rest of the top run true to size and it does have some stretch to it. I got a large and I'm 5'8 205 it looked really cute on but, the arms were just snugged. Will attach a pic when I get some time."
4.0,"Only 2 reasons why I gave 4 stars is because firstly they do not have zip off legs at all, secondly they fit a tad big. I normally wear a size 6 in Jeans and got a medium because it says in the description that they fit a bit small. I would say they fit true-large to size. The material is nice and most of the fit is great (conforms to legs/hip but loose enough down bottom to wear boots under). They have 3 pockets, 2 front hip pockets and one zip closure butt pocket. They do have a bit of a high waist though. But for 10 bucks their great! They will definitely make a great pair of pants for summer backpacking trips as they condense to take up little space and are extremely light. I also thought the belt was nifty.<br /><br />If your looking for a pair of high waisted summer hiking pants without breaking the bank these will do you good. But just don't expect zip off legs."
4.0,I guess I expected these to be a bit more snug. They easily turn when on the handle of the suitcase. However they held up on international trip- didn't rip or get dirty.
4.0,The stone is beautiful but the gold has an odd orange tint.
4.0,Great quality and it's still in wonderful condition.
4.0,"Fit is not very giving,  no stretch at all. Otherwise fits fine just don't expect a lot of movement."
4.0,"I really like the bow tie on it. The snap buttons make perfect sense as I disliked most of the belt with metal hook in store. Size wise I'm a 26/27&#34; waist and it works fine with my maxi skirt sitting at the real waist. However, I doubt it will last for more than one season."
4.0,"Very cute and stretchy, but you'd have to knot it to fit a baby's head."
4.0,I bought this for my mom and one of the leaves fell off 😅 Other than that it’s beautiful 🌹✨
4.0,"This fits great as long as you don't need to sneeze, cough or talk.  Open your mouth and it starts sliding up or down my chin.  The ear straps are also really small.  I think this would fit a youth.  It's not so great for adults.<br /><br />It looks great, though."
4.0,I love this purse but the clip on the shoulder strap was broken.  I did not notice right away which was upsetting when I wanted to use it.
4.0,I bought this to wear as part of a Halloween costume. It is actually nice.
4.0,Lovely product and very warm
4.0,"I like the look, but the feel leaves a little to be desired, Great buy for the money. Way better than the stuff you see at walmart or party city. Quality is good, and sizing is right where it should be."
4.0,I really like this faux fur neckwear.  It's dummy proof and that'svery appealing to me. All I have to do is push one end through the slot on the other end and voila! it's perfectly placed around my neck.  And it's very soft and doesn't go far down in that the length when wearing doesn't even come close to my legs as some scarves do.  I love wearing it and look forward to colder days this winter so I can wear it more often.  The black and white colors are lovely.
4.0,Very cute. It does have a weird plastic odor. The strap will cut into your skin if you have on a sleeveless dress or top. I carried it as a clutch.
4.0,I like It's good.
4.0,"Really couldn’t complain for the price. I’m 5’6 and weigh 144 pounds. I normally wear a 6, but after reading the reviews, I ordered a size 8/10 and it was a little too big. Overall, it looked nice. But if you’re a person that pays attention to detail you may not be as pleased. Couple of things: the sleeves and back of the dress are a little roomy so I found myself pulling up the dress all night. Also, the hemlines and seams are a little weird, but hey it’s amazon what do you expect? It’s one of the reasons I ordered it in black (can’t really go wrong). Either way, it served its purpose and looked nice to the naked eye, but probably a one and done."
4.0,The bill was a bit warped i like the brand new flat look of hats so i had to bend it more than i would like but it looks amazing other wise.
4.0,"I ordered a Medium, which is usually what I wear but it's a bit large, especially in the sleeves. It also flares more than I'd like and the material is pretty thick so there's not much draping. The colour is exactly as pictured and it seems like good quality, so for the price it's a great deal."
4.0,"Love this dress, but is very short in the front."
4.0,"Cute little dress for casual wear. (Too short for the office.) Wore it to dinner on a cruise and it fit the bill. The plaid lines are not lined up at seams very well, but for the price, it’s still a cute, fun dress that can easily be dressed up for a summer evening dinner. I’m 5’6” and typically wear a size 8, purchased a large and it fit well."
4.0,"I thought this worked great. I wore it under my helmet on our Razor ride. It covers most of my ears, which I wanted. I do have a size small head. I liked the terry cloth band on it, that seems to hold it in place. I wish the fabric had a more stretch to it, but was very happy with it. I haven't washed it yet though."
4.0,"UPDATE:  I explained my plight to the vendor, Reni Premium Store and they really came through. They sent me a new belt (didn't ask for the defective original to be returned) and so far it's holding up quite well. There are no rivets on this version so I suspect that it may be a newer design. Only stitching and looks quite robust. The plastic buckle results in quite a light product which is very comfortable to wear. I asked them to send the next size up just in case and would recommend that if only for the extra slack if needed.<br /><br />BTW. this is the second time I've tried to post this - let's see if it takes!<br /><br />Original post: Not impressed. I just wore it on one trip and a rivet fell out halfway through. I'm not a heavy person - waist size is 32 and I weigh under 150 lbs. The belt is a size 32 so.... I don't even really need a belt. But this one still fell apart. Do I get a refund/exchange or what?"
4.0,Very great quality. Runs tight in chest area.
4.0,"The straight part that goes through your nose before it curves is a little long so it comes out pretty easily if you rub or wash your face, or even just catch the top of it on your clothes/pillows/a towel. But it's pretty, and seems to be the surgical steel it's advertised as (it hasn't turned my skin green and the piercing hasn't tried to close around it; even after 13 years, my piercing will try to close up around anything that isn't surgical steel), it's comfortable. I'd buy it again."
4.0,"There was one section that had a snag in it, but we decided to keep it anyways."
4.0,I love the jacket great feel design not cheap just wish the size was a selection of 3xl I got a 2xl fits fine just a bother when reaching but everything else good.
4.0,"Pretty summer dress but runs small. I am size 14 but need XXXL., elastic waist slightly snug but passable, I am 5 '4"" 150lbs and a 40B on top. My waist is bigger than it used to be when I was young it's  about a 34. Had to return XXL. Glad the XXXL worked."
4.0,"Love everything about this dress! I might add it is a bit lower in quality, but is perfect for about 3-4 special occasions! It fits well everywhere and hit the knee in perfect classic fashion. Recommend!"
4.0,The thickness is great can wear on cold weather and not freeze. Only problem is they pick up lint too easily
4.0,This suit is super cute. It does fit large. I normally wear a 14/16 so ordered xxl but it fits more like an 18. The skirt is pretty long in front so I might have to take it up a bit but over all I would recommend it.
4.0,"Definitely follow the size chart. I’m 150lb & 5’4 and usually a size medium but end up getting the XS . And XS is a bit on the big side but it does state on the description based on the chart it will run baggy for a comfortable lounge fit . It is very comfortable, and I enjoy the hoodie, deep pockets and hidden zipper drop seat, & removable footsies. I definitely recommend if your looking for a cozy warm onsie."
4.0,Cute...but very small choker.
4.0,great masks that keep all the light out without sacrificing comfort. Ear plugs are not good quality- very hard.
4.0,Great coat for the price. So difficult to find a men's peacoat in white.
4.0,Although this was delivered later than expected I like this shirt and will probably order another in a different color.
4.0,I love the red/clear color of these shades.  Polarized - great tint and good clean look with the lenses. absolutely love the red/maroon color.  Looks great in the sunlight.
4.0,"They look just like the picture, the color is perfect, had more rings in the package than expected. Wish they fit tighter, but other then that they are perfect!!!!"
4.0,Loved dress except split too high.
4.0,"I really love my mask I'm going to wear it for Halloween I saw this Coraline face mask I thought this is going to perfect with my Coraline costume only complaint I have is that the sewing is really weird the way they sew it it's scratches up and it doesn't show  Whyborns face so I took some of the stitches out and I'm going to resew it myself,  very good quality and it came with those breathing sheets that I don't know what they're called so I'm very happy with the product overall"
4.0,"Cute earrings, cheaply made but I get tons of compliments"
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on this strap. I used it with a grey purse. It is thinner than the original strap but still looks great.
4.0,cool shades they are dark but they fit my head a lil tight.
4.0,Cute coat -  the color is not quite as pictured -more like a moss green instead of army khaky green a described - very small cut - looks very youthful- may give it to my petite neice
4.0,"They’re a little tight, but otherwise they seem fine."
4.0,"This is a really cute shoe and very light weight.  For me, it fit true to size.  It's pretty comfortable and definitely helps with Plantar Fasciitis.  It was one of the more reasonably priced shoes."
4.0,A very elegant product. An excellent gift to give.
4.0,"This for like a charm, but I must have missed the part that said there was no padding.  It is lined with black fabric behind the purple but noting to stop the headlight effect. Even though I didn't love the pattern I would have melted over the way this fit had it been lightly padded. Five stars if you don't want the padding"
4.0,Very thick and warm. I thought it would be more of a casual caridgan but it is extremely warm and thick.
4.0,I love the material in this shirt. A nice fit for me.
4.0,"Just got this in the mail and I am so excited to wear it! Love the colors and how it looks on me! It is rayon so the fabric is very wrinkly and will need to be steamed. Also, both pockets have a hole in the bottom where they weren’t sewn together properly and it was missing a button. As an avid seamstress those are easy fixes and not a big deal to me considering the price of the dress and how much I love it! I am 5’9 and it is hard to find dresses this length! It is very comfortable and I can tell it will get a lot of use!"
4.0,Beautiful bag too large  for every day use.
4.0,Fits great. Even if you are a lil heavy still looks good.
4.0,"Nice fabirc, soft. But to loose for them to work as seamless underwear, they bunch for to looseness. May try a size down."
4.0,A little smug but still comfy and work well
4.0,Love it... comfortable.... just wish I could have gone up just one size
4.0,Gave it as a gift to an owl-lover.  Very nice for the price.
4.0,This is a good bag.  I was hoping for a key chain latch in it but that is not a deal breaker.
4.0,"Runs bigger than expected.  Gray was a little lighter than the original,  but a good replacement.<br /><br />Would not recommend for smaller wrists."
4.0,They are a little heavy so they sag a lil n don't stay right
4.0,"Great tops, I ordered several in different colors. They do shrink a tiny bit so go larger"
4.0,"Nice and warm, but they run really big."
4.0,"Good quality on material and seams used in shirt construction compared to similar shirts I've tried.  The arm length and chest fit were a good fit though the waist was a little snug in comparison.  My only real knock on the shirt was the tag which seems rather large and thick and would have liked a whole lot more if there had been a tag-less shirt instead.  Overall, would buy again but will watch the price which I though a little high for a basic tee shirt of this style, before actually making another purchase."
4.0,"Sweater is good for sports: soft, thin but dense, comfortable on top of thermal underwear.<br /><br />But I have to agree with other reviewers: sizing is wrong<br />I normally wear L, so I picked that size. It turned out to be too large. I understand that this is a loose fit, but take a look at my neck and shoulders.<br /><br />I'm waiting for M and will update my review after I will receive it."
4.0,Nice scarf and great price!
4.0,"XL: pretty dress, soft fabric. I am 5’3” and 150#. The dress is way too long, a couple inches on the floor, and I will shorten to mid-calf length for a breezy casual fit. I give it 4 stars."
4.0,"So cute!! The colors are awesome. I didn’t care to much for them, but my daughter loved them. Maybe a age thing. Lol"
4.0,I didn't really realize these socks must be folded down in order to fit correctly. But that's ok. They're cute and can't beat it for the price. The quality is ok!
4.0,"It was a pretty dress,  very well made. But unfortunately I have to returned because it was to short for me!"
4.0,"Only one reason not to give it 5 stars...really nice tee shirt with traditional full cut but their ""Heavy Cotton"" style, which isn't heavy, in fact it is the lighter then this one, is superior to this Ultra Cotton model in my opinion.  Weird how that is positioned in their line up, and it would solve a lot of confusion if it wasn't called heavy cotton... but it it what it is!"
4.0,For the price you can't beat. Came before the estimated arrival. A few of the jewels look like there falling off
4.0,Pretty nice pair of pants. A little big.
4.0,"Overall the watch keeps very accurate time. Takes a bit of time to understand all the features but with patience I got it all set up. The altimeter and temperature are not as accurate as I hoped. Need to calibrate often. Watch is light- weight and very comfortable on the wrist. I love the lighted face,  large digital numbers, atomic time keeping and solar charging. Once set it is easy to scroll through the different features"
4.0,Dress is cute. Ran large but I tied a belt around it and it works out well. Might order a smaller one to have for a more fitted look. Adorable design. Lots of compliments on this!
4.0,Loved this romper! however I am a medium and ordered a large thanks to reading some reviews and it fit just right.I would recommend wearing something under this because the material is VERY scratchy. Other than that I looked AMAZING!!!!
4.0,"Great seller to work with. The quality of these are average, but for the price and style, I believe it is worth a purchase."
4.0,"The stocking itself was longer than expected, but it fits perfectly. Might buy another pair"
4.0,"This is a excellent product for the price!! So pretty, and good quality. Hubby loved it!!"
4.0,I like the shirt and colors the shirt is to small.
4.0,My son says they are great
4.0,I will definitely order this dress in other colors. I wore it to an event and received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"Kind of hard to get snapped but once you do, it's pretty.  The little chains dangle over your hand makes it a conversation piece."
4.0,"Overall great bag, I would purchase it again. However, extremely disappointed with the travel charger. It seems to be of poor quality. Unsure of how it works, but the ports don't line up- they are crooked and the charger itself doesn't fit in the pouch. I'm disappointed it can't fit in its designated pouch but it's not the end of the world."
4.0,"Yes,  it is good and useful, but not stylish"
4.0,"I was really hoping this dress would be great since I love the style. Unfortunately there are no bust darts so the fabric just folds in that area.  I think this dress was designed for someone with a less curvy figure than I have, or at least with different proportions.  The sleeves are a perfect length and very flattering; they come to mid-forearm.  The dress itself is little short on me at 5'8"" but only because of the sheer sections - if it was fully opaque it would be fine as it hits an inch or two over my knees.  The material is a thinner scuba style knit so it has a very smooth and cool feel to it and it not heavy at all.  There is a zipper on the back but the fabric is stretchy enough that it's not needed."
4.0,Beautiful dress but way too short for me (I am about 5.7&#34;) but the fit was true to size
4.0,"Nice top, fits as expected, great length."
4.0,"The holders are pretty cool, the colors are bright and they seem to be sturdy. I love that there is a little pin to help open the key ring. The first picture shows how the item was shipped, I couldn’t understand the configuration. The second picture is how I revised them. That included opening a jump ring and closing it. I had to make sure I did that carefully so that the stocking stuffers didn’t look junky."
4.0,great mothers day gift
4.0,It is used friendly.
4.0,"This is beautiful. Whether the magnets really do something or not doesn't really matter to me.<br /><br />My only gripe was the pin in the tool that was sent along with this bracelet, to remove links-- B E N T .<br /><br />I had to spend $15 for a jeweler to do it for me.<br /><br />Bummer."
4.0,Bought this for my mother. She loves it and get complements all the time. I only give it a 4 out of 5 because the chain is really cheap.
4.0,"Decent for fast fashion. Very lightweight. Fit as expected. I’m 5’3, 160-170 lb and ordered a medium. The string makes the dress tighter as needed and the arms are a little snug for me but if you’re thinner it’s perfect. Mine ripped at the arm seams after about 7 wears but I still recommend for the price."
4.0,Nice material. Flowy dress.
4.0,The item is nice and very comfortable.  I purchased the large hoping it will fit loose but it fit like a medium size. I recommend purchasing one size bigger.
4.0,"I Love the dress, but it rises up and at times you have to pull down on it.  Other than that it is a Great Fit for me."
4.0,"Affordable, flows well. Fits petite figure with ease."
4.0,"I got the orange scarf. The scarf design is really pretty. However, it's smaller than expected. The scarf is triangular. It'll be better if it's bigger."
4.0,"Aesthetically pleasing, as a gift for Father's Day I wish it would have come in something more than a plastic baggie, but you get what you pay for! My husband likes it, but will have to take out at least 2 links."
4.0,This is an adorable and cute pin for work cardigans.  I purchased several pins and I am happy with my bow pin purchase.
4.0,"This hat was surprisingly warm. I'm from the Midwest and we just went through the coldest days I can remember in a long time. -50 degrees wind chill, but this hat kept me warm. There is a fleece lining on the inside that really makes a difference.<br /><br />2 complaints<br />1) Stitching of the fleece lining is coming apart<br />2) If you have a full head of hair, good luck trying to get it on because the fleece lining prevent it from stretching"
4.0,"I'm 6'4"" 190lbs and bought a size L. It fits my chest and is a nice length but as soon as you start moving/bending/working out, it starts to ride up and ends up by your bellybutton. It's annoying having to constantly pull it down but i'm sure this is only an issue if you're tall and have a long torso like myself."
4.0,"These are pretty good leggings. I am a big girl and they fit, they legs are not so tight and that makes them great for working out. There are some runs in 2 of the pairs."
4.0,Comfortable kids wore all day weather on face around neck or in head... however the color came off on their necks
4.0,"I used to literally avoid driving myself places if I was going to get out while it was dark. I have terrible night blindness to the point where I would probably be legally blind if it was always dark. They aren't perfect, but they have made it a lot easier to when I have to drive at night. The only problem is that they only work in places where at least a small amount of light touches or reflective surfaces, so they don't work super well on country roads and such. You can still only see within your headlights. I've actually used these also to just walk around at night, because my lack of vision usually impairs me. Overall a very useful product 👍<br /><br />Side note: I also appreciate that it's a 2 pack so I have one pair in my car and another in my backpack for in case I needed to walk a lot for some reason."
4.0,This dress is gorgoues! I am 5'2 165 and the Large fit me really well... until I lost a little weight then the armpit area was so exposed it was showing all the goodies. If you're not going to be losing any weight anytime soon then definitely go for his dress!
4.0,Fit is decent. I washed it just as the tag says but the colors ran anyway.
4.0,"Very pretty. A bit large for my small face, but fun for Easter. Would also be great for a Kentucky Derby party. The front veil came put of the package flat, and I did not have time to steam it, but with manipulation it came down towards my face fairly well."
4.0,"These shorts are well designed and well made! The material is lightweight and the color true! The pockets and zippers are functional and add a nice look to the shorts! I deducted 1 star because they do run on the small side! The sizing is not based on American clothing sizes! Although, you will order your waist size they come labeled sum,l,xl,2xl,3xl etc."
4.0,"Pardon the nips, haha!<br /><br />I'm a US size 12/14, and the large fit perfectly. The material is thin, so you'll probably want to wear an under shirt with it. It's soft, and the sleeves are very loose and flowy."
4.0,very common not as exciting as the opal gemstone flower.
4.0,"Too big, but nice."
4.0,"Lightweight yet with cargo pockets. Almost pajamas. I don't expect these to last a very long time as they are thin material and $20 but these are COMFORTABLE FOR SUMMER. I may buy a few more.  Length on front of foot/shoe was long/normal/acceptable, but slightly too long on rear behind heel. THIS IS TYPICAL as you can't order specific length.<br />I rolled the rear leg up about 1.5 - 2"". I pinned it and looked in floor mirror. When I got it right, I added 2-4 tiny stitches so they don't drag in dirt or under heel or get wet.  About 10 minutes hack alteration.<br />I used to wear 36"" inseam unwashed Levi's (1970s before pre-shrunk), but now 32"" dress pants or cargo. These were probably 34"" inseam."
4.0,"After reading other reviews I went up one size for my kid and it fits great. The gloves are too long, but we can cut or fold them down to fit his hands. They might be fine for an older kid, but for my 6 year old they go past the tips of his fingers. The hat and jacket are good quality and what is typical for a Halloween costume. The jacket even has real pockets."
4.0,Very unique and cute.
4.0,"My wife does not play softball. But for some reason, she wanted these pants. She tried them on, they fit her well and she says they are comfortable, but she hasn't yet worn them again. I have no idea why she wanted them... maybe she's planning on joining a softball team in the near future? Regardless, they seem like nice softball pants."
4.0,"Good quality low cut, no show socks. Comes in cute colors/patterns, the socks stay put,t hey are well made. Highly rec!"
4.0,Overall it's fine mine came with a stain on it though.
4.0,"there were only 5 styles sent -  4 of 1 style & and duplicates of 4 other styles. They were what I expected and worked well for the party.  but they were  some of the least interesting of the masks pictured  ( I got 4 of the little infinity design, 2 of the mask with the lightening bolt) i was  hoping for more variety. I also ordered these from a different site thinking i would get a  real variety (2 doz altogether) both places sent the exact same package. Everyone at the party really liked them and the quality. So 4 stars for the designs received."
4.0,great watch - it is a little large for me (I have very small wrists) but overall I think it is really nice.
4.0,Love the workmanship on these two pieces.  Colors are true from photo to actual item.  The beaded chain is great with the one wxception of the clasp.  Too flimsy which makes it difficult to put the necklace on.
4.0,"I bought this for cycling in my city neighborhood, where visibility is a concern. I also tend to exercise hot so was looking for a cool and breathable t-shirt. This is a bargain with great breathability, soft and comfortable, and super high visibility - I feel safe on my bike. It runs true to size. I normally wear M-L and bought an XL to have a loose shirt, and it is loose. The only bummer - it's an odor magnet/magnifier compared to my other t-shirts, which means I'll have to wash it every time I wear it. Still glad I bought it."
4.0,Reading the reviews I was a bit scared. But in some of the pictures it looks so beautiful. And nobody had a purple one on like the color I bought. I couldn't really tell if it was silver or gold in the pictures. It is a little bit small but it's going to work I should have went with the 5X I normally wear a 3X. But for 40 bucks the quality seems fine and it looks beautiful and there was no loose anything falling off of it.
4.0,"It's almost like the were smashed,  some parts of shoe never went was to original shape. It's ok tho,  ordered just for around the house shoes"
4.0,"This is a terrific T-shirt. I bought the small because it said that it was the last one and I paid $24.99 and Amazon said it was regularly $29.99. I would have preferred a medium because the small is tight but still wearable. The fabric is quite thin so be prepared to wear a bra or something under it or get a lot of attention. What irks me is that I discovered this exact T-shirt on Amazon, not here, but same T-shirt on Amazon, in a medium, and in the color I originally wanted, black. It was not shown when I bought the small gray one a few nights ago, the one that is advertised here but tonight it is shown and it's only $19.99. So look around before you purchase."
4.0,Beautiful vest. Can wear year round in Florida
4.0,These are gorgeous. I had to return mine because it was too tight in the waist I should have sized up. But they are so pretty!
4.0,Would order it again.
4.0,I got my pack and used for the first time this weekend. Loved the fit and feel. This product does the job very comfortably. My one gripe is the mesh at the back.
4.0,Very nice set that can be worn at least a few times before it starts to fade.  My mom loved it and I was happy with how it looked. I'm sure it will fade at some point but with a price that inexpensive it's ok.
4.0,This piece fits as is advertised. I wear an XL in shirts and that's what I brought.
4.0,It was alright it did the job used it for beauty and beast custom fits just fine
4.0,Great for the prIce
4.0,"Looks great, I lovethebeltbut it rolls in the back and I cannot stop the roll. Other than that itis very nice"
4.0,"For someone wearing Medium, the fit at shoulders is great and the length is upto mid-calf. The arms are way too baggy - so much so that it looks like I am wearing Glad with reflective strips.  I knew this was ""black"" - but did it have to be Glad-black?<br />The zippers are well stitched and look sturdy - there are a ton of buttons along the length for additional closure - I would have been happier with fewer buttons, but in windy rain, this may be exactly what one might wish for.  The pockets are too baggy - keep a phone or set of keys, they are bound to sloshing around noisily.<br />Apart from those minor issues, the raincoat actually does what it promises to do.  Highly functional but a lot of room for improvement in style department, especially with position/sizing of pockets, looseness of the arm/sleeve lengths."
4.0,"The snap front western shirt from Affordable is a good value for the price. The XL fits my husband well, as expected. Since it's 100% cotton, it bears wrinkles coming out of the wash, so be prepared to iron it or wear wrinkles. The label says made in Bangladesh, a fact I didn't find in the product description. I probably will buy products by Affordable Family Clothing again."
4.0,What I got was a solid black dress. This dress fits well and looks nice. My husband commented on how good it looked on me. I guess all the weight I have been losing is paying off. I will have something nice to wear when we go out.
4.0,Nice fit. But to large. Straps to long
4.0,Really nice watchband.  Bright and fun design but it is long.  I have a small wrist and finding a  watchband is difficult even Apple brand.  This one goes all the way around my wrist and under the watch.
4.0,Size Chart is pretty close.
4.0,Packaged wonderfully and it’s a very nice belt! It did have an odor when I first opened it so I let it air out for a few days before I wore it.
4.0,not really what I expected
4.0,A good buy !
4.0,"Not so good, it pulls on your hair too much"
4.0,"The perfect gift for my wife, daughter and father.<br />Thank you Wonbee Team."
4.0,"I received this as a gift and so far I am very pleased with it.  I've read other reviews where people said it fell apart, but the construction and quality of my bracelet seems to be top notch.  It is an adjustable bracelet and depending on how big your wrist is there may be strings hanging that could easily get caught on things.  And I'm not sure I'd wear it in the shower or while doing dishes.  I don't get the impression it will stand a ton of abuse, but mine definitely isn't going to fall apart with my normal use.  If you do more work with hands it might not last as long."
4.0,"Love the way they fit and feel; although, I wish pants was a little longer."
4.0,"I ordered a similar skirt from another company in a bigger size, because of my hips. This was a medium.<br />I prefer the large because I do not want a form fitting skirt  but because of the type of fabric the skirt waist does not stay in place.<br />The medium does not slide as quickly as the large does but I still have to wear a belt. This is because the fabric is stretchy and it is soft, and I wear a slip.<br />WOULD I ORDER THIS AGAIN? YES!  I have 4 total and I will order the medium from now on (my true size)<br />My other problem is the length. I am 5' 2"" and do not wear heals. Another reason why I have to keep pulling the skirt up. Some day I may hem them???? !"
4.0,It was exactly what was explained.
4.0,I bought 2x and it's bigger than my other 2x bowling shirts.
4.0,they are thick enough and look good but very low rise
4.0,"Comfortable, but thin. They tear easily."
4.0,Was to tight and small and I ordered a size 8 inch<br />Very unhappy<br />They are sending me a replacement  bracelet<br />I am forever  grateful<br />Thank you Believe in London<br />Will update when bracelet comes<br />Just got my replacement I am very happy fits perfectly<br />Thank you very much
4.0,"It didn’t stretch out even though after a late night Halloween party, I fell asleep in it, and then just woke up, showered, fabreezed it and wore it for tge whole next days events… it never stretched out and tge silkscreening didn’t crack or look worn like many screen printed leotards do. The stitching also was really well done, not cheaply made at all 👍 do it!!!! Awesome outfit. Easy costume… buy some long skeleton gloves and it’s basically all set!"
4.0,"I'm happy with this suit. I knew from other reviews that the bottoms would be small, so I was really just wanting the top to work. I'm 5'6&#34; 110lbs and a small B cup bra. The top does fit snugly, but will work. I replaced the flimsy cups with some sturdier ones and paired the top with a black printed bottom. The straps fit loosely and took a little figuring out. I might tack the strap a little to get a tighter fit. It seems to hold up good in the water except the straps are too loose on my narrow shoulders when wet and fit a little awkwardly. Overall I'm happy with the top for the price, it's an interesting cut that I've never seen elsewhere."
4.0,"Dispite the decent packaging,  they still get all tangled"
4.0,I do not carry a purse so all items must fit into a pocket. While it holds all of my items it is a little large to fit into my pocket. Would be perfect if it was 1/4-1/2 inch smaller in all directions H/W/D. In the zipper part it is unnecessary to divide the cards. Without the dividers the depth would be great.
4.0,"The straps are fine, just not for my sons glasses… the ends of the hooks are too big to fit in holes of Nano Vista glasses.  Have to return :("
4.0,Its nice dosent hold too much wont stay shut if you put too much no give.
4.0,I expected this to run small. That was a mistake...I’m 5’8” 130lbs 32D I normally wear a size small. I ordered a medium and it is gigantic. The bust area flares out dramatically. I’m afraid a small would be too big as well :( I will have to return it as it is unwearable. Really sad about this because I LOVE the dress. The fabric would be flattering were it to fit properly.<br /><br />7/19/18 Update: I’m adding 2 stars because I requested a refund and the seller promptly responded and sent a full refund.
4.0,"Cute. Got it for a friend.<br />Note: This is NOT suitable as a SPORTS BRA in the least.<br />The fabric covering the actual chest is little small on me, but will look awesome under tank tops on someone who's a bit smaller chested."
4.0,"These GTSY Reading Glasses Blue Light Blocking 5-Pack Design Reader Eyeglasses are serving very well as reading glasses for both my husband and myself.<br /><br />The pale yellowish tint is a bonus over most reading glasses, valuable especially if you are spending a lot of time reading a tablet or Kindle-type device. The tint is very light, light enough to be unnoticeable when you are wearing them, but will help block electronic devices emitted blueish light.<br /><br />The lenses were free of distortions, and all seemed very true to the correction strength.<br /><br />The frames are very utilitarian in shape and style. The colors of the frames provide enough variety that man or woman can find appealing colors among them. A few I thought were kind of unattractive color combinations, but if one out of five doesn't suit you, that's the one you can tuck into the car or garage for when you suddenly need reading glasses there.<br /><br />The only little irksome thing I found was some of the hinges squeak when you bend or handle them. It's a tiny, but odd and annoying, little feature on about half of the pairs of these reading glasses."
4.0,Fits a bit small..decent product for the price.  Decal you could probably make and do yourself on a cricut
4.0,Home in pocket but perfect
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for my husband for Christmas so can’t really give you his feedback yet, but I liked them so much I had him order a pair for me in women’s! I did try them on when they came in to be sure of fit and they were very comfortable. But as they are my gift I haven’t worn them yet for any length of time. I will try to update this review after the holidays!"
4.0,My wife is very happy
4.0,Ship time was awesome! Felt a little light but was a great product for what I paid
4.0,"Love the earring, however they have a tendency to irritate my ears if I sleep in them. So for me take them out at night and all is well!"
4.0,"Not very thick, and they are even smaller than expected (I'm 5'7&#34;, usually a size 28x30, and ordered the size L (US Small)).  Even still, they're just a little bit small.  Overall, for the price, completely worth it."
4.0,"These were nothing special, just cheap plastic things to hand out on Halloween.  They seem to be a good size for kids, maybe a little small for adults.  I was a little disappointed that some of the individually wrapped packages were not sealed."
4.0,"Works great and the removal tool is just splendid. Looks classy, but it is a bit heavy."
4.0,"I was very excited to find a reasonably priced Venti cosplay. It is true that you get what you paid for. There is good, there is bad, and there is the ugly to it.<br /><br />The Good:<br />It is very well made. Haven’t seen any loose strings or any tears. The quality is surprisingly well for a cosplay on the cheaper side.<br />The Hat is SO cute! It looks exactly like the picture and fits and sits well.<br /> The cape is so pretty and flows nicely. It uses a velcro strap to hold it onto your body, which is easy to hide using the bowtie.<br />The shorts are of a very good quality too. My only nitpick is that the pinwheel is a print on rather than a separate piece. But I can make my own! Also the leg holes are a little tight at the ends, but that could just be me.<br />The belt is alright, it’s what you’d expect for the cosplay piece. Nothing too bad about it.<br />The stockings are thigh high socks rather than tights, which is actually really neat! The shorts hide the top of them really well.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The shirt was a tad large and frumpy, and the sleeves are too long, but with a bit of hemming, it’ll be fine.<br />The corset is also a bit loose too, but again, with some modifications, it’ll be good.<br /><br />The ugly:<br />The vision. I was really disappointed in the look of the vision. It is cheap looking and flimsy looking. The dangly bits look like they will fray and break off, and aren’t really dangly. The top pompom and feather are just glued to the top of the vision. The embroidery on the vision is a bit sloppy. The only thing I won’t need to fix is the vision base/gold part.<br /><br />Would I say it’s a horrible cosplay? No! It’s great! I love it!! Even with it’s wonky-ness. Of course, I can fix the wonky, but if you can live with it, I say go for it! It’s definitely worth the buy, and if you do plan to modify it, then it’s also worth it to have a good base for a reasonable price. Overall, I do not regret this. I’m excited to get it fixed up and working!"
4.0,Very cute earrings they look exactly like the picture . The only bad thing is that the backing part is cheap and I already lost one of them. But they a regrets earrings got asked twice if they were diamonds.
4.0,Was what it said it was.
4.0,I got new locks installed and had to make a whole bunch of copies of keys. These worked perfectly for handing out the 2 new keys to friends/family.
4.0,Good hanging out/PJ pants
4.0,"It’s too big, and the material is very thin (basically see through).<br />After posting my original comment, the company reached out and offered a full refund. They were extremely responsive and disappointed that I didn't like their product. Even though I didn't like this product, I would try something else from this business."
4.0,Had to cut neckline out for an off the shoulder top.
4.0,"Very fragile, i have already broken it once. But, the extra cord was very useful."
4.0,I really like these bags but they are a little smaller then I expected. I probably should have checked the dimensions closer. They are nicely collapsible and attractive.
4.0,Only complaint is the stitching on the shoulder was already coming out and it doesn't lay right. Nothing I can't hopefully fix. Fits great and looks great
4.0,It's a nice dress...just slip it on....I wish the back was less tight around the thighs so it didn't accentuate<br />my hips so much
4.0,Really like this shirt though the metal rings on the sleeves are a little heavy
4.0,"I gave this 4 stars because the suit is beautiful, but it definitely runs very small. I am very petite/skinny so usually when I see &#34;runs small&#34; on the listing I'm excited cause it will actually fit me lol but this time I wish I would have ordered a size up. It looks good but is very uncomfortable due to the small size."
4.0,My badge from work kept getting scratched so I wanted to get something to keep it safe. This works and seems to be well made. It even fits in my back pocket when I do not need to wear my badge. Only downside is the clasp seems loose.
4.0,Thank you so much. These wraps helped me leave the house when I couldn't get my hair done. They are reasonably priced and very comfortable for everyday use.
4.0,basic padding in the shorts. decent price for the quality of the shorts.  the shorts seemed to fit well for us
4.0,"love the interchangeable lenses. But,  a year later and one side of the lens doesn't snap. securely in place anymore. Still wearable but irritating since I'm sure the lens will fall out when I'm running one day."
4.0,Works well if you dont over use it. Mines kinda squished. Should of bought another to alternate.
4.0,"Really pretty, but one of the black beads was cracked in half in the package which makes it look smaller than it should be. But other than that, it is really pretty."
4.0,I really like the shirts. They seem to run small. I normally wear a Med. I ordered xlg.  They fit but length they run a little short. Over all I do like the shirts.
4.0,"This is the perfect bag to take on a trip where you don't want to carry a bulky bag full of stuff you don't really need. I know it's supposed to be a man's bag, but I just had surgery & was looking for a black, lightweight, leather, crossbody or sling bag that was big enough to carry my essentials (wallet, phone, lipstick, small mirror, breath mints). Not as high-end as it looks on the picture, but attractive enough, lightweight & perfectly sized, to keep."
4.0,Im 165 5’6 ordered a L. I expected cotton material but it’s stretchy spandex. Still liked the outfit though. It fit well! Fit better after I lost some weight lol the pants are super long and probably better worn with heels
4.0,"Very well made and looks like it is advertised,  I wish the battery on the watch was as good...Lone negative,  hard to connect"
4.0,Matches well with the shirt i bought it for.
4.0,"I love it, the fit is perfect, the colors great. I only wish it were a bit thicker!"
4.0,"Deducting one star because some were broken at the clasp, as shown, which makes it difficult to use them for the intended purpose.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a good deal, and they seem sturdy."
4.0,The panties aren’t very stretchy or flattering but I am so pleased with the top! Great quality and very cute!
4.0,"Other than them being a little small, I love them."
4.0,After reading the other reviews (thank you ladies by the way ) I decided to buy 2 sizes larger and it fits good but not great sadly.. It's such a cute top! The lace sleeves are a bit to tight but not to tight that I can't wear it thankfully!! I normally wear an XL.. bought the 3Xl. I'm a 38D and weight 215pounds. If your around my size then it should fit you fine and you can enjoy this cute shirt 😄
4.0,These are nice and warm and well-made.  The only negative is they're a little big and it's had to get them in places - like door handles on cars.
4.0,"They were smaller than I expected, but still pretty and easy to use. Used them on a ribbon wrapped around vases.  I bought the ribbon on the basis of the dimensions of these given in the description. The ribbon (2 in. wide) ended up being a little too wide, but it worked. I think these were the biggest buckles like this that I saw on here, but they are tiny."
4.0,Both beautiful and good quality. Black and gold a lil heavy.
4.0,worked for the project purchased for.
4.0,"The necklaces are really cute!! And good quality for the price. I gave it a four though because they are too big on me, it would be nice if the adjustments could be made smaller. Other than that good product."
4.0,"I’m only giving a 4 bc I can’t truly rate it all the way.  This is a gift for my teen niece.  She specifically requested it.  It’s a good size, looks to be of very good quality and the color is super bright:-). It came packages very well and arrived on time."
4.0,i got them so that i could be comfortable at work.
4.0,Good price and customer service.
4.0,It didn’t fit my head with hair too good but fitted my child better
4.0,"My nephew looked super cute in this set! And my sister said that it held up for an entire, swimming and playing in the water, full summer."
4.0,"Great quality material, runs large so it fits way too sack like. Washed a couple times does not shrink."
4.0,This is a good buy for the money!<br />The pearls are nice sized and with shaped.
4.0,love the hat just fits tight
4.0,"The skirt is cute, a bit see through but ok. The top does not fit as per the model, it is more fitted so I will pair separately.<br /><br />I am 5ft 6, 195lbs, 46.5 hips, 40D & 36 waist"
4.0,"This is a good deal for the money.  You get three pairs of socks and a little carrying bag to bring to classes with you.  The only thing was that from the photos, I didn't realize that there is a closing between the thumb toe and the rest of the toes.  It felt a little weird at first but got used to it quickly once I was exercising."
4.0,"Very good socks,"
4.0,"Wonderful fit, beautiful print and very comfortable. I love the pockets! I was disappointed that within a few hours of wearing it, pilling started on the front stomach area where the table I sit at had rubbed on it ever so slightly. I am worried that after I wash it, it will get much worse. I'm really hoping it's not going to be a one time wear!"
4.0,Everything appears to be as advertised.
4.0,"Very, very, very pretty and feminine. Love it. Nicely made and comfy. The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is because after you wash it, the elastic band inside the waistband twists. It should not do that!"
4.0,"This dress fit me beautifully! My only real complain is that there was a hole in it as soon as I took it out of the package. It was along the seam where the skirt meets the top part, so it thankfully wasn’t really visible. I can fix it myself. Otherwise, I love this dress! I am 5’7, 135-140 lbs, and I purchased a medium. I probably could’ve gotten away with a small."
4.0,"I got these for my brother's fiancé because she loves wine and I thought this would be nice to have for marking people's wine glasses instead of the bands that have been marketed for the same task.  I wanted to test them before giving them to her though, so I busted out a glass and gave them a try.  Being a frugal utilitarian, these seemed a lot like dry erase markers to me so I thought they would me a good comparison.  As you can see in the attached picture, the first 2 markers are dry erase and the next 2 are these (markers shown in order).  My initial impression was that they definitely wrote better on the glass, however both accomplished the basics of the task.  As you can see I tested a red and green from each type.  For looks, the green dry erase stands out the most, but the red dry erase was also the worse.  Seems these are more consistent and hold the middle ground.  It takes a little while to dry, which is to be expected (60 seconds?) and then I performed the &#34;touch&#34; test and ran my thumb across the middle of every number.  The red dry erase was competely wiped off where I touched it, while the other 3 remained mostly present.  Upon further wiping both wine markers came off next with my thumb, and the green dry erase was actually the hardest to get off, but still doable with just my thumb.<br /><br />Thus, in conclusion these do perform slightly better than a dry erase marker, primarily in writing quality, and but I would take note to use them on glasses where you do not expect people to touch (basically the middle of a wine glass between the stem and lip) and they will do just fine.  I imagine coming off too easy is much better than it not coming off at all, and writing can always be reapplied although condensation will inhibit this as well, so I definitely recommend that the writing is done before you pour anything into them.  I also learned this through testing.  I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but I never let that fact affect my opinion and write my review with the MSRP in mind to compare value. I rely on Amazon reviews for a lot of purchasing options and I think it's important for them to be honest and accurate. I hope that I was able to shed some light on this product for you, and if so, please mark it as helpful."
4.0,Pretty decent shirt.
4.0,Little big because my last ones we too small
4.0,"I have been looking for a real heavy duty Pique material long sleeved shirt.  This is good quality, but came thinner than I expected for Heavy Duty.  The trade off is that it is much softer than I expected.  I like it and may order another.  Has plenty of room in the shoulders.  It is really about a Medium weight fabric.  Took a while to get here, but I do like it."
4.0,"The rings are nice but they're too thick for ladies fingers. My opinion<br />But I like them , color are nice and bright"
4.0,I just need to figure out how to use the stone:)
4.0,do NOT buy with a long torso
4.0,This is very nice.  I bought it as a gift.
4.0,"Great fit except as usual tight on my calfs, not as bad as others because I can actually wear them for hours though after taking them off after wearing them for about a day/day and a half straight I had some cut off circulation lines that itched/hurt for some time but they healed up<br />So for those with thicc calfs these are wearable for at least a night out, maybe more if they stretch out after time"
4.0,"This is a wonderful idea, love the concept! I give it a 4 though because I would have loved for it to have had more coverage around the sides of the hips a little more...but again, great idea (which I had myself too)...I always wrap a jacket around me because I love work out in tiny shorts, just my preference."
4.0,Phone case is beautiful. Surprised by the rubber feeling and softness and also feels very sturdy. Can't charge with case on though but I'm thinking a quick snip of the top thin part will be an easy fix. Super light weight and covers everything just snuggly. I'd easily buy from yoga case again.
4.0,"Cool necklace and a good deal for the price. My only issue is that my neck started to get a little irritated after wearing it for several hours. I'm minorly allergic to nickel, so warning to people with more intense nickel/cheap metal allergies."
4.0,Great fit super cute!!
4.0,The top isn’t as long as the picture. I sent it back bc it wasn’t the look i was going for anymore but it was cute
4.0,"One of the hats is the perfect size, while the other one is significantly smaller. I love the look of them though and am hoping the other might stretch out a little or something."
4.0,As the Picture and description the quality is high match the the name of CK. but be careful about the size
4.0,"This dress is great for just going around town. The fabric is soft, and especially in the summer, is a little breathable. The colors are a little muted, so it will transition well into fall with a pair of boots and a cardigan. Overall, not bad for the money."
4.0,"Good price , fits well"
4.0,"I received these in the Red/Black combo. They are pretty light & fit well, considering most women's sunglasses aren't wide enough for me and squeeze my head. The lenses arrived with plastic over them for protection & the bag they come with helps as well.  Unfortunately, I'm having to return them as there was a gash of plastic missing out of the frame under the lens which will lead to the &#34;paint&#34; coming off.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"The quality is excellent. I could see using this sling back for a long time.  The space inside the pack was not as roomy as I anticipated, however this may be different because I got the leather version and it doesn’t offer the same ability to conform to the same amount of items as a similarly sized pack I had borrowed for a trip. in addition, it doesn’t have a compartment for a water bottle. i could put a bottle in the front pocket but then I couldn’t carry my umbrella - an essential in the area that I live.  That being, I am still pleased intend to carry this sling back to work for a long time."
4.0,"BEAUTIFUL,  BUT I WISHED THEY WERE LONGER AND THE INTRICATE DESIGN MAKES LOOK EXPENSIVE. I HOPE IN NEAR FUTURE I WOULD LOVE IT IF IT would BE MADE IN A  LONGER DESIGN.  Overall I'M HAPPY WITH MY purchase"
4.0,Top is great.  Bottoms don't fit as pictured.
4.0,Great product for the money. Wish they extended out a little more.
4.0,"It is a wonderful bag.<br />However,  I wish is was bigger."
4.0,Great looking and fit perfectly
4.0,"Fit as expected although I change the insole for more comfort, has great traction for snow and ice but will slide on any oily substance. A great value shoe."
4.0,Fun to wear delivery lunches to kids for school
4.0,I loved this dress the only problem is I can’t really wear it because it’s very long at the bottom and I’m short so it basically drags
4.0,"Nice quality, beautiful color in person. Just wish I wouldn't have gone up a size because a small would've been just fine!"
4.0,One I purchased in store several years ago( same brand on the tag) had more stitching connecting the straps to the bag. Hopefully this one is as durable even though it has less stitching.
4.0,I’m short but wearing boots and skinny jeans pulled off the length of this cardigan. I love that is has pockets! Definitely recommend with leggings or jeans to dress up/dress down.
4.0,Bought this because I have lost a lot of my hair due to scalp psoriasis and I don't like being stared at or asked what happened so I have been staying home.  Now that I have this I don't mind going out again!  This would be better with a tighter seam to hold on to head better.  Also it is a little warm.
4.0,Bought this for my teenage daughter and it looks great.
4.0,"Fast shipping but doesn't really make a difference at night. Maybe it's for City driving, not in the country?"
4.0,lots of compliments on the dress<br /> Very comfortable
4.0,"Its a little bit of a tight fit, but I still like to wear it"
4.0,pretty and delicate
4.0,Good quality for the price. Fit as expected. Some reviews said the fabric is see through but I wore it without anything underneath (except a bra on top) and I had no issue.
4.0,"These are as pictured, not the finest quality, but cute in a naughty way. Pretty true to size, with a bit of leeway because of the style and material used."
4.0,"I got lots of compliments on this lanyard but it's not meant for heavy use. Mine broke after 3 weeks,  but I have more than my badge on it. I have hand sanitizer, visual cards and a fidget. I need all of these for my job so it's probably better if you have just your badge."
4.0,"So I think these run really big (and really wide) but they are so darn cute. My daughter did say she had to take them off because they are too warm. There’s no wooly lining or anything, just plan pink fabric. They are a little more cheaply made I think than other slippers I’ve ordered from Amazon. The sole feels like a very flimsy piece of imitation memory foam and kind of move around in the slipper- but my daughter hasn’t complained about it. The exterior is super soft and I don’t see any loose threads or anything.<br /><br />I think these would be a fun gift idea for any child."
4.0,Pretty necklace but shorter then it appears in the picture. Top layer hits me right between the collar bones.
4.0,Got it while on sale.  Exceeded my expectations.  First pair of jogger sweat pants and I'm really liking it.  It is really comfortable. Would recommend.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:beb1dca33b2b23b4ce19d40bea32cd24]] Great deal its pretty cute just has some defects
4.0,"Gad a Harry Potter themed bachelorette party, the items were great and arrived quickly! I wasn’t able to use the tattoo transfers because they wouldn’t stick, other than that it was a hit !"
4.0,Pretty. Would give 5 stars but it kept snagging my lace dress
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" and 185 with extra around the waist. These sweats sit comfortably (size 1X) at my waist, and the hem hits just above the floor. Perfect!"
4.0,It was cute and comfy. I did not keep it though because where the buttons are at the waist there was a bit of a gap even though it fit me well. It may have just been a one off but it was really adorable and my husband liked it. I may try and buy it again but it did fit nice
4.0,"After much hunting and back and forth with the likes of Costco, we found the only place to get the lenses made, and it was super cheap. About $50 at Walmart. My kiddo has had Solo Bambini and Miraflex, and these have performed just as well over the past 1+ year since we got them. They're a bit more stylish, with the multi-color, and they have a nice option to use the behind-the-ear silicone pieces, which is better than the band, for long hair. I'm buying a backup pair in case they stop selling, because this is like 10% what we would pay for the more expensive flexible brands, and they stay on just as well upside down in a tree, and they survive tussling, rolling, and stepping just as well. Minus one star (really half a star) because every month or so there's an incident where a lens falls out, but so far we've always found it."
4.0,The only issue with fit seems to be my booty! It just fits!
4.0,I am 5’8” and a B cup- I ordered this in a small and it fits me perfectly.  It’s tough to find dresses that aren’t ridiculously short and I love the length of this. The fabric is fairly thin and see-through but it isn’t tight fitting so with the right slip I will be great!
4.0,I believe that I'm the one that got the sizing wrong lol but I'm also pregnant! All around love the dress! It's soft and light weight. I was comfortable all night and couldn't have asked for more!!
4.0,"Loved this! It bothered me a little when wear the plain  glasses part and not the shades.  It was very sensitive to my eyes , but it fit the look I was going for."
4.0,"These little studs are great. Perfect size for anywhere. My favorite is the star so I bought a separate pair of just stars. I only give it 4 stars because one of the posts (the one that has the heart with it) was a bit wonky and the heart doesn't screw in all the way. I have extra posts so this was not a big deal for me, but it would have been nice if they all were flawless. I would recommend these."
4.0,Great design for fans of Guardians of the Galaxy.  Shirt material was good but seemed to shrink after just a couple of washes.
4.0,This serves my needs exactly.
4.0,"Super light and soft, perfect for a budding preteen/teen.  But watch the padding it will slip out in the wash so put it in a laundry bag."
4.0,"Ordered these in 5 colors. All were great...except red. It has a really horrible smell in the fabric,  even after 3 washes.  If you've ever driven past a dairy farm,  you'll recognize the smell.  If it wasn't for that one issue, it would be 5 star. I'm 5'9&#34;, size 14, ordered xxl."
4.0,"Polyester type material, it's alright. Not what I expected looks kinda cheap. Order came as expected. Good shipping came in a timely manner."
4.0,It’s a little tighter than I thought and the pads had significant creases in them. I was able to work out the creases after washing.  Other than that it’s good.
4.0,I really like this shirt. It's the first shirt I've bought from Amazon. After reading the reviews I bought a medium. I'm a &#34;shmedium&#34; (some smalls are too small but mediums are potato sacks). I'm 4'11 120 lbs and big in the hips. I like how the hip area fits but should have bought a small due to the wide neck and longer sleeves. Very cute shirt though and will probably order a small in a different color and give this one to my sister.
4.0,A little thin but I'm only going to be wearing it during my treadmill sessions. No circuit training or squats.
4.0,I love it!!! It's so soft and comfy and awesome! I haven't washed it yet so I hope it holds up in the laundry but I plan to wear it to death. Winter is coming.
4.0,"This was a hit at the con I went to, the only thing that is an issue is the material is very light and will rip easy the gloves ripped after a hour of being at the con so I just keep them off.  Where the attachments are is where it will start to rip so after the first con I made modification to the outfit which I do not recommend to other unless they know how to use worbla or wonderflex."
4.0,I really like this for warmer weather.  They make changing diapers easy as well.  I was a little disappointed with this brand as they started fraying at the edges after washing.  They still are working just fine but my Babyleg brand ones are holding together better.
4.0,I like good fit.
4.0,This dress is so comfortable and you can dress it up or down. It has stretch to it so I could’ve sized down. I love the feel and look of this dress
4.0,"Cute, now I can always find my keys.  They don't get lost in the bottom of my purse."
4.0,Not as big as I thought it was going to be. Sleeves and lenghth are a perfect size.love the pockets
4.0,Not quite as soft as I expected it to be but it is a beautiful length and fit perfectly. They match perfectly with a pair of LuLaRoe leggings.
4.0,"It seems to be working fine.  I had trouble finding out how to adjust the date because it didn't come with instructions.  The images shows that it is a reddish brown, but the one I received was a dark brown.  Not the color that is shown,"
4.0,It was a gift for my daughter in law.  She absolutely loves them.
4.0,"For a cheap, low quality dress for a maternity shoot, you get what you paid for. It's not perfect but it's pretty enough and people will think it's gorgeous regardless. The size fits well enough! If you're looking for a unique high quality piece, then this is not for you, but to save yourself around $200, it's a cute accessory dress to accentuate your beautiful baby bump 💕"
4.0,"Have been happy with the glasses.  I'm not much into the colored lenses, but the polarized ones work well.  There is no slippage when active.  I play golf and this is the first set I have used that do not move throughout the entire swing.  Two friends tried them while playing and have now ordered their own.  They were part of Amazon's &#34;Today's Deals&#34; when I purchased them, and at $16 I would buy again."
4.0,Let's hope it works. Seems sturdy.
4.0,Came in very nice package..in a fast time..very good quality for price
4.0,I loved it it is cute comfortable and actually goes well with my kitchen decor. It feels soft and is manageable when i cook thank you!
4.0,It was good my wife said.
4.0,"Great shoes, but definitely too small. My daughter is a size 6, and the size 6-7.5 was snug. She still wore them, but I wish I would've ordered one size up."
4.0,Really cute design and the material is good and lined well. The only negative is the back looks like a sports bra razor back. It's just plain and black and boring.
4.0,I was expecting a more silky texture but fit well and looked okay.
4.0,"These run a little small, but otherwise it's a really nice shirt.  I originally got this in a large for my husband (his normal size) and we returned it for an XL.  I'd say the Large fits more like a medium in most men's shirts.  The tie looks really cute with it, and it's a big hit with all the kids at school where my husband teaches."
4.0,A little baggy but sleeves could be a little larger.
4.0,"I love a nice fleece jacket. I live in Wisconsin and it's nice to have a nice light, yet warm layer. This is just that. I did get a larger size than needed (XL) in case I want to wear a sweatshirt or something heavier under it...not that I'd need to. This guy is nice and warm. It's definitely a little boxy and I'm not sure that it would change had I gotten a smaller size.<br /> The fleece is nice, however there is a different color fleece on the inside than the outside and collar. I don't mind, just making note. The seams look well made, as do the snaps. Nice, convenient snaps!<br />This is a nice jacket, I don't feel like it looks as dressy as I thought It might look, but it still looks and feels really nice."
4.0,Very happy with the texture /weight of the earrings!
4.0,I bought it for my  6 years old niece. She just started her ballet classes and she needed something to put  stuff closely related to ballet and take with you. If you need something not big and not small I would recommend this bag for you. Also a ballet dancer on the bag like a reminder for what you buy this bag - for ballet clothing and shoes.
4.0,Love it. Wont tarnish when cleaned. Gives me the freedom to wear for extended amount of time and vice versa.
4.0,I have to war a heavy pair of socks for it to fit properly.  Other than that things were as expected.
4.0,These ears are very pretty and comfortable but they were a little tilted from shipping and the box leaning against them. Be aware of this and just use your hands to hold them back to fix them.
4.0,"Light, but you can see."
4.0,Absolutely LOVE these Z-strap sandals in DEEP OCEAN...however...when I went to buy (what I thought?) was the same shoe in a BLACK...the black came in today BUT was 1 size smaller than the Deep Ocean!!!  WHY would 1 color be SO different in size than another!!!  I had to return my Black colored one...and now I'm afraid to order another color...for fear they will be too small yet again!<br />How can be confident that they will be the same size?
4.0,"I purchased the black, they are a little big for women but will be cozy for the winter."
4.0,quality of cloths is great. but zips are super cheap and broke on second day of use on an airport.
4.0,"This was the only size that reasonably matched my regular glasses.  1 7/8&#34; x 1 1/16&#34; (48mm lens width).  Apparently, it is the smallest size available.  I was surprised these sunglasses matched the size and shape of my glasses so well.  However, I didn't realize the four prongs on the sunglasses would have trouble getting over my thick lenses.  I have very bad eyesight, and my regular glasses are progressive.  Although my lenses are triple high index, initially the sunglasses did not cover the sections of the lenses near my nose.  Not good.  Fortunately, I discovered the prongs are very flexible.  They are covered by plastic and can be easily manipulated (upward and outward) with your thumb and forefinger.  After moving all four prongs, I was able to get a very good fit.  The prongs still don't completely go over my regular lenses.  But they apply enough pressure against the sides of the lenses to keep the sunglasses in place.  If your regular lenses are very thick, you may want to consider buying more expensive sunglasses with prongs that have more depth.  My old sunglasses had that feature.  However, these Eyekepper sunglasses are much lighter.  And who wants a lot of weight on their ears and nose, especially in the summertime?  This was a very good purchase for me.  Also, with three pair, I can put them in different places (e.g., car and house) so I always have one pair accessible."
4.0,"This is definitely a different sort of belt that is for sure.  I really like it, but haven't worn it much.<br /><br />The snaps are really strong.  I don't forsee them wearing out anytime soon.  The build quality is really nice for such an inexpensive item."
4.0,Very dainty and cute!
4.0,"We gave the measurements to the seller. It fit perfectly. The material for the pants is a bit thin/cheap for the price. However, it will work for the occasion."
4.0,I have no problems with the sweatshirt itself but they should have said it would take 6 weeks to get it!
4.0,It is a very cute shirt and looks exactly as pictured.  However it is very clingy and runs a size or two small. You definitely need a cami/tank top underneath or you will be exposing the world. Hopefully it washes well.
4.0,Beads were a bit smaller than I wanted.
4.0,Not as relaxed as I expected.  I guess I have to loose some weight.
4.0,"Cute glasses.  The polarization is nice and they are a nice shape and size.  Only critique is the lens has started to distort around the edges, still not bad for the price."
4.0,Very cute. Shirt is more fitted than expected.  I wear ordered an XL my usual size and it is pretty tight across the chest.
4.0,"These shoes are so cute, however, I will have to return it because they are so large. Too bad."
4.0,"They're not my favorites, but I like them."
4.0,"will shrink after wash,get one size up!"
4.0,I bought this for Christmas. My baby is 7 months. He wear 6 to 9 months this was his size but fit a little to big. But that's is ok with me gives him time to use more than once.
4.0,"The product is good, but it defers from photo. I thought it would be more colored as its on photo.<br />It took 22 days to deliver. I almost forgot that I had ordered it.."
4.0,My daughter loves them. Wears them all the time with no problems.
4.0,"Warm fleece for baby for outdoors. We used it along with a carry pack and the baby stayed plenty warm. The booties that fold over the foot seem a little short if you have a long kid, but I like that you can slip them off. Seems plenty durable for what we used it for."
4.0,ok have not used it yet
4.0,Cute cami that can be dressed up or stay casual. I bought it to go to a semi-formal Rehearsal Dinner for a Family Members Wedding. I wore it with dress pants and an open Cartigan & it looked great & was comfortable.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Used it to attend an extravagant, glam wedding in October. Tight around chest, but I was nursing so that might be more me than dress. Flowed beautifully."
4.0,"I'm a 24.5 inch waist and a Small fit perfect! It was however, sewn crooked, so I'll be ordering another to see if it's any better. The front closures are hard to use but it's just for a costume, so I'm not complaining.  I wouldn't recommend it for waist training or long term wear, but it's great for a cosplay/event. I'd also advise being at least a B cup, as this will stand away from you if you're not.<br />-Alyssa<br /><br />Edit: Got a new bustier, this one is sewn correctly. Great for a costume!"
4.0,"Fits perfectly, but it is to short to be considered a dress"
4.0,"The bag is just amazing. Everything is good about it. The design from outside and inside, its violet gorgeous color (the color I picked), the lots of pockets inside can take many items. The only 1 semi-fault is the main strap which I thought would be longer as seemed to me in the picture. Offcourse this is something various subject to customer taste."
4.0,Overall I loved this! I did however size up I usually wear a large and a 38D bra I was worried about it fitting me right up top the lace part that goes over your boobs was a bit smaller than it appears from the pictures but overall this was an absolutely great deal for the price and definitely seems like its going to hold up to a bunch of usage.
4.0,Actually a little to big but that's a plus.
4.0,"great fabric. made well.will fit RIGHT now, not sure about a month from now. could be a little bit  larger"
4.0,"Great hardware and strap, but like most NATO's it could be a inch longer"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3c39247cc75e5acf7afe70e85a4a1628]] Such a cute, CUTE purse! Came with a shoulder or over the body cross strap along with a wrist strap so I can switch it out. Straps have a metal detachment for easy removal. The neutral tan is a great earthy color that goes with everything! The tassels on the front is a stylish decor element for pop: An exterior snap-over-close flap, an interior id slide out pouch with several card slots and a nice billfold slot for dollars. On the back, a zippered pocket for change. This is so adorable and my only slight complaint would be the curious gap in the closure (?). I don’t know why there is so much space there and things can slip out from the gap. Doesn’t bother me near as much as I thought, but reducing the gap would be a design suggestion I’d give; Still cute, stylish, and functional. Made very well and compacted with nice variety of slots/pockets."
4.0,"My teenage son wanted to dress as a Squid Game worker to a Halloween party.  This jumpsuit works perfect for that.  He is 5'6, 33x30 pants, the medium fits well.  The hood is a little tight/snug which is why I knocked off one star, but other than that, this works well."
4.0,love it. ribbon needs to be for firmer in place but dress has withstood many washes and still holding up
4.0,"I think it's exactly was I was looking for, better quality than I thought it would be too!"
4.0,"This suit seems really nice for the price! The material is soft and stretchy, but holds me in. The cut shows just enough hip and butt. I wish the back were a little more low-cut. The only thing I was really disappointed about was the color. The pink leopard is advertised as pink, but it's baaaaaarely pink. It looks white until you hold something white up next to it. And the other leopard print is a little too big and busy.<br /><br />I am 5'4"" and 135 lbs, I got the pink leopard in small and the plain leopard in medium. Both fit really well, but the small shows a little more leg."
4.0,"The elastic is a little loose, and the actual buttons are lower than I like. The shorts are pretty great though."
4.0,"I am always up to try a new belt design, have seen a bunch, own and use a few, thought this would be good to try.  Pulled it out of the bag, wrapped it around my belly, fed it through, pulled it tight, not too tight, but enough to try.  And then I couldn't figure out how to release the thing!  Got out a second, fed it though, not around me, and finally figured it out.  You can see in the picture the little tab, it must be pushed to release the belt.  I am glad this was in a three pack or I might be trying to figure out how to cut it off rather than writing a review.<br /><br />The belts are nice.  Nylon webbing which is what almost all my belts are today.  The width fits through blue jean belt loops, the buckle will not, but the other end does.  They are sturdy enough to hold up your pants, and also clip something to them if you do that.  They are three colors, they describe as black, light black and  gray.  Honestly any would look fine with blue jeans, or black pants.  They appear easy to shorten, the unfinished end pulls out of the buckle, and be cut and put back into that end.  Save the finished end, nylon webbing frays after being cut.  You can try to melt the ends, but I have never been too successful in getting an end finished like the finished end of these are.  Appear to be well built and should last a long time.  And when one does wear out, it is a three pack.  Should be good on belts for quiet a while."
4.0,"The size of the circle was a little larger than expected, but the length was great! Love these"
4.0,Brother loves them
4.0,Like it.  Just ordered another one.
4.0,Love the color and shape!
4.0,"I ordered coffee color and it is much brighter than I expected. Definitely not coffee. Simply light brown. Anyway, it has a very good shape and  it is nice handbag."
4.0,Nice fit. Waiting to see if I have to pay extra taxes because it is New Jersey after all.
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for.  I find masks a bit uncomfortable to wear but found wearing a thin neck gaiter made it a bit less irritating.  I like that they catch some of the contaminates from talking, coughing, etc and that I can just switch these out if I don't have another mask handy instead of wearing a gross, soiled mask.<br /><br />These are perfect because the ear holes keep the gaiter from slipping off my face as normal gaiters sometimes do when you expose your ears for masking.  These are slightly shorter than other neck gaiters so there is less clumping on your neck.  They are also of adequate tightness.  Another bonus is that there are no seams for front and back, do you can just turn it around if you find yourself reusing it during the day.<br /><br />These are also super thin, so if you intend to protect yourself and others from aerosol droplets, these by themselves may be questionable.  If you use it like I do, another layer of protection doesn't hurt.<br /><br />I am giving this a 4 stars instead of 5 because there were some ball point pen markings on the white gaiter."
4.0,I love the colors but it is only one size so is a little big for me and the belt is not attached to it so easy to lose. Great purchase for the price!
4.0,Very well made. I get tons of compliments when I wear this piece. Minus 1 star because the thing that hands down the back chain (the little designed piece at he end) was missing.
4.0,"My glasses keep slipping out of the holder. Disappoints. The company contacted me and offered me a $5.00 refund, which I accepted.  They were very gracious and am very pleased with their response.  The chain is very pretty and I am sorry it didn't work for me."
4.0,The magnet is REALLY strong let’s see how long this one lasts!!!
4.0,Seems to be a value for the money. Giving this as part of a gift for a first time grandfather.
4.0,My wife loves it and it fits her well
4.0,Exactly what I expected and I can make them fit.
4.0,I'm a size 7.5 women's and these are just slightly too small. They still fit but bother my feet when just sitting around relaxing. They are also a thinner material than I hoped. Overall I'm still keeping them because I like the style.
4.0,"Bought this dress for my daughter during the Prime sale, would have loved to have gotten the next size up but sale was over and the dress went back to full price."
4.0,"Bought this to go to a bachelorette party so I could carry my wearable breast pump with me. This bag fit so many things! It has plenty of pockets and space.<br /><br />Only downside was that the straps kind of cut into my arms a bit by day 3 of wearing tank tops with it, but otherwise, I love it!"
4.0,"So far, I'm pleased with this product. It's nice looking and easy to read night and day. I haven't tried it swimming yet. I wish it came with instructions. I'd like to shift the digital time into 24 hour mode. I'll keep trying."
4.0,"These shoes are good quality, but run a bit large."
4.0,Was a little tight on the chest but other than that it looked flawless. Would recommend.
4.0,The shoes looked and felt amazing!!! Only reason it's not 5 stars is because they felt a little flimsy as if the heel might break.
4.0,"Fits really well.  Nice and comfortable and I LOVE the color.  The only downside is it feels like it needs something on the finished edge (bottom) with jeans it would probably be okay but with dress pants, it needs something.  I really like the v neck though and it washes up well also."
4.0,Ordered wrong size.
4.0,"Very good quality.  I personally would have liked it a little bigger, but is probably fine for most people."
4.0,"Ordered the 2-4 year size, which came labeled 3T. This suit is SO CUTE, but is significantly smaller than a 2T suit from target. I’ll be ordering a size or 2 larger."
4.0,Very large around chest with big armholes. Great material and color though. I ordered a medium and it def fits like a large.
4.0,Dress fits perfect!!
4.0,"Nice length, you can pair with the different colors in the dress."
4.0,Very nice looks beautiful
4.0,"This is more of a personal preference as opposed to the quality of the belt. I prefer a softer, more pliable leather than this belt. This belt is rather hard and stiff. I am revising this to 4 stars as the customer service department has been excellent."
4.0,I bought these for my junior bridesmaids. They are nice but I wish they weren't lose in the little box.
4.0,Very thin material but super cute! Not bad for the price
4.0,The fabric is nice quality and the pattern fits me well.  Usually a pleated skirt is has sewn fan folded fabric.  The pleats are merely ironed in on bias cut circle skirt in this case.  They are figure flattering nonetheless.
4.0,So the materials a little thin and almost a tiny bit shiney but it's not bad. I definitely don't regret buying it it's really cute.
4.0,Worked fine for inexpensive sunglasses!
4.0,"Very cute however, I am worried that it is not very stable I worry about losing part of the cat"
4.0,"The pendant is exactly what I was hoping for, and I've had many compliments on it. However, the chain might as well as not be included, since the black chain paint started chipping off immediately.  I changed it over to a black cloth cord the third day of wearing it. So, a big thumbs up for the pendant itself, and thumbs down for the chain.  And frankly, for such a nicely made pewter pendant at this price, I don't care too much about the inferior chain."
4.0,pretty big bag. feel sturdy.  cant wait to put it to use
4.0,"I’m 5’3” and had to cut a good amount of fabric off the bottom of these, probably 4-5inches. But it fits be great at the waist, I’m usually a size 6"
4.0,Took one star off because the quality is not top notch. One of the pairs we received (fox socks) had a stretched leg hole.. but overall the designs are adorable. Bought the one for 1yo. Perfect for my 7month old who loves crawling. The foot part is just a little bit loose but the leg part fits him perfectly and it covers his knees.
4.0,"Dress looks cute and fits well. Very comfortable. Four stars instead of five as the cut is more empire waist than the model photos suggest. I even went a size up to compensate for a larger chest as other reviewers suggested, and the waist is still high."
4.0,Not very sturdy. But a nice fit and very comfortable
4.0,"I’ll name the pros- the material is good quality. It’s thick enough to completely cover my black sports bra (see pics). That’s hard to come by. The fit is stretchy, but doesn’t look like active wear for the gym. It’s cute tucked & untucked (see pics). Now the cons- Here’s why I gave it 4 stars. Even though the buttons are sturdy (another pro) the seam doesn’t stretch over far enough to cover that gap between the button and the other side of the shirt. Therefore, you have to keep the top button undone. Just an FYI. Maybe if you’re smaller chested it wouldn’t matter. For reference I’m a 36 full D. I’m thin, but not petite. I ordered the small. The medium would’ve been too big. Everything said & done, I would recommend this top. If it were any more expensive though, I’d probably get something else because of the button area situation."
4.0,"This coat was a great price and the style was really cute. My weight fluctuates and that can be really frustrating in the winter when a coat becomes a bit too snug or too loose. This coat held up really well and the only drawback was the pilling. I got one of those clothing razors and occasionally I have to shave them off around the armpits. It is a very warm coat-- I live in Utah. I have another coat that is a Calvin Klein, and I barely wore it because I preferred this one. :D Lesson learned-- name brand doesn't mean a thing."
4.0,"Not suitable for girls with boobs. I am a C and the boob section on the shirt does not work, it’s just too small. Sad because it’s super cute otherwise!"
4.0,The product was little small. It did not fit exactly.
4.0,very nice watch and great price.  Clasp a little tricky at first but great item.
4.0,"Ordered medium it wasn't bad, maybe small would be a little better but will take in the bottom of it..."
4.0,"It looked nice online, but when I got it I felt it was too flashy, so I returned it."
4.0,"I washed the dress on cold and delicate cycle, but the green bleed over onto a lighter color dress. The dress fits perfect and looks amazing, but be careful when you wash."
4.0,The socks are great for the price-soft and comfortable.
4.0,"I love this dress!  Perfect fit.  Material has just enough &#34;give&#34; to it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it is very low cut.  I didn't expect that, so I will have to wear something under it."
4.0,Even though its a used product it works perfectly fine. It's a great product to quickly extend your belt out to encompass a large coat or whatever you might be wearing so that you do not need to readjust the belt and all of its locking points.
4.0,"I got the white top/dress and I am 5'6"" tall, 123 lbs. . It is too short for me to wear as a dress but, maybe a swimsuit cover-up. It looks cute with jeans or leggings. The side are shorter than the front and back and it fit me perfect.  I wish it wasn't a one size fits all because this will only fit up to a large for someone."
4.0,Great  product  delivered  as  identified  but  four  of the  lights  did  not  work.
4.0,"Love these finger-less gloves! Wish they went farther up the wrist. They are so cute and fun to wear, and very warm!"
4.0,Nice material. Well made. Run larger then sized.
4.0,good for a suit
4.0,"I have a bunch of cowboy hats and if you didn't know...THEY WILL SHRINK. I bought this unit because it stretches your hat in all 4 directions. It is sturdy and seems well made. TRULY, IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE! I don't know where it's made, but the language of the company that sells it IS NOT ENGLISH. As I say, it works. One of my few complaints is that the grip that you turn to expand the unit is too small and that makes it difficult to hold/turn, possibly there just isn't enough room to make it larger...it works, I'll live with it. I only bought one (1) of these, mainly due to the cost, so I'll rotate it through my hat collection and not just leave it in one hat. As far as I can tell, it will work equally well with felt AND straw hats. To make sure that you do the stretching correctly so as not to damage your hat, look for videos on how to do it on YouTube...I did."
4.0,"After reading the other reviews I went with a small - I'm 5'4&#34; 120lbs, ooookkk I may be 125 since it's right after the holidays lol ;)  Regardless the fit is great, not too tight to be squashing me in, and not loose."
4.0,"I liked the fit, but it was thinner fabric than I expected"
4.0,What you expect for the price.  Strategy but cute.
4.0,First and foremost every finger in the glove can be used on touch screen not just thumbs and index finger which is awesome. I normally get large size on gloves but these felt a little too tight it was even a little uncomfortable to close my hand they already streched out a little but still feel a little tight. So i suggest getting one size bigger than what youre accustomed to.
4.0,"Thin material,  great for summer.<br />Got a XL, fits like a small"
4.0,The color was darker than I expected. Good quality and fits well!
4.0,Got this rosary as a gift. Came in on time and it looks great. Only thing left is to have it blessed.
4.0,jewelry  making
4.0,"nice style and color but too big. The reviews are wrong, it runs big."
4.0,Weird patterns but I use at home so not a big deal
4.0,"Excellent quality, but the bottoms are short. I recommend going up two sizes for little boys."
4.0,"FELEMO Silky Soft Women Pajama Pants with Stretch PJs Sleepwear Drawstring Palazzo Lounge Pants<br />Size XL - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. I would normally wear a medium and a medium would have fit much better but these have a drawstring waist so they work! ;)<br /><br />The material is very soft and the print is pretty. There are cuffs at the ankles and side pockets. They are very comfy PJ pants. I would recommend these pants. 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,"I got many compliments on this swimsuit.  I usually wear an 18 and that's what I ordered and it fits well.  I gave it 4 stars because I find the neckline goes a little too high and rubs on my neck while exercising in the pool.  I'm 5'5"", maybe I'm a little short for the swimsuit.  Overall, it's a great swimsuit and it I've washed it 3 times now and it still holding up."
4.0,Exactly as described. Looks good & made well
4.0,Very pretty.  The V part is a little longer than I expected.  But overall I like the necklace
4.0,A nice piece for the price; not great quality but I'll enjoy it.
4.0,They almost fit my hand perfect
4.0,Love it but a little small
4.0,Size was bigger than normal! Had to return and reorder
4.0,Big. Had to add holes.
4.0,This visor very comfortable. Good sun protection on face but i tend to like one with just a little shorter bill. May order another color in addition anyway because of comfort
4.0,I love the bracelet and it goes well with my other bracelets of a similar style. It does however get scratched easily and I've only worn it a few times. Super cute and simple. Great deal.
4.0,"This is a great dress for the price! Based on other customer reviews, I knew it would be too long and so I'm having 3 inches hemmed off the bottom. I'm 5'1&#34;, 146 lbs and wear a 38D-DD. I am also having the spaghetti straps shortened a bit to pull the bodice up. I ordered a Medium which was the perfect size considering that they don't have petite sizes, which is a shame. Still, the fabric is soft and light w/o being see-thru, which is nice.The cut of the dress hides my Mommy bulges and that bit of back fat. Because the price is SO reasonable, even with tailoring, the dress is affordable. That being said, if they had petite sizes, I would have given it a 5 stars if they had petite options and/ or if the spaghetti straps had been a bit shorter"
4.0,"Love that these do not bother my ears which us essentially what I was looking for! And I truly found it! I was asked if they were real, and shocked my aunt when I said no. I'm pretty sure she purchased a pair on Amazon as well now.."
4.0,They fit fine.  A little thin but comfortable.
4.0,fit is good quality is good
4.0,The dress was too long and I thought the material was going to be cotton but it was not. It was nice though just not for me.
4.0,"Nice quality.  For me, the top isn't at 0% so I still have to look over them to see in the distance."
4.0,"The shoes nicely fit, very light weight and soft materials."
4.0,Arrived in very nice box and well made. Taking put the links to make smaller was not as easy. Getting it back in and to stay was challenging as well but still a very nice watch. Color was spot on.
4.0,"Comfortable and baggy.  These traditional sweat clothes considered ""old-school,"" but I accept the name and work out hard in them."
4.0,"Even for me, being short and having a B cup, this is a bit small. Expect nip slips, so wear pasties or something underneath if you want to prevent it"
4.0,Great slipper for the price. Order 1/2 size up.
4.0,"Soooooo comfortable. As with any lace garment, must be careful for pulls. The dress is so comfortable though and the lining underneath is perfect. Buy in sizes you would normally wear for any other dress."
4.0,It shrinks a little when put in dryer
4.0,One of the post didn't fit securely.  Might have been a defect so others might not
4.0,very nice for the price very slow delivery
4.0,"Pay attention to the product dimensions! It's very small so you may end up disappointed if you're expecting it to be larger. It's a fairly nice necklace, although the clasp on the chain did break after only a few days. Thankfully, chains are easy to replace."
4.0,After the first wash the drawstring fell out. Unfortunately there is no way to put it back in
4.0,"This is actually pretty good, for what it is, but the way that it catches light and the color of the steel actually makes it look quite dark, even in bright light, so it's very gothic looking, far more so in person than in the photos, so you should be aware of this before ordering. It's a great design for anyone into the goth look, but it ended up being far darker in person than in the photos so the person it was meant for didn't want to wear it. Good luck in your search."
4.0,"Is long, which is nice, fits well, the sun flames do tend to stab you when bending over and when jeans are up high,  but it super cute!"
4.0,"I was hoping this would be lighter weight and not as tight.  I bought size Large (am 150 lbs, 36DDD, 5'6"") and it was too tight around my tummy.  It fits more like compression wear and will emphasize your love handles, if you have them.  The length is good with tennis skirts.  The price is great.  I was hoping this would be an alternative to Lulu Swiftly Tech LS 2.0 Race length - but the Lulu top is lighterweight and not tight around my middle so looks better and is more comfortable."
4.0,I haven't worn it yet and am a little concerned about the hook that holds the anklet together.  Just hope it won't come undone and I lose it.
4.0,"Very pretty, but tight for the size, short in the back if you are blessed with a large butt."
4.0,"The material is soft, snaps are easy enough I was able to do it myself two days after surgery, and emotionally it was a comfort to know I had it. I would not buy it again though as I was to nervous to use it as it's intended purpose. I was afraid of having the drains so far from my body (get snagged, etc). And I really can not justify the price point."
4.0,Got these a few months ago and wear at least one of then every day. The colors are true to the photo and the quality is pretty good for the price. The clasp is easy to remove when you want but is very secure.
4.0,Love it  was runs a lot bigger then I expected. I just tie it I  the side.
4.0,"Great dress, so cute and my grandmother would have loved it! My only qualm is that the pockets are cut at a bias across the hip and stick out if you're hippy at all. Otherwise, love love LOVE this dress!!"
4.0,"This has become one of my go to going out dresses. It's so flattering and comfortable! As a plus size woman it's very flattering for my curves. It also does not look cheap. Really, really like this dress!"
4.0,Very nice fit out of the box
4.0,"It's much larger than I expected and has so many compartments that I can actually find my wallet, phone and keys when I need them lol... the design is not bad either. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a crossbody bag that you can easily wear while traveling or shopping!"
4.0,"I mostly use those with sneakers they are not too tight so it feels really comfy!!!<br />Easy to slide my feet in. I was also able mix them since I got multiple packs.<br />Wouldn't recommend them for heavy training , haven't had any come off while walking but I did break a few (3 or 4 but not at the same time ) while putting my shoes on."
4.0,"This is Beautiful! It on backorder when I first ordered it but I still got this coverup in under a week! The colors are absolutely beautiful, soft pinks, purples and blues mixed with black. The cool thing about this is that you can wear it in a variety of ways. Tie it in the front, the back or wear it as a skirt. My preference is to wear it as a skirt, the ties actually wrap around my waist 1 whole time so you have plenty of options with this. The only reason I gave is 4 instead of 5 is that 1. it is wayyyy shorter then it looks on the model and comes only as far as my knees when I wear it the way she is wearing it (I am 5'8 but still!) It also had a slight chemically smell when I took it out of the package but that went away after I washed it. This will look great with a black suit or a sky blue color suit."
4.0,"I love the quality, however they run small."
4.0,"A bit shorter than I expected, but my daughter is tall. Otherwise a good nightgown."
4.0,This dress fits beautifully and it's true to size.  I highly recommend
4.0,"I love these, but they're definitely not meant for larger women. I got an XL and it's very tight. There's not much give in the fabric and it's short too (probably due to me being large in the bust). This will work for working out at home for me but I won't be wearing it with others around until I lose more weight."
4.0,"Cute!! My 13 year old daughter loves them!  The only thing that would make them better is if the words were higher, so that when worn with boots half of the letters aren't covered. Other than that they are great!"
4.0,These are super soft and very comfortable
4.0,"I bought a hat just like this one in Cozumel, Mexico-for much cheaper, I might add- about 4 years ago.  I had skin cancer on my face so this hat, along with a ton of sunscreen works well to keep my face protected from the sun.  I like how it fits comfortably around the back of my head and most of the time even a strong wind can't blow it off!!"
4.0,I wanted to love this- I liked the fit of it- the fabric just didn’t hold as well as I would’ve liked. I wish it was thicker so it didn’t show imperfections or panty lines. Great coverage though!!
4.0,"The 9-10Y size fits my healthy 5 y/o perfect. She is about 46"" tall and about 27"" waistline. Feels like a smooth poly like stretch material."
4.0,"Based on the sizing I would have purchased a different size.  It fits fine, but somewhat on the smaller size.  I like to buy clothes with slight room left, this doesn't have that.  It is stretchy so that helps."
4.0,My wife says it's tight but it'll fit my summer!
4.0,As described...
4.0,"I bought it because of the novelty of it. And for the price what the heck. It's called a ladies watch set but it's more for little girls. Luckily, I have grand daughters. It's a cute little setup and they like it. 4-stars for the misleading title."
4.0,"Light, comfortable and super soft - got this for sun coverage for summer and it is perfect.  It fits over my tank top - and yes, it fits over the boobs.  Buying tops from Asian designers is mostly a miss, but this top, in large, is perfect as a summer cover."
4.0,Luv the glasses
4.0,"I'm 245 pounds, I ordered a large but because they a very stretchy. It's to lose to hold my chest up. I could have went down to a small and got tighter fit!"
4.0,Super cute bracelets but had to glue the magnets back on several times. Just an fyi.
4.0,"Awesome under shirts, wish they weren't so see thru."
4.0,"It was a beautiful dress, but myself was prego so I thought Large will fix. It actually was too big so I have to return it."
4.0,Fit as expected. But were a little tight and uncomfortable.
4.0,I love this dress! The only bad part was 1 button came off as soon as I put it on and another fell off after washing it. I know how to sew on buttons so I was able to fix it.
4.0,The shorts fit tighter than expected. I wear them to the gym
4.0,I wish it could make me a size 2!!  lol  Pads in top fit kind of strangely
4.0,Not disappointed with ring got a lot compliments. Fits just right
4.0,This a cute dress and is flattering for my shape. It has ample room for my large chest and hangs nicely. The only thing I don't like is how the collar ruffle looks. Would be nice without it.
4.0,It's one of my favorite dresses to dress up or down.  The only complaint is the extra fabric awkwardly left over on the inside of the dress on the chest area.
4.0,The only reason this hoodie didn't get a 5 star rating are that the pockets are narrow/ not deep enough for your hands or your cell phone otherwise it is warm.
4.0,Love the comfort and style of this dress. Usually wear it around the house because it is a thin material. Would be great for vacation as a coverup or resort wear
4.0,"Fits very well, great price."
4.0,"Quality Belt but Runs Large; Love this belt, fit and finish seem top notch.  I wear between a 34&#34; normally in my pants waist size and was concerned about which size to order.  Ordered the size 38 belt and had to return it for the 36 belt which is listed to fit a 31&#34; to 34&#34; waist.  The 36 is still a tad bit big but buckles at the middle notch for me.  Still love the look and style."
4.0,A little snug. But over all very nice and sexy.<br />I am a B cup 34 back and bottom is 8/10.
4.0,"I liked it, but it was too small for what I needed for. So I sent it back."
4.0,Hat fit well
4.0,I have bought these for my sons for Christmas... I can't fully review them yet.  I hope they love them!!!!
4.0,"the 3x definitely fits like a 2x, runs a full size small at least in the plus size. but the color and quality is nice."
4.0,I loved this dress! and then the belt broke after 2 wears.
4.0,The hays were used as a unicorn horn for centerpieces for a birthday party. Some of the hats though were more difficult than others to stay closed.
4.0,Arrived on time and was nice and very fuzzy!<br />Only bad part was the horrid smell after opening package.
4.0,"Smaller than expected, about one size. Fairly stretchable, though, so still usable, but not comfy enough to sleep in. Pretty good cover, can be used in place of a tank top. The finish and fabric are decent, price for 3-pack was not bad either. If not for the skimpy size, it would be a five star."
4.0,"Pretty good, though it's a little bigger than expected.  But overall i'm very satisfied and wear it all the time.  Very warm too."
4.0,Tire were as described. They were all nicely packaged and a great graduation gift.
4.0,For the money a grate value
4.0,Super cute...but extra small.
4.0,"These won't be really tested until cold weather arrives but I found them to be comfortable and a good fit for my women's size 12 foot even tho I ordered size 11.5. I anticipate they will be good for wearing around the house on cold weather days.  The price was excellent andI think they'll do a better job of keeping my feet warm and comfortable than some similarly priced ones I have bought that don't have real sheepskin lining.  I was apprehensive about the fit but they went on with just a little coaxing and I should even be able to use a sock if necessary after they've been worn a bit to stretch them out a tad.  I think I'll probably order them in other colors too because at this price, they are a good buy and will help keep the heating bills down."
4.0,"I bought this watch three times over the course of the year as the notch for fastening it repeatedly broke. I would buy it again, but I bought the metal version and the fastener works much more efficiently and it's only a dollar more/"
4.0,These came quickly which was awesome. Unfortunately they are very flimsy and one chain broke the first day using it.
4.0,"For $20 you get 2 pairs of sunglasses and some accessories making it a pretty fair priced bundle. The glasses are decent for the price - we aren't talking Ray Bans here but if you are looking at these chances are you want semi-disposable shades that you won't cry about if you lose them, break them etc.<br /><br />In that sense, these do the job. In fact, just the other day I was taking my son to airport. He got car sick on the way there, we had to pull over and grab a pack of wipes as he was covered in his own vomit as well as the side of my car and most of the front passenger area.<br /><br />I'm my haste, I popped my trunk, put my glasses down and then shortly after proceeded to slam the trunk and breaking the pair of glasses I was wearing. I wasn't even mad. I still have one pair left!<br /><br />I know this a sunglasses review, and you probably didn't expect an anecdote about getting car sick...but here we are!<br /><br />All in all, they look decent enough are well tinted and not costly enough where you are upset when you break them!"
4.0,"It doesn't have the button straps most shorts have for toddlers, just spandex but my son will grow onto them regardless!"
4.0,"From the picture, it looked like a typical off the shoulder dress. When I received it, I was surprised to see that there were separate holes for the arms. The body of the dress fit great, but the arms were a little snug. I went back to look at the pictures and reviews to see if I had just overlooked the style, but it looks like different colors of the dress have the arm holes while others do not. It's still a cute dress, but I would've preferred the regular off the shoulder style."
4.0,Gave this as gift to my nursing preceptor. She seemed to like it. The chain looks well made and is fairly long. The pendant itself is somewhat heavy for its size which relays a feeling of craftsmanship. To expose the clock face the wings open but the watch I bought had some difficulty fully extending one side causing partial coverage of the clock face. I believe with use this defect will correct itself. This product is adorable. It comes packaged in a small jewelry box with a ribbon bow. I feel it is an excellent value and makes a great gift for girls and women.
4.0,"everything was perfect except, the zipper sometimes its hard to zip it. nevertheless everything looks fine. good wuality of materials"
4.0,I have old silver; liquid polish isn't recommended. The cloths work well and leave a nice shine.  I'm glad a I bought two.
4.0,"Nice skirt, i received my package and skirt was damaged, disappointed."
4.0,"The fit is a tad loose, but the right amount of loose (no head squishing)."
4.0,Product is great. Arrived 1 day late - happen to be the day after my sons basketball game (His team is the Pacers). He was pretty bummed.
4.0,Georgous. Fits perfectly.
4.0,Good stylish shoe bag
4.0,I got these shorts for my husband and they fit great! They are pretty comfortable.
4.0,"Due to other reviewers mentioning that it ran large, i sized down one & it was a perfect fit. I love the style of this turtleneck and it was just as flattering on as in the product listing. The material is thick and soft and truly a well made item. This is such a cute wardrobe staple for cooler weather, and can be styled so many ways. Just be sure to size down or you might be swimming in it."
4.0,"These are way thicker than I was expecting which was a nice surprise! Love the real distressing, when I ordered I was worried that it was going to be printed on, but it's real and makes them look way better. The one thing that didn't work for me is the pockets on the back are a little too low for my body type, but I managed to make them work. They do come up pretty high about 3 inches from my chest so they slim you out pretty well. Will definitely order more!"
4.0,"Exclusive Metallica Distressed Master of Puppets T-Shirt<br /><br />I'm 6' and 185lbs., the xl fits great. Not too baggy and not too tight. The Tshirt material is thin but not see through and is average softness. The logo is pretty faded and blown out looking, I know its a distressed look but it's almost hard to make out what it is. I like it though, so as long as you know what you are buying it's pretty cool."
4.0,This gaiter fits my 10 yr old son well. The pocket for filter is sewn on the top and bottom with both sides open (see pic.)
4.0,Love these shoes.  The is the third pair I've purchased.
4.0,This is extremely cute and is perfect for my daughter. However I bought the large thinking it was equivalent to a 10-12 but it was not. The large was more like a small/ medium 6-8. Cute but runs extremely small.
4.0,"This item is a fashion life saver and must. I always hated how my shirts would come untucked throughout the day but this item has solved that issue. Simple to use and works very well, the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the metal piece occasionally gets caught on my leg hair, but nothing too major."
4.0,"So far this hoodie has been great. It hasn't pulled, yet and hopefully it won't! The fabric soft and feels cozy. The size does seem just a tinge smaller, so you may want to size up. The front pocket is great but I don't like the velcro. It feels a little childish. Even a couple buttons would have been cooler. Overall, it is a nice comfortable hoodie."
4.0,Cute and soft. Fits at least one size too big so I would have ordered down had I known.
4.0,"This is well-constructed (made in Vietnam) shoe with a couple of issues to consider  - the width seems a bit too narrow compared to other brands; secondly, compared to other name-brands, the fit seems to be inconsistent - for a kid starting to outgrow US 6, this 6.5 is already more snug than the 6 he is wearing now.  UA sizing has become somewhat inconsistent in the past few attempts - strongly encourage to order different sizes (up) if you can or at least try first.  If you are able to find the right size, this is a great shoe - lightweight, excellent stitching, mesh lining that provides enough circulation and a great color combination.  4.5*"
4.0,Great value.  Minus one star because I had to sew apron where the stitching came apart.  Lucky I sew.  Was great for Alice in Wonderland costume party.
4.0,"Fun pants but the color will rub off on your hands. Plus, they are small of the size. But, they got the job done on a Rex from Napolean Dynamite themed halloween costume."
4.0,The top on this has built in underwire and provides nice support. Pattern is cute as well.
4.0,The case that it comes in is a nice hard case with a cleaning cloth included. They’re a good pair of glasses that feel light and comfortable and the hinges are sturdy.
4.0,These were handy to keep attached to my iPhone so I’d have them to use when I needed to read fine print direction labels in pharmacies.  That was also true for use of theater and concert programs.  That also meant they were often at risk to fall out of their little slot case and get lost which is what happened so beware.
4.0,"would be 5 stars but the string it comes with is way too short, fits like a collar on a dog"
4.0,"This is a product that you want to fit as it shows on the pics and for me, it barely did that. I'm only 5'5 and it fit just right so I can only imagine if someone should be a little taller or bigger than me. It was a nice material and looked very good on me, but, I suggest they just add a little length so it can fit more like the pics."
4.0,"So cute, but smaller then most clothes this size. Too small for my one year old, I even went up a size so she could wear it through spring too but that won’t be happening."
4.0,"They're good quality and shipped fast. Just wish the cup was bigger, even for a C they look like B cups."
4.0,"Its great, but the ball didnt glow. I love the design though."
4.0,"Great for the price, for some reason the brown variation always falls apart, blacks still going strong."
4.0,wish the handle could be a little bit shorter. Otherwise it's perfect
4.0,Thin & breathable material but well made. Colors are bright & bold & seem to last with repeated washings. Great for active kids staying cool in the summer
4.0,Thought may be a little thicker but lI've it just the same
4.0,I love this but if you have curves order one size bigger but the material is stretchy and it can be a little hot in the summer but I don't like my stuff really fitted so it was good overall
4.0,OK this is just one and very reasonable priced. It was a gift to someone who likes dragons and they could not have been happier. I dont expect it to last very long but very much worth what I spent.
4.0,A little smaller than I'd expected. But it still is very pretty and will be worn.
4.0,"I really like the suit. Based upon the reviews I ordered the XXXL although I'm a US size 12 at 147 lbs. and 5'9&#34;. Bottoms are a little loose but I dont like them skin tight either. The suit covers flaws well but still gives you that two piece  look instead of a &#34;tankini&#34; .  Saw from reviews the top needs to be less revealing for those of us DD. Nothing that a few quick stitches with sturdy thread didn't fix. Had I not had to do the alteration it would have gotten five stars. Bright colors. Cute styling with the all forgivinh rouched bottoms. All in all, I would buy it again."
4.0,The only thing wrong was fabric was kind of heavy sweatshirt material. But a very nice looking shirt.
4.0,Material is not the quality as expected....very light but guess its comfortable
4.0,I like this belt. Easy to use.
4.0,Size up. I bought the red pair which was different that the cheetah pair I bought from the same company. The material is also different. The pockets are awesome. I could fit a wine bottle in it. It does ride up while working out
4.0,My son loves the galaxy patterns. But I have a problem with the stitching coming out. I can easily sow it back up but this shouldn’t happen.
4.0,"Too big for me, but that’s my fault for not measuring. I like the size,  but you need a long neck if you don’t want them to look ridiculous."
4.0,"I live in Colorado where it gets pretty cold and we can have a snow storm at the drop of a dime. I have always wanted something like this to cover my face when I am standing outside with my dogs waiting on them to go potty. It gets pretty cold. I received this in the mail and could not wait to try it on. The fit was not exactly what I expected but that may be because it is a one size fits most. The only thing that I found is that it does not cover the top of my forehead all of the way. My hairline and some of my hair is left exposed which will mean that my head may not be as warm on cold windy days. I believe that my head is normal sized, but it may just be a little to big for this. On the plus side, it is very warm. It is thick and the material feels extremely soft. It did fit well as a beanie though which I liked.  I gave it to my oldest son and it fits him well. When we have our next snow, which should be soon he will get a chance to wear it out in the elements.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"
4.0,"Despite the thickness is shown on the product page, I didn’t read it. It is thin but very strong. The ring edge is tall, get the large diameter ring if you have thick keys, like car keys with the remote buttons all in one piece."
4.0,I really like these sunglasses.  Made well.  The bifocal is bigger than I expected.  They are very easy to read with.
4.0,a nice small decoration
4.0,Like them alot
4.0,"Firstly, I really like this shirt. I've seen the same shirt (probably a bigger brand name) for around $30 elsewhere. But there are a few cons: the color is a bit lighter than the picture, I was expecting it to be more cropped and the alien to be like embroidered or more like a patch. Also the material is nice, but it is pretty thin so you might want to wear a bra or something under it lol. The fit is pretty good though, I'm 5'2 & about 95 lbs. Overall I am happy with this $6 shirt made in China. Oh, AND it came A LOT sooner than the estimated delivery date which was about a month and a half after I placed my order; it actually arrived in about 2-3 weeks. I might (MIGHT) consider buying from this seller again. 3.75/5 stars from me."
4.0,"I went larger just because costumes are always a guessing game. The sweatshirt fit well. It is thinner! So you will need to wear a shirt under it. The skirt and leggings were larger than expected. It's not a bad thing since Halloween can be cool where I'm from. I could wear another layer. The wig wasn't that great, but I figured I'd be able to doctor it, or remove some of the implements and make it work. It's hard to find this costume anywhere so I was happy to get it on time, packaged well!"
4.0,"I like these, I will order more"
4.0,"Overall this is a very decent sweater for the price, though it was a little shorter than I would have liked. While I am taller than average, the pictures makes this look almost tunic-length, which is definitely not the case. The knit is nice overall and the color is true to the picture, and it seems like it would hold up decently well over time."
4.0,"Like: material is comfortable and looks just like the photo. Yes, it’s a shade darker but still pretty. I’m 5’2” and waisted size 28 and got a size medium and it fit well around my waist. The length is JUST to my feet so it looks like a dress but still cute<br /><br />Cons: the material is sheer so make sure you wear a nude undergarment"
4.0,"Fits as expected, its comfortable and definitely would recommend buying it"
4.0,"LOVE: material quality, washability(don't wrinkle like 100% cotton ones, just wash, dry and hang up to use again, no fuss. No silly nose wires.I wear glasses and the nose wore always gets in the way of my glasses sitting on my face... No problems with these and are more breathable, seem not to dog my glasses quite as much(the size I got was a tiny bit big on me tho, so I used ear piece rubbers to be able to adjust the ear size and how they hold on my face. I advise the small ear piece holders/adjusters for any masks which don't come on them. Colors are great to go with different outfits/days. Wish they came in more color options tho!!"
4.0,SOOOOOO SOFT on the inside!!!
4.0,"I love this hoodie but I do see what some other reviews were complaining about. The head hole (for lack of a better word 😂) is a bit tight. It’s annoying because I keep getting foundation around the neck trying to put it on. I still love it and will keep it but it’s just something to note. I am 5’4” 135lbs 34B/32C and ordered a small. It fits well but if I had to order again I would size up to a medium maybe the “head hole” would be bigger. Lol. The small is a tiny bit smaller than some other size small hoodies I own. I wouldn’t go as far to say the body runs small, just a tiny bit more fitted than expected. If you want a roomy fit I would size up 1 size."
4.0,"They're super cute, Fit great too, but they look more like panda bears than kitty cats... I'm still gonna wear them and every thing . I may just embroider some whiskers and more kitty like details myself ."
4.0,"I bought this bag for my daughter, to hold her pointe shoes and their accessories.  It seems to be adequate for that purpose.  The color is nice, and it seems decently made.  I'm not sure I'd want to carry it around by the string, but to hold stuff inside another bag?  Sure.  I probably should have bought some a long time ago for soccer shin guards, etc."
4.0,"The shoes fit and looked great! The only thing that stops me from giving them five stars is that the sole doesn't quite cover the inside of the shoe, so it pinches your feet when you walk. I put some duck tape on it, and now it's all good to go!"
4.0,"I can not wait until our upcoming 80s party to wear these!  Perfect accessories for an 80s costume.  You just need tights or legging and a tee shirt and it can be complete, or you can add and remove items to make it perfect for your style.  Wig is of decent quality, not cheap like the dollar store wigs at Halloween time.  Good quality items and great value for the money!"
4.0,Arrived before it was supposed to. My friend loves it. The hat is slightly too large though and falls down over her face.
4.0,This is a nice lite cover up for the summer.
4.0,"bought this for my 3 year old, the chain did not make it."
4.0,The bodice is a bit short. But the fabric is nice and the price was better
4.0,"Mostly flattering, but the hip pockets exaggerate the hips. You could remove the pockets and see them up, otherwise you'll look wide in the hips esp in photos."
4.0,"I would give it a full 5, if the dress would have raglan sleeves instead of regular... it would make the fitting much more perfect, easy and versatile (my shoulders do not have the wide measurements)."
4.0,Charming little dress!  A bit too long
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because i ordered the hat with the neck shade but got the regular hat. Other than that, the hat is nice."
4.0,Very nice product but way too big for a 7 and 5-year-old.
4.0,My measurements: 36-28-38 1/2<br />I went with a large and I'm glad I did. Alittle loose in the booty as all of them are and a bit of a crotch wedgie but over all I'm pleased and it's comfy.<br /><br />I am normally a medium in clothes- I size up to a large with this company
4.0,This is just as described.  Cute dress.
4.0,I would recommend this to anyone. It is nicely finished and polished to perfection. Works great on the Pandora bracelet.
4.0,Obsessed with this hoodie! Quality seems okay enough especially for how cheap it was
4.0,"Great versatility in this top! Perfect for the gym, or as a bathing suit cover up."
4.0,Pretty color. The backs for the earrings were small and made it hard to put them on.
4.0,Nice pants for the price. Received lots of compliment.
4.0,"Overall, I really do like this industrial. I always get a ton of compliments on it! The tree actually looks like a tree and not a bunch of lines. The problem? It is difficult to remove. The tree is welded in the middle so you have to put it in one side at a time. When I first got it, I had to use a pair of pilers to take of the ends. My ear was irritated for about a week but eventually my skin adapted. I would not suggest for those with a fresh piercing but if you have had your industrial for a while you should be fine!"
4.0,These definitely do what they are supposed to do. Yes they are quite tight but at the end of the day my ankles don't hurt. I'm pregnant and was starting to swell and feel quite sore from being on my feet a lot at work.
4.0,"Fits well enough, but I chose size 7-7.5. I'd say if you need a 7.5, just go up to 8. They're elastic/rubbery so they have some give. Pretty comfortable though. Got a set for my husband and I. Will update if I have any issues."
4.0,"Fits well, wish it was more support for the upper back but I still like it. It does not ride or roll up from the bottom"
4.0,Great besides slightly too big
4.0,"I really like this purse, the only the onIy I would change are the handles they are a little stiff."
4.0,"Purchased these shoes Mid-September. They were the answer to my inability to wear enclosed heel shoes following Achilles’ tendon surgery. I immediately loved them. The open back and the insole were very comfortable. Nice looking shoe as well. But today, Sept 30, I noticed that the elastic on one shoe was falling apart. So disappointed. I haven’t found a way to contact the seller. Maybe they’ll see this and respond."
4.0,"I think this is a really fun print and I like the pockets.  The fabric is super soft and it's really comfortable.  I am a size 12 and ordered an XL in this. My normal size is a Large but I'm curvy so I sized up to get this drapey/tent style fit.  I should have stuck with the size large, although it may not have solved my issue with the dress.  I find it to be too long for the style.  It hits me mid-knees, which as someone who is 5'3"", is not a good length.  The long length, in combination with the tent style, has a dumpy look that doesn't go with the fun, bright pattern.  I think this is best for a tall person.  I'll likely keep it to wear around the house because it is so comfortable."
4.0,Love it just need bigger size xl next one I get
4.0,"The shorts are very comfy and the pattern is cute. Only downside is the white pair is decently see-thru, it's doable but not ideal."
4.0,It seems to be put together OK. The wife said she liked it also.
4.0,"Cute dress but a bit too long for me. For reference, I’m 5’4”, 160 pounds, 36dd bra. I ordered a large. Decent heavy weight material. Not the most flattering cut on me so ended up returning."
4.0,A bit short on the torso.
4.0,"super comfy and GREAT fit, probably the most comfortable leggings out there, but i might return since they are SUPER SHEER. too bad they are so see-through since they fit so nicely. i might just keep these for around the house pants but definitely not something you can wear in public in case you ever have to bend over. if these pants were more opaque it'd be 5 stars"
4.0,"This is a nice, flowing top.  I actually thought it would be more of a thin, summer-weighttop, but it's more a light-weight knit sweater.  I like it but living in FL, will have to ait until fall to wear it."
4.0,Best sports bra I've ever owned. Doesn't stretch out after use which is nice. Only downside is it runs a size small so order one size bigger! I'm a 32E and I ordered a 34E and if fit great. I'm also breastfeeding right now so the zipper is very convenient for that!
4.0,"I use it for carrying my kayak equipment, much easier to carry one nice bag than to juggle paddle, lifevest, anchor, fishing gear, etc."
4.0,"Pretty comfortable and stylish shirt. I like the blue color and strap design. The fabric is a little stiff, which is the reason why I give it four stars only. Hopefully it will get softer after I wash it."
4.0,"Very pretty and looks well alone and with other,  nice length"
4.0,"Really like this dress. Got it for a holiday dinner. As pictured. I'm 5'4 and 117 pounds. Got in Small, fits great."
4.0,"the watch and wristband is everything I wanted. however,the clasp is the worst feature; at first it was very hard to open. Then it was hard to close. In order to release the catch and take the wristband off, I have to slip a barrier (end of a tube of lotion) between the clasp and my wrist; otherwise, it digs and pinches my wrist."
4.0,Thought it was a little more bigger but still works perfect.
4.0,"This is my second Eric Javits hat and this one fits me a little better than my older one, for which I'm pleased.  I have a small head and it's difficult to find hats that fit well.  And I love how you can pack it in a suitcase without worry about crushing."
4.0,Muy cómodo y fresco
4.0,"Too large for my 5'3, 130 lb frame"
4.0,It was a cute shirt but quite large. I ended up having to return it because it was super baggy on top.
4.0,I bought this band to make sure I had a replacement for the brown one that came with my Luminox Field 1800.  It appears well made and the stitching is heavy duty.  It came sealed n plastic to protect the leather from drying out and has a nice heavy duty buckle
4.0,It is a very cute top
4.0,It is very beautiful I order the white shirt but I am size M and I buy it L but it is still very small.
4.0,I liked it very much<br />My grand daughter wears it on special occasions.
4.0,Love this dress it's super cute and flowy.
4.0,Would've been 5 stars but the pouch to keep the glasses in didn't have a pully to close it tightly
4.0,"inexpensive lovely earrings for causal wear, light weight, will make nice stocking stuffer, perfect for ladies of all ages, will be enjoyed by all."
4.0,"I ordered this because my mom has the same one that she bought years ago in store. I looked up the brand and item number and found this, but for some reason this one doesn’t have pockets like my mom’s does, so that’s disappointing. Aside from that it’s great."
4.0,These are absolutely adorable. The only downfall is that they are a bit big for my 3 1/2 year old.
4.0,The material is a little cheap but that's what you get for the price. I used it for a bachelorette party on a yacht and didn't end up wearing it very long nor would ever wear it again. I do like how it scrunches up on the thighs.
4.0,"The Relax Maternity 5720 is mostly made of cotton, which was the attraction point. I got it in black. It is so supportive that can be worn without a bra, which is really a relief. I pair it up with soft leggings and a chunky sweater, and soft boots or mules. This is an item to build the rest of your look around, though you mostly do not see it. It is long, which provides extra help. Despite good support – it is flexible, and it does not constrict you anywhere. The top part is actually very flattering, and when worn with jeans and a nice necklace or a scarf – it is dressy. The fabric is thin, no see-through, at least not in black color.<br /><br />Minus 1 star. I could not ignore the “100% made in Italy” sign, and a couple of design/shape features as well, that definitely said the garment was not Italian, whether made there or not. I am part Italian, and know what I am talking about. How sad, why not make something well, take responsibility, grow reputation. Riding on someone’s coat tales always ends up in a fiasco."
4.0,"I ordered these earrings for myself, specifically because of the backs of the earrings. I very rarely take my earrings out, and I needed earrings that would not poke me when I slept or when l I wore certain headbands. The delivery time was as expected. The packaged arrived in great condition. What I like best about the earrings is they come in 4 different sizes. I have 3 piercings on both lobes, and I like wearing the same earrings for each piercing, but reducing the size of the stud in each piercing. I had no difficulty getting the earrings in my ears. I did have some difficulty putting the backs on, but I have had these types of earrings before so I knew it wouldn't be as easy as standard-back earrings. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would continue to order earrings from this company."
4.0,Comfy but fits small
4.0,Had to give it to my daughter. Too small for me. I am a size 32/34 B and it was too tight. Ordered a small.
4.0,"This dress is one of my favorites, but I would not be comfortable wearing it without a camisole underneath. It has held up well through washing and packs beautifully."
4.0,My daughter is 5 foot 7 and the sleeves were too long for her arms. We ended up making it a short sleeve dress because it was for a school dance and she wanted it short sleeved anyway but she would not have been able to wear the sleeves as made as they covered her hands. Otherwise the dress is adorable and one she can also wear to church. She wears it on the shoulders rather than off and loves it.
4.0,Very cute bathing suit but I'm a 36dd n the top was not covering much...
4.0,These pajama pants are comfortable but too short. I like that they’re all cotton. They are well sewn and the seams are serged. The elastic and drawstring waist is comfortable. The fabric is medium weight. They fit true to size. The pockets are on the small size and my iPhone falls out.<br />I washed both on regular cycle and dried them partially and the black pair shrank a couple of inches and the grey pair about 4 inches. They were decent length before I washed them and now they’re too short. I’ll still wear them since I don’t wear them out anywhere but I don’t like the length now. These would be good for someone 5’2” or under.
4.0,era muy pequeña para la talla
4.0,"I like the cut of this sweater, the brass looking snaps and the ribbing on the bottom and sleeves. The pockets in the side seam sag but I stitched the seam shut and cut them off. Have done so w/ several other sweaters of this same brand. The color is dusty, and not vibrant but I knew that before I ordered. Will not be a sweater that lasts winter after winter, but for the price is good enough. Arrived quickly."
4.0,Go smaller! I bought the recommended size. Fits good up top but the middle and bottom is too large. Looks like M.C. Hammer  pants with all of the slack. But it’s comfortable and good to throw on while working from home during this pandemic.
4.0,Cute for Disney trip
4.0,They work pretty good but come up almost past my knee because I'm short.
4.0,"Very good product, firm control"
4.0,Necklace is gorgeous.
4.0,"Overall good basic sweater. Not as soft as others I’ve ordered, a little scratchy at first. Hoping a few washes will help. Love the oversized sweater for the cold."
4.0,"the ponytail extension makes it a bit back heavy, but the wig looks great!! I just bobby pin the front and it stays on very well!"
4.0,GLASS CASE IS GREAT.  NICE AND STURDY AND GLASSES FIT WELL.
4.0,It is so pretty. It looks exactly like the picture and the quality is great. I also like the travel pouch it comes in
4.0,Cute! Smaller than expected.
4.0,"I am updating my previous review because of the amazing customer service these guys have. They reached out to me and offered to substitute the defective pair of ski goggles I have for a new pair.<br /><br />I was cheap and bought these goggles thinking that I do not need expensive ones since I don't ski that often. HUGE MISTAKE. The goggles fit well, quality is also ok, BUT they fog like crazy. I had to stop by every 3 min to wipe them off. Eventually, I gave up and used my regular sun glasses. Learn from my mistake - don't be cheap."
4.0,Very nice looking shoe.
4.0,I LIKE THE COMFORT NESS OF THEM
4.0,Pretty good straps. Have bought these exact ones couple of times over the years as I misplaced them or left them at the destination.
4.0,"Fit great I am 5 1” 159 lbs I ordered size L and is ok, but isn’t stretching like I thought"
4.0,"I would give 3 ½ stars if I could. Nice soft, flowy shirt, but not as long as I hoped/expected. It is just borderline for me to be able to wear with leggings, as I prefer my &#34;goods&#34; to be covered better. I am 5'3&#34; and 127lbs and ordered the small (and even if the medium was any longer, it would've been way too big and like a maternity shirt.)  I tried the shirt on with the crisscross in the front and the back, and my husband and I both agreed that with it in the front, the shirt look like I had it on backwards - even though the description says it's a front-cross shirt. So I wear it with the cross in the back."
4.0,"I like the fabric, the style...i love it!"
4.0,"So I really like how comfortable this bracelet is. Maybe because it is made a little bigger than similar ones, but it isn't itchy, scratchy, or digging into my skin like other handwoven bead bracelets. I'm not big into multicolored items so I gave it 4 stars. It would be a nice gift for someone that really enjoy handmade artisan gifts. The bag and card that come with it are a nice touch for extra special gifts."
4.0,Fits fine. All the sizes run a little small so I ordered the largest size I could. It is still a little tight but I expected that. Good quality. Good purchase.
4.0,"These are nice little bracelets, I got them for myself and my friends. They are good quality and wont turn your skin green. Unless your wrist are extremely tiny you will have to open it up a bit to get it on, kinda annoying if your not wearing it constantly."
4.0,For my som- he thinks they are cool!
4.0,love the top! It fit great but the bottoms were a little small.
4.0,I ordered this to wear for our Super Bowl party and it was perfect.  It shipped quickly and fit great.  Thanks!
4.0,"I needed a cheap navy polo for an event I had to work.  Great price and it's made well, much better than I expected for the price."
4.0,"Cute, but it's way too big for me. I'm 5'4&#34; and 127#s and a medium is really baggy on me. Most things like this are too small...from other venders. But not this little number. Otherwise it's pretty cute. If you're not trying to hide your curves or bulges, order a size down."
4.0,"A very beautiful piece. Just wish the lace and the chain was closer in color. Other than that, it will go excellent with the outfit I have I'm mind! Thanks"
4.0,"The eye wear looks exactly like it does in the picture. It's great and didn't come with anything bad besides for the folding parts of the glasses. One of them was more bent in so it was tighter on my face than usual. Also, I expected this eye wear to be oversized but it wasn't really oversized for me. Left imprints on my nose as well if I wore it too long which I didn't expect. It's a heavier kind of eye wear for me too.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad but it's not the greatest. I don't think I would buy it again just because it didn't look as great as I thought it would."
4.0,"Pretty bag, the material is very soft. I would give 5 stars but I was sent the wrong colour. I ordered the light brown and recieved a pink bag. I decided to keep the pink one though since it was so pretty. Also, the closure clasp is slightly crooked, though it closes just fine. Overall it's a very nice bag with one minor flaw. Would buy again."
4.0,"The shirt is beautiful. I ordered it for family photos (I’ll update later with pics). The shirt is true to size, even a tad large so keep that in mind."
4.0,"I order an xl because that's what I usually wear. Its very difficult to pull over, so I slipped it on and it was great. It held all the funk it all the right spots. Lol. I've had 4 abdominal surgeries and two babies so I have lots of rolls I want to hide and I was able to wear a dress to church and not feel completely uncomfortable. So this is a win for me!!!"
4.0,Good size however the edges are not smooth.
4.0,Wish they offered more of this brand
4.0,This necklace is really sleek and simple. I like it. My only complaint is that the chain is not very long so it doesn't look good with certain dresses.
4.0,the 1st one  i used ripped at the side seam but so far the rest are good.
4.0,The dress fits perfectly and was very comfortable while I was at work.
4.0,Cute hat but still too large for small heads.
4.0,La altura de la fajara perfecta es es fuerte para la barriga pero el material es suave
4.0,Love it so Nice when dressing casual
4.0,This is a great sneaker colours are vibrant and looks to be of good quality.  I purchase a pair each term for my son since most of these kid shoes are not very durable and cannot be expected to last more than a few months.  This style fits a little closer than other Skechers sneakers in the same size.  Son is 7 wears size 1 and his feet are swimming in his older pair while this one fits him just right and will probably be too tight soon so size up at least half a size when purchasing.
4.0,"They fit well and for the price are great glasses.  My one knock is that thy are really light so I dont know long term how durable they will be,"
4.0,"(reviewed by my wife): I really like the fabric and style of these pants.  But they are way too small.  I am 5'5"", 152 lbs and typically wear a size 10 or medium in pants.  This size medium is way too small in the waist/belly/hip area.  I would recommend going up at least one size."
4.0,"Super comfy. Love it . fit as expected. Only took out one star because the quality is so so, but still a great deal and will continue to order more."
4.0,"Nice fit, light weight material"
4.0,You have to go up 2 sizes otherwise it doesn't fit.
4.0,"I have size 13 EEE feet with a high arch and found the socks were tight, and difficult to put on and take off."
4.0,"He’s at the minimum age for the age range I bought, he weighs as much as a normal baby his age and this is too big on him the shirt is okay, but the pants are too big."
4.0,Four stars because I haven’t actually tried it in cold temps yet. Fit is great. I ordered a small and I am a little under 5 feet and 118 lbs. plenty of room to layer underneath. Only flaw I see is I wish the hood had a drawstring. Very lightweight and packs easily.
4.0,"This is a good looking bracelet. It's a good width and it's not too heavy on the wrist. It's an expansion band which means you slip it over your hand to get it on your wrist.<br /><br />I had a problem with it though because it's too loose around my wrist. I know that it could be adjusted to be smaller by someone who knows how to do it but if it's adjusted to be smaller on my wrist it would not be able to expand enough to fit over my hand.<br /><br />If you don't mind having a loose, dangly bracelet on your wrist, then this is a nice choice for that."
4.0,its beautiful but the ring its just one size
4.0,Fits well and great deal for the $ (size small).  The tie in the back in nice to adjust and it is a great flowly dress for summer.
4.0,"I got a size small and it barely fit my 10 year old, with no room to grow.<br />This is obviously not regular Junior size/women's, it's smaller than junior sizes. So please order 1 size up.<br />I returned it, and got my money back, but did not get the shipping refunded.  I did not re-order because I found another jacket that she loved."
4.0,"Got her smashed up, she's had a hard life. Will keep her though. Package them better please."
4.0,Love the shirt but beware that it runs a bit small. Order a size up.
4.0,These yoga pants are decent. A little thicker than anticipated. Like the color.
4.0,Cute but very cheap quality. Four stars because I got what I paid for.
4.0,"i received sooo many compliments on my dress. Everyone loved it. I'm 5'5 about 200 lbs and I order a 1x. it was bit lose and as the night went on the  off shoulder arm part stretched, causing the top to loosen and expose the cleavage more. I bought this last minute and I thought I could wear without a bra. So, i definitely recommend wearing a good bra!"
4.0,"Perfect! I wanted something simple and cute for the dog days of camp. Just what I wanted. The moon kind of looks like a C, though."
4.0,I love the dress. I’m 5’7 225lbs and I am wearing a XL the only thing I dislike is the line that connect the blue and beige on the arms are tight. I have a high butt so when I walk it rise up a little. Overall I love it
4.0,The necklace as a whole was great but the chain had some brown spots on it. Other. Than that great!
4.0,Overall very pretty!
4.0,It is a Good deal for the price. It Looks like the picture. And got to me before I expected.
4.0,THESE EARRINGS ARE GREAT IN COLOR SIZE AND LENGTH.  LOVE WEARING THEM.  SCURTISS1974
4.0,The links were a bit hard to put back together but looks very sparkly and wears well
4.0,"For a size 2X (I have a 38 inch waist) I'd say this &quot;runs small.&quot; I wish it had pockets and a hook/eye closure at the top, then I'd give it 5 stars. Heavy weight fabric, loads of compliments every time I've worn it."
4.0,The back is very low so I am constantly pulling them up.
4.0,"My daughter liked this very much, but it was not really her style."
4.0,Nice Dress just ran a little small
4.0,"Super comfortable, washes great."
4.0,These fit nicely and have a good weight and compression feel. They allow ease of movement for working out or just running around.  They are a tad short waisted so wearers with longer torsos be wary as they won’t sit as high on the hip as the picture shows.
4.0,"I ordered these socks for my three year old, who is just growing into size 8 shoes. I got the size that says ""Shoe Size: 4-10"", but that size description is inaccurate. It should say AGE 4-10. At least she'll grow into them soon.<br /><br />That said, they're soft and cute, and my kid wanted to sleep in them that night, so I'll call it a win."
4.0,"It's smaller than I expected, but still wearable.  Great color!"
4.0,"Look good, and feel good. they arrived with a little bit of the veneer on the frame peeling off which was a little disappointing though i was able to cut it off and no one will notice (though i will always know its there) but no biggie. good price, good look, good times."
4.0,"i lost 50 lbs, and am not used to shopping for my new size, lol i love it, its flowy, but i couldve totally got 2 sizes smaller and been happy too!"
4.0,"It was much more narrow than expected, but there is a good amount of stretch. Quite bulky on the neck when not being worn on the face. They’re light and thin so very breathable and comfortable when worn on the face."
4.0,Nice gloves! Happy with the product!
4.0,"Solid 4 star shirts. I have bought my husband many of them for work and we will keep buying. The only reason they aren't a 5 star is that the ones we have purchased have a tendency to lose buttons. It's pretty easy for me to give them a quick reinforcement when we buy them though, so definitely not a deal breaker. They wash well and hold their color better than most. I wish they had colors in stock more consistently, but that's just because I'd like to buy a wider range of colors. All in all, I definitely recommend these."
4.0,Not sized well sleeves to long
4.0,This device is needed if you want to put on bracelets.  It is a very big helper.  It isn't fancy but works just like you want it too.
4.0,Really beautiful blouse.. arrived 2 weeks earlier and i love it.. the only things i wasn't expecting was the color being a little lighter than it looks in the pictures. I thought it would be like a wine red but other than that i love it..
4.0,My girls always get this in backwards because they can’t tell which way is the front quickly. There is no tag (so no itching) or design change to signal front. Otherwise this is a great leotard.
4.0,"Very warm sweater, but for me it was a bit baggy."
4.0,"I am 5’1” and 105 pounds and the small is super snug! It is stretchy so it will fit better than you think when you first open your package. I can wear it, but I may try to size up next time. I bought the brown (rust?) color and it’s really pretty. Definitely makes you feel good about working out! I will order other colors!"
4.0,The dress is beautiful. The only think the small is big.  I have to take to get Taylor.
4.0,"It's cute. Kind of expensive for the size, but I like it."
4.0,It is a good size for the price.  I really like it.
4.0,"Folding them isn’t difficult, but the stitching on the little envelope that holds them isn’t great on a couple of them. The stitching on the bags themselves appears to be holding fine, so I’m just gonna keep using them."
4.0,I like the way the necklaces look and feel but I didn't measure correctly. I really needed a20 -22 inch. I still can use the one's I bought and they are pretty for my Crystals.
4.0,"This outfit is super comfortable but like other reviews have mentioned, it is not squat proof. If you have any kind of butt at all, it might be see through without squatting. The bra is super comfortable and supportive. The straps are adjustable and thick"
4.0,"Very nice. The only issue is that the photo and dimensions I looked at before purchase actually resulted in a smaller bag than I expected (and that makes it a bit of a problem for my lawyer-husband, who needs more room for legal-sized files and stuff he carries) but for the price, it's OK, as long as you don't carry an overload or anything too heavy. (The straps are not strongly-connected). It won't last forever but it should last for a few years, at least."
4.0,These seem really dura6and comes with a lot of them. I worn them for the first time and they did hurt my ears after a couple hours but it did keep my glasses up. I think if I adjusted them it would feel more comfortable.
4.0,"I ordered an xxl as I wasn’t sure what I could wear as I’m normally a xl but sometimes need bigger due to meds I’m on. But knew if it was to big for me it would fit my husband. (I’m 5 ft 3in and from 190 to 240 lbs) it swallowed me sleeves to long, etc although I could put it on as an emergency case. But my 5 ft 9 in 315 lb husband it fits perfect, and actually isn’t tight or big “just right”.... the texture wasn’t super soft but wasn’t itchy or anything either. If I hadn’t bought another type for me I would by this in a smaller size for me."
4.0,"The dress itself is so cute and seems to be well made, I'm 5'8"" and weigh about 190 and I purchased a large which fit my body but was WAY too short, totally gonna wear this as a top cause like I said, it's a super cute dress."
4.0,I loved the brass material and comfortable
4.0,"Overall it is a slightly large/loose fitting cotton dress shirt. Dont expect a tight fitted muscle type shirt. The haze green is a great looking sage tone green that looks more green in more light, more grey in dim light. It is lightweight and comfy and will be great on a hot day in the sun. The clean lines of the stripes add a crisp dressy look in a summery styled garment. The only issue I have is that it is called a cotton linen dress shirt in the listing, but it does not have any linen content at all. It is 100% cotton without any actual linen fibers."
4.0,Love these pjs. They are very soft. Fight is true to size.
4.0,"very pretty. glow in the dark paint (or whatever) is a little unimpressive, but it works. i also use it with felt circles as an essential oil necklace."
4.0,"I never get my dog mom charm wet but it still tarnished. If you might get it wet it might not last long. It's really cute, I kept mine."
4.0,My son is a slim tall 9-year-old. I bought the medium of these pants and they're still very loose in the waist for him. He cannot wear them without a belt but they seem to work with the belt
4.0,"I like that it's super comfortable however, it runs small and is really thin material."
4.0,"This hat is cute. The fabric is thin, so it doesn’t hold it’s shape well. I’m going to use spray starch on it and then shape it better. I think it will work."
4.0,Purchased for my daughter and she loved them.
4.0,"The fit is a little strange, not sure if it's because I should have ordered a size down or if it's just cut a bit strange, but I still like to wear it. I wear a one piece jumpsuit underneath or a tank dress because it's thin."
4.0,"I am glad I read the reviews. I wear an 8 1/2 to 9 shoe. I ordered a 10 to 11 slipper and they are still just a slight bit too small, but I like them so I will keep them."
4.0,"This wallet has been a pleasure to use.  Like all products that are new, there is always room for improvement, in this case very little.  I've through a few wallets in my lifetime, usually your traditional bi-fold wallet, and the closest I've ever gone to this is a clasp-type-wallet.  Here are a few things I noticed with this wallet, hopefully it helps you make make up your mind on whether its the right one for you or not:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- cards are sealed and if dropped, less likely of falling off like a deck of cards<br />- RFID Protected, though I've never really tested it, its an extra peace of mind in todays society.<br />- Holds more than 7 cards, so long as you can close it with a click, its secure.  I got as many as 9 in there, and you can also use the slots to store money instead of outside.<br />- Money clip/band is secure for my use (my money hardly moved)<br />- not waterproof (no visible seal) but crush proof (I wouldn't run it over with a vehicle though)<br />- plastic holding cards feel sturdy enough and they flap open to display cards for easy removal.<br /><br />Now for the:<br />Cons:<br />- somewhat bulky (feels like a semi fat wallet) and does not bend in your pocket<br />- you need to constantly pull it out when driving or sitting unless your pants are extra baggy.<br />- money is easily visible and holder probably won't hold more than 5 bills folder without them slipping out.<br />- for now, just one color, and if anyone else has the same kind, you might have to open their wallet to see if its yours, would be helpful to put some kind of marker, or open window to display an ID.<br /><br />So far, during my first week or so of use, it has been very reliable for me, and I'm giving it 4 stars.  The biggest thing for me when deciding to get a wallet is whether it will probably stand the test of time like everybody else who gets attached to their wallets till they're full of holes.  I think this one will.  The closing hinge is easy to open and close, plus it closes on a solid bump that doesn't break with content opening.  Good for me I leave my wallet in the car and only take it when I can't use my phone to pay.  Best part, its big enough not to get lost but still small enough to fit in your pocket.<br /><br />I have been provided with the product by SHARKK in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,super cute but white parts get dirty
4.0,The material is a little thin.  These are more to wear with a long shirt or dress NOT with a short shirt.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"I thought that these were really cute; I liked the colors and I liked how I looked in them. They’re also clearer than a few other pairs I tried on. They were a bit tight though, causing a headache a few minutes after I put them on. It was a disappointment to have to return them. I do have a wide head and feel that these would work well for others."
4.0,"Cute dress, but the bottom is completly shear and the split goes all the way to your belly button so you defiently need a slip sew together"
4.0,Shorts r really rough
4.0,"I love this dress and the material. I wore to a day wedding in a humid city and the fabric was breathable. The skirt was lovely - I loved the swing to it. I received compliments on the dress, and I felt good in it. I will say, for those with bigger chests, this may be a snug fit. I'm a c/d and had to safety pin buttons for reinforcement. I also wish the sash was sewn or or had loops."
4.0,"not bad, not SUPER GREAT. It was good overall. I got it in good time and stuff. It was a bit larger than I thought it'd be, but that's probably just me."
4.0,"I actually needed 17 1/2 by 34 but that size was not available, otherwise the shirt was okay."
4.0,"A little narrow across the base of the toes (widest point of my feet) so consequently cannot wear them for long periods of time...<br />Otherwise, true to fit and fabulous!"
4.0,It’s a knock off version of Kbethos vintage hats and I love it other than it does not fit like the originals do. Not near as comfy and don’t like the way it sits on my head.
4.0,Looks  great and very light weight  but will know more after my trip to Dubai
4.0,Great boots! Heel was higher than expected and with my foot problems I could not comfortably wear them.  I did return the item but the boots were excellent quality and would recommend them if you like a higher heel!
4.0,Was slightly big for medium i’m usually size 4-6. I took it on an Iceland trip. I had no problems with it falling down using it hiking or when wet. Resists light rain pretty well but not downpours. Kept me very warm worth every penny.
4.0,Very cute but quality is a little cheap
4.0,"Wore this for my sorority initiation, it was perfect. Good quality & for well. I’m a curt girl & white can be unforgiving, but it looked good!"
4.0,I liked item so well I ordered another..I have been looking over 3 months for shoelaces
4.0,"Took a bit of time to polish the brass earrings, but they became shiny again and look new!"
4.0,"My son runs everywhere and is really hard on shoes. These held up really well seem to be really comfortable. The only criticism (after two pairs, we just bought the same shoe in the next size up) is that the velcro is the first to go. If they could fix that, they'd be five stars."
4.0,"I saw reviews saying these run small, so for my daughter who is sometimes an 8, sometimes a 10, I ordered an 8. The length of the pants was okay for now (zero growing room) but the waist and hips were tight. The shirt wasn't nearly as long it is on the girl in the picture. I didn't love the fabric of the pants - I thought it felt stiff and a little cheap, but it was too late to change our pajama look for the rest of the family, so I just exchanged these for a bigger size. She rolls the waistband of the 10s and they're perfect. And after I washed them, the pants softened up a lot and now we really like them. The shirt isn't scratchy at all."
4.0,Un poco pequeño.
4.0,"I didn't know what to expect from a product like this since I haven't owned anything similar. They feel like standard cotton briefs, but a bit thicker and with more structure. I can feel the absorbent material in the panty area, it is thin and comfortable but I am aware it's there. Reminds me of wearing a foam type of panty liner, but built in. I could hear the foam faintly rustling when there was no other noise, like in my apartment. They tend to ride up in the back, but that might just be me. The fabric feels like it holds me in and is fairly comfortable. I tested the absorbancy of these briefs by pouring a teaspoon of water on the panty area. The water just sat there and seemed to take about 15 seconds to absorb, which makes me nervous. The good thing is that it didn't leak through to the other side at all, and the outer layer of fabric remained dry and never got wet. I hand-washed them and hung them to dry. I'm impressed with how they work and will use these as backup protection."
4.0,Replace it for bigger size.
4.0,Super cute but I had to shrink the skirt. Wish the buttons were functional.
4.0,Im happy with my purchase.
4.0,"good quality, shipped next day..equal to glasses that cost much more"
4.0,"Super sexy.<br />But when Daddy was tightening the back to his liking, one of the eyes popped... so that ruined the night and caused an outfit change"
4.0,"I love the fit of these pants.  They are super comfortable, but look nice enough to wear out doing errands or to informal gatherings.  The reason for the 4 star rating is that the first time I put on the pants, one of the grommits at the waist band fell off.  I am concerned that the fabric may not be finished properly or will fray quickly and not last nearly as long as expected.  Let us hope I am wrong.  I am 5'5&#34;, 130 pounds and ordered a size large, and they are just right, not too tight or loose."
4.0,better than expected and fits good
4.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother.  I usually get her more of costume jewelry type stuff that I know will go with her outfits, but I had a little extra $$ this year and wanted to get something a little nicer.  This is certainly nice, but the image presented is most definitely a close-up.  The whole thing is very small (could be considered tiny).  Not upset, just thought it might help others to know."
4.0,"I ordered the size small. I am 5’1” and weigh about 113 lbs. they fit well, just the pant legs are a little long but it’s not a big deal because you can scrunch them or just pull them up. I didn’t realize they had the seam on the butt when I ordered these so I’m not the biggest fan of the look. I feel like it kind of looks like a fart is being sucked in 😅 but other than that they’re okay. The material is also good and I got the black ones with the pattern so they’re not see through."
4.0,"Super cute dress, good quality for the price!"
4.0,A little bulbous looking at the toe. Comfortable fit though.
4.0,great dress for the money!
4.0,"Good hat, very warm"
4.0,"These are really pretty and a great value. My only complaint is on the bars that have a design/gem in the middle of the bar, you cannot move them so you can get the bar in your ear. So basically I can’t use half of them which sucks."
4.0,"Nice vest, seems to be good quality and details are nice. Seems to run true to size."
4.0,"Good warm gloves, but much thicker than I had thought. So I use them when I go out for a walk on a winter's day, but don't wear them driving."
4.0,a good fit.
4.0,Looks like the photo. A little more shear than expected and will need ironing/steaming to unwrinkle.
4.0,Had my head been bigger I would have given it 5 stars. Quality is good. Stitching is tight. Material is nice. But it is slightly big. So I'll avoid very windy days.
4.0,Size is great for smaller ear lobes.
4.0,"Too large and baggy. While this may not be a problem for some, It just looks plain goofy. Great quality and build however. I would suggest LAPD pants for anyone looking for a better fit and better size options.k"
4.0,"I wear compression stockings to help with my varicose veins and circulation. These socks fit well, they are not overly tight at the top, the weight is nice for wearing in boots, shoes slide on nicely over the fabric.  I would recommend giving these a try if you are in the market for affordable compression stockings."
4.0,Fits the occasion.  Will order again if I need another color.
4.0,"I bought this set for one time use at my wedding. Navy is one our colors. If you want utterly perfect pearls, then expect to pay quite a bit more than this. At this price point, the set is actually a little better than I expected. The necklace's blue pearls are very dark, but do look blue because most are a true blue, which is in line with our Navy color. The earrings however, are not like the necklace and the blue pearls are definitely black. This is not an issue, I'll just save the earrings for a different occasion."
4.0,"I like it, but it's not really a sports bra and it's a little stiff. I am 34C/D and if you do much bending over you'll get a nip slip! Definitely need to wear a shirt over it if you're out in public."
4.0,Pretty bracelet. Closure is better than the clasp used on many of these types of bracelets.
4.0,"I bought this sweater to wear at my family's annual Ugly Sweater Party. It's our thing. Everyone, including the youngest kids, dresses up in the most bizarre, ugly sweaters we can find. Well, I'm cheap. I didn't want a sweater I would wear once then pack away until next year. I bought something I'd actually like to wear out! I love the pattern on this sweater. It's a little ghoulish, but that suits my nature. It's very, very soft and looks great with leggings. The only thing is you have to be very careful washing it. I would suggest washing it on its own because it tends to pill. But I have gotten lots of wear, and compliments on my stranger sweater."
4.0,"Great skirt and really nice price. Love the fit. The belt was extremely long for me, but I figured out a way to make it stylish and work."
4.0,"Had to have mine custom-made due to my broad shoulders, seller was excellent with getting it made to my measurements. Arrived just in time, too. Would've rated 5⭐, but that might've seemed fake."
4.0,Got this dress on green it nice. A little disappointed with the bow accent but hey still a nice dress.
4.0,"Great gift, soft and silky. My mom loved it."
4.0,Cute shirt and good quality. Sleeves aren’t as long as depicted in picture. But overall good buy!
4.0,It fits great and was very flattering. However I returned it because the cut is so wide that it will show your bra straps. Wearing a camisole underneath doesn't help as it will just show the camisole straps. Good quality though.
4.0,"I wish the neckline was not so high but it is a really cute shirt! Flattering for my skin tone. The strings are kind of hard to tie without getting too much of the sleeve in there but it's not a big deal. I'm 5'11"", 150 lbs."
4.0,Very cute... runs a little big or it could be my daughter is a little small for her age. Material is soft. Can’t wait for her to wear this 😍
4.0,This dress fits perfectly and I love the color!
4.0,The quick easy process I went through to get what I was looking for. In this case it was a 3/4 length sleeve baseball shirt. The shirt that was shipped to me was exactly what I wanted.
4.0,These fit perfect.  They block the sun without making things too dark.  They look nice and feel comfortable.  The frames feel durable and strong.
4.0,"This tee was a gift for my Stranger Things obsessed tween. She really likes it. The sizing is a bit small, thankfully I sized up when ordering."
4.0,The outfit is adorable and even came with 2 headbands (pink and purple). The shirt was a little big.
4.0,I was really hoping the color was as in the picture but indeed it is beige. I was really debating to exchange it for a different color but i will keep it.<br />The fabric is cheap. It really looks elegant in the picture but the quality is not the same. It also is above the knees and I am 5'6&#34; tall. I will wear it anyway.
4.0,This was really cute for the price.
4.0,Nice shirt.  True to size chart.  Nice fabric.  Actually piece is just like picture!!!
4.0,"At first sight this watch looks REALLY EXPENSIVE. The color scheme makes it look like a Ralp Lauren watch. I loved it. However after wearing it in a 5ft deep pool for about 20 minutes no diving, I noticed there was water inside and the watch was advertised as waterproof for 30m. I'm very disappointed.  For the price and style however I will be reordering a new one and not test the waterproofing.<br />The watch looks impressive but just don't do water with it."
4.0,Nice dress however the zipper is not strong enough. Fit as expecte. It does have a strong smell
4.0,"Easily one of my favorite pieces. Really cute not as heavy as I'd have liked it to be but, for the price it's a great buy. it is a little boxy if you're looking for a shapely dress this might not be the one for you."
4.0,"fits standard multi-pronged swatch, most watch guys don't carry swatch bands, it's a unique, speciality item.  nice and flexible, plain black."
4.0,I wear these to school often. They fit beautifully and can go from the classroom to an evening out easily!
4.0,"This thing is very well made, only gripe is all the inner padding feels like a regular jansport backpack.. cheap synthetic inner lining. Other than that it's a beauty."
4.0,"Super cute definitely liked it. Just wish I would have gotten a medium not a large the large had to much extra fabric around my stomach area! For reference I'm 5'2 around 135-145#, 27in waiste, 34 around my bust so a medium for sure. I reccomend getting those sticky breast covers for this! The material is the soft almost like an under armour."
4.0,Great purse. Held up well.
4.0,Bit stiff.  Not as comfy as hoped but looks great and was purchased for that reason.
4.0,nice light weight jacket.
4.0,Awesome ! For an inexpensive pair of sunglasses they perform well.
4.0,"Not the best quality, overpriced."
4.0,Brought this product for my daughter she's very happy it's all the things she needs sent it to her and Wisconsin and she sent me a happy face on my phone
4.0,Had hoped that the fabric would have been just a tad thicker but other than that it is fine. Have not washed yet so hopefully it wont change shape!
4.0,"I believe the most value I can provide in a review will be through pictures, so I've attached some images of how the dress looks on my body. For reference, I usually wear a size 10. Here are some thoughts I have about the dress:<br /><br />Fit:<br />Fits tight. As other reviewers have mentioned, that means the dress will show every imperfection. I think it's therefore best-suited for people smaller than I am, but I think it looked decent on me (and will therefore look decent on other people of my size.)<br /><br />Appearance:<br />The color has a nice hue. Some of the ruching is nice, while in other areas it looks a bit like wrinkles (see in pictures.) I LOVE the little cape thing!! It's the detail that drew me to the dress.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />As long as you're comfortable with how the dress looks on you, you should be comfortable in this dress. The fabric feels nice and the dress is long enough that you don't need to worry about flashing anyone.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great dress with some small flaws and it should work well for most people.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a discounted product in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"When received, the top was a bit (ok a lot) too long, but I had hope that once washed it would shorten. Thank goodness I was right, because the other option is that it would become more narrow, which would not have been good. It now fits perfectly and I am toying with the idea of getting another one."
4.0,It is a very lovely bathrobe.  I liked the color I finally purchased.  It was a little large for my petite frame and I was hoping it would shrink after washing. It did not shrink as much as I would have liked it too.  Still glad I purchased it.
4.0,"Purchased 3 pack in white, size 4 for my 5y/o son. Overall, I am satisfied with this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good price<br />Fit is slim (or fitted) and looks nice on<br />Fabric is soft and comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fabric is thinner than expected, especially the collar<br /><br />Again, considering the price, this was a good purchase and met our needs. These work perfect when layered over a white tee, even in our cold climate. I do wish the fabric was a bit thicker and that the collar was sturdier, but they serve their general purpose (school uniform). White is a challenging color to keep clean, so I prefer the value of these (3 shirts for $19.99) over a thicker polo that costs closer to $15 each."
4.0,One came broke but I only wear one at a time anyways
4.0,A bit large and stretchy at the top
4.0,"This top is very cute. You will need a strapless bra to wear with it. It is really flattering the way it wraps around your neckline and shoulders. It is a beautiful deep red color. It is a thin soft material.  I am 5’7” and 195lbs. I wear a size 14 in pants. I wear a large in shirts and 40DD in bras. I ordered a XL and it was definitely too big. So I would recommend ordering a size down. The snaps on this body suit are plastic and you can actually just step into this body suit without needing to snap it. Despite the sizing, I would definitely recommend this very flattering body suit."
4.0,"This ring was very pretty and fit my real diamond engagement ring perfect. It runs small so I am returning it for a bigger size. I ordered a 7, which is my size, but I need a 7.5 for this ring."
4.0,I like the outfit and wore as clothing instead of pj’s. Material is all seasonal I think. Just have to adjust the shorts a tad bit inseam to low for both pj’s and regular wear.
4.0,"Really nice, however too large for earrings. Will repurpose into a necklace."
4.0,"I'm 5'7 with a long torso, somewhat curvy. Size small fits good with some extra room around stomach area.  Nice material, but a little see through. Hits below knees which is what I was hoping for. Pockets! Gotta love pockets!"
4.0,"This is a great hoodie for Spring or Fall for those cool mornings and evenings.<br /><br />I washed it in cool water and hung on a clothes hanger to dry in my laundry room.<br /><br />Even after washing, this sweatshirt was true to size.  I'm not sure if it would shrink if placed in the dryer since it was not advised.<br /><br />The fabric is really soft and comfy.  It is lightweight so you'd want to layer a bit as it gets colder but it's the perfect weight for Fall.<br /><br />I ordered a Large and it fits great.  For reference I'm a 36D with a 40"" bust.  I'm also around 150lbs, depending on how much pizza I've eaten.  LOL<br /><br />This is a nice addition to my wardrobe and I highly recommend.<br /><br />I hope this helps you."
4.0,"Honestly the material was much better than I thought and it fits great, however there are 2 things wrong with it. 1st the zipper gets stuck and 2nd the pockets are way too high up. The pockets should be much lower."
4.0,"Groupon had a set like this for what they say was like 70%+ off. So I'm looking over the site, reading the details, etc and am about to pull the trigger from Groupon because it says it's an extremely good price and I've wanted to get a set like this for my wife who only wears jewelry occasionally... so I didn't need a super upscale set of pearls.<br /><br />So after searching on line for a long time and reading info on freshwater vs. salt water, pearl size, strand knotting, etc, I was ready to start price checking for a set in this size, color and feature range.<br /><br />Tons of websites sell them, all almost identical, relatively close in price, some with shipping costs, some without.<br /><br />These on Amazon were exactly what I was looking for, arrived fast, free shipping, strand is knotted, good size, nice looking, consistent pearl size, packaged well in jewelry box with bag and information, and priced better than the ""fantastic"" deal on groupon.<br /><br />And of course my wife liked them (and has no idea how much pearls cost) so I'm sure she thinks they were much more expensive than they actually were. Win win win situation."
4.0,i ordered by the measurements and should have gone with a medium.  Will return this one and reorder.
4.0,"works good,  could be a little wider to fit my Peltor electronic earmuffs"
4.0,"This one fits my 10 year old girl, very flexible."
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): I love the lime green color of the blazer I got.  The blazer has a classic style and drapes well.  The blazer is fully lined.  It is good quality for the price.<br /><br />I typically wear a size ten in blazers and ordered the medium (8/10).  It is slightly too snug.  I think the large would fit better.
4.0,This is very cute and comfortable .  I hope it hand washes well!
4.0,I absolutely LOVE this thing! I get so many compliments and it is very comfortable. My only issue is that it is a little difficult to un-attach and reattach to the Fitbit itself. But overall it is great!
4.0,Cute stuff!
4.0,"I really liked this dress; please note though, the dress is pretty low cut. The picture within the post is the exact product, and it is true to color. I only give three stars because the seem in the front does not have the pattern match. However, the price is very decent for the product."
4.0,Have not had a whole week. But fit nice and definitely see an improvement.
4.0,They were exactly what I was expecting!  Beautiful earrings.
4.0,I actually love these socks! They’re super soft and really comfortable. The only thing I would change is the elastic area on my ankle. It is a little tight.
4.0,I have my conch punched at a 2 and wanted to get some good quality tunnels to wear in them and bought two sets and once i got them I realized they are a little bigger. Pretty disappointed but it could’ve been me misreading sometimes but i swore they said 6mm. Anyways they are great quality but if your looking for a 2g just keep in mind its 6.5mm and not 6mm.
4.0,"Very cute I wore it for a halloween festival at my school. I received a lot of compliments. It does shed, so dont wear black! It is also very hot!"
4.0,Nice soft material  (like a liquid tee shirt) and great design so you can relax in them. Worth every penny.
4.0,"My daughter is slim and I had to take in the sides. After playing in it outside after the event, it was pretty torn up. For the money, it is good for one use and glad I did not spend a ton on something too fancy that won’t get worn again."
4.0,I'm sure this dye is great and so I'm giving it four stars.  The tint did not come even close to what I was seeking and so it had no use for me.
4.0,"The holders seemed to be well made. I had to trim the sides and end of the 10 page to fit it into my wallet. Otherwise, very satisfactory."
4.0,Very cute. Four stars because the pockets make the skirt hang a little weird. Also it's a little low cut and needs a jacket to be work appropriate.
4.0,nice sunglasses but too big
4.0,"This is a very sweet Trio of necklaces it is a bit on the ""goldish"" side but for the price I paid it's very nice looks great with v-neck sweaters!"
4.0,great deal. i like these.. although i do think they are a bit large n wide. i wear 7.5 but could had and wished i bought a 7.. oh well.. its wearable.. but w the pointed toe these tend to make your feet look larger.. but decently priced so cant complain.. the back zipper also seems cheap. its very difficult to zip up & down.. 1st thing i noticed. doubt theyll last long. ill prob avoid the zipper n unlace them each time to make them last
4.0,"Order a size up! I washed this in the machine and line dried it, and it shrink by about one size (was slightly big to begin with so it worked out...)"
4.0,Fit great and quality was good...
4.0,I like it still.
4.0,"Darker green than pictured, great belt."
4.0,This costume is really nice. Well made of decent fabric & a perfect match to Dorothys costume. I usually make my kids costumes for dress up but this one I decided to buy. The cost was affordable & the sizing accurate.
4.0,"This is a very sturdy, well made bag. My own complaint is it smells like chemicals and even after washing it I can’t get rid of the smell!"
4.0,This item makes a great gift.
4.0,Fits as shown in the picture.  Love the fabric and it doesn't look cheap.
4.0,"There are pros and cons to these. First, they are super cute and sparkly! I was going to use them as a monroe, but the balls are wayyy too big. So instead, i used an old hoop lip ring and put the ball on the end and used it as a lip ring. It's still cute! But if you planned on wearing these as a monroe, i would not recommend them!"
4.0,"Purchased this on January 2015, and i gotta say this worth every penny i spent. I was looking for a simple, understated travel kit with no extra compartments or embossed logo on the exterior, and this is exactly what i want.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Feels and smells like genuine leather, smooth leather. (It's better to use leather care lotion once in a while as mine has started to show some creases, probably due to hot weather)<br />- Neat and strong stitching along the bottom, the opening, and the inner artificial fabric (see photos)<br />- Bottom material is made of waterproof artificial fabric, wide and hard<br />Cons:<br />- I wish the inside pouch were slightly bigger, with a zipper so stuff won't fall off, and can store more stuff<br />- Holds less and more expensive than my Nautica travel kit (see photos)<br /><br />Overall, it's a great product, and with little ocassional care i'm sure this will lasts for years."
4.0,They were really large and didn't look right on my face. I've tried on a ton of sunglasses in the sunglasses hut and stores and never experience such large sunglasses like these.
4.0,"If you’re looking for a pair of fashion-forward summer jeans at a great price, these are perfect. They feel great (with just the right amount of stretch), they’re super soft, and the wash of the denim is spot-on for trendy spring/summer looks. For me, they’re ALMOST perfect… I love them, but at 42 they’re just a little TOO skinny for me. For guys in their 20s and 30s, these are the perfect skinny jean - at a killer price."
4.0,"I like these socks, and they stay up for the most part, but still have occasional sock slippage ...but then I haven't found any no show socks that will actually stay up all the time.  Good purchase for the cost"
4.0,Came in good condition. Really good product and it’s the perfect size.
4.0,The children love these shoes. They are cute and they say that they are very comfortable.
4.0,These fit my 3 year old.  The frames fit his little face.  He is able to play with them on so they don't seem to effect his vision.
4.0,"I would rate 5 stars but the squid part came off while i was at the pool, lost it and havent found it.really good necklace though and is good for the price, i guess just don't go swimming with it, but if i was just being stupid then 5 stars!"
4.0,They are good but the pentacle part of the earring keeps falling off from the back. So i had to fix them myself.
4.0,Not as flowy as the picture shows. Definitely go a size up
4.0,Fits real good. Very lightweight and durable
4.0,"Really cute and the perfect size, I wore my 24-7 and it broke in my sleep one night. Its an easy fix I just haven't gotten around to it. Overall a good bracelet but kinda cheap."
4.0,"I like this pendant, it has a good size and thickness and the detail is pretty accurate."
4.0,"This velour set is really comfortable, and nice for lounging around the house.  It has survived my washer and dryer without any problems.  I do turn the pieces inside out as suggested.  There hasn't been an undue amount of fiber left in the dryer trap from these.  But the set does have some shortcomings.<br /><br />I usually wear a size large in clothing like this.  The extra large I got fit well on top, more like a large than an extra large.  The bottom has very wide legs that aren't especially flattering on me, especially because I'm short.  The sleeves and the legs are much too long for me, and I have to roll them up.  This isn't so bad on the sleeves, but the legs are cuffed, and rolling them looks kind of weird.  The fabric right above the cuff is pretty wide, so it balloons out.  Tall people probably won't have this problem.  And  because of the cuffs, it is not as easy to change the length as it would be if the sleeves and legs were just hemmed.  I'm not going to bother trying that.  To me, it seems the top size doesn't quite match the bottom size.<br /><br />The nap of the velour is fairly short, but it is soft.  So far, I haven't had any problems with the metal zipper or with the hoodie cord.  But rolled sleeves and all, it is comfortable."
4.0,"It's cute, it's cheap and it's comfortable to wear.<br />It feels a smidge loose, but I don't mind.<br /><br />I prefer the weight and feel of these verusus the more &#34;substantial&#34; sunnies."
4.0,though it was a different print. was disappointed but this print is fine.
4.0,"Came fast, just as we expected.  Good size, not too big like some of the lenses out there."
4.0,It was packaged good and fit well .Just the blue on it is lighter then in the picture
4.0,Just as promised. My girlfriend loved it. 4/5 because I expected it in a box :)
4.0,Did lose color throughout use
4.0,I like this a lot.  It is really helpful for close up work or looking at collectibles like coins or stamps.
4.0,"Dress was nice, but because of my large bust I ordered an x large instead of a large, and it was too big so I had to return. It is a very nice and comfortable dress."
4.0,It looks just like advertised. On time delivery. Worth the price. It makes a good gift
4.0,The necklace arrived in a reasonable time and in good condition. I found this necklace to be a bit too heavy and left my neck a bit sore subsequently. It does look as shown in the photos and has been worn 3 times and is still in good shape with no signs or rust it breakage.
4.0,"I ordered this necklace like a month ago, the delivery took too long. However, I love the necklace! I love my country, this benefits my way of showing my pride."
4.0,Material not as expected but neatly finished and fits perfectly.
4.0,The dress is shorter than I anticipated and form fitting.
4.0,It shrunk a little in the wash. It was already a little smaller than I wanted. But Cute shirt.
4.0,Absolutely amazing  i mean all that i was hopping for...besutifull time piece.i love it
4.0,Great product for the price...
4.0,"Love it, looks just like the image!  I took off a star because the small pocket zipper doesn't open and close smoothly, which I guess could be an asset to prevent anything being easily stolen from it while walking. Also, it is smaller than the image makes it appear. I assumed it would fit my binder, but it does not. Overall, I'm still very happy with it."
4.0,I really like them. Ordered grey and they are mostly black. But fits great
4.0,Great band! It is very comfortable and the color was exactly as pictured. Would definitely purchase more colors of this band.
4.0,"I workout pertty hard. I lift weights and do hiit workouts as well. I look for leggings that are going to hold everything in place, squat proof and sweat proof. These are amazing, but I only gave it 4 stars bc it is not sweat proof."
4.0,Pretty floral dress perfect for this summer . Is what i really expected on it and arrive on time . Is come with a belt that great you can make it tight on your waist really fashionable good looking dress and comfy to wear i like this dress. I give it 4 star because the fit is lit.loose big on me but overall really nice dress.
4.0,Very cute and it coveeed my baby bump well. The material is just a bit too thin.
4.0,"This product refined the definition of ""personal heater"" works great and USB charger is an add-on bonus"
4.0,Beautiful earnings.  the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are very heavy.  Got lots of compliments on them.
4.0,Polarize well good clarity light a bit tight on the bridge of my nose
4.0,It was exactly what I ordered and needed.
4.0,"2 week review: seems to be real leather, very comfortable, my 13 mo old loves it"
4.0,"It's so nice ,and I like the material . Nice quality"
4.0,"These are made from very thin material, but what would you expect for the price?"
4.0,"I love this dress, just a bit small for my taste."
4.0,"This dress may be true to the size, but its made out of stretchy material, and I think that makes it a little larger."
4.0,"Bought this for my son to wear to formal and I thought the quality was pretty good for the price. The bow tie is a bit on the small side. I was thankful that the cummerbund adjusted to a 29&#34; waist size. I also bought another set that came with a pocket square and was less expensive on Amazon, but the cummerbund was way too large even when adjusted to the smallest size so I kept this set instead. Good value and quality!"
4.0,"Wonderful watch for the price.<br /><br />I would warn buyers that the strap is for very thin wristed people. Although the watch is great, the strap barely fit"
4.0,Got compliments with this bra. Was in a wedding where we all had to wear strapless dresses. Other bridesmaids were complaining that their bra made them look flat or did not have good support. Well this bra had lift and fit perfect. I only took one star off because by the end of the night I was. Little sore because it is a little tight but I think that's what helps the lift. So I still love it!
4.0,"I really like the style and it was very pretty, almost prettier than the pictures. I had to try it on since it seems like an awesome outfit to wear on a float trip over a two piece bathing suit. Upon arrival, I noticed that it was very light, the arms were flared out, the waist tucked in with an elastic-like band and the bottoms were wide just the way I like it.The only thing I did not like was that the high waist seemed to cause the shorts area to stay a little too high for my liking. It looked fine but I felt like it was cutting off too high at the crotch area for me. I normally get the medium size but this one but I made a mistake I got the large one but its ok still looks fine ..<br />Disclaimer I receive this product at discounted price or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review .My review is base on my honest opinion and has nothing to do with the price I paid for the product.."
4.0,Practical for work
4.0,"I love these for the price! I’ve worn and washed these at least 15 times and they are still holding up. Beverly Hills Polo Club, makes less expensive products but the quality has never failed me. I have underwear, shorts and other BHPC products and I love them all! I can’t say enough about the style, comfort and durability of these."
4.0,"I bought this in a large to cover up my pregnancy bump even thought I'm usually a small. It looks like it'd be a good choice based on the pictures. However the material is heavy and tends to hang and rest on all your curves. It really hugs you, in a sense. It's still a decent sweater and I would recommend it because of that."
4.0,"It is soft and pretty material.  It is thin so you need a slip under it.  I returned it because it was too large in the top.  It is also much longer than the picture showed.  I am 5' 6"" and it comes way below my knees."
4.0,"Pretty earrings. Light and comfortable.  I would not get them wet, as to not ruin the color."
4.0,"Shipping a little long, but mask are great quality."
4.0,This actually arrived in much better quality then I was expecting. I'm looking forward to wearing it to a concert next month and love the shark print. The only downside is how small it runs. It might just be my larger than the average cheat but seems super small compared to most crop tops.
4.0,Very soft. Would have liked it a bit smaller.
4.0,Better than I expected after reading the other reviews
4.0,"I bought this duffle bag for a recent road trip and am very pleased with it. It is lightweight, easy to store, and holds a lot of &#34;stuff.&#34; It might not be sturdy enough for people who do a lot of traveling, but it should serve the occasional traveler well. I love the two outside pockets for smaller things that could get lost in the inside of the bag. Zipping the bag back down to the smaller storage size took a little doing since the fabric kept getting caught in the zipper, but with a bit of effort and patience, it compacted well. I will probably use the bag three or four times a year, so it should last for quite a long time. My sample of the bag did not come with the sunglasses, so I cannot comment on those. This is not an expensive piece of luggage, but seems like it is well worth the price. I'm quite happy with mine!<br /><br />I received a sample of this product at a very discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review, which this is."
4.0,The color of the light blue is so cute! The dress is kinda snug. But still hugs your body!
4.0,Ride bike almost everyday and these goggles are always with me. Very happy I got them. Lenses are easy to change and padding provides the right balance of wind protection<br />and breathability. Only bad are cheapy plastic and that they don't fold.
4.0,"The mediums are quite tight on my 9 year old that normally wears 10-12 sized clothing. He's the tallest kid in his class, so he's a bit larger than most boys his age, but the large (14-16 per the size chart) seemed like it was way too big. Standard Hanes quality but I wish I had ordered one size up."
4.0,Somewhat large but very cute!
4.0,A little longer than I expected and more nylon but should work well under tank tops this summer
4.0,"Everyone loves Zutanos.  I have mixed feelings based on my baby's experience.<br /><br />The Stats: Baby girl, started wearing them at 6 months old.  Her feet are in the 85th percentile, meaning they are normal for her age.<br />Length and width of shoe:  The length felt a little short from the start although the width seemed baggy.  She's now 9 months and they still seem loose across the width although her toes barely fit.  I found them to be good at keeping her socks on, but I honestly stopped using them once she started trying to stand on her feet.  Instead we switched to baby converse aka crib shoes - they have soles with traction on the bottom.  These work much better for us.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Snaps seem to keep the shoes on better, which in turn keeps socks on.<br />- She could pull them off easily, and did, from the beginning<br />- They would be good for newborn - 6 months, rather than 6 months - 1 year.<br />- Good at keep little feet warmer in cold weather.<br /><br />The Not-So-Good:<br />- They offer no real support or protection for the foot<br />- They should not be worn if baby is already standing<br />- Although the snaps help, they can be pulled off very easily<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend them for babies aged newborn - 4 or 5 months.  Babies any older than that would do well to get soft-soled shoes with grip on them as I think Zutano's would be dangerous for any baby that is starting to stand, even with assistance."
4.0,nice fit and wash up well
4.0,"These are exactly as described.  When they arrived, I gave the black one to my husband and the grey one to my grandson, keeping the two pretty ones for myself!  My husband wears his every day as he works out in the humid Oklahoma weather."
4.0,I read the reviews carefully before deciding on a size. I'm 5'3&#34; and around 120 but a bit chesty so I went with a 2XL. I probably would have been ok with an XL but it fits! I'll see how I like it when I actually wear it for swimming this weekend.
4.0,"Super cute print! Not high-quality material or construction. It was crazy cheap though, so I'm not mad!"
4.0,These are nice colors
4.0,"These are great. Adjustable to small faces, great quality. You get Exactly what is pictured!<br />Only complaint I have is I wish there were more designs to choose from, my kids aren't too big on the prints, but they aren't horrible either.<br />They would be the absolute best thing if they were unicorns, and dinosaurs!"
4.0,"Color is beautiful but dress is too snug. I'm curvy and I normally wear a LG, I had to return it bc an XL would've fit better. Unless you like every curve as imperfection showing, go a size up."
4.0,Beautiful vibrant colors. Lightweight. Bit thin but I don’t put things too heavy in it.
4.0,A bit thin but comfy!
4.0,"Very nice. Fit well. Not super soft leather, but works as a belt. Looks good. Feels a bit pricey, but will keep."
4.0,"These are impressive socks.  They are soft, but quite thick, with padded toes and heels which make them incredibly comfortable.  The over-the-calf design provides “graduated compression” in the leg, which improves circulation during running.  That means the socks are quite tight on the leg (the product description uses the word “snug;” I think “tight” is more accurate) – these are not the easiest socks to put on!  But once in place, they are comfortable and supportive.<br /><br />The L/XL size fits those wearing men’s shoe sizes 10 ½-12.  My husband wears a size 12, so he’s at the top end of the range.  While they did fit him (the foot, at least, fit him well), he struggled to get them on over his thick calves.  He did like the way they felt once they were on, but he doubted he’d wear them on a regular basis.  I tried them on myself (I wear a women’s 8 ½, so the foot was a bit big on me), and I liked the way the leg felt, but even I had a bit of trouble pulling them up over my calves.<br /><br />Overall, these socks look good and feel good.  If you’re looking for a classy running sock that will provide superior leg compression, these are perfect.  Just be aware that they are very long, very thick, and not easy to put on."
4.0,Great little jacket for the money!Light weight works great!  Love the zipper pockets
4.0,Was what my son exspected
4.0,I love one of the pairs but the other pair was to small. 2 diff sizes
4.0,"Feels good, looks great, but the key part is rather flimsy."
4.0,I'm 6ft 211 Lbs. With wide shoulders. I bought XL tops and they fit perfectly. My only complaint would be the how cheap the lettering looks compared to the rest of the top.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone.
4.0,"These two were a good purchase for the price. They were delivered quickly and in the cutest packaging.<br />One thing I disagree with is the word “universal” used here. While they do tie in the back to fit the circumference of my head, they are a bit long and either come down over my eyebrows or sit up too tall on my head. Might just be my personal preference but I like mine a bit smaller.<br />Overall, great quality product."
4.0,Nice color combination. Our lil guy wore this to a wedding and received lots of compliments!
4.0,so cute and super comfy.
4.0,"These were a gift for my husband, who likes to use a yellow tinted lens when it's raining, snowing, or dark.  The pair he had was always in the other vehicle, so now he has one for each vehicle!"
4.0,Worked great for costume.
4.0,"Very nice and comfortable, however, if you wear a12 or bigger get the XX extra large fit."
4.0,"Bought it to use with masks. Great for the price. One arrived damaged, some of the necklaces were torn but it's such an easy self fix, and it was even better since it was a big long for me. It's also cute to wear as a necklace. The only thing is that the clipper that holds the ear loop is a bit small, so you have to manipulate it a bit to be able to insert the ear loop if it's a thick one, like fabric masks at oppose to disposable masks. Overall I'm pleased, great value per money."
4.0,"I would love to give five stars,but they so wide, but I put extra insoles and woolen socks and decided too keep them because arch support is unique for my plantar fasciitis"
4.0,"Fit is a little small, but they are made of COTTON, which is good so they absorb moisture"
4.0,"These seem like really good glasses...I just wish it said somewhere on either the glasses, or with the packaging, that they are UV400 rated."
4.0,very cute and comfortable .. well made !!
4.0,"This dropped a lot further down on my legs - below the knees. It looked awkward and strange. If you’re 5’7” and above, it might fit better lengthwise. Otherwise, it was beautiful and I would’ve kept it."
4.0,"I loved the dress, it fit well and was slimming. It hid my lower abdominal fat like I wanted it to. I received so many compliments on the dress. I ordered the green and received more of a blue colored dress."
4.0,"For the price, it’s a great buy. Sizing is also on point."
4.0,"The material and fit were perfect. However, the seams are threading away. Yet I like them"
4.0,"I purchase this for my bundle of joy this is such a cute outfit with pattern, I think this would work for both boys and girls. The fabric is very light so its great for summer or if you live in a warm place but for the price its good quality.  It has snap in the bottom for easy diaper changes, it also has extra fabric on the back so its good for cloth diapers. Overall I am very pleased, I order size up as I think it runs a bit small."
4.0,"The only thing I wish this thing had was more stretchy, wicking material. It does it's job of keeping my hair and my sweat out of my face while I run. It's also thin enough to wear a running hat too if it's very windy."
4.0,I love these rings they are very versatile not only in color but also fit.
4.0,"Look nice, worth the price I paid, wish they were gold, but they'd cost a lot more !"
4.0,"boat neck, but you can pull off the shoulder.  Fit is baggy through the waist"
4.0,Wifed love them!
4.0,"this is a great dress, if you can rock it. I personally can't but it was very good quality."
4.0,"Loved the roped style keychain. Would have liked the verse slightly bigger, but so far very enjoyable."
4.0,"Overall its great, the quality, the inner space, the Switch fits perfectly even with some joy-con cover protectors on. Only thing I'm not completely happy with is the inner pocket, I thought the AC adapter was going to fit better because of the product photo, but it barely fits and fills forced."
4.0,"Hat was a little big for my head, but worked great. Everyone loves it"
4.0,Love the dress so much it’s the most comfortable dress I owed!
4.0,"Fit as expected,round my butt the only bad thing is you see the leg line of the shorts. Which i dont like because that how someone can tell u have something on...its better to wear with dress or skirt"
4.0,"I like the simple gray color of this pj set. The material is very soft and feels nice. It flows well with a long shirt. The bottoms have an elastic waist with a tie as well. They fit snuggly at the waist and flow a bit at the legs. My only complaint would be that I wish they were a bit longer as they ride up a little bit when I am walking around.<br />Also there is no label in the back of the shirt and it's a little hard to tell which is the front and the back as the design is just plain. The tag is inside on the bottom left, but I might mark it with a permanent marker to make it easier to recognize. It do love that the shorts have pockets.<br />Overall I do like these pajamas quite a bit now that the days are warming up."
4.0,Cute just little to loose
4.0,It should've been bigger since she is only 3 1/2 yrs old.
4.0,Now I'm able to save money by repairing my own watches with new batteries or whatever the need now I need a case to put my Tools in
4.0,"So cute, but it does roll up at the bottom."
4.0,"Honestly it’s really really cute. It’s true to size so that’s not and issue. The reasons I’m giving 4 stars though it’s because the fabric is not soft like cotton or even a mix, it’s straight up nylon and it feels a bit cheap. I decided to return even though the colors and print was beautiful but the fabric turned me off."
4.0,"Great for storing your currency collection. A little small, wish it could hold more bills."
4.0,Cute and different great for lounging around.
4.0,"I really like the color and fit of this dress.  I'm 5'4"" and 180lbs .  It fits great through the bust and looks great on me.  My only dislike is the length . Which is not the garments fault ( I have a big booty. Yum, cookies). It's just shorter than I like. It hits a couple inches above the knee.  Overall a cute little summer dress."
4.0,"This is super cute, but the straps in back are not adjustable and cause the top too sit high on the chest. We are hoping they stretch out over time."
4.0,"They are a little more pink than the picture but they stay in my boyfriend's ear just find. He had to use than at his job and they work perfectly. Like most silicone's they get filled with gunk fast, so remember to clean them."
4.0,Pretty shirts. I love them. They just fit weird. I'm a thick girl so I had to buy the XXL but I'm short so they are a bit long
4.0,"It is a low cost guitar strap but it's functional with plenty of room for sizing and I like it.  I don't like any of the three picks.  I like a firm &#34;medium&#34; pick and these are not firm at all, in fact they are useless and shouldn't have been included."
4.0,Fit great. Color is beautiful
4.0,"This bag comes zipped into a pouch. The double sided zipper isn't stitched correctly and the seams of fabric gets stuck and I'm unable to unzip. Real shame, I was looking forward to using the bag...<br /><br />Update: even though the bag's doesn't work. Amazon has given me a full refund and the constant supplied the bag had replayed the bag. They truly know how to treat their customers. So I moved it from 2 stars to 4 stars for the fact that the company so willing to make things right."
4.0,Love them!  Just wish they were darker but still love them!
4.0,"This dress is very flattering on me, I'm 5.11 159lbs and it fits great, size M, only negative is the flap at the top, I actually had it removed, looks so much better!"
4.0,"The tank top fit perfectly. The shorts were extremely small. If you have curves or thighs, I would go up a size or two."
4.0,The dress is really cute but the material quality wasn't that great.
4.0,"these look alot bigger then they really are, other wise they are great! i used them for the top of my ear, and have had a few people ask me where i got them at. i love the sparkles, and that i have different color choices, without having to buy them separate.<br />I got this product at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,Product as described. Arrived when stated.
4.0,Fits well. Good tummy band.
4.0,"About me: This product in general is great but not for me. I am a 5'1&#34; girl and I weigh 105 pounds so I'm pretty skinny and I got a size small and it fit perfectly.<br /><br />Waistband:When I first opened the package and tried to pull these over my legs, I could tell that the waistband wasn't that stretchy and it felt a little tight, even on me but when I wore them, they fit right around my waist and then it didn't feel tight at all and instead it felt great, like it wouldn't fall down or slip.<br /><br />Material: the leggings are cloth but they feel so soft and good. They feel really durable, even though I usually never like cotton leggings.<br /><br />Price: the price is amazing for these great of leggings and you even get two in different colors<br /><br />See through or not?: No it's not see through at all. It has great coverage<br /><br />Cameltoe? There isn't a camel toe but the groan area is extremely highlighted on me. It has one fold on each side of my groan which draws attention to my private area and I didn't like that at all.<br /><br />Why I rated 4 stars: Everything about this product is great! I love this so much but the part about it highlighting my private parts just didn't do it for me but I just feel like this was a personal problem, so if you think these will work then try them! You'll get a free refund!"
4.0,it was a gift and he loved it
4.0,This fits perfectly with some stretch. It’s a great length. The only drawback is that it has started pilling slightly.  It’s still very comfortable.
4.0,TENIA QUE REGALAR ALGO A UNA NIÑA Y ESTABA PENSANDO EN QUE COMPRARLE Y ME DECIDÍ POR ESTE RELOJ ES EL MEJOR RELOJ CALIDAD PRECIO PERO QUERÍA PONER UNA TARJETA SD PERO NO LA PODÍA LEER
4.0,A bit small for an adult face- but a strap extender makes it ok.
4.0,These are adorable but were pretty tight. Gave them to my 12 year old daughter and she loves them. Wouldn't recommend for women's sizes.
4.0,"soft, comfortable, skims curves for a flattering, sexy, but still office-appropriate look. I pair mine with matching tights (also purchased on Amazon) a knee-length skirt and boots. Great fall and winter office to cocktails after work outfit. The knit feels much higher quality than I expected for the price. I'll probably buy it in several colors. Washes very nicely without losing shape."
4.0,"It's very pretty but larger than expected.  As a result, I am giving it away as a gift. :("
4.0,This is the second time I've ordered these socks and will certainly order again!
4.0,It seemed to be a good material.  It does run small.
4.0,"I have narrow shoulders so this works for me ,but if you are normal to wide in this area you may find it tight."
4.0,"Very cute band, particularly for Spring-Summer.<br />Appears to be well made, altho since I’ve only had mine a week, it’s too soon to comment on it’s durability.<br />The (p)leather material is soft & pliable, while  being reasonably thick.<br />Printed flower-stripe design is crisp, with clear, bright colors.<br />(Shown in my photos my w/a bumper purchased at the same time to “match” this band.)<br />Fit: I have a smaller wrist for an adult woman (5-3/4”). The band fits me well. There are 9 slots total. My band is fastened/clasped at the halfway point, at the 5th slot.)<br /><br />My only “complaint”: I would’ve preferred gold tone hardware rather than the silver tone used.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br />- CC, Amazon Prime Member-Reviewer"
4.0,"Nice socks, warm and cozy. Much darker green than expected though"
4.0,The shorts fit good in the waist and baggy and larger in the legs. They are nice to wear around the house or wherever.
4.0,It fits the passport  perfectly but wished it could have a little zipper pouch
4.0,It's a little pricey but my husband will get good use out of these. He can use a pocket square with confidence.
4.0,"Had this shirt for about 6 months or so and has been pretty so far. After numerous washing the lettering is starting to detach from the shirt. For now it gives it a nice distressed look, but I anticipate in the near future it will cease to be legible. Was good while it lasted"
4.0,"They weren't the heaviest leggings, but a hit as my 3 year old niece thought the lego pieces were 3D!"
4.0,"These are so cute, but too small. My 1 year old is 5-6 shoe/boot size and the 6-6.5 are too small. I may order up a size."
4.0,"Quality control is lacking I ordered 3 sets and 2 of the earrings wouldn't close at all no matter how much I tried to get them to, both wearing and not wearing them. If they close, they are great though"
4.0,"I wish I would have purchased these boots long before now. I rode my bike to work and was able to wear these boots all day,  I had to change into something more comfortable before."
4.0,"Seems true to size, but the shirt isn’t purple.  It’s more between a light burgundy & wine color.  I didn’t think the picture looked purple which is why I took a chance because I didn’t want a purple shirt."
4.0,I got these for my son’s werewolf Halloween costume. They were a little big for him as expected. And they smelled bad. Otherwise they were fine.
4.0,"Very bright, well constructed. As to the design, the light is actually too bright and needs a diffuser of some sort to cut the glare."
4.0,Gave it as a present haven't seen him wear it but heard no complaints so can only assume it is good enough.
4.0,"Very pretty accessory for a low price! This bracelet is so far holding up, although it is reshaping due to twisting motion to put on and remove, which is the only time I consider the potential of the “face” snapping off. However, once on, I forget that concern."
4.0,"Bought for an autumn vacation in Lithuania. Great in terms of not having to carry a purse, but you quickly start looking lumpy if you use more than a few pockets. Forget about the tablet pocket if you want to zip up and sit down. I ended up putting my Kindle Fire in the back pocket most of the time for that reason. As others have noted, you really need to order at least a size up generally and if you want to use the pockets or need to layer (because it is not an insulated jacket). Biggest complaint is lack of a hood. What's the point of leaving your purse behind if you have to carry an umbrella?"
4.0,"The fabric of this dress its very stretchy, and it fit nice from the waist down. But i have a very curvy body with the same measurement on top as the bottom with a smaller waist. The top part just keeps on falling off the  straps just go over your shoulder with no attachment to any part of the dress.<br />Also on the bottom part of my arm there is an excessive fabric that just flaps out. I think adding some criss cross strap on the back would fix the problem, thats what i intend to do and fix the problem. Besides that the dress is very nice and the fabric is not see through. The bottom on the back is rushed so it accentuated your curved.<br /><br />I will attaches some picture in hope it will help someone who might be interested in this product. I was appreciative to be given an opportunity to test and review this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. If you have any questions or comments about this product or my review, feel free to message me and I'll be glad to help!"
4.0,"I got these for skiing - can't have too many neck gaiters. They really help to stay out longer on cold ski days. (And are a necessity now when they require face coverings in the lift line!) These gaiters are extra long and plenty stretchy to fit any size face. They stay in place fairly well but can slip off my nose, so I have to pull it up sometimes or tuck it under my goggles (which can cause fogging).<br /><br />I wore this all day on a warmer ski day in the 20s to upper 30s and it kept me warm enough and only got a little damp towards the end of the day. A little more air came through than usual because they are on the thinner side, and not as warm or insulating as my wool blend gaiter, but are sufficient to cut down the cold and wind and protect my face in most skiing weather. A bit too thin for the worst blizzard type conditions I sometimes ski in though when I'll stick with my wool blend gaiter.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with these neck gaiters and will use them often for skiing."
4.0,Adorable shirts! Good quality but fits slightly on small side. Overall pleased with product.
4.0,Absolutely love it but the only prob is I'm really short so the dress is extremely long goes to my toes so if ur 4 foot get smaller size to get this length
4.0,For the price item was fine. The wings have elastic that you put your arm through and it was big for my granddaughter she’s only six. Was a easy fix just secured them in front with a white piece of ribbon. Wings and halo held up good for Halloween but the heart on the wand didn’t it fell off.
4.0,Muy lindas pero el tamaño mas grande de lo esperado
4.0,Love this!!! It’s big but I kept it and roll the sleeves a bit but I’d order down a size if I got another one.
4.0,A little tight but I won't complain.
4.0,"I really liked this dress when I received it; however, based on the size guide it runs a little small. I ended up returning the dress. Had it fit correctly, it would have been a great dress!"
4.0,pretty and well made.  Wearing this summer for wedding.
4.0,"I ordered these for my sister she is having trouble with her skin and can't go outside without fleece lined or thermal clothes on, they fit her great its as expected. Order true to size! They are very soft, very comfortable."
4.0,My wife is loving the wallet and happy it is RFID blocking. Would recommend it to people who want a medium wallet. Only complaint is the gusset where the paper money goes could be a bit more roomy. All in all a good choice.
4.0,average bowling shoes
4.0,"While it fits as I expected and hoped for I read some reviews that said order up a size if your large busted. I'm a 36 j cup so I went with th xxl and I'm glad I did. While it is stretchy, it's cotton and prone to shrinkage and I didn't want skin tight. I'm 5'6"" and it hits about knee height. It looks good with either my flats or my Dr. Martens. I will definitely be buying more colors."
4.0,"If you are a wig beginner, this is a great wig for you. The wig frizzes up sometimes but you should be able to keep it under control as long as you are careful when you brush it. The best way to get rid of the friz if it occurs is to detangle it and flat iron it at 200-250, no higher than 250. The fit of the wig is meant more for children than adults, at Target you can get a small, medium, or large. The size large may fit some adults, but be careful. Anyways, the Target price for this wig was half the Amazon price, but they don't sell it at Target anymore, so I suggest finding the best price online if you want this wig. Overall, for a beginner this is a great wig (it was my very first wig) but if you are more experienced with wigs, invest your money in a wig that is 1. That is for sure your size 2. Maybe a bit higher quality 3. Affordable. I hope this review helps."
4.0,"Love this watch. It looks great and keeps time perfectly. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the second hand on the chronograph doesn't always line up perfectly with the numbers. Not that big of a deal for me, but it is worth noting. The strap is good quality soft leather. When I ordered it, I had planned on replacing the strap, but it looks better in person imo. I may wind up sticking with it now. Overall, a very solid watch for an affordable price."
4.0,Great shades a little flimsy...but I love them
4.0,"It's a very good image of a BT--worth 5 stars, but I could wish it were just a touch smaller.  Still, I'll wear it with pride."
4.0,"Very, very nice for the money - I was pleasantly surprised. Will shop this seller again."
4.0,"Not the most comfortable for all day wear, but can't beat it for the price  I usually am ready to take it off by the time I get home from work."
4.0,the weird metal flaking kind get inside your shoes but it does wick away feet sweet and are a great base layer to even the cheapest of thermal sock making them very warm
4.0,"Realizing that all colors aren't exact, these are not a true royal blue.  But close enough to wear to work with my scrubs."
4.0,Great sun protection. Only compliant is that the pretty tie on the hat wasnt sewn in properly and it has come undone so it isnt as attractive as it is in the picture.
4.0,"I LOVED these jeans. I have a long torso and short legs, so I've always been told I should try to wear high waisted jeans, so finally after doing a lot of research on amazon I found these. They feel in a way like jeggings but still more jean-like, but look just like jeans because of the rips. They are super super stretchy and extremely flattering all around. The holes I do have to say though are a little big and have a lot of fringes, but I've been wearing them for one day and already have gotten THREE separate compliments on them. I am highly considering buying another pair literally the exact same just because I love them so much. I definitely DEFINITELY recommend these to anyone who wants a VERY flattering behind!!!!!"
4.0,"These glasses are perfect for summer time! The color is fun and makes the world seem brighter through the pink and yellow lens, plus, they're super fashionable. I like that they're really light  and they fit my face well. A problem I have with aviator style glasses is that it's hard for me to find a pair that doesn't slide right off my face when I look down, but these don't even budge no matter the way I turn my head (so I think it's safe to assume that they're made small).<br /><br />For the price they are, they're excellent quality, though definitely do not expect RayBands.<br />The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I still found myself squinting into the morning sun with them on. I knew they would be a gentle shade of protection because of the color (and for the light color they are, they really do an impressive job), but my personal preference is the darker sunglasses, so I had hoped that the pink would be a little darker than it is. But overall, I still like wearing them and they do certainly provide noticeable protection to your eyes :)"
4.0,Get the size up.
4.0,"I’m 5’2, 145lbs.  These were too tight/small.  I wanted it as undershirt, but even as that would not be comfortable.  Would be ok as a workout top but I did not care firgtge material.  Also, the debuted was a bit sheer."
4.0,I got this product on sale. Will work great for costume.
4.0,"I really like them, other than the block in the middle on top where you turn it on and off."
4.0,"A lightweight,  collapsible coffin.  Useful as a free standing prop. It comes in an easy to carry bag and pops into shape when removed.  There are six small pipes that complete the structure which are secured with velcro. There is no base to the coffin,  it is open at the back."
4.0,"The watch and band are very nice and good value. I like a square faced watch for dress and this is a good, casual look. I would prefer a slightly thinner watch, but I like this one a lot."
4.0,"They alright for the money. Not the best, but for the dollar amount, they seem to do good."
4.0,"The jacket is light and comfortable, but I feel like the graphic is a bit fragile. I'm worried I'll damage it pretty quickly, but overal it is as I expected and a very nice fit."
4.0,I ordered a 16/18 and fits like a 14/16 so runs a little small but i can wear them. I love the feel!!
4.0,Cute simple dress but the sleeves are not full/puffy as pictured
4.0,"The medium fit a little too tight on waistband.  The large is a little too large, but good value."
4.0,It's a decent product for the price.
4.0,"Very pretty, nice size, not too big."
4.0,"These have been a welcome addition to my screen reading time.  I keep this set available in easy to reach places so I do not have to carry my main reading glasses around.  The fit is just a tad tight, but the anti-glare and magnification have been excellent."
4.0,My husband liked it. I didn't like the nylon interior but will see if it holds up.
4.0,Nice watch--price is excellent.  I love the bit of steampunk feel that it has.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that there is insufficient contrast between the hands and the background metal to allow you to read the time at a glance.
4.0,Fits well and flows very well
4.0,"Nice hat, the fish is a little to green, but was given as a gift and they loved it."
4.0,It is definitely a women’s large not unisex but is a nice material
4.0,"I like the way this fits, very flattering."
4.0,The cardigan was delivered exactly as pictured.  Lightweight but provides warmth in office space.  I saw the same cardigan on a boutique website for almost double the price and thought I would take a chance.  Delivery did take about a month but it was worth it!  Planned the outfit for Thanksgiving and it was delivered days before.
4.0,"These are fun, and work as they should for reading."
4.0,"Purchased this for my 8 year old son to wear for field day. Good quality, just way too small. This would be a good fit for a baby"
4.0,"I am a 38C and got an XL after reading other reviews.  The size itself was fine, but the cups don't curve in at the bottom for me and I felt like I was going to fall out of the suit from the bottom (usually it's the opposite problem!).  Also, for larger busts, don't expect it to be as highneck as on the model.  Other than that, really nice print (Multi1 - gray and pink - pink is brighter than in the picture) and good length (yes, there is a bit of flare at the bottom).  The lining (not really padding, but enough to cover nipples) is not removable, which I like.  I knew I wouldn't like the boyshort bottoms and would have worn the suit with a bikini bottom, but the bottoms seem fine."
4.0,"nice, warm ,bright"
4.0,I wore them at school today and they were very comfortable all day.
4.0,It’s fits well. Will show cleavage so maybe wear something underneath
4.0,I love moonstone and really like this piece. The band is what seems like a crocheted piece. It's pretty but it is stiff. I took it off after a couple of days so maybe it'll become more flexible with wear. Cute piece. I'd buy it again and five it as a gift.
4.0,Well made and stylish but this item order in Small was definitely a Medium. The shoulder seams drooped and the length of the sleeves was several inches too long. Just order one size smaller and you should be good-to-go!
4.0,Just right for me. I ordered a small. I had to cut the back strap so it could fit more comfortable and it worked like a charm. I like the material ribbed not to thick are then. I am pleased with this purchase. I am all smiles
4.0,"The top is very pretty. It did fit snug on my daughter so I kept it for myself,"
4.0,"The sticky surface worked for my swimsuit, it was easy to peel off and seems like it will stay in place.  For the cheap price, I am happy with this purchase. I have not worn swimsuit in the water, so not sure how well they will hold up after getting wet."
4.0,"I LOVE this pant, but it’s too tight in the calves. I don’t have outrageously bulky calves and don’t have issues with clothes or boots being tight on my calves. I wish Giro would have given a little more fabric in this area. I got the 4 because it fit perfectly everywhere else, but tried on the 6. The 6 we’re okay in the calf area but were baggy everywhere else."
4.0,"This is the 3rd shirt I ordered, this was supposed to be white but has a blue hint to it, I will return this one. The green and the tangerine one were very nice."
4.0,"Got for teenage grandson. It looked better in person! He loved it. Got mens large, coyld have probably got a size up."
4.0,Purchased as a Christmas present and I know they're going to love it.
4.0,"This bra is absolutely beautiful.  The cut is really flattering, especially for those who have a little extra underarm flab.  All of the lace is gorgeous, and the detailing is awesome.  It stays in place, and you forget you're wearing it (which for a bra is a miracle!). The color is so beautiful, and I would imagine looks amazing on all skin types.  I took off a star, because unless you're wearing a thick sweater, you can definitely see all of the bumps of the lace detailing over the cup.  If you're just wearing a regular shirt-it definitely draws attention to your chest.  So I would beware of that, but it's perfect for everything else!"
4.0,"Looks good and fits well, but expected more quality for the price. The shipping package was not as should be. The hat brim was out of shape upon arrival. Tried, unsuccessfully, to reshape with hair blower. Not one of my better purchases on Amazon.com."
4.0,Good comfy socks for the most part. Lost a star because some of them have weird portions made of some glitter material thats very scratchy and uncomfortable. Luckily not all of the socks have this.
4.0,The fit was fine however the jacket was a little to flimsy. Returned.
4.0,"This is a nice looking bead that seems well made. Finish is good and the gold color heart is an attractive accent. Reduced by 1 star because this alone does not hold itself or other charms/beads in place. You need to have the silicon rings to put underneath to make it actually &#34;grab&#34; the bracelet and not move. Given that small caveat, a nice bead."
4.0,"Excellent color range to choose from, easy to install, and they all look great. The only problem is that even at the tightest these are still a bit too big for me... I'm 145lbs too so that's saying something. It won't record heartrate or sleep as well when the watch can't make complete contact with the skin. I had to make my own hole past the last one available for it to fit correctly."
4.0,It's pretty cool. Although I do feel like a dog wearing a shock collar. I walk around dribbling pee and my tail between my legs anticipating the next shock.
4.0,"Looks good, fits well"
4.0,"Great fit comfortable ,warm good traction indoors and out. No regrets good boy"
4.0,"Amazing little pins. I forgot I ordered them because shipping took forever, but was a nice little surprise when they came."
4.0,"A tad disappointed.  Not as heavy as I wanted.  None-the-less, good quality and works well as a late fall / early spring throw."
4.0,Very nice tanks for the price. Fabric is a bit thin but will be great on hot days while working out.
4.0,"This wrap is so adorable! And the color is to die for. It served its purpose for what I needed it for. BUT. Right before I packed it up for the wedding, I discovered a HOLE in its sleeve. I was SO disappointed. What a let down! Thank the Lord that the hole wasn't too noticeable and that I could still wear it. I would return it, but I feel bad returning it when I wore it."
4.0,"These are the cutest little cat earrings and I like them! I just got it in mail the other day with Fast Shipping however the posts of earrings were sticking out through the package! No receipt or little box or plastic jewelry bag not even paper tissue wrapping the earrings to protect them! Came in an 8x11 or maybe larger manilla colored envelope. (pretty big for such little items) but they made it to me unharmed. So far they have not turned color, after just wearing them for a few hours so far. So cute and probably more for kidsbut I'm a grown adult and I like them! Thanks...."
4.0,"It fits ok, maybe it is just my body that doesn't make it look as good as the model, but my husband loved it regardless. The skirt does not stretch and the top is not too high end, so do not expect top notch stuff."
4.0,Its extremely comfortable. Fits perfectly only concern would be that it rises as u walk but its super cute for winter wedding. Im 5 ft so the sleeves are full length on me but not an issue. Lots of stretch if needed. I just quickly tried it on and love it.<br />Recap definitely can not be worn if you have a butt if u plan on walking in this you will have to continue to keep pulling it down super annoying. So I bought double sided tape to see if that helps but going to bathroom will be a issue.
4.0,It's bigger than I thought but it's fine
4.0,It's beautiful and I love it but it's a bit hard to put on and take off. Maybe after being used for awhile. It's still a great band and I recommend it
4.0,"Not going to lie, I bought this simply because I knew my husband would like it, not for actually slimming or lifting. It was a bit small on me, but I’m also not used to wearing shapewear. I can say that it does seem to work well for shaping of the hits, stomach and waist. It’s well made and the fabric is soft and not at all itchy."
4.0,"Nicely made and comfortable! But I’m not a super tall woman, I’m only 5’6” and these didn’t even reach my knees. So not as long as I feel is advertised."
4.0,Very soft and comfortable. Good quality for the money.
4.0,I am 5'1&quot; and about 120 lbs. I got a small and it fit just like the picture. The straps are a little loose but other than that it fit really well. Nice thick material. Bunny does come on overalls.
4.0,"This mask is very well made. It is durable and easy to put on. It has a collar type bottom to put under your  shirt which gives it a better look than most masks. It is easy enough to see out of. It does get a little hot and sweaty kind of fast when wearing, but I think you will have that with any mask like this as it is latex. We are going to use it for a Halloween scarecrow type decoration.  It is a great mask overall especially for the price. I would recommend"
4.0,"They Are Cute, I Just Got Them Today. Thanks"
4.0,I wouldn't necessarily call this a &#34;wallet&#34; but it serves its purpose. Holds cards very tightly and has a band for cash also. Feels good in the front pocket and the size is great. Good buy for the price as long as the band doesn't break or get stretched out fast. I'll give it 4 stars for now.
4.0,I guess not everyone can have a good experience.  I found this suit to be very off.  It had runs in it right out of the package.  It also did not fit my torso.  I ordered a size larger because I am top heavy.<br />The suit is very pretty but unfortunately it was not in good condition.  Maybe I got one that was a return because there was also no lining inside the crotch like all other suits come with.<br /><br />Very disappointed.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After seeing my review the seller is doing everything possible to make things right.  I may have just gotten the lemon.  Will update again!
4.0,Great quality for the price! My daughter loves it!
4.0,Clip is awesome - light and tough. The wallet is junk - scratched almost immediately from normal contact with clip. Averaged that to a 3.5 and rounded since I can't do half stars. Get the card sleeve from Ragged Edge to go with the clip. Perfect combo.
4.0,"I loved the style, the material, and everything about it. However, at my age I’m starting to lose height and it seems everything I wear makes me look fat and dumpy."
4.0,"My distant vision is fine from 30 inches (desktop computer) and on.<br />Previously I needed 2 pair of readers, one for reading at 18 inches and another for reading fine print and detailed hobby work.<br />This one pair does both.<br />For carrying it does not fold as small as I would like, but it is still smaller than carrying two readers."
4.0,Good quality& very comfortable
4.0,"Ordered the clear lunch tote and a clear purse for my wife for work. Never got the purse, so I can't rate it. Wife likes the lunch tote. I think it's cheesy, but give it 4 stars anyway because wife is happy."
4.0,"Buena calidad, queda bien 👍.... gracias"
4.0,"Fits well, flattering and comfortable"
4.0,"These dressy socks are very thin -- thinner than typical socks. They are soft and silky and almost have a hose-like quality. They are very similar to the knee-high dress socks that you see in the big box stores. I can't recall ever seeing these kinds of socks anywhere that I've shopped.<br /><br />I like them much better than the knee-high version because they don't cut into my leg. I have wide calves and it makes wearing the knee-high version very uncomfortable. With these socks, I barely feel them. I will note that because the fabric is not breathable, it may not be a good sock if you have sweaty feet. They hold moisture and therefore you might experience some foot odor."
4.0,"It's very beautiful, but a little more fragile then they have you believe."
4.0,"I got these in grey for work. My dress code is business casual, but I really don’t like typical slacks and I prefer pants that fit like leggings and skinny jeans. I got these and they’re very comfy and fit very nice! They also have nice front pockets, which I wasn’t expecting! The downside is that the material is kind of thin. They’re completely opaque, but you can see the outline of the pockets and you should probably be careful about what underwear you wear with them to avoid panty lines. Otherwise great! I’ll be ordering more in different colors."
4.0,"I had one of these belts before, for about 20 years. I just broke and I bought a new one. I'm disappointed that they aren't made the same way though. The previous one had snaps that allowed you to swap out the buckle. The brown color I just bought looked very dark too....almost black, which is not what I wanted. So I assume that their dyeing process isn't consistent and buying online isn't a guarantee for color matching. Great quality though. Basic, timeless design. Won't go out of style."
4.0,"Not sure what to say about a keychain, it holds the single key that I purchased it to keep......"
4.0,Great product for the money! Microfiber cloth to clean and a fabric case! Like it !
4.0,it is cut a bit small ~ love the style ~ I had to give it to a smaller relative. Sad
4.0,It is a great looking/working watch.  A leather band should be installed on the watch instead of a rubber band.  I was surprised at how fast the watch was delivered.
4.0,"Cotton and comfy. Easy to throw on for groceries and go. This is the 2nd one I’ve purchased. Do not recommend the stripes as the pattern was mismatched across legs (pet peeve) hence reason, I purchased a different pattern this time."
4.0,"The chain wasn’t too impressive, but the charm is! I wear it all the time and get lots of compliments. Wear isn’t visible yet and the color and shine are still great!"
4.0,Received in good condition.  Note that both of them are facing the same direction (i.e. there is no right vs left cufflink)
4.0,"Smaller size than I expected, nice earrings."
4.0,Mask arrived on time and looks exactly as pictured.<br />Product only gets 4 because the way the ribbons are connected look a little flimsy and I am wondering if they will hold up throughout the entire event.  Will update review after the event!
4.0,"I liked this dress WAY more on me than on the hanger. I was prepared to hate it, and then I tried it on, and it was super comfy and quite cute. I washed before wearing, and it's really soft. Love that it has pockets. Great length, just above the knee.<br /><br />It is, however, kind of cheaply made. See the second pic. After washing, one of the sleeves had loose threads at the hem."
4.0,"Beautiful style.  But the smaller padding swim in the roomy top and tend to each lodge on the far side.  You will need to adjust them toward the middle to not look weird, unless you have powerful enough bust, I guess. If you have a belly it will surely show....well, I could use it as a weight loss motivator....<br />The material is on the heavier side and seem very sturdy.  I really like the shorts underneath."
4.0,As described. Only complaint is I wish they were a touch thicke.
4.0,Really do like the look of this on.
4.0,I really like them because there confy and cool.
4.0,The shorts didn’t have a scalloped bottom like pictured. But other than that I love them. Medium fit perfect.
4.0,"Its beautiful and dainty looks nice to dress up an outfit. I bought it for my ten year old daughter, but I'd definitely wear it. She told me several people at her school complemented her, adults and students included. Only thing is it does get tangled rather easily if it's not kept in a secure place. I used a plastic toothpick to untangle it."
4.0,"Decent fit, pilled the padding out almost immediately. Meduim/light hold.<br />The pocket functions as intended, my galaxy s9 fit securely. The only issue was after a while of running: having the phone that close to my sweaty back caused it to heat up considerably. Very uncomfortable for me."
4.0,Somewhat uncomfortable for your private parts to have the gel.
4.0,The top fit perfectly the skirt sadly was to small I'm a large breasted women the top fit great the skirt was ment for much smaller women . few inches bigger and better zipper it would been perfect.I could squeeze into it but the zipper broke so I gave up. Kept the top though
4.0,Really like the quality of this purse.  My only complaint would be that there is a zipper on the larger bag that should have been as long as the purse.  It gets in the way and I am thinking about cutting the zipper off otherwise I really like it.
4.0,Wife loved the watch
4.0,A bit see-through though.
4.0,I loved them the only bad thing was the smiley face one was broken but the others are so beautiful! I just bought it for that one! My kids and sister loves them
4.0,"Beautiful dress. I had hoped it would be a similar soft material to another one I bought on Amazon, but this one is a bit more spandex like and has a sheen to it. I isn't my favorite material, but it's still a pretty dress."
4.0,"I liked the colors where true to what was posted the price is also fair , I just wish the stitching was a little neater"
4.0,"Just received yesterday. Really like its design, simple but stylish. I'm 5'4, this warmer is up to just below the knee, I wish it could be a little longer."
4.0,It's a great watch for the money
4.0,very comfortable and looks very sharp
4.0,"This bra is great, except, since I have such large boobs that they kind of made the bra sag, basically the cleavage part goes too far down to support big boobs, but it’s ok, cuz I just sewed it together about two inches there, and now it holds the girls much better!"
4.0,"The glasses are super cute and cheap but you kind of get what you pay for because when I received them the one of the nose pads was missing. But because they’re so cute, I’m going to keep them and wear them anyway."
4.0,"My son liked it, but set up wasn't easy. Have no clue, what is use for T -Click. Other then that it is a good First time watch for my son(6 year Old)."
4.0,"They protect hands, last for a while, and this is a good value.."
4.0,"The silver circle inset is rather larger and darker than pictured, so it limits what the beads will match.  That being said, they are a very pretty peach on the outside."
4.0,xmas present--not for me
4.0,Cómodos. Se ajustan a la medida del cuerpo
4.0,"I love these jeans. They do stretch out after wearing, but washing them brings them right back into shape. Super comfortable and very good looking, they make wearing jeans so much easier."
4.0,"It is so handy not to have to carry your purse into the store, just the Sak Iris Wallet.  The only thing that would make it better is to be a fraction bigger.  I have been stretching mine so my phone is not so difficult to get out."
4.0,Kid loves the shoes. They are rather stiff and fit small but she doesn't care. Have held up well. Would buy again but in a larger size.
4.0,"It's fine, it works very well. I would recommend it to anyone. Looks nice and works very, very good."
4.0,"The earrings came exactly as how they look in the pictures, they are durable but a little bit heavy on the ears."
4.0,"5’9” 125lbs ordered a Small and probably should have snagged a Medium, sleeves are a little short and it’s more of a roll up to 3/4 sleeve style cardigan on me"
4.0,"very lovely dress ,just was too small"
4.0,I love this dress! Has a relaxed fit I tie a denim long sleeve shirt around my waste with some sandals and it looks nice.
4.0,"I wanted this bathing suit in black, but that color was sold out. The olive green color is surprisingly flattering. I am around 210 lbs and 5'8"". The XXL fits well. A little tight around my thighs, but I am heavy on the bottom half. If you are gifted on the chest, this may not be the suit for you. I am a B-C cup and there isn't much support going on. Cups are nice though. Comfortable. Definitely a good buy for the price point. Go for it!"
4.0,"I got these to wear during my pregnancy. The normal size fits well during the first and second trimesters and I got the plus size for the third trimester. Overall the fabric is very soft and not see through. I wear the leggings almost once a week as they are super comfortable. However, given the wear and tear (one legging already has tears and tiny holes), I’m not sure whether they’ll last for more than a year."
4.0,Great fit! And material
4.0,"Love these glasses! Get nothing but positive comments and I wear them almost every day.<br /><br />While I love the lens, I am docking one star because the frames themselves do not feel particularly high end and the hinges allow the arms to wobble a bit.<br /><br />That being said, the quality still far surpassed what I expected from a $30 pair of sunglasses and I will surely be purchasing another pair of Prive Revaux sunglasses soon"
4.0,The product runs extremely small. Make sure you order the larger size.
4.0,"Pros: This is a great pewter pendant. I wear it almost every day, and I enjoy it.<br /><br />Cons: The chain that it comes with is black paint on metal, and the paint chips off. I wish it just came with a plain metal chain, but it can be easily replaced."
4.0,Attractive and feminine!
4.0,Good mask. May need to adjust rubber on ear pieces a bit to make it more comfortable behind the ears. My only “complaint” is the size of the right. You have to stare at the mustache area in order to see what it says.
4.0,little flimsy but still great
4.0,My son is a Patriots fan. I am a die-hard Eagles fan
4.0,"This is a great buy, no too short and super flattering<br />I'm 5'10and 160lbs, curvy figure. I got so many compliments. Perfect for the office"
4.0,"This was gifted to a close and dear friend, and she loved it. but she did notify me that two was missing. So guys please check when receiving this item,"
4.0,Wanted to see if I would look right with this type of piercing. It is very sturdy and stays in your nose well. Just don’t think this type of piercing is right for my face
4.0,"I had lost a black spinel ring and was excited when I saw this one.  It is a great fit, I love the sparkle and it is very comfortable."
4.0,Good glasses for work.
4.0,"It's holding up so far, only been a week. I put a couple charms on it and it hangs just between my breasts. Think I bought a 26&#34;. Very shiny, lots of compliments."
4.0,"I had to return my 1st delivery because they sent me cloths for gold not ""silver"" as I had ordered . I returned the gold and have received the silver cloths and everything is fine, ""finally"""
4.0,"These tanks seem great for the price; color and fit look nice, and the material is very light. The only thing that would be an improvement is if they were slightly longer, so if you have a long torso they may not be the best."
4.0,"Very pretty and sexy low back but I'm short, short torsoed with large breasts a narrow hips and it was not flattering.  It would like much better on a taller, hippier person."
4.0,Love the look of these hit the glare when you wear them in the sun sometimes makes me choose another pair. Love them though!
4.0,Cute glasses let of people at work love them great price they were not what I thought it would be the shape of lens but they are cute & love the color would recommend
4.0,I like the color & style
4.0,I love this dress. It's very comfortable and I have a large chest so it is hard to find comfortable dresses. It's loose enough that I think I can wear it for most of my pregnancy. I'm currently 16 weeks and still loving this dress. Highly recommended.
4.0,Runs small both pieces and skirt way short
4.0,"Had ordered a Medium and the short legs ride up on me, so I ordered a large and the legs still ride up on me just not as bad.  Also, don't like that you must lift up the skirt part so high to get to the cell phone pocket, wished they had pockets on the outside.  I am an older woman and just don't like this fetcher."
4.0,"It's a much thinner material than shown, and a peachy pink rather than the true pink shown, but overall I'm pleased with it. Keep in mind the Asian sizing."
4.0,It is quality stainless steel but  Little too small  If you’re wearing bangle more than 7 inches  but it is good for me.
4.0,"My daughter loves zebra and her feet grow fast.  Great shoes to slip on and go, she is always in a hurry."
4.0,Smaller then I thought they would be but perfect for second holes
4.0,nice top great fit..
4.0,What I was looking for overall. But the clasp is a bit hard to click perfect.
4.0,"So, it really is a cute dress and a really flattering fit. My complaint really is just that there’s so much of it!! It’s just a lot of material, but hey, it works.<br /><br />Came pretty wrinkled, but can’t fault them for that. Don’t love the material, but it’s not terrible or anything."
4.0,I'm finding the sizing sliiiightly different than there other pairs. The hand size is the same but there more room for fingers on this one which which doesn't work as well for me because they loose their tight high dexterity feeling a little
4.0,"Straps are thin, but I’m quite busty (34DDD) and it holds these puppies in. Extremely comfortable and has pads that are sewn into place which is awesome. No trying to find them in the wash or rearranging them. Thick enough to cover nipples too!"
4.0,"very small zipper pull, have to put my glasses on to see the hummingbird"
4.0,My daughter wore this dress to her first formal dance.  The XS was a little big on her but she usually wears a XS in Juniors or 12-14 in Girls. We chose the QueenDream Wedding Sash Belt Black Satin Decoration Bridal sash Black to add a little sparkle.
4.0,very pretty although a little girl
4.0,Slow delivery (weeks) and product was for a different model and did not fit.
4.0,"Somewhat small in the seat, it is of very good quality material. I wish it came in XXXL.  I would definitely purchase a size XXXL."
4.0,the packaging is very organized. they separate the certain nose rings/studs by looks. the only thing is some of the nose rings are more difficult to put in than others.
4.0,"This is a great variety of bracelets and a couple necklaces. Initially I purchased these to take apart so I could use the beads and charms. Now that they are here, I'm not so sure that's what I want to do. Some of them look fun to wear. The round beads on the white and black bracelets are real. The charms are fun as well as pretty.  I believe I remember the listing say for couples. Sisters, best friends or mom and daughter would be ideal. I just can't see very many grown men wearing these, with the exception of the black bracelet. The magnets on the two necklaces work well but I can't see a purpose they would have. Just my opinions. Not everyone will see it the same way. I have only one issue and that is I'm not too fond of how some of the ends of the bracelets are simply melted together. I haven't had good luck with that sort of securing. Other than that I received ten pieces, all in individual bags. The pieces for the most part are well made, pretty and the price point is excellent."
4.0,Too big need 16g ordered them by mistake.
4.0,This sweater is true to size. I ordered a large. I wear a size12/143lbs with a pudge and it still looks great.Its soft and comfy. Its just the right thickness for a sweater. Its not hot. I love the way it looks on me. It is stylish. The black is not faded. Good quality material also. I dont like the stitching in the front but other than that it doesnt look cheap looking
4.0,"I got these yesterday, and just had to check this morning to make sure what I ordered is the thing I got. Because it's not, really. Reading the ad, it says you'll get 5 earrings, and the one in the picture certainly looks dangly and substantive. The red earrings I got (only one set) are smaller than my ring fingernail, and are posts, without the cute heart like in the photo. The major item in the package, however, was a white beaded 3 heart hair clip. What? Right? I mean, I like the hair clip. At least it's a good size (about 3 inches long) and works. But the earrings have me baffled. They've at least included 3 rubber backs, in case I lose one, I guess. But based on the photo and description in this advertisement for this item, I got nothing I expected to get. I'm still kind of baffled, like there was a mistake at the shop in terms of what got mailed out. Still shaking my head at it. I'd say if you order this product, it's like pulling up one of those ducks at the county fair. You never know what prize you're gonna get. I'm happy with the stuff I was shipped, but it's in no way what I thought I was getting. And if I'd paid for it, I'd be sending it back for sure. These are not dangle earrings. And definitely not statement earrings. That only statement I'd hear from other people would be, ""What are you wearing?"" because the earrings are so small."
4.0,It is just what I needed for my dress.  I order it on a Friday and it was delivered that Monday.
4.0,"32in 166lbs, so i got medium, theyre a little too tight and leave impressions around my legs have to push them way up in where its kind of overlaping with the diaper doesnt quite sit right. but after wearing them i still love both the design and function, they do work nicely, no leaks with them."
4.0,"these run a size smaller.  otherwise, terrific!  going to order next size now"
4.0,These earrings are more narrow Than I would like but they are a great quality and I get lots of compliments when I wear them
4.0,Very cute sleeveless dress. I love the look and feel of the material but after wearing it for a full day it has a few pulled threads and the material easily snags. I will still wear it a lot though since it’s so comfortable and versatile. It can be dressed down or up. Fit true to size.
4.0,More Ivory than white.
4.0,"These are very well fitting sweats but a little on the thick side, not too much though but compared to others sure. I really like the color and have washed them a few times already and are till new looking. Very minimal shrinkage and no rear pocket. Will be very great for cooler months, I was looking for something more lightweight but at least they're not the tight skinny type, I need room to move and breathe @ the gym."
4.0,"Casio edifice is a great watch, together with casio g shock line up. This watch is great, good looking, comfortable and stylish. Pros on this watch are: solar powered, sapphire crystal, chrono, power reserve and working bezel. The appearance of this watch is very striking, and pictures just wont do it.<br />Cons: poor lume. It wont last, and this lume is worse than Invicta’ tritnite. I wish casio put some backlighting or some small tiny led in these baby.  Second: bezel material is stainless steel that is ion plated. I thought at first that it is kinda look like ceramic. I wish it will last. Third: the rubber strap feels like mixed with resin, its hard."
4.0,"Nice product, but low quality."
4.0,Love this! Its soft and lightweight. It does run a little small though.  I normally wear a 4x and bought a 5x and it fits a little snug in the arms.<br />I will be ordering more.
4.0,"This dress fits exactly as pictured. Very flattering. I ordered the heather gray, and it is the color of a comfy sweatshirt (which is what I wanted). I'm 5'6 and the dress is long...about 2 inches dragging the floor in my bare feet. The body fits snug like on the model with slight darting/stitching at the bust area to cut down on bulk. If you are &#34;busty&#34; or prefer room, I would size up one, but not more than that due to the length. The cowl neckline is perfect, not too much, not too little so that it looks &#34;cheesy&#34;. Be advised, the sleeves were a little &#34;snug&#34; around my arms, but I do have some muscle :)"
4.0,"Very pretty pendants. If the chain was heavier, I would have given it 5 Stars."
4.0,"I like the glasses very much. They are a little smaller than I thought. That has a nothing to do with the glasses I just did not understand the mm sizing. Case is nice, shipped in a timely fashion. No complaints."
4.0,"Little bit taller than the others I ordered, still fits alright."
4.0,"Very cute sunglasses and come with a cute case. But too bad, I will be returning them as they are way to big for my 7 months old. Otherwise, for those with older kids, I would recommend. The only thing is, on the picture it shows that there’s a strap, which I thought is included. It didn’t come with it. Otherwise good quality."
4.0,"LOVE the sweatshirt!! Soft and feels great, would have been 5 stars but it is a bit small, I wish I would have gotten 1 size bigger."
4.0,This dress was nice. I ordered the XL. The length was right below my knees as I'm 5 ft even. I am big busted so the dress was just a smidge too snug in the chest but not so bad. The only negative thing is the material wrinkles easy but even then it's not that big of a deal. Definitely get it pressed before wearing though.
4.0,"This is a gorgeous band.  The reason I gave 4 stars is because it is difficult to size it with the sizer supplied in the package.  It was bent so it wouldn’t line up easily.  Also the latch was put on backwards so I had to take it off and flip it over.  If you are low on patience, then this might be something you would want someone to do for you."
4.0,I guess I’m used to lighter and daintier jewelry because the chain of the letter pendant necklace felt really thick.  I honestly felt like some sort of gangster which is not the vibe I’m going for as a mom. I’ll probably put the letter pendant on a thinner chain.<br />Also the color of these necklaces is more yellow and doesn’t look like gold.<br />They aren’t bad necklaces and are great for those who don’t mind larger heavier chains.
4.0,"This is just lovely, but be very careful with it.  I’ve had a “jewel” fall off even before I’ve worn it,  keep some glue handy and enjoy!"
4.0,"Perfect length (I'm only 5'2, and it hits my knees). Lace is soft. Bought the blue with black to wear to a wedding. Washed it in a lingerie bag, and hung dry. Only issue is the zipper gets stuck so getting it on and off takes a bit of work."
4.0,"nice quality, size tends to run slightly large. magnets work well and are quiet. The mitten flap could over lap longer. better for mildly cold weather rather than extreme cold weather."
4.0,Love the color the feel nice for the price
4.0,Fits a bit large but shrunk a little the first wash.
4.0,Looks great have one problem now after changing the time on it the the normal one the hands minute hand or second hand I don't know what it's called it goes around once and then stops I don't know maybe the battery is dead still love it but sad at the same time
4.0,Ok price. Fits as expected. My son and daughter picked the same jacket with out knowing the other picked it.
4.0,The tiara is a little flimsy but works well for the occasion. I wore it on my divorce day and took photos. I am passing it onto another friend who will hopefully celebrate her divorce. Fast shopping and was packaged well.
4.0,"My husband loves this sweater and color, but it runs a little small. I will purchase a size larger and hope it will not be to big."
4.0,"Nice socks, they are getting worn now and I only wear them for special events, plus a little small for a man with thick legs"
4.0,Rain
4.0,"I love this shirt, fits as expected, looks nice and matches well with my SRAM Red components"
4.0,Product was a little big on me and unfortunately not quite what I expected will have to return but excellent delivery wait time and customer service will always earn stars from me
4.0,Love these sandals but gave 4 stars because they do run on the small side.I ordered 1 size larger than I normally wear because of the reviews and I could have ordered almost 2 sizes larger.
4.0,"Good basic shirt, great for layering under a vest."
4.0,Daughter loved it!  Very roomy!
4.0,"Gloves and material are of good quality but, for me, the shade/color of pink was too reddish appearing.<br />Granted, this is of a subjective point of view."
4.0,"Although the shoe was what I expected, it runs a size smaller. Had to return and purchased others elsewhere."
4.0,It actually fits my big head which is hard to find.  Plus I can wear my over the ear headphones while I mow.  The headphones fit over the hat but under the sun cover.  I'm pleased.
4.0,"The hook clips aren't my favorite,  but no one complains,  comfortable,  and the kids love the design"
4.0,Love itgood quality
4.0,Really cool bracelet.
4.0,nice and soft but thinner than I thought they would be
4.0,This is by far one of my favorite belly button rings! I have a problem with the top ball falling off of it though as well as some other ones i have purchased from here. It really is a beautiful belly button ring though.
4.0,Decent pair of sunglasses for the money.
4.0,It fits like a US small to Medium
4.0,"These are pretty good for the price.  I go to Barre classes a couple times a week and these are comfortable.  Would definitely order again.<br /><br />I do however see the toe holes fraying pretty soon, so I am hand washing just in case."
4.0,Sent three of these to my Grandkids.  They absolutely loved them!  The littlest one tried to sleep in it with the necklace on. Her Mother had to explain to her she couldn't wear the necklace to bed and had a hard time getting her out of the shirt and into proper P.J.s  LOL!
4.0,"Pretty overpriced, otherwise I would order one of each. Received the dress and immediately washed it. Washed well and no change in shape. Soft material. At 5’10” and 155 pounds a size XL is loose and exactly how I hoped it would fit. I dress modestly and this size and material does not show my form. Very nice dress!"
4.0,"Loved the style, the material is rather thin, thin to were you can not pull up anywhere near the belt loops- it'll rip! The waist was a little looser than I like, outside of that🤔😊 they're good."
4.0,"It was stated that an XL was a size 8 and I am a size 8, so that is the size I ordered. The shirt ran very large, but I still loved it. I simply tied the bottom and, based on the off the shoulder style of the shirt, it was perfect. I loved my shirt and would order it again."
4.0,Had to return the bracelet as it broke in about 2 weeks.  Would be great it is didn't fall apart.
4.0,A little large...I wear a size 14 and as I had already tried to other brands that were extremely small I ordered XXL.  These are huge - plenty of room
4.0,"Very pretty dress, but the collar line isn't great. The top of the dress pops out awkwardly from my chest instead of laying flat. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the design, or just the way that this dress fits on me. Other than that, I love it. Good fabric, and very pretty pattern."
4.0,"I ordered the red with flowers and this dress is as beautiful in person as it is online.  The material is satiny, which I wasn't exactly expecting for a daytime dress.  Overall, however, the biggest issue was the sizing.  Pre-pregnancy, I wore a 2/4, so I ordered a size small.  I am small chested and have remained small through my pregnancy, but, even at 5 months, this dress was entirely too tight for me to wear to sleep in, much less in public.  I could see it being a good nursing dress, but was concerned that, based on the fabric, it would be too clingy to all those post-partum &#34;curves&#34; that I'd rather not showcase.  I ended up returning the dress for a full refund."
4.0,my granddaughter loves this.
4.0,Nice..  looks sharp on. Shows off curves!!
4.0,"Fits great, looks good on. My only issue is the width of the top/chest area is a bit weird so it's hard to find a bra that doesnt show in SOME way under it"
4.0,"Love this skirt! I got the Medium for the length, but it's a little bit large around my waist. I'm 5'7&#34; and 135 lbs. I might have to get it tailored. It is a very pretty skirt though! I got the pink one, and it looks really cute with a black crop top."
4.0,I like the dress and feel comfortable in it; the straps are loose and when tightening they still stretch out a bit. I like the material and the way the dress flows as I walk. The color is bright and it's a fun summer dress.
4.0,Cute top but it runs really small.
4.0,True to the fit. It is a see through need a slip underneath the dress
4.0,Picture on actual pad was not as defined as picture on line.
4.0,"This is an ok dress but I decided not to keep it.<br /><br />It is a nice quality and creates a very flattering silhouette even for a body with a little extra pounds.<br />The top is made of a cotton t-shirt type of fabric, which is stretchy enough for big bust.<br /><br />It comes with a black belt, but I think this dress would be better complemented with blue shoes and the belt.<br /><br />I am 5'5'' 144 lb, 36DD/E. My measurements are 39.8 (101cm)/ 34 (87cm)/ 39.8 (101cm)<br />I ordered this dress in S and M and both were too snug on me.<br /><br />I feel like this dress has a smaller sizing, more of junior than Asian kind though."
4.0,"These were a bit snug, not great for a wide foot. Very warm and cute though."
4.0,It runs rather small and is not as warm as it appears to look. I ordered a  size large I weigh 130 pounds and there is very little wiggle room
4.0,The item is very pretty.  The shipping is horribly slow.  Dont order if you want it quickly or even slowly.  It will come at a snails pace.
4.0,Bought it for a camping trip but didn't have to use it.  Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
4.0,Works well not every thing I wanted
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:26fd59b4c3e624bd60f2d274185aa359]] I got my regular size, they fit kind of snug but anything bigger would’ve been too big. My first pair of squat toed sandals and the square is almost too square for me. They’re comfy when I walk in them."
4.0,I got the 20 pack of coil keychains to use at school when teachers check out computer carts or computer labs.  This helps them keep track of the keys and gets them back to me safely.  This pack of 20 is perfect for this light use.  I don't think they are the highest quality.  I would say they are an economy purchase.  It is a large pack so if one breaks you have plenty more to use. None of mine were defective or broken.  Two of them had imperfections but it was not going to keep them from being useful.<br /><br />They have a matte finish to them which I am not used to but it is fine.  The shiny ones usually get dirty and lose their shine anyways.  The matte finish also means the colors are not very vibrant.  I don't mind.  They will do the job just fine.
4.0,It is of decent quality but the primary beads are not as illuminate in person.  Nice  but in person I was disappointed.
4.0,"Great length!  I was worried that it would be too short for me, but remarkably surprised that it’s a nice modest length falling to my calves. The white stripes are such that I would require a white slip or leggings for modesty. Neckline is nice. I wish the sleeves were 3/4, but I have a bolero and a star ⭐️ lace jacket I can wear over it for better mosquito 🦟 protection. Have a happy 4th of July, in Freedom."
4.0,It runs a little small and material is a little weird feeling
4.0,this is a sweet set i gave it as a gift so all i can say is it is cute
4.0,"Ad images made these seem to be more of a shiny or glossy finish. Just regular down coat fabric, also my calves are not big and the elastic at the top seemed like it'd be uncomfortable to wear for longer than I did just trying on. They are cute though and likely warm."
4.0,Very elegant and simple to wear it every day. I recommend it to anyone who loves simple looking.
4.0,Great hat with my state flag.
4.0,"This seems nice. It does look like the picture.The lower part is a bit large but it is a nice blouse, I think I can do something with it! I appreciate the quality, not that paper-like material. It is a decent purchase."
4.0,"The fabric is soft and the shirt is comfortable to wear. Not too form fitting. The color is pretty. Even after washing and drying, the color remains bright and doesn't shrink."
4.0,Nice material<br />Sz L<br />Hugs curves + rolls lol
4.0,I enjoy wearing this dress with a nice pair of tall boots and it looks amazing. Very true to size. Would buy more
4.0,"I love my handbag, the color is beautiful and size is perfect, I always buy Ralph Lauren its quality is excellent."
4.0,Shrunk length wise in washer/dryer
4.0,"Soooo flashy!  I got this for a costume, and it is what I expected.  Not sure yet if it's quite right for my look, but I'm glad to have the option."
4.0,"It's a Army shirt, but wanted a Marine corp. one. Otherwise everything seems ok."
4.0,"When these arrived and I first saw them, I was disappointed.<br />When I tried them, I like them as much a the other 4 pair I bought in this  order."
4.0,"Runs a little small. I ordered a 2X because I wanted it huge, and it's about an XL in the chest/arms. It's also not a &#34;heavy&#34; sweatshirt material, but it's heavier than T-shirt material. Also, it has thumbholes in the sleeves! (Yay!) Love it!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:36fbdddc7993aaabecb85192b2fce5]] They put me 2 headbands of the same color, so, that’s why I didn’t give the 5 stars to this product. The size of the headbands was right. But I want the black one that they show, but they send whatever they want."
4.0,"Pink lettering is a little dull, but otherwise fine."
4.0,I bought this for my son it fits great and good quality
4.0,"I like the pattern and the idea and the purpose. Today 6/22/19, I still use it. The threading is starting to unravel. And the elastic has stretch out. I enjoy/ I have enjoyed it though."
4.0,"It's alright, the print isn't as great as I'd thought it would be. The size is bigger than I expected to"
4.0,Love the look and feel. The price is great too! Something nice to wear on special occasion. would reorder again.
4.0,"White stones all pretty uniform in size. Crack lines throughout, but does not disrupt  their usefulness. Using them for painting. A bit unnatual looking but fine for my purpose."
4.0,Fits nice except for the arm holes.  The arm holes could fit my thighs.  They are huge.  I guess I will just take them in.
4.0,"I love this shirt so much but in this particular shirt, the neck is kind of loose. Such a cute shirt for my comfy days!!"
4.0,The fabric on the right heel doesn’t cover the black Velcro. Otherwise they feel and look good. Really cute. The cushion on the heel feels great.
4.0,Love the fly away top covers the belly and looks great. Definitely need strap n water top is a little loose.
4.0,Got Xl on accident.  They fit really nice but the xl is more like a large.
4.0,A bit see through! Definitely need spanks or a good quality slip underneath.
4.0,So I loved the band and thought it came with nice tools and great quality. The only problem was that it definitely does not fit my Galaxy Gear 42mm watch so it probably shouldn't be advertised as such
4.0,"It's nice! Beautiful size and fits perfectly. It's a very light sweater so just be aware that it's not going to help if it's very cold. The only issue I have is that the threading is coming out at the end of the sleeves, which indicates it's not the most well-made sweater."
4.0,"This was a perfect fit with all the right places accentuated. It tapers well and rests smoothly along the body. I am 5'6&#34; and this dress reached my waistline correctly and dropped just below the knee, which I prefer for work. For my professional environment, a covering will be needed on the arms. A cardigan, bolero, jacket, blazer or scarf works just fine. The drawback is that the fabric is somewhat thin so additional undergarments are needed to prevent seeing through the dress. That works well in air conditioned spaces but becomes too much in heated zones."
4.0,love the print and design on this dress. however its a bit too large for me in the chest area. will have my seasmstress make adjustments.
4.0,"This is a gargantuan hat as promised and I love it.  The photo for my particular color (desert camo) was a bit inaccurate, but I was pleasantly surprised as I liked the real thing better than what I was expecting.  Also, the drawstring that adjusts for head size is basically worthless. However, I would still recommend this hat.  It is great for sun protection and hilariously massive.  Would have given 5 stars if not for the drawstring."
4.0,Surprisingly pretty solid watch. I was a little nervous when I first ordered it because I've never owned a mechanical watch before but it's very easy to use. As I walk throughout the day it winds a little for me but I still need to wind it up every morning just a little. If you set it at the beginning of the day I haven't had a problem where it lost time.
4.0,It is a super cute and very comfortable dress! Only downside was the skirt to the dress wrinkled very easily. Love the lace and the comfort of this dress though. Would recommend!
4.0,Glasses work great on rainy nights when oncoming cars are coming at you with high beams on. I normally break sunglasses after 30 days use but these are on the tough side and seem to be holding up fine.
4.0,"I bought several of these and the sizing is all over the place! Big. Little. Just right. Because it fits loosely, the size variation didn’t matter too much except for the really tiny one I just gave away. I ordered a size up. The price is good and the quality is good for that price. I liked them enough I bought five."
4.0,"It’s a good skirt, not see through. It wasn’t exactly what I was expecting which I thought it would be more form fitting. It’s a thicker material so if you already have big hips, it makes them look a little bigger. Still a good skirt though it will be better for winter months."
4.0,The money clip works great. It's not a clip but a magnetic flap. The wallet is nice and soft and seams to be made of quality material and workmanship. 2 top pockets are good. Only negative (at least on mine) is the 3rd card fits so tight it's very difficult to remove. It's really only good for 2 cards but the others fit into the top pockets fine. I think the best front pocket wallet I've ever owned. I'm 66 yo.
4.0,The beads are smaller than I thought...
4.0,"Just received this bathing suit, it fits great and is thicker and better material then expected, great bathing suit for the price,<br />Definitely worth it,<br />I recommend buying:)"
4.0,"Loved the band, color a little off"
4.0,"Very cute and stylish, warm and cozy. My feet are always cold at night so they see year-round use. I love the soft, squishy soles inside and the hard plastic sole on the outside which allows me to run outside in these slippers without destroying them. They are not machine washable but they last longer because of it. Cleaning instructions are included! The fit was a bit loose (I'm size 9) but they keep my feet warm! Since they weren't the latest style, they cost half of what the latest and greatest did. I'm, overall, very pleased with them."
4.0,"Nice sweater, only problem was some of the seams started coming apart before it was even worn."
4.0,The material is super soft. I was disappointed that the medium was so small. I gave them to someone smaller than me. I’m about 5’6” and 136lbs. I would’ve had to return them if I didn’t give away. The length and quality appeared good. They were washed once and held up well.
4.0,This is a really cute comfortable top. The material is soft and thick enough where it is not see through. It has a v neck with side ruching at the waist through hip. The side ruching is always flattering to help camouflage the lower belly area. I love the floral print is really cute and perfect for spring and summer. The sizing does run large compared to other brands from Amazon. I ordered a small and it fit me loose everywhere. This fit like a medium or even size large would on me in other brands. However due to the style it still looks good. I am 5’5” 120lbs measurements 34-26-38. Hope that helps !
4.0,"I just got there today and let me tell u that they are super cute. However, they are super long and really thin so they remind me of a piercing stud. Other then that I love them"
4.0,My daughter loves them.  They are just like crocs.  Very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Mask is a little thinner than others I have bought. It fits as expected. Arrived quickly, sooner than the estimated arrival date. I have ordered 2 and would order again."
4.0,Agradables al utilizarlos . Los utilizo todos los días para tocar la guitarra eléctrica.
4.0,Bright vivid print only issue is that they had a funny smell
4.0,Cost was to much for product
4.0,"I got black tint and gun metal frame.  They're not bad.  I had to replace my last ones because i  bent the frame a little and scratched a lense, but still use them.  Overall quite satisfied with them.  Had them for over six months, and they're great and comfortable.  They're good for the price.  Not bad. Tint isn't too dark either and good size for me. I like'em."
4.0,"This Madeline Kelly line of women's underpants provides enough comfort that their lack of durability is forgivable. These fit nicely but the fabric is thin. Since fabric is lost in the washer & dryer (lint), these underpants will become thinner & thinner with each washing/drying. This is why they lack durability.<br /><br />I like the fit & feel. These two aspects are more important to me than how long the underpants last. Most get stretched out anyway and I need to throw them away once that happens. So, I like these underpants very well."
4.0,"Purchased this for my pebble time.  I'm a female with small wrists and this band seems a bit too masculine for me.  I understand it has to be fairly thick to attach to the watch face, but I ended up going back to a rubber type band that looked a little more dainty.  However, the band is very well made, fits perfectly, and served its purpose, it just wasn't my preference.  It was easy to install and the links were so easy to take out with the tools provided.  I will still use, but like my other bands a little better."
4.0,Nice cap a little pricey for a hat. Guess your paying for the polo name
4.0,great little slipper and very comfy.
4.0,Good relation price-use
4.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful. The material is really great quality and the colors are vibrant. Unfortunely for me, it just doesn't suit my body type. I ordered a size up because I have a large chest. It fits fine in that area, but it's too baggy on the rest of my body. I will be returning for this reason and not reordering. I know one size smaller won't fit my chest. I'm super bummed about it, because it's so beautiful and just what I wanted it to be!"
4.0,"Little bit bigger than expected, But otherwise great quality. I have quite a few cards and it holds them well, but is a little bit difficult to get the cards out if you have more than one in a slot."
4.0,"5&#34;3, 108lb. Thought S should be great for a swimming suit. Turn out ...too small, need 2 sizes bigger. Rippted for the first try. In the trash now. But still like the looks that's 4 stars for"
4.0,Broke the first time my daughter wore it... But I fixed it and she loves it!
4.0,"Bought hat for my dad. Fit a little tight when he wore it the first coupltime tomes, but has stretched some and fits perfectly."
4.0,"Definitely runs small. On the advice of other reviewers, I ordered bigger than I would normally, and they do fit, but just barely. I normally wear about a 6.5, I ordered the medium which says it fits 7.5-8, and they just barely fit. Otherwise, I like them, very cute, nice and soft."
4.0,"beautiful, comfy, not quite like picture"
4.0,Wish there was some options for the front of the hat.
4.0,Really great dress! It fits very nicely and just as expected.<br />The fabric is a bit thin but I don't believe it is see through which is still nice.
4.0,"I was disappointed that the shirt was too large, but the quality was good.  I liked that it was all cotton.  I was able to shrink it a little in hot water and the dryer."
4.0,"Necklace is perfect, but this was suppose to be a gift and the message card looks awful! It’s ripped and crumbled up."
4.0,These are a pretty good deal though hard to put on than the more expensive Thorlos which I also wear/
4.0,"Very pretty from afar. Super cheap material, feels like my grandmother's nighties. Creates a stunning effect. Comfortable. Just dont let other people touch it? Lol! Good value for the price."
4.0,the outfit was nice but when we got it the headband ears and bow were not in with it like it was advertised and it was to late to find them.
4.0,"These are gorgeous shoes! I received so many compliments when I wore these.<br />I ordered them for my 30th birthday celebration and wore them the entire night without being uncomfortable at all. I wore them for a little while before that night as I have a little bit wider feet (not wide enough to warrant wide width shoes) so the bottom part was a little tight, but that was enough to do the trick.<br />Great buy, especially for the price."
4.0,"My daughter is almost 2 years old, 24 1/2 lbs and about 35 inches tall. The length is great....the straps are long on her, but that’s something I anticipated needing to adjust. Very cute dress, I’m happy with it."
4.0,It was not a bad item but it is not for large person.
4.0,Very comfortable. I normally wear a medium but purchased a large as I use these for jogging.
4.0,really cute....quality is average but if you are heavy on the bottom half as i am...than a large may fit a little to tight but passable with a cover up. I wish i could get a medium top and ex large bottom... that would be perfect.. All in all great for the price
4.0,Great pushup bra. True to size. Perfect amount of padding!
4.0,"Good summer shirt to have on hand that goes with lots of things. Looks good with jeans or leggings. It’s not tight fitting either, which I like. I got the red color, which is a true, bright red."
4.0,Good compression for legs especially when standing for long periods of time.
4.0,Very cool my son loves it. Looks exactly as pictured.
4.0,"Have only worn it a bit, will have to see how cool or warm it is when wearing on the golf course on a sunny day to see if I love it or if it's just OK. But the fit and the color were correct, and it arrived exactly when I was told it would."
4.0,"I used to hate t-shirts until I found this cotton poly blend that is SO SOFT!  I'm 5'4, 150lbs and got a large, it's perfectly fine and a bit comfortably loose!  I noticed there are a few spots on the heather grey that look whitish and stand out, but I think it's a few of the whiter ""heathered"" strands that may have pulled out/slight pilling.  It's really not bad, but almost makes the shirt appear a little dirty even if it's not.  It's like ash spots on a dark shirt.  I still like it anyway especially for the price!"
4.0,Purse is awesome I love it...however when they folded it to ship it is has made really bad creases in the sides where the black is starting to come off...
4.0,It looks as the picture but I think the buckle may turn
4.0,Son un poco cortas y la calidad del gancho no es del 100
4.0,Not bad honestly i should have went with the black one
4.0,My niece love this and the right amount of sexy and great material
4.0,Loved the fit and very comfortable ♡
4.0,It does keep my back straight which is great if you have bad posture habits.  I keep it on for 8 hours (while I'm at work).  I will defiantly post up results when it's been at least 30 days.<br />FYI my measurements:<br />36-33-40<br />Height: 5'0&#34;<br />Age: 27 y/o
4.0,"I don't dislike it, just fits a little big."
4.0,"I wear this thing everyday.... very LIGHT control.  If you have a lot of cellulite and want things sucked in this is not for you.  More of a light smoother for under dresses.  It works for me.  I feel it is a bit expensive for what it is but I do use it a lot so for me it is worth it.  I won't wear my stiletto nails, however, because I'm sure i'll poke a hole right through it!"
4.0,"Easy to read, and soft to wear. Great soft strap, but don't know how long it will hold up in super-sweaty summer South Florida."
4.0,"I LOVE THIS DRESS! I normally wear a 3X, but I ordered a 2X and it fits very well. It's a bit tight around my arms, but I have large arms. I wear a 44F and the breast area is still quite roomy. The material is stretchy but not to the point that its confining. The dress is higher up in the back than the front, but I believe that's because I have a big butt. Overall, I am very happy with the dress and will be purchasing again. It looks more chic online than in person, but still quite elegant and pretty. I'm happy with my purchase. It's hard to find dresses like this for plus size women so I'm happy that these companies are finally acknowledging that big girls want and can like FLY TOO!!!"
4.0,"Very comfortable ankle socks. Breathable, lightweight, use them both for working out and just for every day wear. Only complaint I have is that certain pairs were somewhat difficult to get on because the cuff itself was somewhat restrictive. But once the socks were on they were still comfortable."
4.0,"Pros:<br />Durable fine linked metal band with strong magnetic catch.  Should outlast the fitbit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Matte coating begins wearing off in a few days, leaving an irregular shiny and matte finish."
4.0,Came on time and looked fabulous with my costume!
4.0,"Had them a year now and still fit well but the color on some do fade ,what ever size you are you definitely need to order a larger size , if you are 34- 36 you definitely need a XL , L fits 32-34 snugly but works"
4.0,"The bag is pretty.  I love the pockets on the inside of the purse, and the size of the purse.  I'm not super excited about the zipper.  It seems like the zipper it too small for the bag, as it does not extend the length of the purse.  I am very careful with it because I don't want to break it."
4.0,I like these boxer briefs. These are light weight and comfortable. They may be a tad too light weight. I'll have to see how they hold up. The one flaw for me is the boxers don't have an escape hatch or slit for Wee Willy to get out when he has to  whiz. I take frequent walks in the farm land around my house and would hate to be arrested for indecent exposure for being caught with my pants down. (:
4.0,"My better-half works out 4 times a week, and she has several yoga/workout pants for different needs. This one is a basic yoga/workout pants that will be for general use. It is high waist and it also has somewhat of a tummy control , and the material is thin. My wife's other yoga/workout pants are tighter (and she said, it holds everything together), and has a better tummy control than this one. Basically, it comes down to your preference. If you want something basic and not tight, but comfortable and loose, then this one is a good choice. But if you need something that is tight and will hold your body together, then you might need to see other yoga/workout pants."
4.0,"Don't go by size chart, I did then had to return for smaller one"
4.0,I received compliments on this cover up. It looks very pretty on.
4.0,I originally bought this skirt for myself.  But I had to give it to my adult daughter.  I usually can fit an XL around the waist if it is elastic<br />stretch.  This skirt runs small.  But it is a beautiful skirt.
4.0,Gave only 4 stars because the boot could use some support towards the heel and arch.  For the price this is a good swamp boot.  I purchased a support insert and all is good.
4.0,Blazer is a good value and fit!  However!  Cramming it into a plastic shipping BAG is dreadful.  I took the blazer to my dry cleaners to have it steamed - the wrinkles simply would not come out otherwise.  SO easily avoided…just use a box!
4.0,They look adorable
4.0,"First dress I received was not as described - color not brown, it’s peach & did NOT have pockets as described on Amazon.<br /><br />I decided to change my review because I received a replacement and it came with pockets which is the main reason I purchased.  I am totally obsessed with any maxi dress (or skirt) that has pockets and so I felt the need to change my review."
4.0,I really wish there were not the inserts that are foam that pop out all the time in the dryer and over time become misshaped and wrinkled.
4.0,"This is comfy! My only issue is that the buttons are pretty hard to do. This wouldn't be an issue for most people, but I'm breastfeeding so I prefer something with buttons I can easily undo and redo one handed. Overall, I still love it and wear it because it is comfortable."
4.0,"I like the soft fabric, but I had to reorder a larger size, because they run somewhat small. The colors are very pleasing!"
4.0,I'm 5'3 130lbs and this fit perfect! The message is funny! The material is soft but quality. I would have liked if the font was just a little smaller though...but shhhh no one cares is right!
4.0,Was very happy with this dress it's pretty and fits perfectly.
4.0,Love the material and overall quality.  It runs small and was very tight
4.0,Love the color and the fit. I only gave it 4 out of 5 because of this weird triangle that poof's out the dress.
4.0,Fits exactly like I hoped. Added Dr. Scholls inserts for comfort and I can wear them all day long.
4.0,"I thought it would be a little more larger in size, but overall its nice, I'm going to purchase 7-10 more as gifts very soon!!!"
4.0,darn good watch. still got it. just replaced battery after all this time. word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word stop bugging me about how many words to use or i wont say anthing
4.0,Very cute but sheer (white). Shorts or capri leggings work under the dress. For 8 year old.
4.0,"Wife likes the pattern, but wishes it was softer.  Great protection, however.  The crumb tray is a nice touch.  Works well"
4.0,"Un poco feo el material, es la primera vez que me ocurre porque todo lo de la marca ha sido excelente"
4.0,Nice fit and my daughter says way more comfortable than previous starter bra. I only wish the padding would stay in place during washing. Kind of a pain to get them back in place.
4.0,Nice robe.  I'm not crazy about the collar.  It is too high on my neck.  Would of preferred a standard Peter pan collar.
4.0,Really nice office or church dress. It is fitted enough that it looks very feminine but not so much that it's inappropriate for work. I am 5'0 114 lbs and ordered a small. I would say it is true to size. The only draw back is that the fabric is a bit too thick which can make it a little hot.
4.0,Love it but my cuffs are two different golds and I don’t know why
4.0,"It's really beautiful, material nice quality. Flows and moves. I ordered size smaller n still have alot of room. I am 5'2&#34; and it fits like a dress."
4.0,The hat fit my 10 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  The purse was cute but the stap is cheap and fell apart.  If strap was better would give 5 starts
4.0,Deberían pedir una talla más grande de lo normal
4.0,These pants fit nicely. Very good quality for the price.
4.0,"These are nice belts for a good price, but pay attention to the text in the description from the seller when estimating size.  The size chart will lead you to order a much bigger size than you need!  That said, Luxury Divas took care of the return shipping and made sure that I got the right size belts.  I ended up with a size smaller than what I usually get.  So beware!"
4.0,Couldve got one size smaller.
4.0,For dinner and dance
4.0,This dress is very cute and the price is reasonable.
4.0,"I'd recommend size down, i ordered size M but it's a little bit loose!"
4.0,"Loved the shirt! It was shipped and delivered super quick and looks exactly like the picture! I'm 95lbs and 5'6, so a small was a tad large, but nonetheless an adorable shirt!"
4.0,"I love the lace part. It's holding up well after multiple wears and washes. The front is very see through, so you can see the circles of padding. That's the only part I don't like,  I wear it with racer backs all the time."
4.0,Looks better on the picture. The snake imagery looks like it will fade. Daughter liked it.
4.0,Fit well! My son liked them!
4.0,The shirt is nice. Very thin and slightly stretchy. It says go up two sizes but I’m usual a s/m and I just went with the medium and it fits perf.
4.0,Great pants bought three
4.0,"Very cute little goggles. Worked perfectly for the costume and came nicely packaged. Would buy again from this place.<br /><br />I ended up temporarily adhering them to my hat piece instead of wearing on my face, but that was part of the look anyway."
4.0,"I love this sweater! The only complaint I have is that the sleeves are a bit short/tight and it's also not quite as long as I thought it would be. I'm 5'6&#34; and 115 lbs, so I got a medium. Aside from that, the quality is good and I'm impressed with the overall product."
4.0,"They grip the ear pieces very firmly.  Big improvement over the flimsy loop style I was using, my glasses were always slipping out of them."
4.0,Nice product but has an order
4.0,"Size up if possible. I did measurements on my hands & order according the measurements they were provide and it was extremely snug. I wore them cause I had no other option, as far as warmth they def did what they had to do! I wore them skiing and in -9 degree weather."
4.0,It’s a bit smaller than we wanted. Maybe too small by the time summer comes
4.0,This dress is really cute. It would have been perfect if it had pocket.
4.0,I really like these slippers.  They are warm and comfortable.  I would like a little more support as right now I am wearing them a lot and my plantar fasciitis is bothering me again.
4.0,"I read the reviews and some said that it fit small, so I ordered a size bigger than I normally do. It fits a little large on me, but wearable."
4.0,"I was glad I read the reviews so that I knew what I would be getting, especially concerning the fabric.  I am happy with it though.  It was exactly what I expected.  Good length.  Many said they thought it was too long.  I'm 5'8"", and it hit me above the knees.  I thought the length was good."
4.0,Comfortable and fairly lightweight
4.0,"Even it is a little larger for my son, I still like it. it is lightweight and performs well under sun."
4.0,"I really, truly want to LOVE this shirt!<br /><br />I generally run at a 16/18 AND I'm 6 feet tall, so this should have been a good fit. Alas... It is a bit too tight. Good thing we have been working on loosing weight, then it should fit perfectly!"
4.0,"This Headphone Pendant Necklace looks as described, but the measurements are slightly different on ours.  The headphone pendant is 1.25in wide and 1.25in tall - just measuring the headphone portion, not the top.  Its a large pendant but smaller than listed in the write-up.  The chain is really sturdy and looks durable, but is exactly 23in.  I ordered this for my 11 year old son - he really likes the chain, the pendant is a bit large for him."
4.0,"The characters could be a little brighter, but all and all it's a good lanyard for my work badge."
4.0,"Purchased the men's medium 10-11 sized boot. I wear a 9.5 in Nike running shoe, but figured it would be worse to get a boot too small than too big. Seems like the boots run a bit closer to 11 than 10. The calf is also pretty loose. That could be an issue with buying the wrong size, but it's not a huge deal. Boot quality seems nice. They are shipped folded in the box. Not sure if that crease will come out naturally as I wear them out not."
4.0,run a lil small but she still loved them!!!
4.0,Cute top... just not as long as pictured
4.0,My daughter loves this nightgown.  She loves Rapunzel and she walks around getting ready for bed feeling like a princess.  I only gave it 4 stars because it has the mesh type sleeves that go to her wrist and I would prefer it just have short sleeves because the sleeves can be a little difficult to get on (especially after a bath when her skin is still warm/damp).  This is made well- very princess like yet seems to be fairly comfortable (or else I'm not sure she would beg to wear it every night).
4.0,"Very transparent and kind of square. The fabric feels a little plastic, For the price is great."
4.0,Color is good but it kind of fits like a potato sack with a draw string
4.0,"This swimming suit is super cute and the quality is good but the sizing doesn't work well for me. I am a tiny bit pear shaped (smaller bust, bigger hips) so I usually order bikinis that will fit my top and I expect them to be a little snug on the bottom. This one doesn't really fit either though. The top is quite a bit too big (although it does curve in enough at the top that I can still wear it without flashing the world) and the bottom is too small in every way. It's way tighter than I thought it would be and it's quite a bit too short to cover everything. So to summarize I love the look and the feel and if I could figure out the right sizing I would probably love it. It's just too bad that it would likely require me to order one size for the top and another for the bottom."
4.0,Haven't worn yet but looks like a cute comfy casual outfit.
4.0,Beautiful dress! But a little too large on top. Very thin material but is still nice for summer.
4.0,I thought these were actual pants and not leggings but they are still very cute and very comfortable.
4.0,"I really like these but whish they were a little longer.  I'm 5'7&#34; and have a hard time finding longer length jeans, but these are nice with boots."
4.0,only down side I've found with these shoes is that they scuff
4.0,"I wanted something cute for the summer that I could run around in and these are great. Like other reviews state they do have ripped up legs in the back that you can't see in the picture but I thought it made them look cute. The green color isn't really a mint but a darker green that doesn't look bad at all. They washed and dried well with no shrinking and the length was just right for me, but I plan to roll them up on the bottom more so they can be shorter.<br /><br />I will be wearing these a lot since they are so comfy and baggy but not too baggy."
4.0,"Great for small to medium faces. Use them for bicycle rides, have anti-glare and color are really vivid as if I was not wearing the sunglasses. The only thing that would make them perfect would've been the strap for when to put them away at the reach of the hand. The come in an great case that makes you think there's nothing inside cause they are super light. Feels like you are not even wearing sunglasses at all."
4.0,A little sheer but color is pretty and fit is accurately depicted.
4.0,"I would order at least one size up on this shirt. At least it was so for me, I followed the advise of others."
4.0,These jeans fit just as I like my jean to fit.
4.0,"Fit a little bit big. Fabric in white is a tiny bit see-through, but all-in-all a great purchase. I got a lot of compliments on the green version I bought. I wore it with black tights and black boots. The bell sleeve are nice."
4.0,"I wanted a smaller bottle BUT these will do for now I am sure I will use them,"
4.0,"Loved it, great quality. I'm only 5'1 and it was to long for my height."
4.0,WAS A GIFT FOR AN OLD LADY WHO DREAMED ABOUT THIS FOR MANY YEARS.  I AM SURE SHE ENJOYS IT VERY MUCH
4.0,"Basic watch, not bad for the price. Described accurately. I like it."
4.0,The suit fits true to size. The top is lacking support I had assumed it had from the photos. Seems well made though.
4.0,"They fit perfectly and are not bulky, making it easy to drive or use your phone."
4.0,I love wooden watches they are so lightweight and this is a beautiful watch.
4.0,"Arrived quickly, I am a 38D and it runs tight, but it’s supposed to be tight. If you don’t want it fitted, like a glove, then order up . Pretty. I ordered a large. Hope this helps anyone who’s looking to buy this. Love it!"
4.0,"The quality is good, but the set we got only has two color variations, which is different that shown in the pictures."
4.0,"I bought this for a business casual dinner, it will go over a long dress. I like the weight of it, I'm always cold in the a/c so this will help. I thought it would have more of a defined collar, like in the photos but it's not quite there... Maybe if I iron it in the shape I want it'll stay. Keeping it for sure!!!"
4.0,Good quality fits as expected.  Took a bit long to ship.
4.0,looks great on wife
4.0,A tad tight on my thighs but still fits and is comfortable. Very cute!
4.0,Really CUTE!
4.0,"I love this!  It's very soft and comfortable material.  The snaps are so much easier than zippers or buttons.  The pocket comes in handy.  It washes well and holds up nicely.  BUT.. I ordered my usual size, and it is way too big for me!  I kept it just because I thought it might shrink some being 100% cotton.  It didn't shrink, and I assume that I can't exchange it now since it's already been washed.  Since I would rather it be too roomy than too tight, I can still enjoy wearing it around the house."
4.0,"Runs extremely small! Because I liked it I enlarged it on the sides, which made it unique."
4.0,But I don’t need two!!really like the dress the color is beautiful but it did not need 2 identical garments. Some websites bring the quantity to buyers attention. Do you mean to order 2?  That would add immensely to your customer service. I wish you had asked me.
4.0,"I have a 7 1/8 head and it was a little big, I put the spacers in and it fits very well. Luv this hat. Wear it all the time. I am a patriotic individual and I love this. I wear this all day every day and luv it. Hat fits well and I have no complaints"
4.0,Stylish but quality is not that good.
4.0,they are a little small but the material is nice and they are comfy.  Just a little small in how low they are in the front; not too small in the size.
4.0,Top was easy to put on but costs too much
4.0,I like these to keep my tattoos from getting too sun burnt. They fit well although a little snug on the biceps (are my biceps too big? - maybe!)
4.0,Was a little hesitant to pay $20 for kids “sunglasses” which usually get lost or broken within 2 weeks.  After they arrived I’m contemplating getting a pair for myself.
4.0,Love this dress so much but the color isn’t what I expected. I ordered the multicolored black and in the picture the skirt looks black but it’s definitely blue. I haven’t decided if I will return or not because the dress fits amazing.
4.0,"Came is a nice pouch.  Inside of a shoebox sized box from Amazon.  Not happy about the wasted packaging to start with.  Lol  On to the item..  I have large hands but not excessive,  a L in sized men's gloves. It was a bit loose on the wrist.  The stones all looked nice, strong magnetic pull from the hematite and very clear tiger eyes.  The elastic string it was strung with, was thinner than on other similar items.  Seems flimsier than them.  I had to restore other ones in past.  From past experience,  I expect 6 months or less of daily wear before string is too badly stretched or broken.  If you have time, I would suggest my previous solution: using a good beading wire, restring 2/3rds with wire than the remaining with a strong elastic string.  Still stretches enough to get on and off but minimizes future repair work.  You can remove a bead set if needed to tighten it up."
4.0,"This dress is so pretty, & I wanted to love it, but unfortunately, the neck part made my double chin very visible."
4.0,"The look of the clips are great, the durable is a 4 out 5.  At times the clips don’t hold well. Still a good product."
4.0,"It was super cute and very lightweight, much more so than it looks in the pic. It doesn't have the same look to it as the picture in that the material is more like a t-shirt than a ball gown, which I know sounds silly, but if you are looking for something that has more body to it, this may not be for your, if you are looking for a super cute casual and lightweight item to wear, this is it. Very cute, very bright, very light."
4.0,Good quality but extremely tight fit.
4.0,"Took a really long time to arrive but when it did, it was really perfect for my costume. It's pretty well made for the price, for sure. I found that it didn't really sit on my neck as pictured, it was more vertical and the lacy parts at the top kind of fell away from my neck, probably because the clasp is in the m iddle of the thick lace piece. It still looked really good. It might just be a matter of anatomy?"
4.0,Feels so soft. Very cute. Have to my daughter and fit her perfectly. She wears a medium and this was a large. I recommend you go up a size. But every one is different.
4.0,I purchased two. One for my mother and one for my sister. They both loved them.
4.0,Like it I had to re adjust the band. And it is alittle heavy
4.0,Cute accessory to represent my sons love of sport!
4.0,"I bought these compression socks to wear during pregnancy to reduce swelling of the feet and ankles. They are comparable in price but so much cuter than anything i could find in a medical store. I wear size 10 shoes, and my calves are measuring at 17 inches while swollen. The size large fits well. They are long enough to come all the way up to the knee."
4.0,"The material was amazing and comfy. The straps were large making it ideal for larger breasts. I usually wear an XL but have large chest so I got a XXL and was too small. A 3XL would have Probally for perfectly but they don’t have, kinda bummed about it!"
4.0,"I bougth this vestthe firts time that i saw it i was surprise about the materials and colors looks like a military real vest, works excelent<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Juan"
4.0,"Nice, attractive and comfortable.  Fits true to size."
4.0,"Cheap material, definitely priced how they should be. They did the job I guess."
4.0,Really cute but was too small so I returned for a size up.
4.0,"When I saw this dress online I ordered it immediately as I have been searching for a cute plaid A-line dress that isn't undersized for a while. The dress in real life is cute, though it does not look as neat in person and the pleats are not crisp like they are in the photo (I haven't tried ironing them in yet).<br /><br />My measurements are approximately 38&#34;-32&#34;-40&#34;, 34C bust, broad 15&#34; shoulders, height 5'7&#34; and I have long arms and a long torso. I ordered size large and it fits comfortably and is knee-length. This dress probably would not accommodate a much larger bust. The side zipper and buttons work fine.<br /><br />The fabric is medium weight, not very warm or flannel-like but soft and OK if layered for spring or autumn. The collar is cute on its own but makes the dress look very awkward with almost anything worn over it--I tried all sorts of jackets, sweaters, and cardigans with different necklines and collars, and nothing looked great regardless of whether the dress' collar was tucked underneath or layered on top. The collar is also low in the back so it doesn't provide much warmth. Luckily there is enough room under the dress for me to wear a lightweight wool T-shirt and the dress looks good with a black scarf.<br /><br />The removable sash that is included is made of the same fabric as the rest of the dress. It is cute but I replaced it with a black belt with a cutout pattern to break up the monotony of having a single pattern and think it looks much better that way."
4.0,This two piece set is super cute! I am smaller chested so I had to wear a strapless bra underneath to fill the top out. But I am very short so was worrying about it being awkward length since the model in the photo looks tall but it fit great!
4.0,It was a great substitution in a very short notice
4.0,Love this dress! Wish it came with washing instructions but such a steal and many compliments.
4.0,"I'm really sad. I really like this sweater but it ripped and I only was able to wear it couple of times :(<br /><br />Update: Futurino got in contact with me, were extremely helpful, and will give me a 100% refund on the sweater. Awesome customer service :)"
4.0,Make sure you size up it because it was too small for me.
4.0,The image makes the dress appear more lose fitting and flowy.
4.0,I would suggest moving up a size as mine is a little snug. But the overall fabric and coverage is great.
4.0,"A little too big for my small head, but great quality. I love mines."
4.0,I like the watch. It’s just so small. And I don’t have huge wrists
4.0,I wear these a lot
4.0,"These are pretty good, my only complaint is that the waist is pretty tight and occasionally rolls down a bit on me. That’s annoying, but I can deal with it. Otherwise these are great for workouts."
4.0,Not as large as I would’ve liked.
4.0,Buy a size up. Nice material
4.0,Like fabric
4.0,The material is very soft and yet not flimsy.  I like the color (coral) and the fact that it has pockets. They fit perfectly and are the right length for me.  One aspect of it that is bothersome is that the pockets stick out and are not as flattering in the hips.  That is really the only suggestionI would have is to make pockets a bit tighter.<br />Christine
4.0,Too cute adds a touch of sophistication to an outfit.
4.0,I really liked it! I am 5'2&#34; 120lbs and bought a small. It was made for someone with a much longer body than I. It fit well everywhere was just way too long!
4.0,"DISCLAIMER: I have been given this product at a discount for my completely honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I'm actually pleasantly surprised by these earrings. What originally attracted me to them is that they are nickel free. Many earrings give me allergic reactions, so I typically need surgical steel. These did not give me an allergic reaction. They feel sturdy, yet they are light and easy to wear. With that said, I do not suggest sleeping in these, as they do feel pointy and pokey if you lie down on them. They are a very cute pair, perfect size and style for any occasion. I give these a 4 out of 5 simply because I am not sure on what type of stone these are, so I'm not sure if they are worth the list price of $22.99. I do appreciate that they come with two different styles of backings. They are very beautiful earrings, nonetheless."
4.0,"Brilliant idea and easy to use. Only criticism is that the converters are a little too big to &#34;hide&#34; behind many pins so they show. Maybe if they were smaller, or if they were straight rather than round, they would be better camouflaged. But for the price, it is well worth it, even if it only works with some of the pins I wanted to wear as pendants."
4.0,Maybe I just picked the wrong size.
4.0,Love them!!! Very sparkly
4.0,Love these they are beautiful.
4.0,"I bought these because I have a number of mesh shoes which are terrible to clean.  This gives background to the mesh areas, allowing me to thoroughly scrub them back to white and clean.  For that purposes they are great, don't think they have quite enough spring action to be a true shoe stretcher."
4.0,"It runs very small. I’d normally wear a M so I ordered an XL knowing it was made in China. It fits nicely but barely, and I have a small waste. I do like it. Very cute for summer - but buyer beware."
4.0,Nice bag. Good organization. Perfect purse size.
4.0,I like the sunflowers
4.0,"Worked perfectly for a costume as Phineas and Ferb's mom for our homecoming parade float! I wore it over a white button-up shirt, and the fit looked nice. Everyone my age (15-16) said I looked like a mom, and everyone my mother's age said they would wear it day-to-day!"
4.0,Really pretty. Great size. Love it.
4.0,"I LOVE the burgundy one I got, but the white one has a lining that is hemmed about 2 hinches higher than the actual Hem, which makes the lining very very noticeable. I am sad I have to return it, but to me seeing your lining underneath is fashion faux pas."
4.0,I like the filter pocket and the adjustible loops.
4.0,Adorable! Fits perfectly. The fabric is very soft . The zipper sticks a little at the top so it only gets four stars.
4.0,They were perfect for 2 months! Then they fell to the floor & one of the lens fell out! I wasn't too shocked cause of how much they cost but other than that there worth it cause of the price :) !
4.0,Nice strap like the closer
4.0,these are ok but a bit too big for my glasses.  also hard to clip  on.
4.0,"Nice coat, well priced.  Wish the sleeves were a little bit longer, and  it comes up just a little too high under the chin on me"
4.0,Pretty.  Will pair well with summer dresses...
4.0,Feels great and wears great.. I just wish the band was alittle tighter on top of my foot. Between toes feel fine tho.
4.0,Bought this for my daughter who is 4’10’’ and 97lbs and and the small fit her really nice.
4.0,It fit well and wasn’t too short. It arrived without any wrinkles. I like the print pattern.
4.0,Fits perfect. I'm 5'7 138 ordered a Med.
4.0,"These shorts were an excellent purchase choice (I bought two different colors), extremely comfortable due to the correct fit, kneecap length and lightweight cotton material weight for me. They haven't shrunk and although they're 100% cotton, the material is linen-like, which gives them a nice casual look without worrying about some wrinkling.  Looks like they're unavailable right now, but I recommend them for a fine value if and when they're offered again."
4.0,"Adorable! A little harder to bend than some of my other earcuffs, but it does the trick"
4.0,It is okay for the price. Runs small but cute.
4.0,Runs a little small. I do prefer a loose fit though. Adorable and well made. I'm large busted.
4.0,I like these pants and style but they are not made for women with hips. These are mostly for women in USA that are probably a size 12 and below.
4.0,"This dress is super cute. I love all the details on it. My only complaint is that the pictures & the price make the dress seem like it is going to be made of a thicker material. It is not. The material is very thin, which is great for summer wear, however, I think in the right lighting it might be a little see through. I made my daughter wear a pair of sleep shorts underneath it just in case. Other than that, this dress is beautiful, and fit perfectly."
4.0,This leggings are almost perfect . They’re the right height for high waisted . They are squat approve and they make my butt look great . People have came up to me at the store and gym to ask me where I got my leggings from. I like the material it’s really stretchy and comfortable to workout in.My only complain is that I wish the material was more  tricker to hide my cellulite.
4.0,"It's not what I was lead to believe I was ordering, but that could have been a language misunderstanding. It is essentially long underwear. It buttons in front and you have to take it off to use the restroom. It is not sexy as they protray it, but it is very well made and worth the price for long underwear as they are extremely warm and hold in your body temperature very well. Match them with some good thermal bottoms and you are ready for any winter experience.<br />One thing to keep in mind they do fit smaller than size probably because they come from China and if you are large up top like me keep that in mind when ordering. They are a very good value for long underwear.<br />I got an extremely marked down price for these, but I still almost did not review them because they were not what I was told they were, but I realized that they are still a very good product."
4.0,"Really cute, the material isn't cheap and its made of a real net material. It's not made of that cheap yarn material. Only thing is that it seems a little long."
4.0,Warm&cozy
4.0,I loved this dress as much as everyone else except that the back and sleeves on my shoulders would not stay. If you buy this dress invest in double sided tape.
4.0,"Comfortable  bra, color is very pretty..However,  I must agree with other reviews,  it does create an uniboob. Also, the material is sheer so nips will probably  stand out but not a deal breaker."
4.0,Such a cute shirt! The length is a bit long but that just makes it perfect for tights!
4.0,Absolutely beautiful - bought it for my husband who is a music teacher for Valentine's day and it was a hit!
4.0,"Kind of big, had to use pliers to make it fir me but super cute otherwise."
4.0,"this is exactly what I need for a trip for work.  Small, fits my cell phone and all necessary IDs and money."
4.0,"Muy buen artículo.me gusto mucho ,gracias"
4.0,Truly a fantastic watch quality built and quite stylish
4.0,"Super cute dress in a petite fit. I'm only 5ft 1in and 95lbs, so it was plenty long on me. I am small chested,  so the top was a little large and showed an inch of my bra above the solid material. It was a little gaping under the sleeves, but I could have taken that in. The zipper was also kind if wonky, angling out away from my back several inches. It was super cute, and I was happy with thr petite fit, but I returned it for a dress that I felt needed less alterations."
4.0,I am a barefoot runner and they are used when frost is on the ground. I should have bought the next largest size
4.0,Seemed way too long until we washed and dried it then it shrunk enough to pretty much fit as expected
4.0,The tie dye hoodie is vibrant in color and fot as I expected it to.  The recipient loved it!  It could stand to be a heavier weighted material for the price.
4.0,"Super cute, a bit long in the crotch but I kept it to wear to the park or grocery shopping...very comfy!"
4.0,Was a nice color and size.
4.0,"Sooo pretty though! 😫 this is the second fancy wrist band I’ve bought and have to return. Although nothing missing on this one; very pretty look so beautiful on with the rose gold but I had to have help. I could not get on or off alone. My mate had to come to my rescue. (Bummer now I have to keep him) if it had been for that taking on and off with assistance only I would have kept it.<br />So unless your mate doesn’t mind assisting all the time or you have incredible agility, move on to another choice. My search continues for a fancy wrist band."
4.0,I believe it’s not 100% made of cotton. But looks good and I like it.
4.0,"Very comfortable and well fitting, but the seams on the wrists ripped within the first week of wearing them. Just sewed them back myself because I like them otherwise."
4.0,This dress is worth the money! The only reason it didn’t work out is that I should have sized down. It was too big. I purchased my normal size large and I should have went with a medium for the fitted look I was going for.
4.0,"The instructions are a bit lacking in detail, but it is simple enough to figure out."
4.0,"This shirt is so soft and comfy. It is a oversized which i loved, with that though, it is a little boxy."
4.0,"It's incredibly difficult to button and unbutton, plus there are many buttons. Unless you don't mind taking 5 minutes to button/unbutton each time you put it on, I buttoned it once and just put it on/off over my head like a pullover. Good news is that even though I find the fit a little tight, it's still not a problem to put it on over your head. The really nice part about this blouse is that the buttons are very close together, unlike most blouses these days. So there are no gaps when you sit down. The cut is very flattering and I have had many compliments when I wear it. I would order it again."
4.0,"I am 5&#34;9, about 140lbs and got a large.  It's snug in the top (but the material is stretchy) and  the rest fits fine .  A petticoat (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ES8XGK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) really makes the dress come alive.  As others have reported, the belt is pretty worthless, it has no grip at all - breathe and you will loosen it.  I will be buying another belt to wear with it.  Very cute otherwise and you simply can't beat the price for this much character."
4.0,Looks very cute... very well made. Leather is soft and seems comfortable. Heck I'd like one for me! My daughter has not been able to wear them because they are bigger than I had expected. I will have to update when she starts wearing them.
4.0,Love the colors! Love the feel of the bag! I really wish it had the feet on the bottom so that it would stand up. I think that's the difference between Anna and the true Anushka bags.  It sort of feels like a knock off but I'm not sure if it is or isn't?
4.0,Soft and warm. Machine washable and doesn't fade.
4.0,"I ordered the size I would typically wear (I'm 5'5 and 250 lb, I ordered an XXL) but it was somewhat larger. I wrote it for the first time and unfortunately noticed a hole in the seam a few inches below the zipper, I'll be sending it back."
4.0,"Very blue. Havent actually worn it out yet. but good quality for a fun wig. More than just one use, Not a cheap halloween wig. Its not shedding or falling apart with every time you put it on. So worth the buy. Very pretty, for blue hair"
4.0,"Loved the dress, but to casual for the occasion."
4.0,"Very cute and stylish  hat!  And amazing sun control while being lightweight and very portable. The Velcro used to size does not stay in place that well. So, if you have a small ish head, have to keep adjusting."
4.0,"I order small size since my wife is Asian and she is petite :)<br />Is fit perfect on her, the color that I ordered is soft pink, but it came out little bit soft orange color<br />And she's really happy with it"
4.0,"Nice, simple sunglasses. Great price. They are pretty comfortable. I am very picky when it comes to glasses. This were not too tight and did not hurt my nose. They are lightweight. My only dislike is that feel a little cheap but you can't beat the price. They even come with a case."
4.0,"There should be a label that says, ""NOT SUITABLE FOR ADULTS"" They are childlike"
4.0,Gave them as a gift.  Waiting to hear.
4.0,I just received it today.  Would have to come back in two weeks to tell you the results
4.0,"The material is lightweight, not quite what I expected quality wise. However to my delight it has lasted and is durable. I love wearing it to a casual dinner or social gathering."
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE the leggings from Leggings Depot!!!  The patterns and colors we bought looked just like the pictures.  My only complaint is that they run much larger than Lularoe even though the quality is very similar.  My daughter is a size 0, can wear the OS Lularoe, but needed me to take in the inseam over an inch down each leg.  I am a size 2-4, and they sag on me around the ankles (they are longer than Lularoe as well) and the backs of the knees and have a loose fit feel.  I would say if you are a size 8-12 and are at least 5'5&#34; (I am 5'6&#34;), these will be a great fit.  I would have given a 5 star rating for the quality for the price if the fit was better for what is advertised."
4.0,Son enjoys it
4.0,"Quality wasn't the best and material see through, but for the price okay. Fit was good with the short sleeves."
4.0,Took a while to arrive but it was pretty decent. Shiny and cute.
4.0,"These are good for what they are - a cheap pair of sunglasses. Are they super high quality lenses? No of course not, but for the price, the quality is pretty good. And they look cool, which is *most* important, right?!"
4.0,I ordered a medium and they are a little snug. I was hoping to get something that would cover for around family but it seems like all other short I own that they get stuck up my backside.
4.0,Made pretty well.
4.0,Stones are smaller than they appear in the picture. And the names are also very small but overall very pretty
4.0,Nice colors. Very slimming.
4.0,"I bought this dress to wear over my swimsuit while camping, at the beach, and taking the kids to the pool. I really like how the dress has a silky feeling to it. I wore this dress with one of my swimsuits that are black with white polka dots and I was able to see the pattern through the material, so if you plan to wear this as a summer dress you may want to keep that in mind. The fit was very flattering and I can this looking good on just about any body type, I'm on the short side at 5'0&#34; and a curvy 167 pounds. There is a string in the front to tighten the dress under the chest, after I tied it up I didn't really notice a difference in how the dress fit, I do like that the tie is on the inside so you don't have to worry about a tied string showing. I washed it and it washed and dried very well, it came out of the dryer without any wrinkles and was ready to wear. I plan to wear this with some leggings on a cool night or when I need a cute outfit to run errands in once swimsuit season is over.<br />I did receive this product for free or at a discounted price in return for my free and unbiased review. The discount did not influence my review in anyway."
4.0,"Gorgeous dress, fit for size S is a little bit off but I can live with it."
4.0,It will dress up or down; and the workmanship is great.
4.0,"Maybe a tad big ,but very wearable. I really like the fabric and color."
4.0,Good safety glasses with large nose pads
4.0,Very cute but shows sweat marks a lot
4.0,"For most people, this is a good deal and a good product. For me, however, the band was a little short when fitting it around my wrist. Easy to install, looks good, wears comfortably otherwise."
4.0,Nice looking and slim fitting shirt. I'm 5' 11&#34; tall and 180 lbs with a 42&#34; chest and I ordered the XL size it fit nicely. Overall a good value shirt that you don't have to iron if you don't over dry.
4.0,Can't charge in band but works well otherwise
4.0,"I was pleased with my purchase of Dynamic 80's fishnet gloves. They arrived quickly and looked exactly how they are pictures here. They don't seem like they will turn out to be really durable, but they suited my purpose (80's theme party)."
4.0,"I have a nice Carthart sweatshirt...but it's black and everytime I go into a store in the mountainous area where I live, people look at me as if I'm going to put up the hood and rob them.  So I needed a different color...one that wasn't so intimidating."
4.0,The underarms darkened pretty quickly. That was disappointing. And it took ages to get here. But it is beautiful and it fit better than expected.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for but largest size still too fitted to suit me. I passed on. Zipper does NOT glide as smoothly as I wished.
4.0,"Works great, keeps glasses from falling off my head when working."
4.0,Perfect for larger sunglasses.
4.0,I really like this wallet.
4.0,Live the shirt but it was to small. The fabric doesn't have any give to it.
4.0,Nice job = quick and efficient
4.0,"It's simple, but it looks good. A little bit large for my year and a half girl, but it's ok, I liked it!!"
4.0,"If there's one thing my grandson loves to say, it's: &#34;Green. It's my favorite color!&#34; And these are GREEN!! He loves them and they're very bright! But they're hard as hell to get on!! The foot opening is not big enough! Quality is fine overall."
4.0,Nice red color. Wider than most of my other glasses  rhinestones bling look great against the red color. Glasses are nice tint and good sun block so need to squint. Can also see I phone where a lot of other glasses you have to take off to see screen.
4.0,"While expensive, this is a great belt.  I had trouble choosing the size (why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5).<br /><br />My suggestion is that you take seriously their data that shows exactly how long their belt length is for each size, measure the belt that fits you best, and go with that length.  I'm a 35"" waist, and even though I ordered the medium length, it's a little long once you insert the pin into the belt to secure it.<br /><br />It's hard to find a grey belt that is not too dressy, but can be used with dress pants too.  Great belt."
4.0,Sizing sucks. I'm normally a large - xl. Ordered a xxl to account for their sizing issues in reviews. Still doesn't fit!
4.0,Grandson will like
4.0,I love the way these fit.  I wish they were a little slimmer in the waist to match the legs though.  The legs fit great but the waist has quite a bit of room making for an odd sort of fit.  I have to wear longer shirts to make up for the gapping weirdness.
4.0,"Nice product, good presentation in velvet bag."
4.0,It fits perfectly with some extra room. I gave it 4 stars because the blue is a lot lighter than the photo. It's a nice shirt and comfortable!
4.0,Hats were fine. Very thin and flimsy. A little large for 3 year olds but they didn't wear them anyway. Just made the themed party more fun to have them. They arrived a day late and the day before the party. The box arrived all smashed in on one side but the hats were easy to pop back in shape
4.0,They do the job and fit well.
4.0,Got these on sale & happy w/ them.
4.0,one of the bands is overlapped. Oops!
4.0,Thin material. But very comfy.
4.0,Nice bag. A little too big for my 5 ft frame. But well made and trendy.
4.0,Stay true to size or a size smaller. I can't wear it at all.
4.0,"If you’re looking for a good faja this is the one! I’ve had no issues besides going to the bathroom I prefer to just unbuckle and go instead of using the little hole provided I’m too worried about going on it! Other than that, it fit me amazing of course you have to stretch it out when you first get it but once I got it on and wore it for a while I fell in love! I have a short torso and it came up just under my breasts. I ordered a size larger and thankfully I did or it probably wouldn’t have fit me. Perfect for postpartum pregnancy use!"
4.0,Great for the earrings I needed them for. Easy to use and the correct threading too.
4.0,"This is cute but not a sweatshirt, you’re cold bc it’s not a sweatshirt lol, it’s lightweight shirt material"
4.0,"Size down, very cute!!!"
4.0,"I was a little worried about buying jewelry from Amazon, but this bracelet is very pretty and just the right size."
4.0,Cute dress. Fit great in the waist and bust but at 5’9” this dress was far too short. Had to return.
4.0,"I took their advice and went up a couple sizes, because the 'fur' definitely makes them feel tighter.  They are comfy and warm."
4.0,"What I like about this vest is that it’s soft, it looks exactly as photo. I like that it has two functional pockets and it’s overall a good quality vest. That is true to size. I probably could have sized down for a fitted look.<br /><br />What I disliked,  was the arms openings, it seems rather large and bulky. It would not lay flush with my shoulder. Making me appear to have shoulder pads.For that reason I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />Overall, nice colors, quality material and lightweight."
4.0,"pretty dirndl. The red is not a bright, true red, but more of a burgundy/maroon color. The picture makes it look like a true red. I think I would’ve liked it more if it had been a true red. It fit nicely and was comfortable to wear."
4.0,Fine and fits well. Good for the price.
4.0,Cute. Nice colors
4.0,"Love these but, I wanted them baggy the xlarge is tighter than I thought they’d be."
4.0,"Fits Great!  Love the print, blue and white floral with tulips.  Was excited to receive so quickly.<br />However, I was very disappointed to discover that the dress I received did NOT have pockets as mentioned in both the title and product description of this item (took off one star for this)."
4.0,"We were planning a weekend get-away at the Kemah Boardwalk and I didn’t want to lug my purse around. I also didn’t want to use a backpack. And, I wanted my hands as free as possible. My daughter suggested a Fanny Pack. Good idea!<br /><br />I personally wanted something to hold my wallet, cell phone, driver’s license (for id purposes), keys, and my tiny snap and shoot camera. That’s it, nothing else.<br /><br />When my Fanny Pack arrived, I packed the things I wanted to have handy in it to give it a try. It is the perfect size for those things. Not bulky and cumbersome and not too small either. The fabric is light weight, not too thick.<br /><br />This Fanny Pack is perfect for what I needed it for.<br /><br />What can you carry in a fanny pack? You can carry many things in these handy little accessories, like those items I’ve listed above and more.<br /><br />Be aware! If you try to fill it with too much stuff, you will run into a problem.<br /><br />Have you ever used a fanny pack? Do you have one now? If you have never used one, you should give it a try. You’ll be happy with the freedom these handy little accessories provide your hands.<br /><br />I recommend this Fanny Pack."
4.0,Very pretty and very adjustable. Arrived fairly quick.  Just a lil pricey in my opinion
4.0,"Really cute dress.  A little fitted in the shoulder, but looks good.  Would recommend to anyone who likes to hide a little bit of tummy."
4.0,Was really nice and the colors are great.  I would buy again.
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and ~127lbs. The small fit very well, and looked beautiful on. The material is high quality and the stitch work is good.  I'm removing a star due to the lace neckline not laying flat. The scallops would often fold in in themselves as I moved around. I wore this in 85 degree weather and was a bit sweaty, so I'm not sure if it would fare better in cooler temps."
4.0,Bought these hats for a dress up party they came in two packs which was nice. They were shipped flat and never really came back to life. I had to stuff the top with paper to get it to stand up. They worked ok for what I needed.
4.0,I like how this outfit fit!
4.0,very nice wrap
4.0,"I thought they had zippered legs, but don’t, and would have preferred if they did."
4.0,wear them when driving and fishing good to reduce glare from reflecting sun.
4.0,smaller beads than I expected
4.0,I liked the shirts and how they feel. Just too short for me.
4.0,I ordered this in green and its beautiful. Very lightweight and fits true to size.
4.0,"Really liked the material, not too clingy and drapes real flattering on your shape. Blue was a nice true blue and am very pleased with this purchase.!"
4.0,"Great colors, and super soft.<br />I love the weave and the funnel neck.<br />Runs a bit big -- so order accordingly.<br />Very pleased--will be a great sweater this winter!"
4.0,"Adding this: very soft etc But be warned: Wash before wearing. The black dye transferred to my skin, making me look like I desperately needed a bath!<br /><br />Plus: extremely soft, top has lots of room if you like a looser fit.<br />Cons: waistband on pants just a bit tight.<br /><br />So, the top is a roomy medium, the bottom a bit snug. Large bottoms might be too large.<br /><br />I’m keeping them because I love the top, and may pair it with a diffferent bottom. Not the best outcome, not the worst either."
4.0,"Wand is a total piece of junk, even my 7 year old thought so. The tie, scarf, and glasses are where it’s at though!"
4.0,Buena calidad de la maya en general. Pero la pintura de la parte metálica al poco tiempo se removió.
4.0,I love this bathing suit. It's adorable and well made. But it IS VERY SMALL SIZING.  Example. I'm 5'8 and 190 lbs. I normally wear size 12/14 US. I had to order a 4xl. I probably could've gotten a 3x if I had a smaller chest (c cup or less) but alas I'm a 38D.  So for me the sizing chart was correct.
4.0,"My wife had this on her Christmas list, and she was excited to receive this. The quality is good, nice design."
4.0,Really love it tho
4.0,"Cute, well made. Would recommend."
4.0,"These are beautifully shipped in a zippered durable bag, wash well and are brilliantly white.  Great for summer!  They do, however, run large.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 150 pounds.  I got a medium and should have bought a small.  If I hadn't already worn and washed them once, I would have exchanged, especially after seeing a picture of me wearing them.  I would definitely recommend.  Good quality material."
4.0,I bought it just for cutting and dying my hair at home. It turn to be very cute! received compliments from my sisters
4.0,"The lenses them selves are amazing, best sunglass lens out there in my opinion. Frames feel a little cheap compared to some Serengeti sunglasses I had in the past. Which is why they lost one star."
4.0,if anything was wrong with it you would be the first to know.
4.0,"The price is great! They look cute, and they have good elastic for holding them up better than some other brands.<br />They shrunk, (some of them quite a bit) after a few washes, and that was disappointing because I was hoping my daughter could use them for longer."
4.0,"Very loud ticking noise, according to my wife. Other than that she loves it."
4.0,Fit as expected but shrunk a little after first wash.  Hoping it will not brink each time after a wash. It is thinner than other bamboo socks. I'll wait to see how they wear before ordering more.
4.0,Fits great. Looks super cute on. Very warm.
4.0,"Straps are a little tight, good coverage and support"
4.0,"La impresión es de muy buena calidad, pero deben alinear mejor los patrones y asegurarse de que los tamaños se correspondan con el estándar establecido, si lo vas a comprar pídelo 2 tallas encima de la que regularmente usas."
4.0,I liked the product because it fits my boobs comfortably.
4.0,Cute dress. Arrived a little big but dress was as expected
4.0,"better pocket design than the original overshort, sadly they didn't have it in my size so i ordered a size up and it's pretty loose.<br /><br />this version has the zip mobile phone pocket, and the front pockets are the top split pockets like jeans, opposed to the side split khakis style pockets (side split pockets = stuff spilling on to the floor) so kudos to giro to updating the pocket design!<br /><br />I feel like there is something with the trim that i don't like as much as the original overshort, but maybe its just the bigger size bothering me. overall, this is another really well designed, durable, and stylish overshort from giro. i'll keep an eye on these and probably buy another pair in my size if they go on sale."
4.0,Pretty and good quality for the price
4.0,"Masks are very attractive and well made.  Unfortunately, not a tight fit, so if you're using them for Covid protection, you should wear a mask underneath."
4.0,Once opening the box I knew I made the right choice I quickly cooled pressed it and wore it out for dinner! Thus top is so cute I only gave it four stars because it had strings hanging on the sleeves  which were quickly cut off
4.0,"Very nice looking necklace. Arrived in a pretty box suitable for a gift. Quality seems good.  I thought it would be just a little thicker, but not a deal breaker.  My teenage grandson loves it."
4.0,"I love the thought and idea of the gaiter but it's kind of big, Despite having ear loops, it's still too big and often slips down. I've tried gaiters from other manufacturers that fit more securely. A few stitches in the back made this one fit much better."
4.0,"My feet have become wider as I age, and many shoes and slippers will not fit despite being my size.  These fit very well, as if they were a wide size. They are also vegan.<br /><br />Several health issues give me a tendency to be too cold, but these are wonderfully warm and make my feet completely comfortable.<br /><br />The fake fur can be folded up to slightly increase warmth and coverage.<br /><br />I'm pleased, would buy these again."
4.0,"Cute earrings, size is great. Only downside is the length of insert is quite short."
4.0,Pretty dress but I ordered it to Big.
4.0,"The dress was very cute, wore it for my bridal shower. I do think that it runs small and is cheap material, but it did the job and I was satisfied."
4.0,"I did not have any of the problems others mentioned about size, quite the opposite in fact. I ordered the size above as other recommended, and it actually did end up slightly too big, so I might literally just order another one.<br /><br />The package itself got here several days earlier than the estimate! I was very surprised and pleased. The engraving looks really good. Like I said, I accidentally ordered mine a bit too big, so I'm wearing it on a chain around my neck right now. It spins freely and it's just generally really cool. Mine says &#34;Laughter&#34; because I'm a My Little Pony nutcase. I'm very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"good nice fit soft, not as warm as i had hoped, but it has been minus here lately, would recommend"
4.0,"I really enjoyed this dress and didn’t want to take it off 🥰. The hem is a few inches short as others reviewed. I only noticed this issue in the back when I sat down. I hope it doesn’t shrink. I think it will be a good for nursing after I have the baby and I’m positive the hem will make sense after delivery. I’m 32wks, 5.2, and 150lb as the moment. I may buy another color after the baby is born because nursing with this neckline will be very convenient."
4.0,"Overall very cute bracelet. The gold is very yellow. None of the gems have fallen out so far, but I’ve only worn it a couple times."
4.0,Decent quality and easy to adjust
4.0,"Definitely go a size up, if you wear a medium/large go at least a XL"
4.0,Product is fine
4.0,"What’s the most important thing about this package is I loved it but the earrings was a lot like on the cheapest side there wasn’t it quickly exactly what I expected,  But overall the rest of the package was beautiful! I recommend that you buy this package but with different earrings I love love love the set.<br />I highly recommend buying this set but like I said with different earrings.  The delivery of my package was quick I didn’t have to wait long that was the perfect thing about it"
4.0,"Would have liked to have purchased it in white, but no such luck. Black is always a good choice if and when available."
4.0,They are a bit shorter then my other 5-inch running shorts but that's okay. I would like to see a liner where I would not need to wear underwear
4.0,Washed well no fading
4.0,the crop top is the only one I can really wear because the shorts are a little too tight despite the fact that I bought a 2XL and I wear an XL
4.0,"Dress was a tad shorter than expected, however the fit was precise."
4.0,Medium. Cute sweater. Definitely don't buy unless you have a big enough chest or you'll have to wear a shirt underneath because the neckline is really long. I have to constantly pull the sweater back so It doesn't fall too low.
4.0,"I searched quite a few pages before coming across these babies, and so far I'd say it was totally worth the time! The gloves are super soft and supple. The lining is smooth and warm. I purchased a medium size, which is my usual fit. While they fit as expected for a medium, I'd say they're on the roomier side of medium. Not a bad thing to me.- It'll allow space for my rings, which is a plus in my book! I haven't tested them outdoors yet, but believe they'll due for temps down to the teens, being outside intermittently."
4.0,"You got your standard safety goggles, the wraparound types, like you’d get in shop class or the scratched-up loaners they give you at the gun range.  This is a nice step beyond that, a ski goggle-type of safety eyewear.  I like the fact that the eye protection is total here.<br /><br />There was one defect upon receipt.  On the right side the sewing of the elastic strap was incomplete or had been done incorrectly and was beginning to unravel—see photo.<br /><br />This comes in adult size.<br /><br />The goggle is very light, not heavy at all.<br /><br />The 1 1/8” wide stretch nylon strap is adjustable.<br /><br />Yes, this goggle can we worn comfortably over glasses!  There are subtle cutouts in each side of the face molding to accommodate glasses.  These went right over both my regular glasses and sunglasses easily, with no need for any adjustment and no pinch or pressure points.<br /><br />You have two vents at the top and bottom.  As a skier, I know that motion is what makes the venting work, but with these you’re not sailing down a mountain, so you might get some fogging.  I used these in my home shop and out doing yard work, specifically using the weedeater.  They definitely were hotter on my face than just my regular glasses, and I did get some fogging from time to time.  Because of the seal to the face, sweat inside my goggles pooled in the front, and seeped out through the bottom vents.<br /><br />I had a contractor over to my house to do some work, and he saw this set.  He was impressed by it, and tried it on.  He liked it a lot, and it went home with him.<br /><br />Documentation: Nothing.  No paperwork at all.<br /><br />Price: This item comes in right about $16, and I think that this is a fair price for an item like this.  You can get the old-school goggle-type safety glasses for a lot cheaper, but you get what you pay for.  These fit a little better, go over glasses easily, and in my opinion offer better protection.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is a nice safety goggle set which fits well over glasses and provides full coverage, at a decent price."
4.0,"I liked the dress color and fit! Dress is a little long but that’s okay. Also, fabric is a little iffy. Not usual"
4.0,"This fit exactly as I hoped, I'm 5'6&#34; about 135lbs and usually wear a size S shirt but I ordered size M and it fits perfect. I also like that it has pads so I can wear without a bra as a swim shirt, or remove them to wear my swimsuit underneath"
4.0,Loved it around the twins.
4.0,Perfect. Love the stretchy material.  Light. Not thick. Just right
4.0,Great dress.  Very flattering and quite comfortable.  Not the highest quality material but I don’t mind for the price.  I bought it in 2 different patterns.  I am pleased.  I bought mediums. I’m 5’7” and 135-140lbs fits great.
4.0,My granny loves them!
4.0,"Generic leggings, warm, soft. The black pair smelled really rubbery/chemical-ish, though. I bought to use for maternity wear, but the band was still a touch too tight. Will be great for a post-partum winter, I anticipate."
4.0,"Comfort of shorts, flexibility of movement for doing different projects and/or activity indoors or out."
4.0,Very nice thought they would be a little bigger though
4.0,I ordered it in a bigger size and she still has room to grow. Be advised the picture looks like it’s a thick material (like a sweatsuit) but it is a thin material. I still like it it’s very cute!
4.0,"I think it's cute, especially for the price.  I ordered a small. I'm 5'6&#34; and about 120 lbs and it's a little bulky. It's a good length for tucking in.  It's that weird &#34;chiffon&#34; material that I'm not crazy about. It reminds me of a parachute. But for the $$ I like it. I hope it holds up in the wash."
4.0,I got this too for a photo shoot with my car and it was perfect! The only negative I can say about is I wish it were longer. When i raise  my arms it came up as well. I’m no teenager so I don’t care for mid-drift show.
4.0,"I really like that these have a good heft to them. They aren't flimsy feeling.<br />I like the colors.<br />I like that the lenses match.<br />They're polarized. Good stuff.<br />The measurements provided on the page allowed me to gauge whether or not they would fit me, too."
4.0,"Runs a little small, but is very long! I’m 5’7 and had to wear heals ."
4.0,Good shoes. Could use more cushioning considering they are Basketball shoes and big people wear size 15 like me.
4.0,Not really as I expected. I have a friend that ordered the same dress and the floral print on hers looks a little different. The one my friend has looks more like the website picture. I tried hers on before ordering mine so I would know what size to get. The elastic was so tight on mine that it looks more like a maternity dress on me. I contacted the company and they are supposed to be letting me return it or making it right for me.
4.0,"the ears are not a hair band type hold, a hair pin type hold instead is used and it isnt that good, the tail however is fine, although i would suggest removing the wire using the steps below<br /><br />1: feel for the wire<br />2: push the wire out the bottom of the tail (there is a little hole where the wire was inserted)<br />3: pull the wire out from the hole and dispose of the metal wire otherwise<br /><br />Overall good purchase"
4.0,These sunglasses are so girly and perfect for summer time. I can't wait to wear them ! Good quality for overall price !
4.0,My grand daughter loved her dresses.
4.0,I measured my sunglasses to make sure they would fit.. no dice but my regular glasses fit in this gorgeous case and sunglasses fit (albeit quite snugly) in my glasses case
4.0,"Received for my birthday. The stitching in one of them in one area on the inside is screwed up. Can't see it on the outside though. On the other one, the neck is out of round and kinda sticks out on the side. AND I was supposed to have received white, but got light blue instead. Other than those things, I guess for the money they were a good buy. Nice lightweight material. I'm an athletic 5'10/170 lbs, 40 inch chest and 33-34 waist and the medium generally fits well. It's almost a tailored look, meaning it's not loose at all, but it's not tight like a compression shirt either. Maybe a little tighter than what the pictures show here. I have long arms and even if they were a couple of inches longer, there would be enough length in the sleeves to fit. Not sure how comfortable they'd be fit-wise for working out because the fits off a bit somewhere and doesn't quite feel right."
4.0,Great product. Tight clasp. Bought for 18 year old son. He loves it!
4.0,"I love the shirt.  Its good quality, but definitely ran very small.  I typically wear a Large in store brand t-shirts.  I bought XL and will be exchanging it for XXL."
4.0,"I'm not one to write reviews but had to write on for this. I was a little nervous about getting this dress because I am curvy. The dress looks great! The material is not see through and it's soft! You wouldn't think for the price that it wouldn't look as good on you as the model , but it def will hug all your curves. I ware a spanx under mine and it even looks better! I got an xtra large. I always get a size bigger on amazon."
4.0,"These socks are super cute and fun. I'm 5'2&#34; tall and wore them for a halloween costcume. They were a good height, but I have wide calf's, so I could have used more stretch. They were just a tiny too small in the width, but I was still able to wear them comfortably with my Halloween Pikachu costcume. Overall, good product and got use out of them."
4.0,Looks and feels great.  All of the Merrell shoes I have purchased have been great.
4.0,4 stars because for what you pay it’s good.
4.0,"Great brush to clean light colored hats with but for the price, you can definitely get a cheaper one that does exactly the same."
4.0,as advertised!
4.0,"The wallet is well laid out-space for cards, a pocket for coins and a section for notes. However it is quite thick and when loaded up with be quite a bulge in your pants, making it a target for pickpockets. The leather is smooth and is completely bereft of the typical rich leather smell if that is what you are after. It's a good quality product and stitching is top notch."
4.0,They're great shirts although the sleeves seem extra long. The one problem is the blue one was supposed to be navy and it's royal.
4.0,"It's got plenty of room for the cards I carry. It's compact and feels nice. The only thing is, it's much more of a red color, rather than the pink I was expecting."
4.0,My teen likes this wallet as it is minimalist & fit well into his back pocket. It allows his to put in up to 6 cards & some bills. The leather feels like nubuck. I would have wanted a small zipper pocket to keep his coins.
4.0,"I absolutely love this earring! Be warned though, it is really hard to get it in the cartilage. I had to open the ring a little more and use pliers to close it back so the ball would catch, BUT doing this did not scratch the metal! I adore how this looks and even my mom (who was not thrilled I got my cartilage done years ago) thinks it is a pretty earring. Worth the buy and it shipped earlier than I expected!"
4.0,Does this come from China I got the biggest size I could I’m still losing weight so I’m not afraid that I’ll get into it but I’m like a 2X or a 20-24 USA 🇺🇸
4.0,"Loved the light and airy linen fabric, and that the dress is lined. I purchased an XXL, but it was still a bit of a tight struggle getting into the dress. Once I got my arms through and straightened the fabric, it was actually quite comfortable."
4.0,Love them! Well worth the price. I would definitely buy again.
4.0,Worked great for our holiday party costume!
4.0,Absolutely adorable!  I gave 4 out of 5 stars because none of them fit my daughter. It's true what others say in that each one is slightly off in size but they are pretty large for an infant. My daughter is almost 4 months and right on the 50th percentile in head circumference but I will need to take these headbands in about 2 inches to fit her which will be no problem since it appears pretty easy. I'd definitely recommend ordering if you don't have an issue with possibly needing to take in.
4.0,"Looked great with my storm costume, a little tight though"
4.0,"We loved the shoes, how they look, and how they feel. We just bought the wrong size for our kid, so we had to return them."
4.0,Great socks. For women! I wear a 8/8.5 and they are a perfect fit for me. My husband can’t wear them. He wears a size 12 men’s. They cut off his circulation.  Wonderful quality. So great I didn’t return them. I kept them for me. Sizing is off. But they’re made in China. So I should have expected that.
4.0,It was a little larger than it needed to be.
4.0,"The keyword to read from the description is &#34;Big & Tall&#34;. My son is about 5'10&#34; and wears a shoe size of 12.5. These socks are big for him and he is not using them. So, please make sure you check the size before purchasing. No other complaints and therefore am giving this 4 stars."
4.0,"This tweed sweater is absolutely stunning and so chic. I’m definitely going to get A LOT of wear out of it once it gets cold. The only reason I’m giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is that it’s a little hard to get on. I wish there was a zipper to loosen it up while you’re putting it on. Another thing is that the buttons are quite loose, however they do provide you with an extra one and they also look very well and not cheap at all."
4.0,"I purchased to wear around the house. i wore it Labor day weekend. I have big legs so my daughters felt it was short, it came just above my knees, but  they told me I looked nice. I have 20 somethings who if they felt it was too little THEY would not have had any problem telling me to take it off. Extremely comfortable."
4.0,"My husband had been always complaining about how huge walets were, how uncomfortable is to have then in the back pocket and then sitting down on it... So I'd been keeping an eye on this wallet brand since I saw them on kickstarter os something like it... So I finally decided to buy this for father's day... And he toootally loooved it!<br />What I didn't love much about it is: this model doesn't offer many options on leather nor colors. I would've preferred a more modern look like blue with some accent details on orange for example as they offer on other models. This cow skin leather is nice with a smooth feel but not that shiny (which can make it look like used or wore out. Another thing, the inside fabric lining makes it feel like a cheaper wallet.<br />These things doesn't bother my husband but me knowing a bit more about materials ans design I just think, for the price you pay, thaey could improve on quality and make them more appealing to touch and sight. Anyway, for now i think is the best option available if wallet space is a top priority like my husband's."
4.0,"This is a very nice chain, perfect for hanging a pendant on. It seems slightly smaller than 2mm, like maybe 1.8 but thats okay. I would have liked it even better if it had a lobster claw clasp but its serving the purpose I needed it for. I will probaby be back to get a 20 inch one for another pendant. It is nice and I do recommend it."
4.0,I really like this jacket.  But I'm not in love with everything.  The hoodie/ collar is kind of annoying.  It's a little tight around the waist.  But something about it is just right it is stylish.  It is kind of classy.  It is form fitting and it's not tight around the neck.  It's definitely  something I would still recommend to others as each body is different.  I received this item at a free or discount price in exchange for my honest review
4.0,I like the necklace but am disappointed that the Pendant cannot easily be placed on Another chain.
4.0,"The number seems well built and sturdy, the chain could be a little better, I will purchase again when team numbers change."
4.0,Nephew (19) really liked it.  Very soft and fairly loose fitting.  Good purchase.
4.0,"The mask was pretty tight and I found it hard to wear without squashing up my face. I would recommend this to younger buyers, since it didn't really work for me. Despite this, the quality was good for the money."
4.0,"Really cute T-shirt, would give it a 5star if material was a little thicker blend.  Wearing it to celebrate Christmas this year, and getting lots of laughs and complements.  The movie is a classic!"
4.0,The skirt was tight on my daughter. I had to stretch it out around a chair two week before the party for it to feel comfortable. I added gold ribbon to it. It overall looked nice. Very strong elastic!
4.0,It seems like it's good quality
4.0,Was really good I mainly use the lil balls for other pricing tho
4.0,"My son has Sensory Integration Disorder and needs sensory input and deep pressure to help regulate his body. This T helps when he isn't able to get that ""physical"" input that is necessary to keep him calm. It fits well with the exception of the shoulder, which are a bit loose. It is really snug, but easy to put on and we call it his hug shirt! Do wish it came in a variety of colors. Overall, a good shirt!"
4.0,looks great but me lady said material wont last . hope shes wrong
4.0,This was great for a Christmas gift! The beanie is a little darker in person than it seems in the photo
4.0,"These are nice shoes but they are much too large, I would recommend going down a size when ordering."
4.0,The top a little tight
4.0,"I am 5 foot 7 120 pounds, if American order a size larger"
4.0,Received with a small hole by the thumb joint.
4.0,Color was a lot lighter than the picture. Supposed to be a darker navy and instead was just a normal blue
4.0,Wish it had a filter slot
4.0,"These are great for my post thrombotic syndrome from a previous DVT, however, after only 3-5 wears they already have a run on the right leg. They are one of the most comfortable compression leggings I’ve found, but definitely need some quality control for wash and wear."
4.0,Very nice looks just like pic
4.0,"I was skeptical when I purchased but I actually love this bracelet. The hair tie stays on great, but the bracelet itself without the hair tie is a little hard to wear and the edges are a bit sharp."
4.0,This shirt expresses my feeling towards going to the gym. Soft fabric. Nice fit.
4.0,"I Received my skirt, and it's BEAUTIFUL!! Can't wait to wear it!!"
4.0,Belt quality is great but the delivery is kind of slow.
4.0,Have not worn these as yet.  But they do fit on the shoes I will wear.  Hopefully they will last for three performances!
4.0,I like this skirt.  Fit as expected and the material is very light and cool feeling.  The one thing that I wasn't liking too much was the wide band.  I thought it was a bit to wide.  Other than that I think this skirt is very nice.
4.0,Great keychain with good detail. Her blades were bent in crooked angles
4.0,Super cute for the price. Nice details especially in the cape it’s gorgeous. Lace sleeves are really tight at top I had to cut them off and turn them into gloves for my daughter. The skirt isn’t very full but we added a tutu underneath. I ordered a xl because I expected it to be on the small size it’s definitely more of a m/l.
4.0,"I have Raynauds and these socks do help. My feet get so cold, they hurt - both summer and winter.  While these socks don't stop my feet from getting cold completely, all the time, they do help.  Most days I can keep my feet comfortably warm with them.  On my worst days, when my feet seem frozen solid, the socks can't warm them by themselves, it takes extra work to get them warm. But for the most part these are a Godsend.  I want to get more soon.  Hope they help you too."
4.0,"Hard to hook on your own, should have other colors to choose from, but overall they cute for a couple of any"
4.0,It doesn’t seem like a real Nike product unless Nike uses cheap material. It stretches out at the bottom quickly while wearing and it is loose on me. I’m 5’7” 185lbs and I ordered a large.
4.0,Nice top... wish it was a little longer in the back.
4.0,"Good quality material, and sewn well. But the earrings  hurt my ears a lot."
4.0,Face a bit larger than expected. Nice watch. Wish the band wasn't plastic like. Suede would be great.
4.0,"Very attractive dress, but it ran way too small. I wear a 14 women's, bought up to a 167-18 size just to make sure it would fit loosely, but was very tight across the bust.  Unfortunately, I had to send it back."
4.0,very nice quality I just wished I had ordered a bigger size my fingers are big. I would buy it again.
4.0,"The tee shirt is fine but I wish the letters were a little smaller, it could be more understated"
4.0,"I got this pair of polarized sunglasses for my husband because he drives quite a distance to and from work each day, driving into the sun both ways. I figured that the polarized lenses that these glasses offer would suit him better than the sunglasses he had been using, which are just tinted.<br />These glasses come with a hard outer case that zips to secure the sunglasses. On this case there is also a hook so you can hang the case from a bag or your belt loop if you wanted.<br />There is also a soft pouch inside, ths seems to be at least two layers. The other layer is mesh and the inner layer seems to be some kind of thin foam. A cleaning cloth is also included.<br />The sunglasses themselves are heavier than most sunglasses I've ever owned. They are made of a black plastic and the ear pieces and where your nose rests are a soft blue silicone. The silicone is comfortable and flexible.<br />The lenses are polarized so they cut down glare from the sun but they also mess with color perception. For driving they seem to be ok but I tried them on as a passenger and I couldn't really focus on anything up close. I do not normally wear glasses or contacts but these lenses seemed to stress my eyes. I would not be able to wear these sunglasses, but my husband does not seem to have the same problem. He did say these glasses sit lower on his nose than he likes so they're a bit uncomfortable.<br />Other than that small issue he likes these sunglasses very much.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Great delivery. Seems well made. Smaller than expected though.
4.0,Very thin and clingy.  Pretty color and design.  It arrived in good condition and quicker than expected.  I didn't send it back.  Instead I gave it to my granddaughter.
4.0,"Boot last, even after several washings."
4.0,"Very nice top but too small for a medium, I decided to give as a gift instead of returning. I'm sure someone smaller busted than me will be able to use this. Nice for summer and color is just as pictured."
4.0,Really decent item for the price. I was pleasantly surprised. They are a little smaller than expected. I had to go up a size from the charts but the quality is nice.
4.0,"Bag is a great size, made from sturdy materials-- exactly what I've been looking for when I don't want to carry a large shoulder bag. Just wish the Sage Grey color was more green like the picture; it's more of a light grey color with barely a hint of green."
4.0,Wife likes it but too short to wear out
4.0,Browned when got dried. Looks really old now. I've worn it twice.
4.0,"I really like this but it does feel like i put on a bag lol its to large, and shipping is to much to return."
4.0,Very nice sandals and very comfortable.  I have had them and a black pair for a few months and they are durable and still look great after multiple use! Highly recommend!
4.0,"Although they only cover my glasses about 90%, they seem well constructed and flip up/down easily.<br /><br />If you have rimless frames, this flip up style is almost mandatory versus ones that clip around the lenses.  They are much easier to put on and you don't risk scratching the edge of your lenses.  Being able to flip them up and down is much easier than fumbling to take them on and off, especially while driving.<br /><br />The only reason I've giving four stars instead of five is they don't fully cover my medium size lenses as noted above.  This being said, they still give great protection against sun and glare.  Overall, a very good value for the price."
4.0,"This was a gift, which was happily recieved, it was love at first site."
4.0,"The earrings themselves are very nice, however, they are somewhat annoying to put on because they are screw back earrings...they have to be screwed on and the back attachment is so tiny that if you drop it, you probably will not find it..I didn't realize these earrings were screw on they should be push back NOT screw on."
4.0,My daughter-in-law seemed to like it.
4.0,They are great for running into a store. They are stylish and very lightweight. The only con is they don't stay up. They fall down very easily.
4.0,Good quality and fit. Look good after washing. Fabric could be a little softer...
4.0,"Love the color and sparkle. The back on the earring is easy to lip on and stays on well. My only surprise was the size of the item itself. It is much bigger than it appears in the photo. Other than that, they’re beautiful."
4.0,The shoes were not the advertised designs so i will regift the gender inappropriate styles. The designs are cute and the slip resistance is useful.
4.0,Wonderful when you can't tie them yourself because of an injury
4.0,"The pants are soft and fit my daughter well.  The top is very thin. Holding it up to the light, I can see through both layers.  She had pajama day at school and had to wear a tank top under it.  For the money, I was expecting a better quality top."
4.0,These dresses fit well and look good.
4.0,"I'm happy with this dress and will be wearing it this summer. It's a nice, inexpensive dress. It's pretty and doesn't feel too cheap, but the fit isn't perfect--the back pooches a little bit despite the shirring--not enough to prevent wear, but it woiuld be more flattering in back with a closer fit.<br /><br />The cut on the front is great--ample cut and full coverage for wide-set breasts like mine, with room to cover much bigger than my 34C. Between the size and the overlap, it's got great coverage. No risk of pop-outs. Consequently, it may be a bit bigger than you need for your size if you're on the smaller end bust-wise--I'm typically a solid medium these days, and while this medium is still a nice fit, I think a S might have worked better with the gapping  in the back.<br /><br />I love the pattern and the fabric is nice, a sort of stretchy cotton sateen, with a nice sheen and a bit of stretch.<br /><br />The only real disappointment in this dress for me--and it's totally random--is that the cups just happen to be cut so that the one light colored area in the whole pattern maps to my nipples, which is totally frustrating. It's like my nipples are framed in the print."
4.0,"Fast shipping, daughter loves the dress. Interesting fabric."
4.0,"Both my husband and I like this shirt/jacket.  He because it is warm to wear around the house, I like the convenience of grabbing it up on the run to a store in a hurry.  The color is a nice shade of navy and goes with everything thereby eliminating having to change to match clothing."
4.0,"Arrived double bagged and secure. Purchased as a bridesmaid dress. My measurements are Height 5'6&#34;, waist 27&#34;, hips 35&#34;, bust 34C.<br />Fit very well, slightly loose in the waist but not noticeably. Kind of a heavy dress everyone says I look great in it. Lace overlay likes to attract things off the ground- dog hairs, lint so careful where you walk. Skims the floor in the front for me train in the back about 1 ft long. I do feel like I have to pull the dress up from time to time as the upper lace portion around the neck is a bit flimsy. Wearing a bustier style low back bra with it seems to be best. Not see-through and looks great with pearls. Darker navy blue color- exactly how it looks on the picture on the model. Very impressed with the quality and would recommend!!"
4.0,"Looks nice, be nice if the size was adjustable so be careful of the size of your wrist."
4.0,This brooch is a lovely brooch for a bridal bouquet. Multi color stones and rhinestones to add some bling.
4.0,"Not as thick as I anticipated, but is comfortable and fits well"
4.0,"These slippers are ok, I feel like they are to square at the toes, fit a little different then I’m use to slippers fitting. Maybe just me."
4.0,"Very good fit, and performs well."
4.0,"I don’t really have any complaints about these, just observations. For what it’s worth, I’m glad we have these shows. My 2.5 yr old can put them on himself and loves them. That being said, for our family’s lifestyle, he needs other sturdier shoes than these that have higher functionality.<br /><br />Pros: they’re easy to put on, water proof, breathable, cute, good for little outings, there’s some extra grippy pieces installed on the bottom of the shoe to help with anti-slip<br /><br />Cons: straps come undone easily, the little rockets popped off within a week (not a big deal since they’re just for looks), not super sturdy for big adventures, a little slippery on said adventures (I know that’s contradictory to my “anti slip” comment above, but if the kid is wearing them on a dusty patch of ground and steps on a slippery rock or something, they’ll fall)."
4.0,Basic black bodysuit. Not much else to say so far...
4.0,The color is ivory not white.  I ordered 2 sizes larger so it fits great.  I've found that out when I order a product from another country.
4.0,I'm about 43-44 inches around in the stomach area in usa. I normally wear a xl juniors or large in womans and I ordered a 3xl and it fits great! Just recieved today so i don't know yet if it works.Only problem is in the pic it shows it goes over the arms and mine does not it only goes around the waist.
4.0,Just as depicted in the photos. Very adorable!
4.0,"I like the suitcase......It did take a couple of weeks to get the smell out...put outside in the shed and sprayed a common spray on a paper towel and put in the pocket...smell went away...took it on a 3 day trip to Florida and it did well..held 3 shorts, 4 tops, socks, pj's, undies, etc....did very well..If your going to  take a 1-4 day trip this fits the bill....or you want to use as the carry on for longer trips it would do very well...I love the size and ease of using....I am a 64 year young gal and travel often and would recommend this suitcase...Thank You"
4.0,I love the pattern of this belt. It's very thin so it doesn't show under shirts. I am about a size 4 and the small fits well. It probably has about 3 inches extra belt so it is a generous fit. It seemed a little flimsy at first but it has held my pants up well. I don't know how long it will last but at this price I think it will be well worth the price.
4.0,Alrught
4.0,"Not very shiny; bought for my 12 yr old, but they are smaller than expected."
4.0,Looks nice!  I usually wear a M in swimwear and I purchased a L based on the other reviews.  5'1&#34; 125 lbs  Order a size bigger than what you usually order...
4.0,"I like this dress! I wish it came in other colors. I wear a large. I'm 5'3&#34;, 170 lbs Bust 41, Waist 35 and hips 43. The hem line comes just below my knee. The material is very soft and comfortable. Also it's thin but not see through and it's stretchy. It's form fitting but not at all tight. It flatters my curves and hides my stomach. This is a great versatile dress for work or casual wear. And the price is good too.This is the fourth MIUSOL dress I have purchased. I've really come to like this brand. Photos coming soon.<br /><br />I have one caveat. The embroidery on the sleeves and hem line are itchy. I can't say it's enough to really bother me but it's noticeable. It would have been better if this dress was lined. And that's enough to knock it down from 5 stars to 4. If this sort of thing bothers you or you have sensitive skin I would NOT recommend this dress."
4.0,"Ordered this band for my Samsung Galaxy Watch (46 mm).  Looks good, however the leather band is a bit thick and stiffer than I had expected.  We'll see if it eventually breaks in a bit more.  The price was very affordable, though, so I can't complain too much."
4.0,Very comfortable and fit was what I was hoping for! I use for warmth and layering!!!
4.0,"Returned these because the waistband kept rolling down. The compression though was fantastic, nice and tight throughout the legs.  I might get a larger size or lose some weight..."
4.0,This is a great item to use for Mrs. Santa Clause outfit.
4.0,"Found this thick gold band with inset diamonds to wear out for fun and to work.  The ring is gold plated so i am not sure how the wear and tear is going to be after a few or more uses. I will have to update this post when its been worn for a while.<br /><br />I like the simplicity of the design while still having a bit of glamour to it. I feel the ring size runs small. I ordered my normal size 6 and its tight, and very hard to get over the knuckle. If unsure-go up a size.<br /><br />Overall i like the look and feel and will update the review when i see how the plated gold wears with time."
4.0,I wear these for mostly camping or for getting dirty. They are a little roomy and not as much support or cushioning as I had hoped. But still get compliments every time I wear em!
4.0,"I'm fine with these earrings except for the price. The blue topaz is eyecatching and has a lot of sparkle, but the quality of the earrings themselves doesn't feel pricey. They are small in size so whatever silver content they have is relatively miniscule. It comes in a pretty box and would make a nice gift, but I doubt the recipient would think they are worth the price currently listed here. It's more like costume jewelry and nothing about it screams luxe. It's OK but I would get it at a discount."
4.0,I purchased this shirt in XL based on views and has a loose fit. I believe if I had purchase it in a large I believe it would have been snug fit.  A good buy looking to purchase the shorter sleeves.
4.0,they were waaaaay too small. but customer service got back to me in order to remedy the situation.
4.0,"I really like this dress.  I'm 5 ft. 7 inches and weight 165-1670 lbs.  It does have a weird gap in the back as others have posted and I've got plenty of bust to have filled it out, but its no biggie to me. During the fall/winter I have stuck a shirt under it and made it kind of like a jumper dress. It comes right around to my knees. I like the belt because I'm definitely a bit violin shaped, so this works to accentuate your curves.  I love the pattern and, with the shirt underneath, will definitely be a great dress for the company holiday events I have to attend.  I did get a comment that it reminded him of a picnic blanket, but men are dumb about that stuff. I love the dress!"
4.0,"The fit and style are so cute!  Although it’s a little see thru, should be fine for beach vacation"
4.0,"Very thin, but surprisingly good!"
4.0,It could be a little thicker. Otherwise it is very nice
4.0,These fit a little large but are super comfy.
4.0,It was pretty loose around my waist
4.0,"Expected it to be a bit thicker, but it's perfect for fall days and fussy classrooms that never are the right temp. Color is great and the material is very cozy."
4.0,"Wallet has less compartments than I'd like, but this may be good for me because I usually end up stuffing them anyways.  The material feels nice"
4.0,Unfortunately did not look flattering on my curvy frame…
4.0,This is good but it runs a little long for people who are around 5 feet 1-2 inches
4.0,I like the comfort of this dress. The material is a bit see through.
4.0,"This pouch will keep your glasses/shades clean, but obviously not safe from getting bent. Overall, it serves it's purpose and is great for the price you can get such an item for."
4.0,I wanted some well padded gloves for cycling. I didn't realize the gloves (and shorts) run small. I always order size Large but these gloves fit more like a medium. Same with the shorts. If I had known I would've ordered XL's.
4.0,"Well it doesn't fit me very well, but it fits my wife perfectly. She even got a few compliments when we were out the other day. She likes that the sleeves are longer than most dresses of this type."
4.0,This is one of my favorite sweaters. It’s lightweight and very comfortable on a brisk fall day.
4.0,My daughter wanted a pair of these for over a year and we finally her size on Amazon.<br />Fit and Quality are very good
4.0,Good a little thin in low ban
4.0,Well worth the cost but fits extremely small. Normally a medium but ordered a large and should’ve sized up to an XL
4.0,"Really liked this band. I did return it, but only because my wrist wasn’t a good size for it—I was in between two link sizes and couldn’t find a comfortable fit. But otherwise it is very cute and seemed very sturdy."
4.0,"Short on the sides and longer in the back, not the material I expected. Looks fancier in pics but it’s just a cotton material. Definitely a more casual dress"
4.0,"I was very pleased with the look and quality when the Crew Socks arrived, especially that the top of the sock hugged the leg firmly but gently...then, once I washed them (cold water wash) they came out of the dryer with 'pills' all over them.  Now I'm kind of disappointed in their appearance."
4.0,Sturdy bag!! Wish handles were a little longer.
4.0,"These are the things that I would read the reviews to find out...<br />1. I’m 5’2” and size 12/14ish. I purchased large. It was what I would consider a long tunic. Too short for me for a dress IMO. Some people would probably be ok with it. Came about two inches above my knee.<br />2. I ordered grape/purple hoping it matched the color of the photo but worried it would actually be purple. It looks exactly like the picture. More mauve, which is what I wanted.<br />3. A few other reviews mentioned it but I thought it wouldn’t pertain to me because I don’t have a large chest area, but it did: the top/arm area is tight/on the smaller side.<br />4. Like I said, I ordered large. While it was not really tight around my torso, it wasn’t as loose as I thought it would be. In hindsight I may order a XL next time.<br />Ultimately I love this and it is exactly what I was shopping for. Soft, good color, right length for leggings and boots. And you can’t beat the price. Craftsmanship is much better than I expected. Plus! It hazzz pocketsss!"
4.0,The waist is smaller than expected.
4.0,"Very nice shirt.  The size is great but it's a little short.  To be fair, I'm 6'4&#34; so it's understandable that it would be a little short but it's a Large so I expected it to fit me like other larges.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with it.  If it weren't so short on me I'd give it 5 stars."
4.0,"These shorts are so soft and comfortable. I wish I went down a size, I normally take a xl."
4.0,"Had to shorten, hope I loose some weight. pretty tight for a 14. I love the material and color.  They are comfortable."
4.0,"I ordered the package that says two of each color but I got THREE tan, ONE white and two black.<br />They are more comfortable then the other ones I have but they do slip off easily by the end of the day."
4.0,Perfect fit and shipped same day! Great material and vibrant colors. Wish the sleeves were a tiny bit longer though.
4.0,A little see through but a great fit
4.0,"These are, by far, the lightest sunglasses I have ever owned.  That was my primary goal.  However, they are very &#34;springy&#34; so I worry that they don't fit well in any case/wont' stay closed - but that's fine since I like how light they are.  I did have to write to the company because they came with a &#34;film&#34; on the inside of the lenses - it had to be peeled off carefully - could have avoided the trouble if they put a note in there to peel off the film.  Otherwise, VERY pleased with these sunglasses."
4.0,"I didn't think I was missing out by not having metal versions of these, I just couldn't find any plastic ones and these were a cheaper option for me. They work well, don't weigh down my collar."
4.0,Good material and very durable!! Not exactly as the picture displayed but still nice
4.0,"This bag is generally good but a bit pricy.<br />Pro:<br />Lightweight, super light.<br />Easy to store, you can fold it and it takes very little space if you are not using it.<br />Roomy, you can store a lot of things in it, and because of the material, it can be ""expand"" side way.<br />Water resistance, repels water (at least when new)<br />Con:<br />Relatively pricy<br />fold-able comes with a price, the bottom doesn't have those flat pad, so in the case of gym locker room that provides only stall (not the usual long bench), the two long ends will just go down and not stay flat."
4.0,"I like the silk next to the skin, feels like extra skin. Wear it, your mouth area will be toned, and stops transmission. 2 for 1, what a deal."
4.0,The bracelet are nice but the colored beads are darker than shown and don't really stand out.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:1a74ef57cb0596f226e711147d0e32b8]] So with the fit they models have in the picture, I was willing to put down the $20 for one pair, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I got 3! I know that it says that there are three pairs right there, but I didn't notice until afterward. I was worried about the fit since the waist looked a little big for a one size fit all, but when I tried it on, the legs fit perfectly, and you just fold the waist over to your fit. They're a little itchy so I hope they're better after a wash. Good for the value!"
4.0,"it came as a pair, which is fine, but I don't have two piercings in my nose... also it came with an extra clear one that had a blue gem. Fine again, except I like to know what I'm getting so I know the sending is legit, and not just throwing in some used items. Bottom line, one would have been nice enough"
4.0,"Cute skirt color a lil off, but as pictured. Order a size up, taut waist. Other than that great buy!"
4.0,Thanks for the quick shipping!! Awesome seller!! The dress was great and fits great. Thanks again!!
4.0,Pretty in pink!
4.0,"Somewhat small, granddaughter wears the a lot, she is happy."
4.0,Love them however they need to reinforce the stitching at the toe seam.  I've only had them 2 weeks & the toe seam is already torn.
4.0,"Very cute! I didn't realize until after purchased that it was coming from overseas but it didn't take long to get here. The key ring was not at all what I expected, more of a piece of metal wire. Nothing I would use (or know how to use) as a key ring."
4.0,"This dress is so flattering, fits well. Beautiful colors, nice material, good length, perfect summer dress."
4.0,I really like this cardigan. I bought a black one to wear with sleeveless dresses. My only complaint is that the fabric is a little more sweater than jersey and it has faded after washing just a few times.
4.0,Watch functions very well and keeps excellent time at a great price.  My only complaint is the strap is too short.  I can just wear it by using the last hole.
4.0,This was a gift for someone else. They have rotted that the bracelet fits well and is comfortable and he really likes the new color.
4.0,Got it a week late but looks good
4.0,My daughter loves it calls it her sunshine dress.. it's beautiful and true to color. Quality is pretty good too for the price
4.0,"Seems like a cheap material, there was blue fuzz all over the robe when I first opened it but I washed it beforehand and it came off. It fits good but isn’t very thick and the teeth on the hood are all bent and messed up. Seems cheap"
4.0,They're a little tight around the ankle
4.0,I wear this hat often and it's very warm. Only small complaint is it's a little tight around the forehead and if I wear it too long I start getting a headache
4.0,The material is a little thin so I am not able to use this for the original purpose intended but these pants look good when worn so I did not return them.
4.0,It's a very pretty dress! I bought the petticoat and that will help with the tiny bit of looseness. It's made well and will be just the right dress for the upcoming event!
4.0,Cute fits well not as pink as the picture but still cute
4.0,I have a lil bit of a ponch up front and the pockets r just amazing on covering that ponch. Good workmanship in these comfy pants.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for pretend dress up for my daughter
4.0,"It is much longer than I expected. It is a tunic length. I wanted to wear with jeans, but more appropriate for wear with leggings. Nice and light weight but not see through. I am 5’4” 145lb and got a medium."
4.0,"Nice looking bag, and very useful. Wish it was slight bigger. But it is big enough for a weekend trip."
4.0,Super cute print. Perfect for over a bathinsuit or coverup. It was too long for me but the size up top was great. The ties go through the hole and tie in a nice bow in front or even on the side. Cute I just wish I was taller! Gave it to 5’5” sister and it’s the perfect length.
4.0,Dress was fine. Just didn't find it to be anything special.
4.0,"Nice top. Love the crochet top and the padding. The cups fit true to size-but yes, they do give you cleavage! Order 1-2 cup sizes up if you want total coverage. Straps probably do irritate a little due to being thinner, but I expected that and am just happy to find a top that contains and covers the ladies."
4.0,Works very well. the straps are adjustable.
4.0,"my only issue with this pair is they are calf, not knee high which I was expecting."
4.0,"Purchased two for my patio. Easy to operate. They are open every day, weather permitting. Heavy duty fabric provides good shade where I want it. They are heavier than other umbrellas I have had so a good heavy umbrella base is best for the 10 ft. canopies when they are open."
4.0,Plastic clasps
4.0,It’s a little confusing to put the plastic in the part of the sandals. You’ll notice when you get it.
4.0,"This is a super fun set of shirts! Runs a little small, but I have large arms/shoulders. The material has some stretch to it, though.<br />Perfect for Halloween. I’m using the red and white shirt as part of my Where’s Wenda costume (Where’s Waldo’s girlfriend)."
4.0,This minimalistic look is great the band however does not compliment it. I found other bands and now looks amazing.
4.0,"I bought it as a gift, I don't wear these stuff, but it looks pretty good. Looks kind of big for women's wrist. Now she can put more than one snaps on."
4.0,"Fits fine but don't get it wet, the colors will come off on anything it touches"
4.0,Beautiful dress but it was larger than expected.
4.0,"This is a beautiful belt, and buckle. I intend to wear it mainly for dress. It fits me perfect, but I recommend giving yourself extra length when cutting the belt. I have only a single notch to play with for its expansion. As with most foreign made products, instructions (for cutting) need much improvement. Overall, still worth the price!"
4.0,Fun and colorful
4.0,Fits fine. Works fine.
4.0,"This dress is a thin stone washed denim.  I have not had any issues with the snaps on the back.  I got this in the 6 for my 6 year old.  She is around 44"" tall and 40lbs.  She is slim but does wear a 6 in most other brands.  This dress is really large on her in every way, including length. "
4.0,These are definitely cute but they are a bit heavy. Some of the metal has caused issues with my ear. I have sensitive earlobes so it may not be a issue for others.
4.0,"Fits good, soft comfortable. One star off cause of the color, got Navy but not really navy. Kinda bright blue…"
4.0,Very comfortable worth buying.
4.0,"Love the design but very thin. I saw where one customer used panty liners for protection, excellent idea also it will slide off your face. I use a thin or small hair clip behind my head and it works great!"
4.0,cute little trinket
4.0,"I love the horse pendant itself, but as other reviewers have reported, the leather pulled out of the clasp on the braid of the necklace.  Luckily I had ordered a smooth leather necklace that was the length I wanted for this pendant and tossed the one that came with it.  I knew the quality, since I ordered a shorter one of the same kind and it was very well made.  If you order this pendant, you may have to replace the cord right away - but otherwise it is very beautiful and well designed."
4.0,Great for wearing under sweaters!
4.0,On both Candy pant the bra could be bigger and strapsstonger
4.0,These are very stylish and comfortable. They are also very easy to change so you can customize your look. Great for day to day wear but if doing more aggressive activity (like rock climbing) maybe switch back to the silicon band as fabric ones can fray if caught on sharp surfaces.
4.0,Lightweight. Material is not cheap. Fits just right. Looks good. Daughter approved.
4.0,"The bag is a great price for what you get, unfortunately, the laptop compartment really needs to be half an inch bigger. If the bag wasn't priced so reasonably I would be returning it. I can get my laptop in it and zipped but it takes effort and you can see the zipper pulling at the two corners where it meets the computer.  The rest of the bag seems great so far. Just really struggling with the fact it really is a 17"" laptop bag and not a 17.3""."
4.0,"A new collectible stretchy bracelet for boys and girls which feature the ever popular emoji family of smiley faces.<br />Two bracelets per pack. 2 packages per order. Come in a variety of colors, with a variety of emojis characters to collect.  The bracelets are double sided so you can flip them back and forth to suit your mood or attitude.  The only downside is the non discounted price which iwith the cost of shipping and handling makes these quite high.(3.50 per band)<br />I received a discount price in return for an honest opinion."
4.0,Very beautiful and sexy but fresh out the bag i found a hole in my pocket. I definitely don't want it to get bigger so I will stitch it up.<br />Will follow up if more damages happen after first wash
4.0,"I got these to go with a rainbow &#34;tree of life&#34; pendant I got for a friend. I like them...they just feel a tiny bit cheap. The pendant feels like better quality than the earrings, but those earrings were less than $9 so I can't complain."
4.0,The lace looks cheap. Nothing special. I wasn't impressed that much at all.
4.0,"Love these shorts. They are my second pair. They don’t rise up when I walk. The fabric is not too stiff, but the elastic waist band twisted up a bit after first wear and wash but not enough to make them any less comfortable. I bought these as an alternative to heavier denim shorts that are a bit dated looking in my opinion, and cut into your waist when you sit down. These are great!!!"
4.0,Very good fit and comfortable. Material is of good quality and does not cause skin irritations.
4.0,Legs not wide
4.0,"Really like the beanies, the size is nice, like the slouchy look. The price could be a little lower but the product is good and designs nice. Fast shipping too. Ultimately very happy with the product and will buy more in the future."
4.0,Very pretty looked better than expected
4.0,It run small so I had to get one to two sizes up. The color change good.
4.0,Cute and quirky keychain.
4.0,The rubber of the bottom of the shoe is a bit hard therefore it is slippery.
4.0,"What can I say, a bottle of glowing fairy dust, who doesn't need one of those. If you or someone you love believes in fairies or magic, this is the perfect gift. It's small but very bright. I got up before dawn to go to work and could still see it glowing on the table after being in the dark all night. the glow material is some sort of powder or fine sand with glitter, so no liquid to spill. The bottle is sealed well and I have no fear of it opening accidentally. The chain that comes with it is not a high quality item but seems strong enough for normal use. If you plan to cosplay act with it, maybe get a heavier chain. The only concern I have is if you get this for a small child, it is a choking hazard and has no information on if the glow stuff is non-toxic. Definitely a good purchase for everyone else."
4.0,Ordered this in a 2x and it fits right to me.  I usually wear a 1x so definitely would order a size up.  The fabric is very thin but it's nice and flowy.  Would definitely say it was worth it.
4.0,good leggings
4.0,"Pretty and nice enough material, but I wish it was longer."
4.0,"I really like the size of these glasses but wish the lens were just a little bit darker. They significantly reduce glare but they don't eliminate it altogether. Still, very happy with them and would recommend them to others."
4.0,It's a good quality wallet with high-end stitching. It's light brown color and smells nice. It fits 6 cards but has no space for cash at all. But it will certainly make a good gift for anyone.
4.0,Such a cute costume! The straps are long enough that we will be able to reuse this for years.
4.0,Nice for and good quality although it is much brighter pink than I thought.
4.0,It is a little hard to read so I had to blow up the words so we could read it but besides that it was great
4.0,Little bit big on my 28&#34; waist. I can't close it properly because it's a little too big and I bought a size small.
4.0,Absolutely beautiful but the sizes run smaller than expected
4.0,good comression but a bit large for my 46 eu
4.0,The crown is fabric and I’ll probably need to put some plastic in it so it actually stays in my daughters hair/ on her head.
4.0,"I took a chance on this sweater.  I'm not unhappy with the purchase.  The material is very stretchy for a sweater.  It's not thick, it's not thin, it's comfortable. I am a true size 4 (34A, just under 5'5&#34; and 140 lbs) and the small fit just the way I expected it to fit.  The color is just as it looks, a deeper mustard and will be a great color for fall outfits.  I'm on the fence on the price vs. quality.  Had it been a couple of dollars less, the value would be no question.  The only reason I held back the 5th star is because the sleeves have an unfinished look that I am not a fan of, but some may like it.  I haven't washed it yet, so no feedback on if it will shrink or not, but my first impression of this sweater is a good one.  I'm considering ordering another color."
4.0,"Perfect fit, perfect perfect perfect! I am 5'7"" 140lbs and the medium fits like a glove!"
4.0,Very hit or miss with the quality. The threading around the eyes is what messes them up a lot of times.
4.0,It fits great around my pretty large ski goggles.
4.0,Very nice screen print seems good quality just received it .arrived a little before expected  I do agree with other reviews this does seem to run a little small which in my case was a good thing was leery about ordering it I'm a small petite person thought this would be too big  it's loose fitting but I am a 32 inch chest ( ordered a small )
4.0,Material flimsy though
4.0,Cute overall
4.0,"Where do I begin? First off, when I ordered this I was extremely confused because the package I received was this pretty cool Cobra Kai hoodie. I never ordered this and I was racking my brain trying to figure out how I got this. I felt the package as I was opening it and I heard little clinky bits. I dumped out the hoodie and these MASSIVE hands fall out to the floor. I tried them on and then the hilarity ensued. They were just so ridiculously big I couldn't help but laugh. They are honestly quiet bad as Violet Evergarden hands but, man, I'm going to keep these puppies and repaint them. They would make amazing grim reaper hands."
4.0,I bought these shoes as an extra pair in my daily wardrobe for an office with a business casual dress code. They fit well are reasonably comfortable and seem well built. For the price I consider them a good buy. The only detractor is whatever rubber the sole is made of has a strong rubber smell. I'm assuming that will go away over time.
4.0,"Great colors, soft, thin cotton, some unravelling when washed on the ends but the majority wash extremely well."
4.0,I like the scarecrow charms. I made earrings from the charms but one charm was broke off at the top of the charm so I couldn’t use that charm at all so instead of having 15 pairs of earrings I only have 14 pairs.
4.0,Great coat! Looks expensive! But needs a button or belt in order to close it and make the jacket more functional
4.0,The metal tended to snag material.  Clasp works fine.
4.0,"I ordered these small hoops for my daughter as a promotion gift. They arrived on time and are very lightweight. She loves them. I ordered a second pair for myself that arrived today. One of the earrings' clasps was a bit loose- that is the only issue that I have with my recent purchase. These earrings are not super large, which is nice."
4.0,For the money it's a nice little watch . It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but it's easy to read
4.0,"Comfy, nicely tight, but very long."
4.0,"We loved them and they look beautiful, but we had to sew the ribbon in place as the baby was able to take them apart in two minutes in."
4.0,"These will work fine once I my feet can tolerate them.  I can only wear these for about 15 minutes before they start they become irritating.  However, the massage benefit I get is nice and will continue to wear them intermittently."
4.0,Very satisfied with the fit and sizing. I take a size 10 1/2 shoe and the large/X-Large fits just fine. I’m also a slim build with average legs so I have no problem putting these on. The price is reasonable compared to other brands. I’ve only had them for a short time so still evaluating their benefits. Ordering another pair today.
4.0,"Pretty dress, decent quality for the price (though the straps are SUPER lax for the weight of the fabric, and are barely able to hold it up, so they might have been better it select a slightly sturdier stretch strap for a floor-length “velvet” dress). But this thing runs HUGE. I’m normally a size small, but based on the sizing chart in the description, I opted for an XS.<br /><br />Even though by my waist measurement, I should be a size S, I thought “oh well, the reviews say it runs a little big, so I’ll take my chances with the XS” Well, I should have gone with the XXS. The XS is quite a bit larger than the chart indicates. It’s not intended to fit snug or anything, but as it is, it is so loose that it looks sloppy and ill-fitted. Sadly, my event is too soon to exchange it for a smaller size. So if you’re in the XS/S range, I’d go down TWO sizes from your normal size (which for me was one size down from their product chart), as the chart isn’t totally accurate."
4.0,"they are nice clear lenses, they are cute and I like the size. the only thing on the fit they are curve a bit much and site very close to the face, there is not much of a gap.  On one level it is great for providing much more sun protection darkness, the other hand on hot days there is no air so it gets a bit sweaty around your eyes."
4.0,"Nice leather, low cost-- Only negative is the band is really small and tight around my wrist"
4.0,fit great just a bit long for me but I am only 5'2
4.0,"It was a bit bulky and large. It didn't sit flush with my ear, however it is beautiful and I enjoy mine."
4.0,"The style was as seen, the metal on the temples (arms/ sides) was thinner than I prefer! The lens were thin and more plastic. But I was just looking for a cheap pair for the summer, this would do if fit correctly. The return was easy!"
4.0,It looks cool and all but you have to have a certain style for it to look good while wearing if you know what I mean.
4.0,"I initially really liked these leggings, but after several wearings realized that they rode down too much in the waist for my figure.  Not the leggings' fault, I just needed to go with a different style that has a higher waist (for anyone with a smaller waist but with a curvier figure below that, I recommend ODODOS High Waist capris).<br />Aside from that, the quality seemed good, and the fabric was comfortable."
4.0,Very functional and great price<br />Value. If I could change anything I wish it had a better place for coins. All in all I like the wallet.
4.0,"Good quality for the pay, should work perfect for my costume! :)"
4.0,Like the color very much.
4.0,Absolutely love. It fits perfectly and is exactly as pictured.
4.0,"okay so I actually love this piece a lot. I am in AZ so there will be absolutely nothing stopping me from wearing this as it is, as a top, when it's 19277° in the summer. I normally wear a small if it runs a little large, or a medium comfortably if I'm looking for a more relaxed fit... i ordered a medium in this and while it fits, it runs just small enough that I will be going for a large when I order the other two colors. I'm 5'5, 125, and 34B (on a good day) for reference."
4.0,Was a gift - I believe she likes it as she is the one who asked for it as a gift idea.
4.0,Kind of rough
4.0,"This fit a little smaller than expected.  However, it is a lovely Cardigan.  The fabric is light weight and the little daisy's are very cute.  Great for spring and summer."
4.0,The shirts are very nice however they do run small I would go at least one size up
4.0,"As pictured. Looks cute with belt. I am 5'3, 140 and got a size M."
4.0,True to color nice fit.
4.0,"Baggy and warm, just luck all of the other comments. I will say the mane is a little unwieldy, though."
4.0,It looks good and has held up well over half the summer.
4.0,"I like the fabric and it fits, but the high in front is pretty short.  With my regular-sized arms hanging by my ide, the front hits my palm."
4.0,"I have been a long time Vans customer, but recently the quality went way down. I found these in my size at the local mall and ordered here on AZ, they fit great, 4/5 would buy another pair again."
4.0,Gave as a gift so
4.0,They fit like they should. I love the dry fit material. I would highly recommended these to anyone that is looking for a shirt to workout in.
4.0,"My wife and I have enjoy sushi, like cats, and needed a place to organize our keys. A Sushi Cat Keychain made perfect sense."
4.0,"These fit all right, although they were smaller than I expected. I'm a B cup, and thought they would be okay, but they are a little small. Still, they are cute, and I will keep them and wear them."
4.0,"Super happy with this! Gorgeous and well-made. Nice weight. Pretty clasp. The only thing I'd say is that the picture gives me the impression that it is a shorter necklace than it actually is. It looks to me like this would sit gracefully at your collar bone, but instead, this sits down more where your average v-neck would. That's not necessarily the look I was after, but I still love it and have worn it multiple times."
4.0,"Not amazing quality, but it worked well for Halloween and is still being enjoyed without falling apart so I call it a win!"
4.0,Design is very nice.
4.0,"The length is great, but the strap across the top is a bit snug."
4.0,It was alittle big but not too big. It is wearable enough to still look stylish. Ive already gotten 4 questions yesterday about where i got this jacket
4.0,"For the price that you pay, this radio strap is as expected. It’s durable, stays on my gear well, holds my gloves tight, only complaint is the release system. It is not quick at all. You have to really work to get your gloves out of it which is great for not losing them, but bad, obviously in emergency instances where you need them fast. Overall, not a bad product. 4 stars"
4.0,These are thinner than I expected but perfect for pajamas or around the house. I wore the top out of the house with some leggings to go for a walk in and it looked nice. The material is very soft and comfortable. I was hoping I could wear the shorts out of the house too but they would be a bit see through. Fit true to size.
4.0,"Average, nothing to write home about."
4.0,Going into March (3months) and still loves these shoes. One of the lights stays in red even when I'm a different color setting but im not complaining. At least it's not out.
4.0,They are larger than I expected. Should have paid more attention to size information before ordering. They look cheap but I’m hoping that once I put gems in it will look better.
4.0,Very nice.... Reminds me of the time that I spent in Hawaii.
4.0,"Cute hate, fit is a little tight, but it works"
4.0,"I couldn't pull shirt over my grandsons head.  Shorts are so tight they squeeze his little legs, but after reading my review the company contracted me to offer a refund our replacement.  I opted for replacement in a larger size.  I feel this is above and beyond what I expected."
4.0,Size was perfect. Very soft feeling pjs. So far no pills or decals coming off. I will order this brand of pjs again!
4.0,"I feel that the pockets are too tight. Also, the zipper doesn't work smoothly. Over all it feels and looks nice."
4.0,Love this dress makes me look AMAZING! Although the collar can be confusing
4.0,fits great except that maybe it could be an inch or two longer
4.0,I generally wear a large pants (maybe size 12-16 in jeans). These almost fit but they were too tight on my thighs and looked funny so I’m returning it and getting a size up.
4.0,It was a bigger then wanted
4.0,"Beautiful Scarf!<br /><br />It has a simple lace detail and easy to dress up or down. Perfect for cooler days. I tried it on under a jean jacket and it looked amazing.<br /><br />It is a bit sheer and there are a number of ways to style and wear this scarf. The color is bright and fun and the look is very feminine. It may not be warm enough for extremely cold days but otherwise, a very nice scarf!"
4.0,This band is exactly as pictured and arrived in a timely manner. It was easy to change the band- fits perfectly as there are many holes to insert the spring bar. I bought black and Brown. Perfect band at a great price!
4.0,"Loved this dress fit perfectly, only problem is the fabric felt like a sheet or a blanket and wasnt a pretty white just very dull"
4.0,Just what we were looking for .<br />Fits perfectly<br />arrived several weeks before expected
4.0,Very cute fluffy bunny! However came a little smashed and needed to give a haircut around the eyes. Also bunny is smaller than it looks in the picture. I still love it though makes me feel warm inside every time I see it dangling on my keychain
4.0,"Nice and light. Hope they're genuine Ray Ban where they presently retail for almost twice the Amazon price on the Ray Ban website. Had Costco put in their HD progressive lenses. Already got some compliments. Nice, very comfortable lightweight RB frames, good deal on quality lenses - can't complain as long as the frames are......"
4.0,"All around pretty great, no chipping and doesn't aggravate my septum. Something with the threading whether it's too short or doesn't secure all the way but the ends loosen and/or fall off easy, but I haven't had issues with cross theading when trying to put ends on, so that's a plus. I've already completely lost the rose gold ball from one day of wear and (almost) lost the rainbow cone the next day. Seems to only happen if I'm messing with them or in my sleep. Everything else is great and the packaging is nice; it comes in a tiny box in a mailing envelope."
4.0,"Great fun for Halloween, parties, etc.  Not the highest build quality so they won't last, but definitely good for the evening.  Bright colors, easy to strap on your fingers."
4.0,"Internal zipper pocket mounted too high. Otherwise, fabulous."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:21fd590b3eb8ce78d1917d3fe8c86d7a]] I like the zipper option which makes it easy for kids to put them on. They give a good 2 to 3 inches in height. The inside seems to be soft and cushiony.
4.0,"Están muy muy chevere, pero me hubiera gustado que fuera flexible la parte de la muñeca"
4.0,Came damaged (plastic was cracked on the front bottom of backpack) but I had already written my kids name on it before I noticed. Still really cute and no other problems with it
4.0,"I wore these to a football game in Wisconsin in November, under my jeans - and they were perfect.  I don't know that they look nice enough to wear out as leggings, but I will probably wear them under my pants this winter as I commute in Chicago.  If you are looking for leggings to wear with long sweaters - not my recommendation.  If you're looking for an alternative to tights under a skirt - these would absolutely work."
4.0,Nice necklace with butterfly of different sizes.  Pleased with my purchase.
4.0,Fits somewhat small with the liner in but perfect without the liner.
4.0,"Go a size up.  Normally wear medium, ordered a large.  Still a little snug.  But it looks good.  Really like the style."
4.0,"Joseph Aboud is consistent, His clothing has been stykish and well made fors years. This is the reason that I selected this wallet"
4.0,"oxidental red = rust = pretty close to super dark burnt orange, which = can potentially get away with it on game day!  it helps that it is cute too.  it's not the most flattering dress - i say that because it does easily also pass as a maternity dress with the empire cut, however the multiple accents really help to add a lot of penache.  the empire waist does add a lot, the uplifted sides on the hem are actually flattering and add little zest, AND it has pockets!!!!!  pockets are amazing.  this is a great summer dress and will also extend into the fall for me because our weather will allow for it and i can wear it on game day.  it's easy too work with as well - from a styling aspect you can dress up or down.  i have it with a pair of leopard print  slip on shoes here but i started out with a little pair of booties at first and dug the look i just gave up the idea of being that trendy.  this will get quite a bit of wear - i'll try out different looks and play with it - it'll be fun."
4.0,Nice gloves.  The only complaint was that they ran small.
4.0,The price and shipping time were wonderful.  The only thing I wish it had was the tab to hold the small band in place.
4.0,"The mask itself is great for the money. My only gripes is that the band for the eye patch is too wide, you could cut down on the width by half as much and the product would become much more adaptable."
4.0,"The hat was nice and as pictured, but there where some shipping issues as this did not arrive on time."
4.0,"Layers seems thinner than my last order, but fits great.  Lightweight and breathable"
4.0,It stayed put all day!
4.0,One came with a torn seam but otherwise nice pair of tights.
4.0,"Comfy, well made. Worth $7."
4.0,I love this coat!  One small negative is to zip it up you have to stretch the elastic bottom to meet.  Elastic could be a little looser.
4.0,"At first glance, I thought the fabric was very cheap and going to be see-thru, but it wasn’t. It is a very light fabric, which would be comfy for hot days. The size runs small, it is tight around the midriff. Debating on ordering a size up."
4.0,Nice quality<br />Length runs short
4.0,"If you love fresh water pearls, this is the one for you!"
4.0,"The item is a regular mesh RL Polo shirt. They are always nice. The color is a bit brighter than the image I saw on my computer, which I like. As far as the execution of my order, when I first placed it, the tracking information indicate it was ""out for delivery"" on Monday. When I didn't have it by Tuesday afternoon, I contacted the seller VRMI and spoke with someone named Tiffany, who fixed the problem immediately by sending out another shirt via express delivery, and I had it by Thursday morning. That was pretty good service."
4.0,Ive bought this set twice.  My first bracelet broke in the middle when I opened it to put on my wrist.  But I love the simple elegant look of the silvertone.  The posts on the earrings are too thick and hurt my ear but I Love the ring and the bracelet.  You cant beat the price for the entire set.
4.0,Beautiful ring! However it was too small for my fingers! I wish their sizes would go up. It looks exactly like an engagement ring! Must buy!
4.0,Very nice and as advertised also very good and immediate service when I needed to return because I ordered the wrong size.
4.0,"utterly impossible to see through while illuminated, but sofa king cool looking in photographs that they’re one billion percent worth it for dress up, cosplay, etc."
4.0,"Love it, i got lots of compliments!!!"
4.0,It has a quilted lining by the way. It's warm and comfy. The picture is accurate too.
4.0,"I decided to finally write a review mainly because one of the bracelets keeps breaking.  The first time it broke I emailed the company and they replaced it, but unfortunately it broke again.  I restrung the bracelet myself and then the the other bracelet broke.  These are nice bracelets but even with limited wear don't expect them to last long."
4.0,"I have been looking for a pair of fox ears and tail for a few years now and I haven’t found any that are great for a low price. There are a lot of really nice ears and tails but they’re usually very expensive and I would worry about them getting ruined if I wore them out of the house or to a costume party. But the cheap ears and tails look bad and too cartoony orange. These seem to be a nice middle ground for the look and the price. I like that the tail keeps it’s shape and is nice and soft. I don’t like the wire headband that the ears come on, and I will eventually try to change it out for something different, but it’ll do for now."
4.0,"I tried them on my daughter before washing them, they fit beautifully. She is 4 months old, on the smaller side of a 4 month old. I got 3-6 months, and after washing they are a little tight on her calves. Very cute though and she could not kick them off when wearing them."
4.0,"Very pretty dress! The  material  is somewhat thin and very soft. I didn’t wear anything under it and you couldn’t see my underwear, so that’s a plus! I wore it for my baby shower. I’m 5’1 and 155lbs at 32weeks pregnant in this pic. I ordered a md, but wish I would have gotten a small but it’ll still fit to my liking after the baby is here! Hope that helps!"
4.0,Nice hat for a good price. Shipping took some time.  Seller responded to my email inquiry quickly.
4.0,"I at first thought that these were not going to be effective, since there seemed little insulation on the finger part of the gloves or palm side of the mittens.<br />I was wrong.<br />They are relatively effective for keeping your hands warm with the mittens down, and with the glove fingers exposed they are at least as good as most woven gloves. I do wear gloves liners under them when it gets really cold here (@5F and below) and when I do so the index finger touch screen capability doesn't work even when the index finger of the liner gloves have the same feature.<br />The magnetic hold backs seem just a little weaker than I would like as they can release the parts they are holding back in an active situation, but it isn't horrible, and is slightly preferable to the more common Velcro option.  Do make certain you don't let them rest against your credit cards or sensitive electronics as they are strong enough magnets to possibly wipe them.<br />These are also fairly sturdy. I have worn them while working minor construction here and they have not gotten damaged or shown any signs of abuse.<br />Warning - they are large and you wont want to drive with them on (they stick out so that they will bush a cars controls) but then they are MITTENS not driving gloves, so what do you expect."
4.0,very convenient to purchase the matching set at a very reasonable price.  looked great!
4.0,Fits me as I was expecting! Totally recommended
4.0,"My wife love these. There's lots of stretch, doesn't feel to tight, the material conforms and stretches in all the right places to be comfortable no matter what she's doing, it breathes and the color is true to the pics<br /><br />They're also just as soft and comfortable after a wash<br /><br />Her only complaint are the pockets. It's AMAZING they included pockets but it's been designed at an angle that makes it super easy for a phone to possibly slip out of while walking even. It's almost happened a few times so these are totally worth it, just be careful of that angled pocket"
4.0,I only received really small charms except for one shell & a few spiders. I was hoping for a few more larger ones. They are heavy & have nice detail.
4.0,"The armholes are deep-set.  Length is 36"". Seems more like a swimsuit cover-up."
4.0,I’m a shorty  so for me they are very long! The fit great though.
4.0,"I am a size 2 to 4 in pants and am 5' 7"" for reference. I ordered a size small overall they look okay. They are VERY high waisted, more than expected, so just keep that in mind and the crotch is on the longer side. I don't think I would go a size down however. They could be longer but they also don' t look too too short. they hit right above my ankles. They are pretty comfy too."
4.0,"This necklace is super cute, & looks like the picture--- except the back doesn't say 'kiss me'; (like in the picture) which I really thought that was cute :( It's cute anyway though, &lt;3<br /><br />Just kind of annoyed that it doesn't have that > . &lt;"
4.0,The chicken is thick on my neck but it’s cute and I really like it.
4.0,Love this dress!!!  The small was a little wide looking so I exchanged for an extra small.  You can size down in this dress if needed.  I am about 5'2&#34; and 125 lbs.  Perfect vacation wear!
4.0,Very stylish I like them and it was a good buy when it came to pricing
4.0,Suggest to buy one size up. Good material but the hood is little akward.
4.0,"The fit is good. Long length, but it is sheer. I definitely need an extra slip under it. But I still really like it."
4.0,"Nice shirt, but I've had to sew all the buttons back on."
4.0,"I am giving this skirt a 4 star only because the zipper is very cheap and hard to open and close without fear of breaking it plus the pearl though cute I will remove it because it of course digs into your back when driving/sitting. Other than that I absolutely love LOVE this skirt! I am 5'5&#34; 120lbs and I ordered a small! The shoulders slip down sometimes but it is not annoying which is great. It is not too tight or loose and the length can be revealing but I wear &#34;booty shorts&#34; under all my dresses/skirts anyways which still looks cute. I'd rather not expose myself accidentally or draw unwanted attention. I wore a petticoat, my &#34;booty shorts&#34; with a red stripped mesh shirt, fishnets, and boots to the club. I received so many completes on my outfit for Carnivale night. I also have worn it casually with a tank top and my shorts. I feel very pretty in this skirt and it will most likely be part of my bi-weekly rotation of outfits. Ha!"
4.0,a little on the small side would order bigger
4.0,Nice fit comfortable looks good would wear in and out of the gym. Not to crazy about the seem across the front looks like it can get loose threads
4.0,"Comfortable, stylish, and warm."
4.0,"Very comfortable! For the most part, they stay put. Sometimes I have to pull them up a little when wearing short-shorts. They did pretty well in the wash so far. I don't want to give it 5 stars just yet since I want to know if they will actually last a long time. Other than that, they are the most comfortable underwear in my drawers!"
4.0,Fits Perfect. Material pretty good for the price.
4.0,"This is a fancy looking bag for a good price, the clips for the strap are not the highest quality, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:bdb72c82b31ed849b72b3cbff6217ebb]] This dress definitely makes me look fat and I’m not 😂 I would definitely size down, I was swimming in this dress even though my measurements are exact to the size I ordered."
4.0,My husband thought these fit very well.
4.0,Wish they had them in smaller sizes. Got them for my sister. Not sure if they will fit her 🤞🏻. But cool socks.
4.0,I'm going to take it into a seamstress to see for sure it fits right. I love it. If I do any alterations I'll write another review.
4.0,Very pretty and sparkly but runs small!  My daughter is 4 and the medium 8-10 barely fits with no room to grow. She is 95% in height and weight but still i would not expect to order a 11 large for my 4 yr old.  She wears 6x or 7 currently in kids clothes.  Also i would say the boy short is shorter than other biketards i have ordered but my daughter did not complain.
4.0,"Gave as gift, my cousin loved them."
4.0,"Good replacement strap, but obviously looks a bit cheaply made. The ability to customize the strap to your wrist size is great, and you can't really beat the price for something like this. I'm using this on one of my beater watches as I look for a better quality strap in the future."
4.0,"It's not quite as long as I expected and the collar is bit wide, but it's soft and it fits well so I would recommend it."
4.0,"These pants are actually super great ! . Let me note I'm pregnant,  so they are a tad tight in my stomach but I'm surprised they fit ! . Last time I ordered leggings ( of another company ) I couldnt get them above my butt . These slid right on. And I think they will be awesome post pregnancy to hold in my stomach !! . I'm worried the mesh may rip,  but that's just my fear, so far so good . It seems thick enough to last."
4.0,"Nice material, very long though."
4.0,i havent regreted my purchase. Please note that every now and then it stops working but all i have to do is tap and then it starts spining again. Lokks expensive :)
4.0,"Love carhartt products! Very sturdy nice look. Was expecting a larger bag for the price, but the quality makes up for it! Will enjoy using this bag for travelling."
4.0,"I missed the word “loose” in the description. But when they say loose they mean it. I wish I had ordered a size down. But despite that, the material is soft and the top does not cling  anywhere. Great for hiding a few extra pounds."
4.0,"Great carry on to take on work trips.  I love the blue color.  It reminds me of Tiffany's. I wanted something other than black. I've had a couple compliments from strangers.  It's a little pricey, but I don't regret buying it."
4.0,"I love this bag! I've been using it as a purse replacement since I got it and it happily holds everything I need with room for more in a convenient, stylish and solidly built little package.  I only wish it was a little bigger to hold my laptop too but oh well.  Whether I carry it cross-body or over-the-shoulder I never have any fear of dropping or losing it.  I've only had one minor problem and that's that my water bottle keeps falling out of the side pocket, but I think that's more because I have a particularly tall bottle rather than any fault in the bag itself."
4.0,"I bought these in black, green, nude, and red. The brighter colors are fun to wear. These are high-waisted, to the bellybutton and I have to roll them down a little to keep them inside my pants. However, they are very comfortable (!!!) and they offer NO Visible Panty Lines--even in your tightest jeans...which was my goal when buying these. The fabric is on the thicker side, but not heavy enough to wear alone. Use only as underpants. They make your butt look really nice and smooth--so much better than a thong! I would also recommend these as better coverage underpants underneath sheer summer skirts, shorts, and dresses. Note: pantyliners don't stick very well to the fabric."
4.0,Appeared big however fairly true. Water shoes stayed on my daughters feet even in rough waves.
4.0,"Fast delivery. But only 4 stars because the purse smelled so bad. I soaked it in fabreeze cleaner for about 45 minutes. Sprayed fabreeze in it, it helped a lot. But still smells some."
4.0,"This necklace looks exactly like the picture, and it’s adjustable. One thing to know before you buy it though is that the knots may come undone like mine, and if you tie it in a regular knot I will not be adjustable any longer."
4.0,"I don't know what others got that caused them to write negative reviews, however ours is precious. Has belt, fits perfect,  pretty color."
4.0,My son uses this with his scooter.
4.0,"I was looking for basic shower shoes for the gym and these worker out great, they dry easily, the fit is on the small side, and they have good traction on the wet floor."
4.0,"The suit was great, purchased this for my boyfriend and he loved it. Sadly the pants did fit correctly. the Jacket was perfect. Order larger size even if jackets fits too big!"
4.0,"Nice shirts, how we they do run a bit small."
4.0,Its really comfortable and slim. I'd definitely buy again.
4.0,"Getting two glasses with two cases… great idea.  I got these for my husband but his eyeglasses and head size were too big and they did not work for him,  I gave the polarized ones to a friend who needed them. She loves them … and I kept the yellow lens ones for me — they are invaluable when driving through driving Florida rainstorms - yesterday my daughter said she would not be able to see if she was driving .. but these fitovers helped with clarity and clearness … it was astounding ."
4.0,"The mask is really cool and the kid loves it, but it is so thin it's really barely (if at all) functioning as a face mask in these COVID times. Also, it's large rather than stretchy, so it easily falls off."
4.0,"I wanted to love this but somehow, it doesn't look as flowing and as loose in person, as it does on the model.  I think if you are plus-sized or larger than say a (2X) 18W-20W, it will not be loose and flattering.  It is definitely long though.  If you are under 5'5&#34; if will definitely hit your ankles or the floor.  The sleeves also seem to be wrist length and almost appear dolman-like in the photo, and they aren't in person.  Not sure if I got a different version?  It is still pretty though. I think this would obviously fit differently on tall / thin women but will probably look nice on everyone depending upon the purpose or event.  I did not buy this with the intention of wearing it as a beach cover-up.  I bought it to wear over spaghetti strapped dresses or t-shirts with leggings, so I guess it serves the purpose."
4.0,"It is a nice dress, looks almost identical to the picture. I have a smaller upper body than lower body so it will definitely need some adjusting or double sided tape to avoid an embarrassing malfunction. And it's not as form fitting as I expected but quite comfortable and pretty."
4.0,IT WAS A GIFT AND LOVED
4.0,Nice little purse and can hold most of my items I need. I didn't want to give 5stars because its already starting to tear when the closure/button is on the front.
4.0,its very warm
4.0,"Great shirt for work because I freeze all day in the blizzard air conditioner, yet stylish and dressy enough."
4.0,I think this is teenager size. My sister said it looked like swallowed the Hippo. LOL
4.0,"155 lb, 5'5"", 36ddd.  Ordered a medium & happy with the fit.  Sparse, but good enough coverage on the boobs.<br />Already ordered on in a different color"
4.0,"Costume was supposed to fit up to size 12. The skirt is fine, as I wear a size 8 and it has an elastic waist anyway, but the top is snug for a large-busted woman size 10-12. If you wear size 12 or larger, the top may be too small and will definitely not look like Velma's oversized turtleneck. I was very pleased with the wig and the glasses. Material is OK, a little scratchy but not too cheap-looking.<br />[[ASIN:B00F4LQ5F4 Adult-Costume Velma Std Sz Halloween Costume - Most Adults]]"
4.0,This necklace arrived in a nice box that is perfect for gift-giving. It includes a cloth pouch for storing. The necklace itself is very dainty and fragile. There are 3 fake diamond stars and two silver stars. This necklace is choker-sized on me. It would be most appropriate for a tween.
4.0,This was stron and beautiful but it was too small so I had to return.
4.0,"You will not be able to fit super big items in this bag, but if you’re carrying a bunch of small stuff it works ! It’s a nice design but I wouldn’t give it a 5, because it’s not super firm ! Like the material is nice but it could also get crushed if that makes sense"
4.0,Runs a little small for adults.  Looks awkward. But really great quality. The listing photos make it appear larger than it is.
4.0,Its a bit snug on the arms n would love a bit more wiggle room but it fits ok...I wear it every week.  Just don't dry it. I would size up next time!
4.0,"Very cute! I love the color and quality, but these were way too big for my face. Like, hilariously huge. I returned them."
4.0,"nice hat, i really like it"
4.0,I loved the got. However the top and bottom portion of the dress were different shades of navy. I sorry I waited too long to return it.
4.0,Cute. Little smaller than I expected but they are very cute
4.0,"I misjudged the size on this. I thought it was going to run small, so I sized up, and that was a mistake. I'm usually an L, and I would have been fine if I had stuck with that. This XL is not flattering on me at all.<br /><br />However, I think I would have really liked it had I ordered the right size. The fabric is a crinkly polyester. I'm not sure I'd wear them as pajamas, but they'd be nice for lounging around the house. I ordered the Army Green color, and I really like it. The fabric has a decent drape to it.<br /><br />I think I might be able to split the pieces up and style them into something wearable, but together they just look ill-fitting on me. My fault, though. For under $20, I think this is a great set. Order your usual size!"
4.0,"I was looking for a longer skirt to cover everything while I was pregnant and this fit the bill. Now that I'm back to normal, it is just a bit too long for my taste. I am 5'2'' with normal proportions and it comes down to mid calf."
4.0,"I ordered the small one and runs large especially on the breast sides, but wasn't very noticeable and I used just like that.. I bought it according to the size chart but clothes running large it's not something new for me.. Anyways, I really liked the dress, it's well made and the price is really good for the quality.. It's the first time I buy a dress online and I'm very satisfied.."
4.0,"I have run with these glasses and so far they are excellent. They are light and the lenses aren't too dark for the transitional areas. The lenses did scratch when I wiped them with my tech shirt, but for the price I will buy them again."
4.0,"So, so cute. I like the thickness. Minus one because they make my feet sweat."
4.0,Gorgeous but took too long to break in. These boots rub and hurt so bad to walk in. I kept putting stretchers in them. Finally I can wear more than 2 hours. I think I can wear them all day. I bought a size bigger than my usual size. I bought these in a 9 and they still hurt my feet. But after months of stretching them they are fine now.
4.0,Little bit bigger than what I expected but LOVE the quality of the purse and wallet.  Awesome!
4.0,It's a great case with one issue. There is not enough tension to hold the Fiio. It has the potential to fall out of the case. I would give 4 stars if there was better retention.<br /><br />Maybe small doublesided tape...
4.0,This was exactly what I was looking for. It holds an average size hair band and it won't pop off. I would not recommend for a smaller than 7.5&#34; wrist.
4.0,"I was hoping for a more “oversized” look but it’s not, but still cute"
4.0,"This is a pretty good body suit, thick material, not see through. The one thing I would have to say is the seams on the black patches ripped a good amount when I put it on."
4.0,"This is a basic, medium weight blazer that can dress up most any outfit.  I love this jacket with my casual white dress.  I found the fit a tiny bit snug in the upper arm but not deal breaker snug – I have larger tri’s so this is a normal problem for me in most clothes. There are pocket flaps but no pockets – again, at least for me, this may be a good thing because it keeps the silhouette clean.  This is a nice jacket for jeans also."
4.0,"First let me apologize for a previous feedback i wrote accidentally on this sandal, it was meant for a different red sandal i had ordered for my 3 year old from a different seller...this sandal is pretty flexible, but it was too small for my 6 year old.... the sides bothered her little toe a bit...love the red color!"
4.0,"Bought this with the earrings, only complaint is that the necklace is only barely bigger than the earrings, looking at them together it seems like it should be a bit bigger. But like my review for the earrings, this set is very well made. Not a single flaw and looks better than the picture, how often can you honestly say that?"
4.0,I really like how the fit and color are exactly what I was hoping for.
4.0,"A cosmetic surgeon who does spa treatments uses these when they do facials and other things.  I was given one when I had a facial, and it was very comfortable, and flattering on me (I'm 5'2"", normal body weight)<br /> - if you know about colors that compliment your skin tones, and happen to be be ""summer"",  this color will look great on you.<br />I bought it to use for when I go to and from an outdoor shower.  I know it will be great inside the house too, after showering in the summer, before getting dressed to go out."
4.0,I ordered these for my 6 year olds (big for their age) and they were a smidge too big for them. Thankfully they are adjustable so we made it work for Hawaiian day at school. The boys said they were overall pretty comfortable. I would say these would fit kids 8 and up better than you get kids.
4.0,"Fits well, I got for a piece in my sons halloween costume. Only odd thing is the tags are on the outside of the onesie, on the hip; however since it’s for a costume/regular house wear I don’t mind that much."
4.0,Reliably warm and comfy snug.
4.0,"This jacket appeared very well made. nice materials, zippers, and pockets. Comes with laundry bag and is also well packaged. Unfortunately, it had to be returned because the smallest adjustment is equivalent to a men's XL not a M.  I would recommend if you are a larger size."
4.0,I like that I was able to roll it which is great for packing but it was hard to get the wrinkles out. I had to put a shirt on it flat and apply heat from an iron on it. I also liked that it was adjustable in size.
4.0,"I very much liked the warmth and length of this scarf (it's as long as a non-fur version). There were just a couple of things that made me take that last star away: it's a little scratchy and when I got hot, it was extremely uncomfortable to have it touching me and the writing on it is kind of stark and better off worn by the young women in the house."
4.0,Beautiful dress but too big for me. I'm an 18 and xxxl was too big
4.0,Exactly what I expected and a very good fit.
4.0,Too wide but beautiful sandals... My daughter has narrow feet so they look big on her feet
4.0,"It's cute and fits on waist but  I have a small chest there seems to be too much room at the top. The sleeves are also roomy at the top.<br />I will keep it and make it work but may eventually have it altered by a tailor.<br />I am 5'4&quot;, 115, 32A and got a small"
4.0,"These glasses are a classic shape. They say that they are unisex, but they definitely look more like women’s glasses to me. Especially with the delicate sides. They are flattering. I can’t believe how light they feel. There is basically no weight. They also come with a case and cleaning cloth. They are polarized as well."
4.0,"I purchased the red velvet contrasting with the black. It is quite a graceful and attractive gown. Mine was apparently longer than some others, however my heels are high. I am 5'7&#34; and weigh 125 lbs. and have broad shoulders. The 12 which I believe was a 10-12 fits well. My only caveat is that the contrasting collar of the dress is a pull through where the red velvet overlaps itself and there is a gap through which the material is pulled to criss -cross. Unfortunately mine was nit sewn correctly so there is a small gap where the black shows through that is problematic. I can fix it with a pin, and for the price this is still a good buy, IMO, but I wish that I had noticed it when I received it for I would have exchanged it for one that is perfect. The design and the material are very good, and I am overall quite happy with this gown. I did add a simple slim very dressy belt and it looks very elegant that way as well. For the price this is still a good buy, IMO"
4.0,"Arrived on time. Snug in the crotch and thighs, I'm built like a athlete so I don't know how anyone overweight would fit into these. I'm going to wear them to bed they're so nice."
4.0,It’s  beautiful and somewhat fits okay but expect for it to ride up if you’re “Bottom Blessed”
4.0,"I like them but READ THE REVIEW BEFOE BUYING ! These are great 'boy shorts', they have enough material to go down the thigh about 2&#34;. The waistband is wide so they don't roll or slip.  Beware, other reviewers have said this too, The sizing is all wrong. in most underwear I am a size 7 but I took the reviewers advice and ordered really big (XXXL, I think) and the size is right, although somewhat discouraging to order something that sounds so big...<br /><br />Another point other reviewers made, and were right about. The package control on this product stinks. 2 out of 6 pairs were size XXL, not XXXL. I can still wear them, but probably won't on days I'm feeling 'fat'. I will also be careful to wash in lukewarm water and air dry them so they don't shrink. This is a hassle, but I'm going to order them again so I can wait a little over a week before I have to deal with the hassle.<br /><br />Final points. The bow in front is annoying, cut it off. Also they have a tag in back, also annoying, but easy enough to remove - but now I don'r know which size I ordered. I hope Amazon does so I can re-order them."
4.0,I really love the light weight material. Perfect for summer. Personally I’d size up!
4.0,"This necklace is beautiful and the pendant is stunning. It came in a pretty box with a polishing cloth which I like. I don't really wear jewelry that often so I was a bit worried that this necklace might be a bit much. When I tried it on I fell in love, I loved how the pendant would change color when you look at it from different angles. I accidentally broke my necklace chain, so that's not as durable as I thought it was, but I'm getting a replacement chain just so I could wear the pretty pendant again."
4.0,Well made shirt but the length is longer than usual
4.0,Very light . Able to twist links open.
4.0,My son love these boots. They were a bit big but I didn't mind because my son will soon grown into them. They were a bit pricey.
4.0,I love it! Its about 3 inches by 1 1/2<br />It looks just like it does in the picture! It was short in length but I added more length to it.
4.0,Keeps head warm! But it had been losing a few feathers here and there.
4.0,She loved it and I was happy but 2 days later I saw it for a few dollars less. But I won't tell her
4.0,"Order a size up ladies just to be comfortable. I wear a size 14 dress and xl usually fits me 38d chest and it was a little snug. I should’ve ordered a 1x to be safe but it will do. Cute little dress, thin fabric but it’s great."
4.0,- High quality - make sure you get the perfect size for you -  I got big size :(
4.0,LIKE ITT ALOT.  WISH THE WHOLE SHIRT WAS GREY AND WHITE.
4.0,Very pretty earrings but no metal backs.
4.0,As expected price a little high
4.0,Cute but fits more like a child’s hat and my head is small.
4.0,"Super cute! Quality is ok, it worked for family photos. I think it runs a little short in the legs, I just pushed them up and it looked cute. My daughter is 4 and over 40"" tall."
4.0,The Beanie is as described as being slouchy which is why I said it was big as in it fits great but you will have to adjust it to get rid of the slouchy look which I forgot a few times.<br /><br />The beanie is warm and fits around my ears and the top of my head with extra room to spare if you wanted to adjust it to cover the back of your neck you likely could. I am always in freezing parts of the world and this fits in with almost any style and provides the warmth I was looking for.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to put on and comfortable.
4.0,"I bought this holder a couple of months ago and have worn it several times. (I have more than one holder.) The look is good for its price, and it's easy to put on and take off. The only reason for a ""4"" rating is that the magnet is a little weak if placed on thick fabric, like a sweatshirt or corduroy jacket. It could be that the circular magnet simply doesn't have enough surface area to hold well, or it could be the magnet itself. Hard to say! Either way, I'm happy enough with it and may buy others from the same maker."
4.0,Thought the lace was all around but it’s only in front
4.0,"Love it though, gives me an excuse to lose a few lbs. Not really small, it still zips up, just holds me &#34;firm&#34;  lol."
4.0,"very nice shoes and good quality, they do run small luckily I order a size up"
4.0,"Super cute and comfortable! It doesn’t slide in very smoothly, but seems to be holding tight to the watch face."
4.0,My husband bought these for me as a gift. I would have given it 5 stars but the bats are pretty thin. I'm also allergic to nickle. I thought these would be alright because it states that they are silver plated but I did have a reaction to them. I'm not sure I can actually wear them anywhere which is a big disappointment.
4.0,"The SweatVac is a thin, low-profile headband that absorbs a ton of sweat while remaining reliably in place even when I'm engaged in rigorous activity. I've been using it for more than a year for a variety of activities: gardening; jogging; soccer; yoga; home repair; long walks. As a 6'1 man with an above average head size, it fits great and hasn't stretched out over time.<br /><br />The liner is made of extra-absorbent material that wicks away moisture without becoming overly soggy and cumbersome. Indeed, even when it's soaked with sweat, the headband stays in position. Additionally, I've discovered that I can get several uses out of it before it starts to smell a little funky. And once it does, I just toss it in the wash and let it air dry. It dries surprisingly fast. All in all, a fantastic product at this price point."
4.0,good glasses but there are too large got me.
4.0,Beautiful - very pleased!
4.0,"Would be five stars if they were at least somewhat scratch resistant. Second pair in less than a year. Kind of expensive for them not to be. Otherwise, they look great."
4.0,"Fits well, I’m 5.4’ ,the length came perfect, it is very elegant and I received many complements! Of note, the material is different from what it’s shown in photos.."
4.0,"Was what I expected, one small sewing flaw on the tongue that I was able to fix myself."
4.0,"This generously-sized scarf is wonderful for the winter, offering moderate warmth with enough fabric to wrap many different ways. There are definitely warmer scarves out there with thicker, more insulating fabric, but this one is decent for moderately cold weather, especially if you have the right clothing on. My only critique is that it is a little bit itchy, in spite of its softness."
4.0,It is a nice dress but i have to return it since it does not fit me. It runs small.
4.0,Pretty but watch the clasp
4.0,Very soft. Perfect for winter time
4.0,"To add to the confusion of sizing....I ordered 4 dresses of different colors and sizes all from Trachten Haus.  I measured and ordered off of the sizing chart as suggested and a size smaller. I am 5’ and on good days 125lbs. For a total of two size 36(one and one Long in Black).  I ordered the green in 38, long. And Blue in 36, long.<br />The 36 short black was impossible to zip over my ribs!  I was heart broken because I really loved the blue long in person which was also a 36.  And amazingly the blue 36 long fit perfectly!  Not to tight and not to lose!<br />The 38 long black fit snuggly.  While the 38 long green was giant!  The green had very pretty embroidery but the zipper was puckered and was distracting."
4.0,"I ordered a medium and they were comfortable on my 155 pound, 5'7&#34; frame.  The pants are a little shorter on me than pictured but that is a common problem for me at my height.  The cut of these pants is so different than anything I've seen at the stores.  These pants sometimes seem like shorts."
4.0,FIT GOOD
4.0,"Got these on sale and am mostly satisfied. Clearly not the highest quality shoe, but good for the price."
4.0,"Very pretty pierced earrings and they seem to be made well. The ad says they are sterling silver but, I cannot see anywhere that they are stamped .925 telling me they are sterling silver. They came packaged in a very nice purple velvet box. I would have thought that there would be a label or something but, no such luck. However, I was really disappointed by the size of these earrings. They seem to me that they would be perfect for a little girls first pair of pierced earrings or, for my third piercing going up my ear. The back of the earring is very small as well and I had a hard time trying to get it on the back of the earring. If you want a very small earring, this is the one. Otherwise, I would go for a little larger pair. The picture in the ad was rather misleading too. They are much smaller than what you see in the picture."
4.0,Have to hide from family they want them
4.0,I am considering getting one for my friend. I love this necklace. I have always been a fan of ethnic looking jewelry and had to have it.
4.0,"A bit tighter than a usual 8/10, but it's really cute. A bit shorter than I usually wear, but I can manage. The color is really great. I did get a lot of complements when I wore it to work."
4.0,"Beautiful and well made, birthday gift for my son. He absolutely loved it."
4.0,"I haven't worn this yet with a wash included, but it's a nice material. Quite a bit of material, in fact, which can be worn several ways. Pretty colors and pattern drew me to this purchase. I wanted to be able match a few different suits with this cover-up during vacay."
4.0,"Good price, good fit. Weird though, that the socks were labeled &#34;small&#34; on the packaging, but I had ordered large.  Even though, fit well."
4.0,The look good but they are smaller then I want. I would have given a five but the size is to small
4.0,bought for son. he likes them
4.0,Comfortable but way too big.
4.0,Beautiful shirt. True to size.
4.0,Comfortable and light!  I would suggest to always order up a size or two! Love them!
4.0,"The shirt looks as pictured, but the material is a little cheap and the stitching is very loose.<br />The sizing is true to the chart.<br />Good for the price"
4.0,"I should not have gone down a size. I am a 4 on their sizing chart everywhere but my 38” hips. They are little past the size 4 on their size chart. In addition, many reviewers stated that it was good they went up a size. Well, after going back and forth on sizes, I ordered a 6. It’s not flattering and too big everywhere, even the hips. I will need to send it back and order the 4 now. It just does nothing for me larger. It is a very beautiful dress but it needs to fit properly otherwise it can look too matronly. I would say their size chart is accurate if not slightly big."
4.0,"This dress came as pictured, however, it was about 7 inches too long. I had to get it cut so it wouldn't drag across the floor and get dirty since i have this in white. The fabric is nice and airy. I will buy again, but maybe go down a size."
4.0,"Super cute and warm! After their first wash, I noticed a hole in one. Not sure if the washer snagged it, it arrived that way, etc. For the price though, I can quickly sew up the hole without complaints."
4.0,"Haven't worn yet, but love the look"
4.0,Not great quality but still pretty
4.0,Beklo
4.0,"The flares are a bit large, but the plugs are quality."
4.0,"Very nice, smaller than I expected but still worked for what I wanted. I threaded ribbons on them and gave them away as ornaments at christmas"
4.0,"Fits my son great! He loves it. He likes the fact that it turns into a backpack also so he uses it as a pillow on the bus, lol."
4.0,"First loafer sock I have ever worn that doesn't slip right off.  Yes, I know they show with really low shoes but with Topsiders, great. and low boots with ankle pants, even better."
4.0,Super cute and fits great!!
4.0,Nice material and  fit well.
4.0,"Snaps right into place works good. If you have small wrist, you may need to add a extra hole with a lether punch"
4.0,Looks so cute but it is cheap quality.  Also the pants seem a size smaller than the shirt and jacket
4.0,I bought this for my 6 1/2 y/o son. He loved the design but it is much larger than expected.
4.0,"Hmm. So I received a size Medium...i guess i accidentally ordered that size or i had a reason at the time (don't remember). Nevertheless, IT FITS...and a bit looser than i'd like. I normally wear a L and XL and this fits me like an XL. The fabric is loose (not big). It comes down right above my belly button which i think is where it's supposed to. I wanted something more form fitting (maybe with a bit more spandex) to keep the girls in place..i have found that when i sleep it slides up and i'm exposed if you know what i mean. Overall, i like the shirts and can be worn in many different ways."
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised to find that these actually fit completely on my teeny tiny almost non-existent ear lobes. It's a rare phenomenon for me. Also they are nice and sparkly and the sparkles aren't sharp and don't seem to fall off or shed.
4.0,"For all the cheapo clothes you can get on amazon which are disappointing, this was pretty good. Soft, color accurately represented."
4.0,"Perfect fit, soft to the touch"
4.0,I had liposuction and needed to wear compression for 6 weeks... these are great as an added support. I think I got them a size too big but very comfortable. I will continue to wear them especially in the gym
4.0,Nice construction and style just a little larger than expected. Hoping it will shrink a little when I wash it.
4.0,"My wife said that it is very comfortable to wear and exercise, and it has good elasticity, and she can also go shopping, she likes it"
4.0,This is a nice top.. however be careful what you wash it with. I don't know what was in the washer with it but after first wash it has a bad case of &#34;fuzziness&#34;
4.0,"I purchased the Style 3 in black when it was available on Prime.  There was only one size given - waist measurement 30-33.  I knew I was right at the upper limit, but decided to buy them anyway.  I am 5'4"" and range between a US 6 to 10, I generally prefer looser clothing.  They arrived the next day and I was very impressed by the quality material and construction.  The waistband was incredibly tight however, as others have mentioned, and I knew that was not going to work for me.  I took it to a seamstress and had it replaced with a larger elastic.  They now sit comfortably on my hips, there was PLENTY of fabric and the minor alteration was well worth it as these do double duty as both pants and a skirt.  They will last forever - seriously the fabric is super durable and they are well made.  I have no complaints with Mordenmiss. But I do advise everyone to read the size chart carefully and know your measurements!  I am willing to have things taken in, or let out, as needed to suit my body.  I wear these weekly and they are only getting better as they are getting broken in."
4.0,its a really good watch
4.0,These were larger than expected. Worked out fine because I can easily fit two pairs of glasses (sunglasses and regular) in one bag.
4.0,"I ordered a medium, which is what I usually get in cardigans.  It was HUGE!  I gave that one as a gift and ordered a small.  Still a little large, but better.  I'm 5' 2"", 125#, and I wear a small in other items."
4.0,"Nice material, but I ordered the wrong size.<br />I'm almost 5'5"" and 124 lbs and the small is very snug. I'll probably be able to wear this once, then have to give it to my daughter after I wash it."
4.0,"Such a cute purse! I won't use ti every day, but it is fun and cool for a fun night out. I even got a wallet with cats to go with it :)"
4.0,Fits nicely. Good quality!
4.0,"This scarf is pretty. I do wish it was a little thicker and longer, it is pretty thin. The material is soft and the pattern looks nice. It doesn't hang as full or long as I typically like but it would be great to put under a coat!"
4.0,I like that this sweater is lightweight and stretchy.
4.0,"This is a super cute dress.  I so wish it fit me, but if you are not large chested it may be too big on the top like it was for me."
4.0,Would buy it again in another color
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:886dc03fa4599f3e01cbdd09cde3060a]] First off the pattern on this bikini top is beautiful as you can see from the pictures and video and second, the price is amazing ($10 on Amazon Prime).  I just wish that it covered me a little more - I'm a 34 B and I feel it's a bit skimpy but hey, someone may find it perfect for them.  The quality, price and pattern as well as comfort level made me mark it as 4 stars - I think for a lot of women this might be a perfect fit - just not for me."
4.0,"I wanted a Random Ghost for a long time and I purchased this as soon as it was available.  I received a nice color combination (not the best I have seen but far from the worst), very happy with the watch.  I would give the watch itself 5 stars.  I gave this 4 stars (was debating 3) as the packaging was poor.  The plastic Swatch box was almost destroyed.  Almost snapped in half (2 small places holding it together) and one corner has the plastic chipped off and completely missing.  Which almost goes to show this was shipped damaged.  Watch is fine and in great shape, which is why I am keeping this"
4.0,Fun earrings for a tropical theme party. The metal is a bit thin and I don’t think they would be all that durable for everyday wear but they were perfect for my needs and super cute with my dress.
4.0,Brought this work accidentally order the small but it work out
4.0,I have not worn french-cuff shirts in a very long time. I like these cufflinks because I can wear them with any color.
4.0,These are cute but wish the quality was a bit nicer.
4.0,"Creases with folding in package are hard to get out, have tried washing and drying to no avail.  Any suggestions?"
4.0,Me agrado mucho que el pantalon es libiano
4.0,Material is thinner than expected. I like the adjustable draw strings to pull so l up the sides.
4.0,These are gorgeous the shine on these is just incredible and they look amazingly cute only complaint is it can kind of scrape my roof of my mouth when eating but other than that they are so worth it!
4.0,I keep this on my keychain at all times!<br />The hair on the bunny sometimes comes off but for the most part it’s super soft and adorable.
4.0,I wear this alot. I'm short so regular legging always too long. This one is perfect. It sets little below mid calf.
4.0,The wearer likes them they are a little heavy though. Overall pretty.
4.0,Great romper. Soft and comfy
4.0,Smaller than I expected.  Dainty!  Personally enjoy a little larger earring.  &#34;Cute&#34; but I did return.  Quick service on return request.
4.0,"I really like my new red boots. I ordered the ones with the flocked inside for extra warmth in frigid temperatures.  They really are quite warm.  They aren't really waterproof, but I am sure you could spray them with something to make them water resistant. They are pretty comfy.  I have an awesome pair of winter boots that are warm and water-proof but not very comfortable, and I have I feeling that, between the two, I will choose these 80% of the time. The inner flocking sheds really badly. When I take my feet out of the shoes, my socks are covered in brown fur. I am sure that over time the loose bits will wear out of them and it will improve, but I have only worn them about 5 times so far. That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. The upper seems to be high quality, and the soles have enough bounce to them to feel good walking, but I don't feel that the two are glued together very tightly.  These may be just one-season boots, and perhaps I will update that they are or aren't come spring.  Also, the soles don't have deep grippy grooves for slippery surfaces, so these are more for keeping warm in mostly dry conditions, and less for in ice and snow.  Lastly, I wear a 6.5 and euro size 37. These boots don't come in half sizes, but I went with the sixes because the chart said they were 37s, and I am glad that I did. I would usually size up if my half size weren't available, but I am an American living in Asia and have come to find that their shoes that are marked 6 when no 6.5 is offered are usually better than a 7, and these are Asian shoes. I hope my review helps someone!"
4.0,"Love the shirt but be warned, I normally wear an XXL and when I got it it was WAY to big.  Returned and got an XL, fits perfect!"
4.0,My husband really likes this product. He said they worked perfect. Can't wait to try them.
4.0,I wore these for my birthday in 2021. They're the cutest. They're flexible. I can dress them up or make them casual.
4.0,I love these boots they are so cute and comfortable. However the little pull on strap on the heel ripped off when I was putting them on one time. I don’t mind the look without them so it wasn’t a big deal for me I just hope the rest of the boots hold up!
4.0,If you have curves go up in size and it's very short.
4.0,"The earrings are sparkly! They look amazing. I ordered the 6mm one and the size is good. Maybe, I could have ordered 5mm though. My earrings did not come in with any fancy bags. It came with a plastic pouch. I wish it came with a nice pouch though."
4.0,not easy to put on or off
4.0,"looks great, beautiful print. very flowy"
4.0,"I purchased these earrings for my daughter and she loves them. I haven't heard any complaints but one and that is the earrings were smaller than she expected. Nevertheless, she happily received and put them on and that is that. As long as she's happy, then I'm happy."
4.0,It's good for yoga
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful, but it is much smaller than I thought it would be. I have no problem with it though. I took it out of the box and put it on as soon as I got it."
4.0,"Extremely comfortable but too big for me. I am 5’2 105 lbs and usually wear a 32B or 34A bra, and I do not fill out all of the fabric in these. I had to tack my straps tighter to smooth out the bunching fabric at the top part of the bra above the padding. The picture shows the bunching where I didn’t fill it out. They would be perfect for a little bigger sized chest!"
4.0,Good and cozy as sleepwear. Fit perfect for my 5-year old son. The print is also really nice.
4.0,"I really wanted to love this dress - it fit my body perfectly.  Generally I wear a size 6 jean but ordered the dress in size 8 because my chest is 36DD.<br />That said, the problem was ....it showed more breast than I generally care to show. I dont think a boob would actually pop out, but it was just all cleavage.  It's a personal preference thing I suppose.  The length was long, as expected, because I am 5'2&#34;.  Thank you for fast shipping, but I had to return the dress."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter she loves them. Very convenient just slip over your face no fighting with a mask
4.0,It was a nice bag for the price but don't use it much anymore.
4.0,I'm 6'2 athletic body large in the chest run's to small but Great material good looking t-shirt
4.0,"I like the thickness of the pants, and the pockets. Great for work. I gave it 4 stars because the band around the waist rolls while wearing it and twist around in the wash. Otherwise it’s a great pair of pants"
4.0,"I love it! Great fur trim. The only negative, is they did not sew the bottom of the pockets closed. Lost a great lipstick!"
4.0,"I'm 5'3"" 130 and I bought XL. It fits well, but the fabric is flimsey: I thought it would be stiffer so the blazer could hold its shape... it feels more like rayon or loose spandex, not cotton/polyester... It's for a costume so it'll work, though."
4.0,"Thought it would be a heavier material, but i still like it.  Love the longer sleeves"
4.0,This coin necklace is beautiful. The only downside is the amount of “yellow” in it. It looks faux  even put next to other faux gold chains. You will not be able to layer this one must be worn alone.
4.0,"I like it, but I'm returning it because it was too snug, The way this clings made it uncomfortable for me to wear. I tend to prefer shirts that flow, but this looked so cute online that I decided to try it. It just felt too tight and I looked as uncomfortable as I felt in it."
4.0,I love this but medium's a bit small and large is too loose :(
4.0,Hole in the back is very wide but fits well. Really like the fabric good for working at
4.0,Nice material but did not fit my crazy figure
4.0,Nice fit and workmanship but the fabric is a bit lighter than I had  expected.  But not objectionable in the heat of summer.  The one area in which I would improve the design is to add a third pocket to supplement the two on the side.
4.0,Cute shirt! Soft. Neck is a little bigger than a typical T-shirt and I can normally wear a medium but the large fit better ( returned the medium). The lettering seems like it might come off easily so I'll wash inside out.
4.0,The skirt fits as expected the top is a bit large it hangs to low at the neckline
4.0,"It isn’t as long as it appears on the picture, definitely order a size up. I’m 5’3, 112lbs and ordered a medium."
4.0,"I get compliments on these earrings all the time, but when I take them off my ears are green where they touched my skin"
4.0,Very unique. Solid buy for the cost.
4.0,"The fit is good except I feel like I have to keep pulling up my pants when I workout. But once they are up, they fit very well."
4.0,"Cutest casual Minnie dress! One Star off as, Fabric isn’t a super high quality; haven’t washed it yet but i plan on hang-drying. Daughter loves it, but it’s too big on her now. Can’t wait for her to grow into it!"
4.0,Much thinner than i expected but i think that was my own fault. Other than that it is great!
4.0,not as pretty as the show
4.0,It's nice but not the size I needed. Shirt is beautiful I just wish I could wear it. I guess they don't run sizes like you'd think
4.0,Great glases
4.0,"They fit like they should and last , only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because from the picture it looks to have a thicker cuff with words on it. Turns out that is just a bracelet the guy is wearing."
4.0,Was made well stays on adult head good. The band is covered in felt so it doesn't slip around and I have very slippery hair and it stayed on for hours.
4.0,Good pants. Good fit; true to size. Fabric is nice and not bulky feel like some cargo pants. Inseam is 10&#34; which I wished to be 9&#34;(-1 star for missing in description).
4.0,"I bought this for the obvious reasons (Valentine's Day) a few months early and she and I both love it. The two-part charm does fit together perfectly, and it's made of something I know will last and retain its shine. The biggest drawback is the neck chain, which is a bit short and uses those cheap connector pieces. I would have preferred the choice to lower it over my head instead of undoing the clasp every time I put it on or take it off.<br /><br />Otherwise, a solid and fantastic way to say &#34;I love you&#34; in a way that lasts."
4.0,"Purchased this to use on our Disney World vacation. Needed something small to carry phone, sun glasses, I D. It is perfect and two front zippered pockets will be perfect for easy access. Quality is good."
4.0,"Color is more of a beige than white, Else this is a good product.  Fit is perfect, I wear a 12.  Launders well,  ironing not needed, but to those that are meticulous about a good press a hot iron and light press will do the trick.  This season I purchased every color I could find because the fit is so good and the leg cut with cuff works well for me."
4.0,"Soft fabric, and I like the style; I like my tops a little longer though."
4.0,"Don't stay tied as well as I'd have hoped, but otherwise great."
4.0,They work well but on my face they feel heavier than my normal glasses and the top plastic frame is distracting at first.
4.0,veerrrrry big but cute
4.0,"Definitely worth the price.  They bend easily and are a little thin, as they will go through my pierced hole.  They are a little bigger than a nickel which I expected.  I love the size and I love that I can sleep, bathe and just forget about them and not worry about tarnish as they are good quality white gold.  I have always worn this type earring because I don't like changing them all the time.  I just leave them in and these are just what I wanted.  They came in a beautiful little box with a bow.  Just darling, ha."
4.0,I like it! Definitely looks good with many different looks. Great value for the price.
4.0,"This is a standard cotton broomstick skirt.  I'm a size 12 or large and it fits me well.  That being said, it would definitely fit a smaller size well too.  I have the rainbow and it's really cute and festive.  It's hard to tell in the photo with the long dark top the model has on but it is solid rainbow pattern."
4.0,really love the pants don’t care for the shirt to all!
4.0,"I appreciate the number and size of zippered pockets. However, possibly because the purse was folded and rolled for packaging, the zippers were sticking easily due to puckers. I finally got them all closed and pressed each one closed, and they now function, but do not open or close smoothly yet. I'm hoping this improves in time & with use. I really like the strap, too. Easy to change the length from shoulder bag to cross-body bag."
4.0,"This hat is perfect. So comfortable, keeps its shape. I have a bigger head, so it's nice that it fits. The only thing I would like is a string so that I could hang it easier. Also, the strap around the brim broke very quickly, but I superglued it back together."
4.0,Not as cute as picture but bigger than expected
4.0,my kinda style so i order a 2nd one
4.0,Love these socks!! They're warm and comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the way they're sized. I ordered 1-3yr for my almost 2 year old and they barely fit now and I dont believe they would fit a 2-3 year old. I think that's a broad range for sizing. But good quality socks and I definitely recommend them!
4.0,This is a good shirt for what I  need  a little small for a large. . Bit fits. . Sleeves were too long for me so I  tacked them up a bit and looks great
4.0,"I wear these all the time. They're very comfortable. I have a post-baby body - still need to lose the weight, and all the jeans I had were too constricting, uncomfortable, made me bulge in all the wrong places etc. These have a nice modern style, and hide a lot of my trouble areas. I like the butt pockets. Biggest complaint, they bled for a few washes, and they STANK for several more washes. Like a factory chemical smell. No bueno."
4.0,Good socks. They're just the right size for my small feet and the color makes them work with most shoes. They do wear out and stain eventually but that's not surprising for inexpensive socks.
4.0,Smaller than expected. They fit my two year old but not my dove year old.
4.0,"Not as soft as other bamboo socks I have gotten in the past and I suspect they're a blend because it is absolutely not the feel of 100% bamboo rayon, but they fit very well and are relatively thin without being flimsy.  The ribbing at the top is snug without being tight and the pastel rainbow is just a fun bit of color."
4.0,Expensive looking beautiful bracelet that’s also great for layering
4.0,Very nice dress.  Fit well - I am 5'6&#34; & 152#.  But the pink just didn't look good with my skin & hair color.  I returned it.
4.0,"The dress fit very well but it rode up a lot. The band at the hem was also a little tight which prevented me from taking long strides. The white lining shows through in the areas that are stretched out. Shipping took forever even though it says Amazon prime, so keep that in mind."
4.0,She was in her Peppa Pig phase so she was over the moon for the slippers!
4.0,This is a great tie.  It's great quality and looks like it will last a very long time.  It took a while to arrive here in the U.S. as it comes from overseas.
4.0,"Got here quick with prime.  Is super warm, inexpensive and fits okay (runs a little larger than normal with the thinsulate liner)"
4.0,"Arrived quickly, great product.  I'm going to add a little padding to the edges, as they are fairly sharp."
4.0,"These are good summer shorts<br />Fit:  I wear a 34 waist and these as a 34 literally fall off me, so I would size down<br />Material:  these are very thin, which is nice for summer casual wear.  I would not use them as my hiking shorts as I’d have some concern about durability, tears, etc,  But for daily wear, especially in the humid northeast, I really like the thinness of them<br />Velcro pocket is nicely deep, zipper pocket is a little more shallow than I prefer. Not terrible, just by a bit,<br />Color is nice"
4.0,"It is a pretty good bag, very strong! I used it during a Spartan Race and he held up, no problems. The only thing I wish it had is a pocket to hold my phone or ID. Other than that, it is great! I was able to complete the race with water leftover. It isn't bulky and the straps make it fit perfectly."
4.0,Very pretty but losing its sparkle after only 2 months.
4.0,"I was hoping the fabric to be a bit thicker and warmer, they are rather thin, but still comfortable and soft."
4.0,"The material of the shorts is good but some odd things are: The short strings are really long (no a big deal), the inside liner is just not tight enough, lots of loose threads. I think they are good as shorts but the attention to detail is lacking."
4.0,"I chose this one because there's a zipper for change, and most passport holders don't have that. I wish there was a clear holder for my driver's license, but for the price, this one's fine."
4.0,"This purse did not come with an optional shoulder strap/chain which was surprising as I thought that was standard. The gold color was also paler than I expected. The size was good enough to hold my essentials -phone, keys, cash, lipstick, and it looked nice with my outfit. It's a reasonable buy, but not great."
4.0,Standard wristbands. Pretty funny.
4.0,"This dress was bought to wear at a wedding. I am 5’3 and weigh about 130. I bought a size small. I was worried that if I bought a medium it would not fit me because of my chest size. ( A little flat chested) I am small on top and curvy on bottom. I went with my instinct and bought the small. The dress is beautiful and many compliments. I was so comfortable in it.  It does have the problem of having a gap for the small chested people but a good old safety pin saved the day.  It is easy to adujst around the waist but the hole on side that you put the string through, does come apart. Some reviews did mention that. Hope this helps for future buyers"
4.0,"I have bought several pair of these inserts and love them. However, I wear a size a 9 shoe, (walking sneaker) and they leave a small ridge space up in the toe box. I knew with the right fit that these inserts would be quite comfortable. I walk 10-14 miles a day so I am very hard on shoes and my feet. I ordered a size up and they fit perfectly. No spaces at the heel or the toe box. I've looked at other options, but I keep coming back to these. So if you find the insert is not true to size, I encourage you to alter it up a size before giving up on these inserts. You won't be disappointed."
4.0,"The Timeson Women’s lace blouse is perfect to wear with slacks, a skirt or even jeans. It is lightweight and cool. The fabric, which is 100% polyester (Chiffon) is comfortable and feels great against your skin. The color is beautiful (wine/burgundy), and the neckline is accented by a lace design. The pleat in the front can hide imperfections, if you have a belly (I do so I appreciate it). This blouse is very versatile, you can wear the shirt inside or out. It looks great either way. And finally, this shirt fits true to size. I’d recommend it."
4.0,"The color in the picture is a soft blue but in reality it is a much more vibrant blue. It is still okay, I just like the softer color better. For some reason the brighter color makes it look cheaper."
4.0,Had a few small dirt specs on the inside rim. Nothing major
4.0,Great shirt and getting compliments already. I plan to buy more. I bought an XL and it fits fine but I normally wear a large.
4.0,"These are what I expected but it's tough with a one size fits most. I'm 5'3 and these bunch at the knees, and I have to pull them WAY up or roll them at the waist for them to fit. Very comfortable though."
4.0,"Fit's slightly on the small side. The bottoms would be better if they had a lining in them because the material is thin. Otherwise, for the price it's still a good buy."
4.0,Suggested sizing worked for me<br />Wish it was a little further away from the neck but I liked it
4.0,Expensive looking watch.  Good quality.
4.0,"Was shown with a watch chain, came with a thin necklace chain that won't hold it. I don't were necklaces. I do love the watch, it's  beautifull, wish I had the watch chain though."
4.0,My daughter looked adorable in this for her first birthday party. It’s cheaply made so if your looking for high quality I’d go elsewhere. It’s not all one piece - each color is separated so expect to put shorts underneath
4.0,Had a lot of fun with these. Pin trading is great.
4.0,I really like this bodysuit. The hip is cut very high and the arm as well as the back are cut quite low which is reminiscent of an 80’s one-piece swimsuit- which is exactly what I was looking for! The fabric is a good thickness in that you cannot see a dark colored bra through it and it has a decent amount of stretch so it feels mildly supportive. My only gripe is the rear area isn’t quite thin enough to be a thong so it tends to be slightly “bunchy” which may be an issue if you plan on wearing this with thinner leggings. I’m willing to overlook this as I think this is a great product as a whole👍
4.0,For the price you will not find a better pair of church shoes! They aren't as syllable made as expensive shoes but for under $10 ( I paid $5) they are AWSOME!
4.0,"It was fit to size, I love how you have cute styles for plus size women."
4.0,Gets runs easily
4.0,Love the comfortable material & style.
4.0,"I love these - just wish they weren't white on the backside- makes them look cheap. Other than that, I love them. Just what I was looking for."
4.0,it fits but not as oversized as it looks on the picture
4.0,"I'm so happy with these. I was a bit concerned, as I've rangled many an animal with those big bulky gloves and had issues with grip. These seem to have that unique form fitting style that will work much better. Plus, grabbing wire, cutting fish hooks, etc., will be made easier by the free fingers on both gloves."
4.0,It is of satisfactory comfort. I did notice the item was held together by heated glue. This was evident by some dried glue remaining on the fur. This means it will be easy to repair and maintain when it wears out a little.
4.0,Very large mask - my husband now uses it instead of my daughter. Otherwise good mask
4.0,Not bad! Fabric is seen through...
4.0,I'm pretty happy with my new jacket.  It could have been a little more fitted but all in all its a great coat and great price!
4.0,gorgeous but difficult to put on without help
4.0,"I typically wear 1x - 2x (depending).  This boho piece fit like a 5x.  It's super huge.  I'm going to tailor it so that it looks a little more ""clean"".  The colors are very pretty, which is what drew me to it."
4.0,"I'll preface by saying I am used to wayfarers so I was surprised at how light these are. I am afraid sometimes that the arms may snap off. But overall I am very happy with them for what they are and being light is not always a bad thing. I would recommend them to anyone, they are amazing for their price point!"
4.0,"Very cute t-shirts.  They appear nicely made and will rate it 5 star if they hold up to the washings...we'll see, but so far we're very pleased with this purchase!"
4.0,Good support and comfortable.  4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't come in white.  Hope they hold up.
4.0,"Really pretty but seems cheaply made.  Also, it is a sheer material. I had to buy a slip to wear under. Despite this it is really Pretty!!"
4.0,This was a very cute dress for beach photos! Fits is expected has pockets which I loved… The only improvement it needed was to be slightly thicker as you need a slip underneath.  Otherwise very cute
4.0,The latch works about 95% of the time.
4.0,Looks ok. Works ok.
4.0,"The top fits my daughter well but the bottoms are a little baggy in the crotch. No luck trying to shrink them in the wash, but am hoping they cling to her when wet like most swimsuits do."
4.0,"Unusual color - not what I expected, but interesting and I will surely wear them!"
4.0,Cute but not very t-shirt comfy. It’s a little stiff and not very soft.
4.0,"I bought this for prom, super pretty and feels high quality. The only issue is that it tangles really easily so you have to straighten it out and store it properly after you wear it."
4.0,"I ordered a xxl , was 200lbs. Got lots of compliments"
4.0,I have been purchasing Troika key chains for some time now and am very happy with their products. The D Click is very good quality product. I love the design. I just wish it had two more key rings.
4.0,Great quality just a tad small and fell out frequently
4.0,The goggles are good quality as expected. The swimming hat not.
4.0,I do like the shirt. It is somewhat thin though. Many reviews said to order two sizes larger so I did. I should have just done one size larger.
4.0,I like the way these earrings sparkle. They are a little smaller than I first thought but still beautiful all the same. I had to change the backings because they didn't fit well. Would buy again.
4.0,Delivered on-time and great quality.
4.0,"Cute and unique! I wish it were a bit more form fitting as it tends to be a little more boxy than clingy, though some people prefer that. This could also be at least two inches longer. 3 1/2 ⭐️"
4.0,"Great ball, son loves it. Much cheaper here than in store"
4.0,I like the comfortability of the dress.
4.0,I wore this dress for my maternity photos. Super cute and comfortable but white is SHEER! I wore a slip and a sticky bra to fix it but just be aware!
4.0,Perfect size to carry all my junk. It is on the smaller side. But it is sufficient to csrry a notebook. And has many pockets for misc things. If you are looking to put a laptop in here then i suggest getting a messenger bag. I think the intended purpose of these backpacks are to carry light stuff.
4.0,"The top fits just fine, the bottom is a little long in the crotch. Very soft material. Cute"
4.0,"I really did love the product, however, the bottoms were too small and the top was too large- which is surprising as I have a large chest- so going up one size to get bottoms to fit wouldn't work. I'm a little sad, cause its really pretty!"
4.0,Bought them for my son for Christmas he like them. He is 5'7
4.0,Arrived on time and pretty close to perfect.  The black socks that randomly came with them were pretty funny because one was a kneehigh and the other only went up to above my ankle.
4.0,I have sensitive ears and so far I can wear them most of the day with very little irritation.
4.0,nice sweater really cozy. would recommend
4.0,shirt was good but did not like the elastic type band around the bottom of the shirt which causes the shirt to rise up every time you set down
4.0,"Just got it and I love it. I agree that it's beget than Victoria's secret.  Yet to wear, just tried it on.  I will update if anything changes during wearing time or the washing process."
4.0,"Product is good, light weight weight doesn’t look cheap. Wish it had a glass protector.<br />Side button works well, little difficult to move button back and fourth. Over all ok."
4.0,i love the quality of the product.the only short coming is that it is a little big for my wrist and i have no idea if it can be reduced or adjusted somehow.
4.0,Good quality even after few was.
4.0,I love anything Oakley - these are great solid Aluminum styled &#34;O's&#34; & should look great on my truck once I get them on - I'd suggest a wee bit of clear silicon seal around the outside of the frame of this &#34;O&#34; if your planning to mount it on a vehicle - the two way tape which comes with it will not survive outside elements - high quality will help keep these on your vehicle for a extended period of time.
4.0,"I loved the dress, but it was too big.  I ordered a 3x (my usual size) and it was huge and too long.  So I ordered the 2x petite, it was still a bit loose (but looked fine with a cardigan), but was still too long.  Really loved the fabric and pattern, but finally decided to return as I found another dress that fit properly.  Really good customer service (they called me after the first return, so a good company with quality products."
4.0,"Perfect fit and great look. Excellent sole and well made. They dry slowly and don’t drain water quickly, so not good for wearing all day wet."
4.0,"I wear a size 6 in women's shoes, which is about a 4 in big kids. I get kids shoes all the time, they are usually cheaper and brighter colored. I got these because who doesn't need slippers! I figured being 4-5 big kids they would be a little bigger, but they were a little snug actually. They are pretty cute and the hard bottom is great for running out to get the mail or Amazon packages :)"
4.0,"I got these to cover my forearms but so far I haven't needed to used them but I know I'll be very happy with them.  They're light-weight but I just wish they came in a skin-tone color so they're not so obvious while driving but in general, I'm happy with them and would recommend them."
4.0,"A tad bit short for a 5'9&#34; girl, but because of the way it's made, I can pull it off. Really comfortable."
4.0,"I absolutely love the designs and level of comfort Solmate socks deliver!  I, however wear a size 14 and even the XL socks try to rip as you navigate the heel of your foot....so I just leave them on 😷😂"
4.0,Purchased as a gift. I'm told that it is comfortable and fit perfectly.
4.0,I got these for the hocus pocus themed jibitz. They are really cute and were a festive addition to my sparkly crocs. Saw the idea for it on tiktok of course. They are very sturdy but the backs a just a tiny bit too big. It’s easy to get them in but it tore a couple of them when I struggled to take them back off. I was disappointed about that.
4.0,Very comfortable & fit perfectly
4.0,"Shipping was very slow, fit atleast 2 sizes too big - think men’s sizes when you’re ordering. But very comfortable and I am able to tie it in a knot on the side to make it fit a little tighter."
4.0,"Beautiful tap shoes, love the Velcro feature, but my little one has a small, narrow foot and these were a bit bigger than other brand's size 13.  Just go a half size smaller possibly?"
4.0,"I am usually a size Medium, but I felt more comfortable in the Large.  I weight 155 and 5'2. I wear a 34DD. The split is very high and its still a very cute dress. Overrall, its amazing!!!!!"
4.0,"I like the colors and the shape, my Granddaughter loves them!!"
4.0,"Nice mask, and is made well. But beware, it runs large. Sized more for a man. The red glasses on the pattern should be at the top and not at the bottom where it kind of disappears."
4.0,Good quality and delivered on time. I would recommend this product to others.
4.0,Light weight. Simple. Look real. My new favorite studs to wear.
4.0,"they are very small, if you have wide nostrils like me i wouldn’t recommend them. the bright side is it comes with a lot so if one falls out you have plenty to choose from."
4.0,I normally wear a large so this fit as expected.  It is super comfy and warm.  I wish it was a little longer to come farther down length wise.  It fits just at or slightly below waist level and I like sweatshirts to fit a little lower than my hips.  Neckline doesn't choke you when putting on or putting hoodie up so that is a plus.
4.0,"I ordered this for a costume party. The size medium dress came, very good quality but it definitely ran big. I am 5’7” and the hem was about 3 inches too long which that never occurs. And then I ordered a small for better fit and hoping it would be shorter.. nope! I returned both because I didn’t want to pay to have it hemmed. I see but I don’t have a sewing machine that will cut off the hem and stitch it which is needed related to the type of material. For this reason I gave it a 4 star.."
4.0,Bought for handbells at my church.  Price isn’t great.
4.0,I tried it on and it looks good.  I haven't actually worn it yet.  I'll wear it on my next cruise.
4.0,I wear an 8 and these are about an inch too long...........they are extremely comfortable though.  I thought that they were leather and that is the reason that i bought them.  The strap looks like some imitation leather.  It is lined with fabric.  I love the shoe though....just thought it would be leather.
4.0,A little small but nicely made and true to the colors in the picture.
4.0,Material is thin but dress is very pretty
4.0,"Really pretty earrings! It doesn't get 5 stars from me only because they get stuck on everything. They have a curve to them making th get caught on my shirt, dresses & hair. But I really like them other than that!"
4.0,They fit nicely. The fleece feels soft and the Velcro is a great touch.
4.0,This is a really cute shirt. The pattern and colors are as pictured.  It's pretty true to size
4.0,"Other than the fit I guess I could play around with it once I get the proper size back each month just to see how long my hair stretch from a big hair chop 2 years and one month ago.  I like the quality of the shirt I thought it would be of a cheap quality since it's just used for measuring hair lenght but it wasn't. I was very surprised and I like the meaning &#34;Patience&#34;, is something I must practice in life."
4.0,Down loft is compressed  when you take it out of the package. Give the parka some good shaking and let it sit for a while  down will puff up and it’s good to go. Very wind proof and warm for our cold and windy northern winters
4.0,"I bought this as part of a cosplay costume for my daughter. Everything about the belts were fine except how to actually strap them on. The directions are confusing at best. It took me, my daughter, her friend AND a youtube video to figure it out. All I can say is that the belts are great once you figure them out, but pray that you never have to use the restroom because they are not easy to get on and off. In summary: Overall good quality belts, could use some less confusing English directions. I suggest marking each belt for future use."
4.0,"Well, I purchased it for myself...without checking the face size.  It is big!  I'm a small old lady and it looked like Big Ben on my wrist.  Rather than return it, my daughter is getting it for Christmas, and it's a great gift!"
4.0,It's beautiful but the edges are so sharp. I usually can't wear it longer than an hour.
4.0,"Have ordered these socks several times and have been completely satisfied with company follow-up, price, fit and results.<br />Several socks have failed after considerable use at the point the two colors come together at the ankle resulting in a small round hole which will continue to grow.  I believe a reinforcement at this point would stop this.  I use a Jobst stocking donner and it seems to put stress on this point so others may or may not see a hole at this point.  I have been completely satisfied otherwise and will continue to use these socks."
4.0,The pants fit a little smaller than expected. Shirt fit as expected.
4.0,As a woman in my early 50's I need this fan for my hot flashes. I have several and keep one in my purse for when I'm out.  They have come in handy!
4.0,I love this dress! I bought it for an anniversary dinner. I feel like a beautiful fragile butterfly!! I only gave it 4 stars because the shoulder strap seemed too insufficient to hold up all that material. I ended up using their little 'belt' as more straps to add onto the existing one to beef it up. So I did do some minor alterations
4.0,I was waiting for this product so eagerly and loving to review it. As soon as I opened the outer packaging I was smiling. The red box packing was no nice and attractive and also one red gift bag came along with it if we want to gift it. And as soon as I opened the box again I was very happy to see the white paper packing. And opening that I found the scarf for which I was waiting. The Red color is so nice to see and wear. Good for any formal parties. The material( I don't feel 100%silk but) is so nice and soft and I just hold it in my palm for few minutes to check out if it is warm and yes it was warm. I also like the knots tutorial which I got it with this scarf. With the pictured tutorial we can wear our scarf in different style. I got this product in discounted price for my honest review and I recommend it to buy.
4.0,"Im 5'4 190 and the XL fit nicely not too snug and below the knee.  This dress can be easily dressed up or down. Comfortable dress, material is not heavy or bulky, but its not see through either."
4.0,Only problem was that nose wire was off-center so had to cut mask open to reposition and stitch it.
4.0,Bought these pants as part of a Halloween costume for my daughter.  Quality isn't the best but for the price and intended use they are fine. Actually look better on than I expected.
4.0,"these don't work as shoes, it is for glasses(jeeze)"
4.0,"I really love the print, the light weight, the perfect size, all the slip pockets, and the stiff bottom with feet!  It's like getting a Vera Bradley for less than half the cost.  Rated only 4 stars because fabric is a little stiff and also, only time will tell how it wears."
4.0,good quality but does run a tad small.
4.0,It’s good but material isn’t that great.
4.0,"Great shirts, but they are too tight. Even an XL. Guess they run small."
4.0,Too small and short. I would like to return if still possible.
4.0,Wish it was a little more sturdy for the wind
4.0,Granddaughters were happy with this!
4.0,Thin material but very comfy. You can dress it up or down. Happy I got it.
4.0,"This is really pretty in person.  The sequins details really make it.  I have the coral peach.  I normally don't wear orange but this shade looks good on most and matches of other clothing.  This is not just a bathing suit coverup, although it makes a cute one.  This looks equally as cute with jeans and tank top or a dress.  I'll wear this a lot this summer.  I have a dress by this brand and it is also really well done.  I'm a curvy size 12, Large, and this fits me well with plenty of room.  "
4.0,"I am 5'9&#34; 150lbs, I ordered an XXL as I wanted the blouse to be a bit looser.  Next time I will orde an XL or an L as this is just a little too big.  I am<br />Impressed with the fabric and the weight of the material as it is very light but NOT sheer at all.  This will be cute with jeans or shorts and is easy to maintain.  I was very pleasently surprised."
4.0,"Beautiful top. Just a little large, but very comfortable."
4.0,"These ear cuffs are very nice and has a nice shine to it. They're a bit thicker than I had expected, however, they don't feel uncomfortable on my ears at all (sometimes I have to ne checking if they're still there to how unnoticeable they are).<br /><br />They're fairly easy to bend. The reason I knocked a star off was because I received it with one of the earrings bent out of shape, but I was able to bend it back in shape.<br /><br />To me, so far, it was a good purchase."
4.0,"Super soft and thin so great for working out... My only issue is how much boob/sports bra shows in the front... I feel like maybe a little extra material could've been left there lol. Other than that, i really like it."
4.0,This is great for dress shirts with the added support of compression. Only issue is that the logo can be seen when wearing thin or white dress shirts so make sure you are wearing a suit jacket
4.0,Looks cute but wish it had at least one clasp in front
4.0,Too cute!!!! I love them!!!!!
4.0,"I wore them with a dress and  hose. The hook and buckle is interesting and I like it. When putting them on or taking them off, I must do so from the front, while staring at the buckle area. Perhaps in time I will be able to hook and unhook them without even thinking about what I am doing. So far I love the shoes.  With hose on,  my feet slide forward too far.  I can remedy this by applying a Foot Petal to each shoe where the ball of my foot rests. Next I will try them with bare feet. I haven't worn wedges in many years. They feel great!"
4.0,"Very cute,just like picture.arrived quickly."
4.0,"Fits a bit tight, but super cute. I love it. Haven't &quot;used it&quot; yet, but hope it remains as comfy as it was when i tried it on"
4.0,"Very Nice nice belt. Definately high-quality. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I was sent the wrong color and size, whoever's fault it may be.  Ordered a 32-34 and received a 52. But I cut the belt myself with a knife and the tool provided with the order. Was easy. I'm probably going to buy another one with a different color."
4.0,"I love the look of the bracelet, but it is very difficult to close the clasp that holds the bracelet together!!"
4.0,"This bathing suit is extremely flattering however, I didn’t like that the lining was white.  It kept poking through and I felt it made the suit look a little cheap."
4.0,Both my husband and I tried these. They felt comfortable overall - well cushioned and supportive.  The fit on one of us was fine - the other found the top a little tight around the ankles.<br /><br />The color is a very pretty blue.  Wont exactly match anything we wear but pretty
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress. The fabric is kind of like wearing a burlap reusable shopping bag or a scout uniform, though. Bought a size up after having read the other reviews and it fit nicely."
4.0,It's really neat looking but the chain is so cheap the chain broke within a week of me having it.
4.0,Cute bee suite not a bad price.
4.0,Ol lady liked it.
4.0,Great garment! Well made and fits and holds in those problem spots. Overall comfortable to wear even after 12 hours.
4.0,I thought I'd compare this to my current minimalist wallet. They both are about the same size and the clear spot for my ID isn't an issue because it's been a decade since I was carded.<br /><br />I like that there's plenty of room for all my items and I can keep cash inside or in an outer compartment. I'm using the magnet-clip for my headphones but could be used on its own with cash and an ID & credit card when really downsizing.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars because it's a little difficult to access the inside. Hopefully this improves with age. I'll probably replace the leather pull with para-cord but otherwise it's feels great in my front pocket.
4.0,These are very cute. I bought these and the rose gold colored. I loved how they looked. The only problem is that I have worn them twice and the &#34;gold&#34; is already off-color. I guess I can;t ask for too much with these prices.
4.0,"Despite reading the reviews, I got my normal size. They are a whole 2 sizes too big!"
4.0,Nice belt.  Good color.  As described.
4.0,These goggles are not anti-fog
4.0,It's very compact.... The colour is beautiful
4.0,I’ve bought maxi dresses before from amazon and never had luck finding a nice fabric that felt sturdy and not sheer. This dress is PERFECT. I am currently in the process of losing weight and I’m 5’6” at about 200lbs. This dress was a little bit too big but I usually wear XL and I didn’t want to be disappointed if I bought a L. It came with a sash/belt which was a nice surprise because I can mix it up with belts if I want. Thick enough to wear on cooler days too with a nice flow scarf! Totally happy with my purchase!
4.0,"It's pretty, I like it. There's not much more to say, though my girlfriends think it's super cute so that's always a plus!"
4.0,"They fit well, but could be a little more snug around the belly."
4.0,Excellent good quality garment very beautiful
4.0,"Great for the price!  They're a bit small, but the price is just right for their size!  I have a 'Tree of Life' pendant and they complement beautifully!  I like them."
4.0,"well made and looks beautiful, just make sure you order a bigger size."
4.0,Product fit as expected. I did not keep the dress as it was too casual for my wedding. This would be perfect for a beach or casual wedding. It is a nice dress and reasonably priced.
4.0,"not as long as I'd thought they'd be, should've used a ruler"
4.0,"First of all, my watch came in a nice box, with no signs of use and working very well. Since receiving it last week it's been running +5seconds/day which is quite good for an automatic movement (though perhaps the ""chronometer"" is a little bit optimistic). In general in various positions it runs from as little as +1s/d to as much as +12/d and it's very satisfactory. According to my diamond tester, the hardness of the glass does not match sapphire so probably not sapphire glass. I'm guessing mineral crystal.<br /><br />The dial is a very nice sunburst silver dial. The IWC Portuguese watches this resembles (chronograph by face and automatic by function) has a whiter looking face which also claims to be silver but this has a very different look. Even so, the Parnis has a good look and seems like a great watch.<br /><br />The watch has a very thick and stiff black leather band which feels a bit rubbery but works adequately. I suspect it needs time to wear in. Some have complained about it, and if you buy it you might end up switching it out, but it works pretty well. I find it comfortable.<br /><br />I don't know how long this watch will last, but it's quite a nice watch with an accurate automatic mechanical movement and thanks to IWC, this watch is beautiful to look at. It was my first Chinese watch and it's a very good introduction to just how inexpensively it's possible to make a nice watch."
4.0,I ordered these shoes and they arrived sooner than expected. They were cute and they fit great. My son has little fat feet and these fit great.They are so easy to get on him and are adjustable. I'll probably order these in the next size as well.
4.0,A very snug fit which is very unexpected
4.0,got this ring for my husband. great choice his friend had the same exact ring but spent hundreds of dollars. very glad amazon was around.
4.0,Visca Catalunya!
4.0,Works how it's supposed to and is quite curtious  of the company to include  it for no additional charge.
4.0,"The slippers are lovely and very warm (just tried them on). However they were more than a bit too large for me. And perhaps because of this or for other reasons my feet did not feel secure (when trying to walk it them). However I am keeping them to use as a Christmas gift for a friend, Hopefully the fit and color will work for her."
4.0,"I love this top in the picture, but when I put it on, it's much shorter than pictured. This totally sucks as I am disabled and don't drive, so getting to the post office is not possible, so I'm stuck with it. I'm hoping the seller has a kind heart and would replace it. * shrugs* (crossing my fingers) I wear a med, so I ordered a large, but looks like I should have gone with a 1x maybe, so it would fit as it looks in the picture."
4.0,Material was not as nice as expected but really nice product for the price. The dress is ribbed and the material is kind of thin.
4.0,They look and feel amazing except they're pretty small. If you dont got a small head dont buy.
4.0,"These silk pajamas are awesome! The fit is true to size . I'm 5'9 135 lbs medium fit very well although the pant leg has a  &#34;cropped&#34; look on me fitting just above my ankles. I'm not sure if this is the design or if technically they're too short but I'm happy with the<br /> look , feel and deliciously intense colour which was as shown. Will buy again."
4.0,We used these for our &#34;USA Drinking Team&#34; Halloween costumes. They served their purpose for a few parties we went to.
4.0,It looks great but its a little small. Even adjusting the tightness doesn't help much and it always feels like its close to slipping off. I don't usually have problems with hat sizing either. Quality product just a little too small for me.
4.0,Not worn them yet just a little big
4.0,"These are beautiful, delicate and elegant, exactly what i wanted. HOWEVER, the post that goes through the earlobe is a very uncomfortable width and hurts my earlobes (very tall and flat, not rounded) I will have to have them replaced with regular sized posts at the local jeweler. That being said I couldn't find this type of elegant hoop in Sterling Silver anywhere near this price point for months now so definitely still worth it."
4.0,"Wasn't expecting much but these sandals are attractive, comfortable and have moderate arch support"
4.0,Very soft. Silky material.
4.0,"The price may make you think it's junk. While it's not a high end band, it works very well for my LG GWatch R and feels better than junk. Worth it."
4.0,"I love my new product which I received back in February 2014.  The leather smile etc very happy also arrived early.  I ordered the butterfly, I love great jewelry ."
4.0,Love the jumpsuit runs a little small so I’d suggest  ordering a size up from the norm...very flattering!! I’d recommend.
4.0,I received this dress and it's as pretty as it is on the picture. I got the blue and it's really nice. Material is heavier than I expected and might be to hot on very hot days. It's  too long for me. I'm 5'5&quot;. I had planned to buy the green one if it fit and it does just much too long. I had to have it hemmed and that cost $28.00 so I guess I'll pass on the green one.
4.0,Belt and buckle are good quality but the length is overstated. I wear a 56 leather belt and could get belt to go into the buckle. I have transferred the buckle to another belt until I lose another 20 pounds.
4.0,Great quality and super cute fit
4.0,"This dress is soft, flowy, beautiful on… however the neckline was wonky (halfway between chest and neck with short straps.  I cut the straps off the back, folded and sewed the neckline down and tie it like a halter and now it’s one of my favorites! For reference I am 5’7” 145-150, muscular build, short torso/longer legs.  36-29-38 measurements."
4.0,"I rarely buy clothing online because of concerns with sizing. I read a few reviews indicating these run big, so I bought a size lower than I normally would. It is still a little too big on me, however, I love the style and ordered another one a size smaller hoping it will be a better fit. For the price it's worth it! Other than sizing being hit or miss I love this suit and and it's very comfortable!"
4.0,I bought this hat for my wife for Christmas.  She likes it.  It appears to be well made.
4.0,I'm a politically blue girl living in a politically red area/state. This shirt speaks for me. I just give them them stink eye and point at it!
4.0,"I really loved this style, and with a pair of platforms this looked great, got lots of compliments! I ordered this in white and be warned you will need some nude undergarments!! the color shows everything! also, i am a a size 8 pants 5'7&#34; 145lbs small chested with a little bit of a booty and i ordered a large. maybe an extra large might have been the better choice? i do not have a long torso and it wanted to wedge itself up in my lady parts :/ i dealt with it for the event i bought it for but i dont think i could wear it again unless i ordered a larger size."
4.0,"A bit big, but overall a good buy! Once they're tied, they're fine. Material looks sturdy (I hope lol)."
4.0,"I really like this skirt. It is very flattering to my figure. For size comparison I am 5'0, 25 inch and 35 hips. The skirt came just above my knees the skirt was loose on my body. I ordered a S. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it's very see through. Depending on how it looks in the sun I will have to now wear a slip in 105 degree heat … not sure that's a plus or not. The skirt is so cute I probably will do it. Beware that this material is fairly sheer. If you are under 30 you aren't going to care probably because it's not THAT see through...I'm a prudish 80s teen if you know what I'm saying"
4.0,"These are awesome pants!....... Got them for Xmas. I'm going to by myself a couple more, but guess what, I got the exact same pants from "" Wal-Mart"" ! EXACT FROM WALMART! LESS THAN $23.00 !"
4.0,Good product for the money. Only they are not tight fitting and rattle a little when the pressure is removed.
4.0,a tam with some head room....good fit and color
4.0,Not good quality...
4.0,As good as it gets for the price.
4.0,"I like this but the arms are way way way too big.  Even as a kimono style, it seems a bit excessive.  And I’m a big girl (Generally a 1X but in some styles / brands I can wear a L and in others a 2x).  That’s just a lot of arm hole.<br /><br />Looks really nice when work open or tied at the waist.  I don’t like it when tied with the tie as you lose all shape then.  Tying it at the waist worked out much better, giving me a waist.  Being chiffon it’s very lightweight and great for layering.  Especially in summer if you aren’t comfy showing off your arms but want to wear a tank because it’s hot out.  that’s the only advantage to the oversized arms.  If your arms are on the bigger side, no one will notice."
4.0,"Got this to wear a few weeks after breast reduction surgery.  Fit nice, was comfy and didn't irritate my incisions."
4.0,"This bag is great because it has lots of pockets and it fit several towels, our wallets, our phones, a couple books, a couple water bottles and more. The only thing I don't like is that it's mesh throughout. Because it's mesh when you set it down in the sand, it gets everywhere. I know their thought process is that you can rinse it easily but I brought back way more sand from this bag then I ever had with a non mesh bag. I'd probably use it again cause I don't want you waste my money but I really wish the bottom half wasnt mesh. And I wouldn't take it to beach again, I'd use it for other types of trips or outings."
4.0,"The hats fit well, they made a great time at Thanksgiving.<br />Some stitching could be better but its not designed for heavy use."
4.0,"Nice looking crew socks right out of the bag.  Bright colors, tight knit, proper sizing - lives up to the product description in all respects.  Even did a quick test to wick moisture:  these socks certainly aren't waterproof, but water still beads up as advertised.<br /><br />And while they're certainly comfortable, they're more like dress socks than athletic socks.  The material is thin, with no additional cushioning whatsoever.  This makes for a nice, snug fit but doesn't really provide the support I'm accustomed to in an athletic sock.  At a similar price point I can buy a 10 pack of crew socks with extra cushioning at the heel and ball of the foot.  Maybe not in these snazzy colors, but an athletic sock really isn't about style."
4.0,"Don't buy~&#62;2016 Hot Fashion Toddlers Children Girls Love Heart Straps Jumpsuits by FEITONG, Black, 2T(1-2Y). Horrible stitching on product and frayed out fabric strings everywhere...everything else I bought I loved and looks great."
4.0,Really good mask. To me it's amazing.
4.0,"nice design, not too good material but acceptable."
4.0,"Fit ok.  Not high waisted, as stated.  Developed a small hole in the leg seam a few weeks after wearing.  Repaired, since they were cheap.  Good look."
4.0,Love the color and when I first got it love the fit. Washed once now its two sizes smaller.
4.0,"A very nice looking watch. I really like the blue dial.<br />The strap is good enough in terms of looks and color, although it has room for improvement. Perhaps a different strap would complement the watch better.<br /><br />My only problem is the thickness of the watch and the fact that you cant individually set the date. You have to keep moving the hands 24 hours to change the date.<br /><br />So far I'm quite satisfied with it. I hope it lasts long enough."
4.0,"This is large for its size. Saving for next year, hope he still likes adidas"
4.0,Soft material. Perfect for under a seethrough dress!
4.0,I like these gloves I have not had to use them yet due to weather warming up.  The only off putting thing is that they came with a fair amount of the stuffing material loose in the packaging.  These are currently a we shall see item.  The good thing for 4.95 even if they fall apart after one ride that is still a dang good price.
4.0,Used the medium option for wet swimsuits following a day at the beach and was surprised it didn’t leak. Love the size options for traveling.
4.0,Fit me but I was hoping for a little off the shoulder action like the photo. It works just as a sweater.
4.0,The fabric is quite thin... I fear it my break quickly. Loved the colors and versatility.
4.0,"Great great boots, so comfortable. The only thing is they get dirty really fast"
4.0,"This is a nice necklace, better than I expected. It'd be even better with a slightly longer chain & larger pendant. I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,Nice watch for a very low proce
4.0,"Runs very small and tight.  It is also much longer than your usual camisole.  I am 5' 4 and it comes below mid-thigh if I stretch it down.  I like that because it guarantees that the lace trim will show under whatever you wear over it, but it is worth pointing out for anyone wondering how it will fit."
4.0,The dress itself is beautiful but their sizes are not true to size! I wanted to use this dress as my beach wedding dress but unfortunately their 2xx is more like an xl.  Quite a shame as I was so excited about it!! Wish they at least made it in a 3xl as they do with other colors of the same dress.
4.0,The jeans I ordered were “black 68” I would have given 5 stars but the front pockets are fake! I normally wear a 10 and I ordered a 10 and they fit great. I have long legs and the length is perfect. They washed up nice. False or fake front pockets is a bummer.
4.0,The belt was perfect. It looks great. The fit was large and the hook not quite tight. I had to manually adjust the fitting. I have a small waist so technically I am an outlier.
4.0,"I really like these, but they are very small...Would have liked them larger.  But still very pretty."
4.0,I like this dress.  Cute and comfy.  Fit is right.
4.0,I thought it would have the number 15 on it and the colors would be more vivid
4.0,"It looks exactly like Dean's, but after a couple weeks of on-and-off wear, the paint started to flake off around the nose and swirl."
4.0,My daughter says they are confy but looks a little bit cheaper
4.0,"Good quality, a little bit tight for me. Stitching at the top is pretty prominent, unlike the photos."
4.0,"This item that was designed to be utilized as prescription glasses frames, they say. They look really nice, however, they do not possess the very important feature of having spring hinges which are, in my opinion, crucial for every day use. Spring hinges not only make the frame more comfortable while wearing it but it also provides the peace of mind of knowing that when laying on a pillow (or anything similar) the hinges will not break, but &#34;adapt&#34; instead."
4.0,It fits a little small but it’s very soft and simple and I can’t wait to wear it
4.0,My hair dresser friend liked this necklace. It was decent quality for the price.
4.0,Love the look and feel of these earrings but lost one due to weak backings. 😞
4.0,Love this hat. One star omitted because it was missing it's chin tye strap. Luckily I had a thin fabric belt that i slipped through chin strap loops..matched perfectly 🥰
4.0,Love the structure and the style
4.0,"Very nice shirt, looks good and good stitching."
4.0,"These jeans are near perfect.  I love the higher waist, they are comfy and quite pretty.  They fit very well in almost every regard.<br />The one and only issue for me was that they are on the shorter side for my height (5’10”).  They certainly don’t reach my ankle (like the ad shows), but are too ling to look “cropped.”<br /><br />However, they are so comfy, I chose to just roll them up a bit snd make a cuff so that I could keep them.  Hides some of the embroidery, but still cute.<br /><br />For someone of average height, I super recommend.  Taller ladies, just be aware that they will run short."
4.0,"My daughter loves it and wears it quite often. The colors are beachy and vibrant, but not neon. Exactly what she wanted. I think the waxy coating helps it hold up well."
4.0,Beautiful shoes. Returning. Fit big.
4.0,"Very cute shirt, but clingy. It is not a T-shirt material. It’s a more clingy and slightly more see through material. This is a fitted shirt, so keep that in mind when you order."
4.0,Faltan más colores y tallas
4.0,"I originally bought this dress in the orange and in a large.  I am 5'7"" and 170 lbs.  The large was a bit flowy in the skirt so I wanted to try the medium but it was too small in the chest.  This dress is nice material and a nice length.  Overall it is a cute dress."
4.0,Very pretty dress. A little smaller than expected.
4.0,"Glasses are cute, serves the purpose!"
4.0,"Look great and are very comfortable, however they don't keep my hands warm for an extended period of time."
4.0,"Love the skirt. Fit is nice. Fabric is nice, but does not give so order the right size. I got compliments 1st wearing it. Got the spice like color and it looks even better in person. Length hit right below the knee. Good buy."
4.0,"Good socks but slightly shorter than I thought. That being said, I'd still recommend them."
4.0,Bought this brand at whole foods years ago<br />Well made but was sent the wrong item. No issues with any ear irritation
4.0,The only reason these jeans get four stars instead of five is because they are not skinny jeans like the picture portrays. They are boot cut. They fit perfectly with my Chelsea boots but they are not skinny leg. Something to think about before buying. They are awesome jeans though!
4.0,un poco grande pero de momento se siente que mantiene el cuerpo caliente; 95% polyester
4.0,Cute but a bit uncomfortable if your feet are on the wider side
4.0,The face mask offers good coverage and stands up well to hand washing. The only issue is that it holds too much moisture. Walking around outside for an hour the area around my face was picking up the humidity from my breath and the area around my neck was soaked.
4.0,Fits well according to husband. Makes feet sweat easily.
4.0,"Muy bonita la tela, me encanta que tiene bolsillos. Corre un poco pequeño. Muy bonito el traje y buena calidad."
4.0,I use them in my military boots. The weather is getting hotter and my feet welcomed them. So far so good.
4.0,Fits really well. Material is high quality just a little big on my on the shoulders...
4.0,"This jumpsuit is made of great material - it doesn’t feel hot, but it’s thick and feels well made. It’s not too clingy and the shape is great. The color is pretty and the belt is a great touch - the buckle is cute and feels of good quality. The fit just wasn’t quite right on me, but it was very comfortable and I appreciated that the sleeves and construction make it appropriate for work. I didn’t end up keeping it because of the fit - my legs aren’t quite long enough to pull off the wide leg - but I would definitely consider buying another article of clothing from this vendor."
4.0,"I wear a size 42R and usually have to order an XL in tshirts. But this shirt (XL) was a little large for me. I would estimate it as a 44R to a 44L size. It looks and feels great however, so I just wear it loose. I thought there was nothing truly remarkable about the shirt. Nice athletic cut with color trim on ends of short sleeves, however, my wife did compliment me on it, and that is the case with about 15% of my shirts. So, overall, nice find."
4.0,"very sleek and cute. This runs very small so think about that when ordering. Very cute and cool, flattering and sexy."
4.0,I like how the belt is very stretchy & is attractive. The belt isn't very long so ensure the length is long enough.
4.0,Works very well. Excellent.
4.0,These are very comfortable to wear.
4.0,No issue works fine
4.0,"Daycare requires a full body rain suit bc they go outside every day, rain or shine. My only complaint is that it is fleece lined which makes it a little too warm for the back to school time in August."
4.0,"Even though it's small, it's still easy to put on, and stays on the whole time. It looks nice and simple, and I can't feel a thing at all."
4.0,"This is a beautiful clutch wallet case. It has become my functional wallet. However, I still intend to buy a cling case for my phone has no protection while in use and out of the wallet case."
4.0,I loved going out shopping with this bag and it was able to hold all the I need to carry out with me. The only problem I had was the stitching came out for one of the chains so I had to see it back together.
4.0,The shoulders do not drape on me as your model on display.  Got many compliments when I wore it to work.  Wore it without belt.  I do no like belt option.
4.0,"The top is AMAZING! I could wear it everyday and it is adjustable for all sizes. It is extremely flattering. The bottoms are really cute and flattering as well, but the fit more like a thong than just 'cheeky'. But as a whole it's super cute and sexy if that's what you're going for."
4.0,Good looking product.  Right Price.  Fits a little small
4.0,"It super cute! The only think is I feel it's made for individuals with long torsos. I'm 5'5, 175 lbs and I ordered a large...it kinda scrunched up in the middle, but it's not obvious to onlookers."
4.0,"These are very cute, and fashionable, however I must drop off a star due to only having 3 sizes to select from. The smallest size is way uncomfortable on me, with it being slightly too small, and the middle size being just a little too big. -- noting that taking a look at other collars on Amazon all have the sizing system, so take it with a grain of salt, you probably won't get much better. ((I wish they'd come up with a system with more sizes, maybe like a belt, or smaller buttons to click together)))<br /><br />The colour selection for the price is amazing. The material is comfortable, and good looking with no imperfections as far as I can see, and the quantity of how many you get make some of these singular $10 dollar black chokers look like a major rip off, and these a shining eagle."
4.0,Comfortable with arch support
4.0,"They were warm, ended up cutting the fingers out. The magnet is awesome. Loved the hand warmer pocket. Did the job for what I bought them for. No complaints"
4.0,"Obviously, I got this solely because I'm a product of the 90's and yanno...<br /><br />Sadly, it did not fit my face properly; every time I spoke the mask would come up over my chin, like there wasnt enough material.<br /><br />But the design and fabric was nice."
4.0,"Loved the saying, just wish the font size was larger. A scale next to the charm might help people see exactly how large it is in person."
4.0,"They are great. They stick well and are easy to take off, except if you have bigger breats they wont really do much but lift your nipple."
4.0,"It's a little hard to tell the true colors of this mask from the listing, which is why I wanted to emphasize in my title, that the overall effect is primarily Gold with sequins of a variety of colors interspersed."
4.0,It was soooo soft I love it!!! The only thing is... which isn't even a problem is the fact that the print on the arms are different from each other. Hardly noticable.
4.0,"I received this product for at a discount in exchange for a review. They are SUPER cute - I can't wait to show them off. They arrived sooner than estimated, although it was still a long time - almost 2 weeks I believe.<br /><br />I'm curious to see how these hold up. They fit me really well, but I'm a small chick (5'1'', 107 lbs) so I would not recommend for anyone that typically buys size M or larger in yoga pants. The elastic waistband it odd, too - it feels like a free floating band of elastic (think men's hanes underwear) free floating within a larger seam/pocket (sorry, I don't know textile technical terms). All in all I really do like the look and fit. I will have to see how long they last and how much I notice the weird elastic in them when I wear them to a class before I could say if I would pay full price for these."
4.0,"The shirts themselves are solid for the price point. You’re getting three compression shirts for the price of one name brand compression shirt. Only downside to the shirts is that they run small, given that you will be washing them, I would suggesting sizing up at least one or two sizes up! Quality isn’t the greatest but again for the price point you cannot beat it!"
4.0,a little short on the arms but the rest fits and feels great
4.0,"Good fit. Lightweight, airy and comfortable. Amiable design."
4.0,lovely tote lots of space to hold my 3 quire books without struggle. the straps are slimmer than I anticipated hoping they will survive. But VERY GOOD thus far
4.0,Great conversation starter.  Very light material and it took a really long time to ship from the UK!
4.0,Fits great.  I just wish the waist and length was 1-2 inches lower.
4.0,The necklace is beautiful and was delivered fast after I ordered it. The colors in the necklace are beautiful. Bright and very vibrant! It is a little short on length but it is a chocker style necklace so keep that in mind forsure!
4.0,Dress is well made. We are pleased.  Dusty blue is as pictured.
4.0,The arm straps should adjust a little more.
4.0,I really like these and most have been great so far! I did have the clear one break where it screws in. The ball part broke off and it’s not fixable. The other ones are fine.
4.0,Pretty good swimsuit. The top is somewhat small. But overall a good purchase
4.0,"Got this a couple days ago and wore it the whole weekend while streaming. First thing I did was try and figure out the ugly yellow drawstrings, After 5 minutes of realizing they're doing this guy no good, I grabbed my pocket knife and cut them off. Totally loving the hoodie aside from the first 5 minutes of owning it. Looks great, feels great. The zippers in the hand pouch are a somewhat helpful feature too"
4.0,They're really big...I love it
4.0,not bad for the price love it
4.0,"The wallet I had that opened had a wrist strap.  Sadly, this model isn't made any longer but this was a close second.  I like this style of wallet and will probably cut and resew the strap to make a wrist strap.  I really didn't want a cross-body bag, because I like the flexibility of putting the wallet in my larger purse or carrying in on my wrist."
4.0,Love this. Fits true to size is super cute however impossible to wear if you are alone because you can’t possibly unzip it by yourself to go to the bathroom if n
4.0,I love this top and ordered one of each color. The silk is surprisingly great quality and so comfortable. I wear theae over leggings as an outfit. I am afraid rolling in bed may rip them because the bust fitting and shoulders are very tight. Overall this is a fantastic shirt!
4.0,"Nice feel and falls nicely.  Have ordered a second color.  Did order up 2 sizes from what I would normally wear, so keep in mind that they run small, unless you want a very tight fit."
4.0,Decent quality. Still haven't decided on whether I like the necklace itself. Every row of beads is different. Kind of &#34;Aztec-y&#34;.
4.0,Can't keep them on my son's feet; he seemed to slip out of them very easily.... but they do fit as advertised.
4.0,exelente colores y material
4.0,It's kind of heavy but works great... Wish it was a bit smaller.. but overall happy
4.0,Loved it! Fit great I seen the reviews saying it ran a little small so I went with a medium and it fits great. I’m 130lbs 5’3 and it’s great. I just the arm holsters could be tightened
4.0,"So going on what everyone said and reading the sizing chart , I ordered two sizes down- I'm 5'8&#34; and 185lbs and I'm normally a large; I ordered a small. The gown really flows at the bottom, which is great, but it's a little constricting on my chest and the sleeves are very tight. Since my breasts push the dress out pretty far, I'll probably have to wear a belt with it so it looks like I have a waist. Overall it's a really nice dress. It's comfortable and has pockets! Just wish the arms and chest weren't as constricting. I'm afraid to order a medium and have it be too big on me."
4.0,Very pleased with the product but
4.0,"This is a very nice key wallet, especially considering the price. The leather is very soft, the stitching looks good, and the snap buttons close securely. When you open the wallet, it has a pocket on the left with a flap that snaps shut and an open sleeve on the right. These pockets are relatively shallow, and will most likely not be used by me outside of holding spare change or receipts.<br /><br />  The wallet is roughly the size of my old iPhone 4, but just a bit shorter. Though still longer than my previous key wallet, which was easier to slip in and out of my front pocket. There are six hooks in this wallet, and one large clasp presumably so you can hang it from a belt loop. If you have a lot of keys, you definitely could attach two, maybe three to each hook. The aforementioned clasp is fairly narrow, so unless you have narrow belt loops you'll just be folding it into the wallet which is what I do.<br /><br />  Overall a very nice key wallet and definitely worth a try if the keys in your pocket are causing discomfort, or you need a new key wallet. Currently I have 4 keys and car key fob in mine for reference."
4.0,Fit the car perfectly.
4.0,Just enough bling! Easy to attach to watch and just pull it up the chain and it's done. Stays snug all day and I'm very active at work. Recommend this buy.
4.0,"If you are, say a large, then you better order 2 to 3 sizes bigger...just saying it is a small fit."
4.0,These are decorative to be worn over a mask.  I got them for my grandsons so wearing a mask can be a little fun.
4.0,"look nice, a little clunkier than I expected"
4.0,Nice quality but runs big. Wanted it roomy so Ordered medium for 5’2” 135 lbs but returned for small. I was hoping the weight of the flannel would be heavier.
4.0,"Ok, I wasn’t expecting much for the prince, is decent, I am happy with what I got, it does rum small, I ordered 2 sizes up, I am small and order large, the color is not the same as the first 2 pictures, is like the 3 last pictures."
4.0,"With the strength of the sun, we are trying to encourage our little one to wear sunglasses in order to help protect her eyes.  And sunglasses are the perfect addition to the Easter basket!  Unfortunately, they are a little big on my almost 3 year old.  They seem to stay on her ears (her head measured 49 cm in January) but fit loosely on the bridge of her nose.  I suspect it might be closer to age 4 before they fit her well.  They are very cute and seem sturdy enough for the price.  I will report back if we have any issues."
4.0,Very wide in shape
4.0,Nice soft wig. Quite comfortable but runs a little small.
4.0,These look as advertised but are a bit thin. However my husband loved them.
4.0,Beautiful back but hard to lace up
4.0,Cute little gift. My sister loved it!
4.0,"I liked it in the picture, however it doesn't quite fit my ear like it does in the picture...but it is really cool."
4.0,"The design and color is super cute, it’s very well made.  I bought for my 2.5 year old. She’s between a 3T-4T so I bought a 4T. It was small out of the package. I washed (cold) and air dried and it fits like a shirt now. I would go up at least two sizes if you want this to fit as a dress."
4.0,"Decent bag for traveling/weekend. Perfectly fits laptops and additional electronics. Straps are sturdy and I haven't had an issue with it so far. It is a canvas bag so it won't hold it's shape. Overall, good bag! I recommend it!"
4.0,"Shirt is great quality! Unique layered fillagree design, washes well and get tons of compliments."
4.0,Super comfortable. Very pretty on.
4.0,good quality.  but i think large size is better fit to me.
4.0,I like. Little on the to large on top  It fits but the symmetry is what I'm referring too. Still something I wear a lot in the winter or golfing if I ever had the time.
4.0,Good variety and bang for your buck. Some a are a little frágil but have gotten tons of compliments. One set broke when they fell from my cabinet
4.0,Love it. Will order more.
4.0,"I am usually a 4/6 and between a small- medium in tops so I ordered the small. It’s still very loose and low cut. I’ll be using it as a swim cover up. Nice, thick material and very cute tassels. I washed mine in a garment bag and it held up well. I had seen a recommendation to hand wash this because the tassels got tangled and unraveled."
4.0,Slim design
4.0,It's very 😍cute
4.0,My daughter loved it. The quality is not so good and it's not durable but is fun and good for the price. Lasted for one Halloween and made my kid happy.
4.0,"Looks very good, good protection from the sun. only draw back is hat arrived with some dimples in the top portion that I can not seem to fix. little picky but noticable."
4.0,Super comfy. Cute colors. Stretchy. But not thick enough to cover nipples. Great for working out or under clothes though
4.0,"Cute, looks a little cheap but it was...."
4.0,Abalone is varied in color so you never know what your going to get. The shell piece is small so the color will be limited. Mine are more of the brilliant blue which are pretty and both studs match well. I have two holes in each ear and got these to go in the upper one so I can wear a hoop in the lower. Works perfectly!
4.0,"I like this, they are a great summer sock, but are a bit thin for winter"
4.0,Exactly like the picture. Very cute!
4.0,Nice quality and appearance. I'd buy another!
4.0,This costume is great! Great quality. Definitely size up! I’m a medium and got XL- fits perfect.
4.0,"Helps with my plantar fasciitis and my tired feet at end of the day. The only problem is the pair I ordered are too large, (so order size down), but after wearing them I didn’t want to be without them to return. Will eventually order a smaller size."
4.0,"I ordered both the &#34;light grey&#34; and &#34;beige&#34; colors. Really cute design and the material is thick. Sadly, it was too snug for my head and also for another adult friend. However, it fit perfectly on a friend's 8-year-old daughter! So while it may not fit most adults, it's an adorable hat for young girls.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I receive no benefits or compensation whether I write a positive or negative review. All opinions are based on my individual experience."
4.0,Great set for the !obey. Fits well and very comfortable. I must stress that you wash these at LEAST 3 times before wearing because they do bleed and will discolor anything you sit on.
4.0,"I was very excited to find and order this product. My so is testing for black this October! I'm shine my dismay when it arrived, in a completely shredded box! I was terribly concerned the slats would be broken or damaged. Luckily they were not! I examined the product before UPS left, and I'm glad I was able to do so. The cardboard was extremely thin and poor quality. Thankful the boards were intact."
4.0,"I am 5'4"" about 125lbs. I really wanted to keep this dress, even tried two different sizes and decided to return because its length on me was just too long. The dress went about 4-5 inches above my ankles and I thought that it needed to be closer to my knee than my ankles to achieve that wow factor.. Also had to size up because the XS was too tight around my butt and legs, I wanted a more relaxed feel around the legs. If you are tall, 5'8""+ I would definitely recommend this dress!"
4.0,"Big, roomy, well made. Great price!"
4.0,"Seemingly well-made, durable, comfortable and a good value.<br /><br />Pleased with them and wearing them most days for work."
4.0,I love the shoes even more in person. Definitely agree that the sizes were off. My daughter wears an 11 and I ordered an 11 and they were about 2 sizes too big. Re-ordered a 10 and they're perfect. We loved the shoes so much I kept the bigger pair for later on.
4.0,Very cute fit with this dress
4.0,I received and thought it was way too large but ended up putting both my RX glasses and Sunglasses in the case - it WORKS!<br />It works real well as I know where both are most of the time.<br />Downside - The lining inside is a hard plastic with the coating - it has cracked at both ends at the curve and pulling away from case.  Guess I will have to replace and shop for perhaps a better one.
4.0,Fit well and wasn’t cheap fabric! Definitely a great purchase!
4.0,Very good product will purchase from this company again came really fast
4.0,It's very stretchy! However I have big arms in proportion to my body so the fluttery arms make it look even bigger. Great dress though! Wish it flattered me in the arms.
4.0,"Comfortable, breathable, fits great!"
4.0,"I got the size medium black-gray-blue set. I'm 5'6"" + 125 pounds. They fit me nicely for a long-sleeve t-shirt type of deal - but they are definitely not ""compression."" I will wear them, but not as a compression layer under a t-shirt, as planned."
4.0,it fit perfectly. the color is great. pattern beautiful. came on time. however i received a neck tie. i contacted the seller about that hopefully i can send the necktie back and get the bowtie coz that's the sole reason i made this purchase
4.0,This are adorable! I marked it down because I feel they are way too big for earrings. For them to look write your ears need to be quiet large...
4.0,"Beautiful bag, well put together. Love the color! Only downside is how narrow and stiff the opening is. Can't reach in it or find things easily at all."
4.0,They are comfortable.  Need to buy replacement filters to go with it
4.0,I like the look eventhough is a bit too big.
4.0,"Cool mask, but it was a bit hot to wear.  But then again, is there such a thing as  a ""cool mask?"""
4.0,The shirt is excellent quality and the pattern is great. The only reason I gave in 4 stars is because the material is stiff. . I think it will loosen up over time though.
4.0,Was looking for a small earring for multiple piercings on my tiny ear. These are very cute but definitely too wide for multiple placement on the same ear. Great quality for the price though.
4.0,It came just like the picture. I get so many compliments on it
4.0,Product got loose after 2 washes. but mostly true to size
4.0,Fits well- My daughter is a size 4 and the small is perfect
4.0,"Really cute, model pictured must be very tall, it was a little longer than I thought, but it is really cute.  Fabric is fine, but not over the top nice."
4.0,"the actually suit is made of pretty good material. does not feel cheap. whats a little annoying is the size. I got a large, and i usually wear a medium, but the bottoms were still too snug and the top was way too big. but with some stitching, i got it to work"
4.0,"I had to return the original boots I ordered.  The website recommended ordering a full size down- the boots that arrived were too small.  I think the- fit is more true to size.  The top fabric of the boot is difficult to get your foot through.  I am hoping it stretches a little.  Once on,  the boots are a good fit."
4.0,"A little faded when arrived. Stitching was done well but not straight at some spots. Other than that, very beautiful from a view an arms length away."
4.0,"Thought from the photos provided that this watch would have true tachymeter function. The watch came with the second hand stopped at 12, and all other functions working. Was disappointed after releasing the second hand with the first push on the start button, I was unable to stop or reset the second hand. Thought I was getting a watch with true Tachymeter function. Other than that, I like the watch"
4.0,Nice once
4.0,Cute hat. Came down a little longer on the side of my face than I’d normally like but definitely warm.
4.0,"Very comfortable, good fit and great support for my walks and yoga sessions."
4.0,"not fresh water pearls.  These are shell beads, but they are great."
4.0,"super cute but super tiny.  gave it to a friend, easier than returning."
4.0,Is a simple silver cross that comes with chain. I gave it to my older son who loves it. Im not sure if it handles water. We received it about a week ago.
4.0,Very beautiful and also of good quality but I hope they use another way to send the earrings other than in a plastic bag ...
4.0,good quality and nice sun protection. No more sun's lotion needed.<br />But the size I bought was small.
4.0,I thought it would be more soo a hunter or olive green than the brownish green it actually looks like
4.0,"I have yet to wear it outside, but I tried it on inside my home. Good fit without the heaviness. The color is true as advertised.  The brim is large enough to cover the face and back of the neck, which is a plus. The only thing is that you have to play around with adjusting the sides (i.e. as pictured); but, I think after the &#34;break-in&#34; period, the hat should be easier to shape. I would recommend the Coolibar Beach Sun Hat to the consumer."
4.0,These were great with my elastic banding I use in making face masks.
4.0,Nice piece. Not flimsy exactly as advertised. Good buy!
4.0,It’s very cute. We have a cafe in our area called bees knees. I bought it for the owner
4.0,"I ordered this in a medium and I'm keeping it because I'm worried the sleeves on the small would be too short as the sleeves on the medium are perfect but otherwise I wish I had gotten a small. I usually am a small and ordered a medium because of some other reviews I read. Order whatever size you usually are! I ordered the green and the color is fabulous. Nice comfy sweater dress. It's a little thinner so if you are looking for a true sweater dress this isn't it.  If the sleeves were a little longer, I would buy this in small in multiple colors. As a tall skinny person, I often have this problem with sleeves so most people won't have this issue."
4.0,I purchased these biking gloves and I was happy with this product.  These glove provided me the comfort and padding that I needed to enjoy my bike outings.
4.0,Beautiful shirt. Extremely comfortable and perfect for the summer.
4.0,"I was drawn to these cat eye sunglasses when I saw them.  They look just as they are advertised.  The tint is not a dark one but dark enough.  I was afraid the floral embellishment would look cheap and gaudy but it doesn’t.  The detail of the floral design is exquisite.  These sunglasses feel lightweight.  I was expecting them to be a little weightier and more sturdy so that was a bit disappointing.<br /><br />However, they do not disappoint if the cat eye look is what you’re going for.  They are classy and chic looking.  They will look great dressed up or with jeans and a biker leather jacket on.  You will definitely stand out with these on."
4.0,Fits my son prefect!
4.0,Average quality and fits ok.
4.0,"Runs large, great fabric. Loved"
4.0,"Bought this Tarasenko jersey for my 11-year-old daughter. The fit was fine around the torso, but the arms were borderline too short (and she is normal height for her age). Returned and exchanged for L/XL--she'll be able to wear that for a few years."
4.0,"Beautiful, but fits too tight.  I am a tall person, so my wrists are larger than most.  It would probably fit a shorter person just fine."
4.0,"Slightly smaller than expected, but I am pleased with the performance of the material and the product."
4.0,"The product is good but the size was incorrect, I got a 16&#34; suitcase instead of 18.5&#34; . But I was promised a refund so I am fine"
4.0,"Dress fit as expected. I was hoping against hope that the sequins would be securely stitched in place and unfortunately that was not the case. However, that was my only complaint."
4.0,"I just need something to hold my very stretched out reading glasses onto my head while reading (propped up with a pillow while laying on my stomach). I'm not crazy about the silicone (I'd rather have fiber); but, for the price, these are a pretty good deal. I don't think I would care for them if I had to wear them all day; they would be difficult to adjust on a frequent basis."
4.0,"This is a nice price of jewelry. Doesn't feel cheap, the clasp is a bit tricky but the overall look is nice!"
4.0,"I love the T-shirt and the nice colors, but I don't think it's true to size.  The product info states that a small is 4-6, but I think the small is more like a 2-4 size because it was a bit snug.  If it was a true 4-6 size, I would have had a little room, but the fit was a bit tight, or too fitted.  Therefore, if you need a little room, I suggest getting a medium because it's more 4-6 size.  I ordered a medium, and hope that it will fit right!"
4.0,They work well under scrubs ..
4.0,"It is a very nice sturdy band, but it is very hard when you open it and doesn't shape will.  You'll need to condition it or soften it."
4.0,I've received multiple compliments for this piece! It's very unique and bold!!! I may purchase in another color :)
4.0,Nice quality bangle for the price
4.0,"I LOVE the material! It's super soft! This does run small. Based on reviews I ordered a 3x and it fits like a 1x. Only thing I dont like is it doesnt really have any shape to it. It's borderline on being too short but I'm 5""10"" with long legs so this might not be an issue for a shorter gal. I took 1 star off for the shape and the sizing being off"
4.0,Will only fit one size 12 shoe.  My wife can fit two shoes in each one.  But they appear well made and we are still using them.
4.0,This is the perfect solution. My husband lost his previous hearing aids because the straps of his mask pulled them out of his ears. He just got new ones and we had to find a way to keep this from happening to his new ones. (Hearing aids are very expensive.)  This works perfectly. And it’s more comfortable than the straps around the ears.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars but it’s difficult to hook the mask straps into the metal clasps.  But once it’s hooked on it’s great.
4.0,Very easy to attach when you look at the website photo!
4.0,"Good watch,that has a low profile,it will never get snagged when working fast or getting things in and out of pockets.<br />The only design flaw is the small light that only lights up the hour but not so much the minutes."
4.0,I love this style of sunglasses. They are very flattering. I get compliments whenever I wear them.
4.0,I had to return because this skirt unfortunately does not look good on me since I have such a short torso. It looks as described. Good quality and overall quite pretty. True to size.
4.0,"I ordered this for my teenage daughter for an event she was in. She wears a women's size 4 and the tutu was a little tight for her, but not uncomfortably so. The quality is acceptable for the price, but get this in early enough to air out or hand wash - the packaged smell was a little off-putting."
4.0,My daughter loves the color and wears this often. My complaint is that it pills too easily. After only a week it looks worn and has so many pills down the sides and under the arms.
4.0,"Great frame, fits well, I really like it.  Like the other reviews mentioned, you will have to switch out the lens because their logo is stuck on the stock lenses, no way to get it out."
4.0,My kids love playing kitchen and dressing up
4.0,Works great!  Easy to use to be able to change purses.  Grab and go
4.0,"This was a Christmas gift to my 6-year-old, but it was way too difficult for him.  My 8 and 11-year-olds put about half of the set together and then required adult help.  There is a mistake in the instructions that held us up for quite a while.  One of the construction steps lists 4 of the half round black pieces as being required, but the parts list only shows three included in the set.  We put together everything else and found that there were 2 quarter round black pieces remaining  that substitute for 1 of the half round pieces.  After we finished putting it together (it took about 3 hours), it worked perfectly and was lots of fun!  The elevator is really cool!"
4.0,"I like the overall, but runs a little bit big"
4.0,"color was not quite what I was expecting, but I find it hard to choose colors from computer."
4.0,Girlfriend loves them for kayaking! Totally cute pattern
4.0,THIS IS A CUTE SHIRT. I USUALLY WEAR A MED/LARGE AND I GOT THE LARGE AND IT WAS A LITTLE BAGGY ON ME. BUT I LIKE THE WAY IT HANGS. VERY CUTE WITH JEANS
4.0,Nice watch. Happy with both the product and shipping. It came quickly and with no problems.
4.0,Stitching comes out easily. Comfortable.
4.0,It's a cute bracelet. However in the picture the skulls' eyes appear black. In person the eye sockets are not blacked out- they appear whitish in color. Otherwise I like it.
4.0,It's a very light weight and breathable band. I wear it while running and sweat doesn't stick below the band unlike other solid bands. The charms are very cute. I have used it every day for last couple of weeks and it's good so far. I would recommend this band.
4.0,"I like it, but too small to read to appreciate."
4.0,A little long. But love the color & different material rather than velour.
4.0,The picture didn't show the grey on it but other than that it's just as it says
4.0,"This is a very beautiful choker but the fabric needs stiffening up (I bought some fabric stiffener but haven't done it yet).  It just needs a little stiffening because I do not like extra tight things around my neck and to make this look wonderful, you will need to tighten it up or stiffen it up so I have chosen to stiffen it.  I have gotten many compliments every time I wear it and it goes with white, pink, red, red-purple, and I bet you could put it with other colors also but the rose and the pearls are why I bought it in the fist place.  I love flowers and this rose is just right.  The size is just right for the choker and accents the necklace wonderfully!  I accidently got a red color stain on it and it washed right out the first time with little scrubbing involved.  The necklace looks brand new!  I accidently got a smudge on it again and I just rubbed a wet finger over it, put it on and it was dry by the time I got to church!  My suggestion is the company put a stiffener in the package with it with instructions on how to put stiffener on it if you want.  That way if you want a stiffener, you have it, can lightly apply it then after washing apply it again apply again.  I look forward to wearing this masterpiece for many years to come!"
4.0,Best thing about it is its awesome portability. I can keep this in my pants pocket. Decent glasses but a little uncomfortable resting against your nose.
4.0,"Handy replacement. Will discolor and fade with time, but the quality for the price is quite good."
4.0,Runs small. Id. Be sure to order a size up. Cute shirt though.
4.0,Ordered in white and it was way too see through. Love the fit and smooth feel though. I may try ordering in darker colors.
4.0,Pretty item the back piece suck and the earrings are kind of heavy
4.0,"is a little thin, but great for the gym."
4.0,"Overall a nice jersey, especially for the price. I would say if you are sometimes in between sizes, go for the lower size because it’s slightly more roomy than I expected – but not too bad. I got an XL but L probably would have been OK. It has a nice length that fully covers your backside as well as a nice elastic band that helps keep the jersey in place. Zipper works nicely up and down in the front."
4.0,We bought three of these and two bags fit our little kids 4-8 and the other bag was to big.
4.0,"This purse is lovely but it's a bit of a pain to get items in and out, even with undoing the snaps that hold the top closed. I also don't like that the longer strap is not removeable. But it will do."
4.0,it looks good but not the most comfortable band.
4.0,"The leg portion of these ""boxer briefs"" seems to be a little shorter than other brands. These are more like a  ""girls -boy short"" cut."
4.0,"Dress fits exactly as expected; it's a little &#34;boxy&#34; meaning it doesn't come in at the waist. All in all, it's a very comfortable dress, if I get it tailored/brought in at the waist, it would be PERFECT."
4.0,Pants have defective fasteners for adjustment feature
4.0,Needed a hat for a safari halloween costume and found this one.  Only problem is I am asian and this hat looked more like one of those cone shaped asian hats on me.  Had to put a coat of tan spray paint and used a strip of electric tape to make it look like there was a strap across the top to really make the hat look right.
4.0,"I ordered a med. im about 5'5 and 126 lbs (US) material is stretchy, jersey like material.cute/goes to my knee"
4.0,Thicker material than I was expecting--still t-shirt quality just thicker. Like dit.
4.0,It's a cute SMALL purse.  Cool for toddlers.  I have her use it to carry a few toys when traveling locally (so she doesn't LOSE anything !!!)
4.0,Light and flowy.  Daughter loves it.
4.0,"Purchased this product for my kids and their teacher. Kids didn’t use because they thought it was very uncomfortable, but their teacher uses it every day. Says it helps the student to hear her better"
4.0,"Nice material and pattern, but somewhat large."
4.0,Good quality- Bought as a substitute for a Maaji bikini and looks so similar.
4.0,The are definitely medium length. Not short. Easy to put on. Love the assorted colors. Don't look cheap.
4.0,cute one.
4.0,I took measurements as suggested but the hat was still a little too small.
4.0,"I love this necklace, very delicate, but I think is overrated"
4.0,This shirt is comfortable but it’s see through and no bra really looks good with it but it’s light weight for even hot summer days
4.0,"I've recently ordered Magiftbox cheaper sleeveless hoodie and gotta admit YoungLA looks fancier, though it's also heavier (250gr or ~9oz vs 140g or ~5oz). For easier comparison, your iPhone or Samsung 6/7 weights about 130-140g or ~5oz. The material is nice, but doesn't feel like dri-fit.<br />Me: 43' chest, 5.9' tall, 185 pounds, purchased Large, based on the top reviews that claim medium to be too tight/small. Alas, I find Large to be a bit too loose for me and i'd rather stick to Medium, though i have no nip slip with Large.<br />P.S. It was too bright, so color may look like a dark blue, but it's actually a pure black."
4.0,Good but a little see through.
4.0,"I love this hat.  It fits well, and is what I expected.  However the way that is was packaged was undesired.  It was wadded up, and it took me some time to mold it properly.  I was glad, and feel fortunate that I was able to get all the indentations out."
4.0,Shows a lot of skin because you can't make it fit better
4.0,"I am 5'3"", 158 lbs, 34DD, and typically wear an 8/10. I bought this in a medium and wanted to love it, but it had an extremely short torso which gave me a camel toe. The smocked top was very flattering and had some stretch. The jumpsuit itself is made of more of a rayon material that has 000 stretch."
4.0,I love ISIS so I love the bracelet. I gave 4 stars because the snaps started changing colors....I expected more from the product and it's price.
4.0,This is beautiful and the price is just right.
4.0,"Feminine and good for young or old, one arrived bent but fixed it easily."
4.0,I really like the necklace. The chain is sturdy except the end links but other than that it's perfect. Thsnks
4.0,They make my bum look good! Haha<br />I am a size 2/4 or 26 in some jeans and I got a size small which is super small. I think a medium would be perfect!
4.0,Beautiful shirt but I otdered too big. Loved how the material felt and looked. Ordered a smaller size and sold my original order to a friend.
4.0,"My son loves these sunnies. For the price, they are great! Very durable for a 4 year old who is learning to take care of things. They do scratch, but not as easily as you would think."
4.0,I wore this while overseas on deployment for my swim practice. I absolutely thing it's one of the cutest and most comfortable swimsuits I ever owned. However the lower band of the top got messed up somehow maybe from the dryer and I was not ever able to fix it. It happens maybe a month into wearing the swimsuit.
4.0,The picture on the mask is beautiful! The only thing I’m not happy with is that it didn’t come with filters. It’s a gift for my niece and it would have been nice to have filters for her to start with. I tried it on and it’s a little big but I’d rather it a little big than too small.
4.0,"Used in an ace for my daughter, worked perfect!"
4.0,I really like it. It looks exactly how it does in the photo.
4.0,"This is so soft and beautiful. I was really bummed when I received it with a white stain near one of the arms though. After trying to contact the seller then reaching out to Amazon, the only option was returning and buying it again at the current price. I caught it on sale so didn't want to hassle with the process and then wait for a sale to hopefully come up. It's a lot snugger than the picture but still fits fine."
4.0,"These socks are as described.  They wash well, no shrink.  Very pleased."
4.0,"This is the perfect solution to my COVID sports bra only issues. I wanted a non-racer back sports bra to wear under shirts with lower necklines etc and found this one. They only had this Caucasian color, but it turned out to be great for under white shirts! Definitely low impact. You can see the cups are a little funky. It’s gotten looser the more I wear it between washes but overall it keeps me out of an underwire bra. Works under SO many work shirts. I was yelling in excitement. Will I ever wear a normal bra to work again? Unknown. It’s not the highest quality for activities but for lounging, it is 10/10, would suggest. I am a 32C and I got a small."
4.0,Bought this for my 5 y/o size 5 The shorts are a bit big on the waist but its wearable. Good material.
4.0,This is my second time ordering from this site.  They offer quality products at reasonable prices.  The anklet fits nicely.
4.0,"not as high waisted as I had hoped but like the,feel of the material."
4.0,I found these to be true to size and very comfortable. They will be plenty warm for cold weather climates. They fit true to size.
4.0,"Super cute, a little shiny"
4.0,Very pretty top. Works great to wear it work.<br />It's quite big so order carefully.
4.0,Fit well except the back straps were a little loose and for bigger breasted people not recommended because side and under Boob is a real struggle with the top
4.0,"I ordered a size up as recommended in the reviews that I read. Fits good, neck is a little oddly shaped, gaps a little on top of my right shoulder.  Cute shirt though."
4.0,The dress was nice but it really runs very big and it's long
4.0,Biught for our trip to the beach. Worked out great. Only dislike would be they are tinted. The kids didn't like that very much.
4.0,Was never able to give it to my girlfriend at the time because she broke up with me but hey it was still a nice necklace
4.0,"Uses ""IIII"" in place of the correct Roman numeral ""IV"" for 4'o'clock position."
4.0,I like how fast this came. The quality is nice. It's lightweight and has a nice stretch. I am excited to wear it as my hair grows out. I will be ordering in more solid colors. I only gave 4 stars because the print is smaller than on the model...and I really wanted the bigger print.
4.0,"great colors, nicely made, very dramatic statement necklace! (a tiny bit scratchy on the underside or it would be 5/5)"
4.0,Great toys for kids but 8/40 pcs were duds and didn't work.
4.0,"Smaller then it appears, but good quality."
4.0,"Bought these as a gift, made that person happy, satisfied"
4.0,I like the look and feel of the earrings but they are really small.
4.0,Was expecting a white color on the outside and inside of the keyblade
4.0,"These fit true to size, they are very cute, and they are super comfy. I'm 5'9&#34; and wear a size 7.  The length is better for flats if you are my height.  My only complaint is that the material kind of reminds me of my mom's nylon pajamas.  lol  They are sort of shiny and snag easily like if you cross your legs under a desk and they come in contact with a wooden surface.  I don't think anyone will notice the tiny snags and I will just be very careful with them in the future."
4.0,A shout out to customer service who reached out immediately after my first review and offered for me to try another band.<br /><br />I have been wearing the black leather and silver band for 3 days.  It's a perfect blend of the bangle and watch band. Light and comfortable.  The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because I don't like the style.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another when there is another funky fun stylish one available
4.0,"Took our 5 month old granddaughter to her first beach trip.  The hat was the perfect size and kept her from burning up in the sun.  She's too young for sunscreen, so the hat and an umbrella did the trick.  Great quality and stayed on her head."
4.0,"So I bought this belt since I fluctuate in waist size like most other folks and preset holes in belts just weren't cutting it for comfort. I saw this on sale and gave it a shot. The mechanism works great, and the cut to fit was simple and left no visible evidence. The box it came in is really nice, and would make this belt a perfect unwrapped gift. However, I think that's where the problem lies. They could have shipped the belt in a boring box and used slightly higher quality material on the belt.<br /><br />The stitching is fraying and the &#34;leather?&#34; is separating in some spots on my belt. I probably wear the belt 2-3 times a week since ownership. The buckle looks just as good as the day I got it, and the ratcheting system still functions perfectly. So I'll wear this thing until it completely falls apart, I just can't wear it with business attire where the belt isn't covered by a shirt.<br /><br />So would I buy another one? Yeah, but only during a great sale. Would I give this as a gift to someone? Probably.<br /><br />*UPDATE* 11-23-2016<br />Marino contacted me and offered to send me a replacement belt. I'm changing my review from 3 to 4 stars because I would have reviewed it as a 3.5 initially. They get a .5 boost for outstanding customer service. I'll come back to this review in a few months and adjust the review again if warranted (in either direction, as if the replacement belt doesn't fray in a few months it's definitely a 5 star item with the customer service)"
4.0,"It's small! It's about 23 inches long and 14 inches wide. It's also 16 inches tall. I was expecting something a lot longer. Still though. It's a great looking product. It does come with a shoulder strap, and the inside looks weather proofed and clean."
4.0,"I was looking for something slightly different and so far, I've only used one of the black earrings, but I love it. It does take a little patience to get the ball screwed on because it is a bit small; however, the size works because I sleep with it in.<br />I gave this 4 stars because I have only tried the one. I ended up giving the rainbow ones to my mom, but she hasn't tried them yet."
4.0,"I LOVED the 32 below masks from Costco so nearly went full meltdown when they stopped selling them. Enter these bad boys, the straps  are a little bit thicker and I’d say it’s about a half inch bigger all around so not exactly the same fit but similar material and comfortable/breathable for wearing all day without getting a sweaty face"
4.0,I think they are good sandals. I was just expecting a softer material.
4.0,A little shorter than described but still cute
4.0,These are great for sketcher shoes.th
4.0,"These leggings are soft & comfortable.  They are almost like nylons but a bit thicker and opaque.  I bought them to wear with tunics,<br />and dresses that are a little too short."
4.0,"I love it so far, the fit is perfect on my legs (I have some thick legs lol) but the waist isnt as tight as I'd like but the extra waist band gets the shape I want.<br />I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting the one with the adjustable buckle between the waist and thigh trainers if you have a curvier body type so you can adjust to avoid muffin topping lol<br />My only forseeable complaint would be the wear and tear on the velcro straps, I've worn mine over ten times, and while it's still in perfect shape, the velcro is pretty tough on the belt material so I don't see it lasting if used daily."
4.0,Really cute but runs small.<br />Ordering a size or 2 up would be ideal for kids growing feet.
4.0,I am very happy with this outfit!
4.0,This product came quickly and was exactly as advertised. I with it had been shipped with my other items or the packaging was heavier since it easily would of blown away on a windy day.
4.0,"Very cute and comfy. True to size. Just a little lighter than the picture, not worth the money."
4.0,"Damn good product for what you pay for. Needs a bit of airing out once you get it out of the bag, because it smells like chemicals and what not (but nothing obnoxious, unless you're some over-concerned soccer mom.) Worth every penny!"
4.0,"This shirt fit well, maybe a bit tight, but had plenty of stretch in it. I am 5'8"" and found the sleeves almost 2"" too short. The color is nice so I am keeping it and will just push the sleeves up to 3/4 length in order to wear this comfortably."
4.0,These socks can per purchased in one pair packs or multi-pair packs. The socks are thicker than normal socks. They don't slip down to your heels like others. They are breathable and moisture wicking. They have seamless toes to prevent blisters.
4.0,"This will be a nice addition to a Harlem Renaissance holiday party I am attending. They run a little loose, but I guess that is to be expected with a &#34;one size&#34; item."
4.0,"Cute, simple, great everyday necklace. Had a tiny blemish scratch on the outer/upper edge of the pendant upon arrival, but its hardly noticeable."
4.0,"Quality fabric, stretchy,nice neck line but runs small."
4.0,The leggings are super comfortable and very soft. Fabric is lush. They will be a nice warm layer for Fall. Probably could wear underneath pants for Winter. The pattern is pretty and appear made well. They fit me great. I'm 5'2&#34; and 117 pounds. I have long legs for a short girl so they aren't too long if you're petite height. They are listed as one-size fits all. Probably not for above size 12. The color is more navy blue; I thought they were black. They do look black in photos.
4.0,"Hard to get around heel, but feels great while wearing them."
4.0,"Love it!  Only isssue I have is the sweatshirt doesn’t hang down, but crawls up as my son wears it.  After a bit, the bottom hem is riding above the top of his pants and he has to keep pulling it down."
4.0,Nice lil piece.... just depends on how long its last
4.0,"The cut and color of the top (burgundy) are quite nice.  I found the XL a little snug in the shoulders and chest.  I normally wear L/XL.  The drape of the neckline and hem are perfect and hit about mid-thigh.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the snugness up top.  If you are not a busty lady (I am a 40DD), this top will fit you beautifully!"
4.0,"So look, these are inexpensive dress socks. So you're not going to get superior durability and construction. Rather, they're pretty well made, with decent stitching and pretty good comfort. I had no problems with getting the toe to line up with my feet or shoes, and they stayed up well. Comfort-wise they are average. My recommendation is to go with whether you like the pattern or not - for the price, these are a fine buy but do not distinguish themselves from the cheap Chinese-made competition."
4.0,"I actually like these because I bought them to sleep in.  They are very thin, breathable fabric and have no real support.  Exactly what I wanted.  If you want any support at all, these are not for you."
4.0,Good! !!
4.0,A little big around the waist but nothing a belt can't fix
4.0,Bought my husband 34 and they fit my 31 son.
4.0,"I order Medium but it is somewhat large,"
4.0,Nice price. Fit as expected.
4.0,Pedir una talla menos de la que uses ya que son grandes pero del resto muy cómodas
4.0,They are cute but run on the big size in a 9 and they ate loose.
4.0,A must for a Clemente fan
4.0,"I love the dress. It hangs at the perfect length. It covers my ankles but doesn't drag. The fabric is amazingly soft and breathable. I bought this for a renaissance costume but I wear it all the time. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because the color isn't as it was shown. I ordered this dress in red, but when it arrived, or was actually terra cotta. I don't know whether they sent the wrong color,  or if the red is off in the picture but the terra cotta is still gorgeous."
4.0,I like the bracelet and hopefully so will my daughter.
4.0,"Haven't worn or washed this yet but so far I like it. Elastic band feels very tight at first but it stretches just have to give it a good tug. The details at the bottom didn't have the extra material fully punched out so I have to go around the edge and pull them out but it isn't that big of a hassle and doesn't seem like any are torn as of now. I was worried about it being too short but it is the perfect length the cut outs begin at the very end of my butt though so keep that in mind, but it doesn't look like you can see anything through the tiny holes."
4.0,This is the craziest bra ever!<br />I love it because it's super snug and really comfortable but the boob cups are formed... as in ridged. The 'point' part.... because they are not truly round.. is like maybe 4-6 inches apart. So either I have boobs that are further apart than normal or... that's kinda weird BUT I love it! I wear it all the time and barely feel like I have a bra on.<br />The odd shape of the cups is only noticeable if you grab them... so as long as you don't have people walking around grabbing your boobs then no one would even know they are kind of strangely shaped.<br />I am a 32C and ordered a small
4.0,"A little bit expensive, but great quality."
4.0,"A little thin, flimsy. My son got it for Fanboy Expo Knoxville. He was happy with it. Good for someone who doesn't go to a lot of comic cons. ""Metal pieces"" are thin and hard to shape but we used hairspray and pinned the pieces around 2 liter bottles, this helped to shaped them to his legs. The helmet is what really sold the outfit. We bought it from Amazon but you can't find it anymore."
4.0,"I bought these primarily for a show--the large pair (they don't look large in the picture because the image was reduced to make them fit the same space as the other three pairs, which vary from each other in size, too) have stylized male and female faces of two different shapes--which I like a lot--and were distinctive and showy enough for my purposes. The colors of the rhinestones don't look quite the same in person, but they're fine.  The only thing I don't really like about the set is that both earrings in two of the four pairs face the same way, instead of opposite ways.  This isn't a big deal and it clearly shows in the picture, so I knew what I was getting.  It was also important to me that they were nickel-free and to get them quickly, which I did.  The description is a little off in calling them ""dangle stud earrings""--three are dangles, one of which has fishhooks vs. the posts on the others, and one pair is not dangle.  But that is perfectly clear in the picture."
4.0,Pros: Great looking and feeling belt. Nice and thick<br /><br />Cons: Only issues is that the leather around the fabric is so thick that it makes it tough to take the belt off. The leather portion ends up getting stuck on the belt loops.<br /><br />Follow up: After a few weeks of use i have noticed that it has broken in and catches on the belt loops less.
4.0,"I love these. I wish they were a touch wider in the forefoot, but length-wise, they fit perfectly. They are super comfortable. I wish I had them in other colors."
4.0,These are very nice - I just need to figure out how to make the work for me.
4.0,The bracelet is great but the strap holders aren’t tight enough so they move and the strap flaps.
4.0,These are Exactly what I wanted. These are Laz-Around House Shoes and Nothing more. Not Fancy At All but do the Job. Soon as I wear these out(soon) I'll order again.
4.0,I've never had a watch like this before.  I don't usually like leather-type bands but this one is unique!  And the face of this watch is really different!  I really like it.
4.0,i liked the clutch very much.
4.0,"The top hook is a little hard to hook in the back and the bandsize is a bit snug, but nothing extreme. I just wish I had known that it was handwash only. I wash all my others on delicate and hang to dry."
4.0,"I would have given 5 stars, but I went by the size chart and ordered a large.  Choose one size smaller, these run big everywhere!  I should have exchanged, I’m just going to take them in myself.<br />They are great shorts, lightweight, durable, and quick drying!"
4.0,"Purchased multiple colors, love them all"
4.0,"Cute dress, I did get it altered a bit in the back area was too large."
4.0,"This is far and away the best running bottle I've found. Great balance of size and portability, and easy enough to carry. Note that the pouch definitely does fit an iPhone 11 (and therefore iPhone XR) with 3 credit cards in a wallet case. The pouch on this is actually slightly bigger than the one on the last iteration of the FastDraw 600. The nozzle is also new and improved. The old one would stop closing automatically after a few months of use, so I had to remember to push it back down after each squirt. Not so with the new version.<br /><br />I'm docking one star because, as other reviewers have long pointed out, it is frustratingly easy to cause the lid to leak. As far as I can tell, this results from cross-threading the lid, the tiny rubber gasket inside the lid slipping out, and/or catching the edge of the pouch/hand-strap in the threats when screwing the lid on. These are all totally avoidable, but you definitely do have to pay attention and be deliberate each time you close the bottle."
4.0,Came crushed in a bag with other items in the box. Was able to get in shape easily.  The brim was not affected.  Should last a few months by wearing it twice weekly.
4.0,It looks great except for a couple sticky spots I've been trying to get off.
4.0,Great fit on my wrist
4.0,"You get what you pay for, this thing is cute and I love wearing it, but if it flips over to the back, it definitely looks cheap"
4.0,"It came packaged in a clear & white bag inside of a white Amazon envelope.<br />I love crosses & anchors so I LOVE this necklace because it has both + a heart 💙 as well. I gave it four stars because the chain is flimsy, and could be thicker. You can’t wear this chain in water, or it will turn, so I put the pendant on a sterling silver chain."
4.0,Everyday shorts.
4.0,This is an excellent item my wife loved it. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the height.  Most of her necklaces are to long... besides that product is excellent.
4.0,I thought it was a great match for my son to wear on Halloween. Everyone liked and and he did too. I was disappointed the cost of the costume went up 10.00 before i could purchase it. Shipped very fast.
4.0,The suit was a little big in the leg openings.
4.0,"Good socks for the price. ""Midweight"" in reality is very thick for ski socks, so you may have to adjust your boots. Very warm, too.<br /><br />As far as order fulfillment, I bought the pink ones and they sent gray. Looks like pink is sold out now and to assume I would be satisfied was a gamble on their part. I would not have bought the gray ones, but it is what it is."
4.0,"My four year old daughter absolutely loves this dress and wants to wear it every day. It fits true to size, she is in 4t/5t and that’s the size we got and it fits perfectly. The top has pilled up a bit after a couple wears, but we bought it for play/dress up, and as long as the kiddo still loves it the pilling is nbd. It is soft and comfortable and a bit stretchy, with no itchy seams or scratchy sequins. Would be a beautiful dress for a party or photo shoot."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful! I would give it 5 stars except the first dress I ordered was incorrectly sewn in the front. I am usually a size 8, 5'4, and a D in the bust. The medium was very form fitting and i was worried that since it is a cheaper type dress it would shrink a little. I then ordered it in a large, which gives a little more room without being too large."
4.0,"It’s pretty nice, I expected to be a little more extructured"
4.0,"I like tank tops with a little support/spandex in them when I go to sleep at night, and was interested in this one since the description said that it has a 'shelf bra for great support and coverage'. Uhm... as far as I can tell, no (shelf bra to me is either cups or separate fabric to help support the breasts, and there's nothing like that here). It's a basic tank top (with a slight v in the front) with spandex so it does provide the support, not cut too low, straps don't adjust but it does stay in place. We're not talking natural fabric here, but it's fine for sleeping in since it 'hugs' and, as stated, does provide some support because of the spandex holding things in place without being too constrictive. So I'm happy with it even if it could be a little softer.<br /><br />It's not something I'd wear without a bra beneath it (it doesn't provide THAT much support, but then I'm 34DD), but it's fine for how I'm using it."
4.0,"I knew to buy a size up, so it fit just right. Wings (or cobweb) is light material but the dress itself is on the heavier side. Used it for Halloween and it was warm enough."
4.0,I've got a big head and felt like I could only keep it on for a minute or two before I started to run out of oxygen.  Looks hilarious though.
4.0,One of the ears won't work. It goes up but will not come back down on its own. Granddaughter was disappointed
4.0,These shoes were great for the money! Wore them for an entire night walking around Las Vegas without any pain! Would totally recommend.
4.0,"Lovely , it runs a little small. But a great dress"
4.0,I love the tshirt but it doesn't run true to size.  Buy bigger.
4.0,I really like the fit and quality of the shirt.  The shirt design is unique and definitely stands out in a good way. The only con is the collar is pretty large and I would order a size up.
4.0,"I love this crop top it fits super well, very flattering. But the only thing is that I wore it one and there's a hole on the side, near my waist. So that kinda sucks. Otherwise it's cute and fits true to size."
4.0,"This is a cute tank.  It fits a little larger than expected, but I like that it's loose-fitting.  The bottom is pretty &#34;flowy&#34; so it doesn't lay flat under a longer sweater, but it's still cute for the price."
4.0,"It is a nice hat, well made, and very nice looking color. I am wearing it because I would have to pay for return. I will give it to away when the right head comes along"
4.0,"The fit was perfect, I got a small and typically wear size 3 in pants. After using it for my yoga class, I hand washed it to get the sweaty smell out. During the wash some of the brown dye came out. Not complaining, just fair warning. Would buy again."
4.0,"Looks decent. Cheap, functional, works."
4.0,It's very lightweight and efficient. I ordered from Amazon LLC and the watch arrived quickly. The light on the watch isn't very effective but it's not enough to complain about considering the price.
4.0,I usually wear a large in everything.  It's too tight on my chest 34D. I'm returning it for an XL then I think it will be great!
4.0,"Perfect exactly as expected, very comfortable with the article."
4.0,Socks are too thin and flimsy
4.0,"A bit longer in length than I had expected but in all fairness I am only 5'3 and don't have a very long torso!  It comes to about 3 inches above my knees.  I love the material and color though!  It is a stretch material but it hangs great and does not cling to me the way some other dresses do (I am a size 10/12 and I don't like my clothes to cling to my stomach and hips).  I paired this dress with a wide black belt and it looks fantastic!  The neckline is low, but nothing obscene."
4.0,"Costume looked cool,  but I was too hot in it after just a few minutes.<br />Ended up wearing an inflatable costume that did not cover my whole head like this one did.<br /><br />On a positive note I tied off the bottom and tied the arms to the saucer controls.  Mounted it atop the golf cart and drove around with it on top!<br />Next time I think I'll throw some lights inside it too :)"
4.0,Pleased with this - the graduate loved it.
4.0,"This is a pretty cool robe.  It drapes but fits me as I expected (6 ft tall, 220).  It hangs to just above my toes so it does a decent job covering my feet while not dragging on the ground.<br /><br />Quality wise it's well constructed.  Not any noticeable fraying, good weight to the fabric.  The hood is somewhat see-through--I assume purposefully--which is good because when the hood is up it covers your eyes but you can still see and interact."
4.0,Latch isn't weak.
4.0,"When worn, the underwear keeps its shape without folding over due to momma muffin top. They’re a 5/5 comfort level; I enjoy the slimming fit. No unnecessary wedgies with normal movements. They go on easy and feel perfectly contoured, but not tight.<br /><br />I ordered LARGE and they’re true to size. Large corresponds to 12-14 Women’s Panty Size.<br /><br />I would never wear these without protection during menstruation. The crotch area is not as thick as I expected. They would confer some protection for mild sweating but for profuse crotch perspiration (during workouts, for example), I don’t think they’d prevent 100% sweat through."
4.0,She is very pleased with them and has taken them into use.  Have not heard other than she is happy to have received this 'care package' from the US.
4.0,Just love the look of this watch. Great buy at a great price. Been getting so many compliments when I wear it. Everyone thinks it is so posh!
4.0,"I ordered this dress on flash sale and I like it pretty well. My favorite aspect is probably the pockets! The slits make it nice and breezy. I do like the floral design; I chose it because it makes me think of fall time :). However the yellow is more orange/Cheeto-y than pictured, and that’s why I gave it 4 stars. I am 5’3, 133 lbs, and I ordered a small. It grazes the floor when I am barefoot, and the slits come up to just below my knee. But not bad at all for $11! I would consider buying from them again, probably in a solid color."
4.0,Button fell off as soon as I opened the package.  Nice blouse. That would no stop me from buying it again.
4.0,Fits true to size. Very cute on!
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 41&#34; waist and hips, 185 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly. My friend who is about 5'6&#34; and 240 lbs borrowed them and they fit her well too. I bought these to wear under a dress and haven't tried working out in them yet. Only con is that they rolled down just a little bit in the waist. Other than that, perfect for under a dress to prevent chub rub :)"
4.0,"comes a little large, size down!"
4.0,"I had a bilateral mastectomy years ago. No implant reconstruction. Finding a bra that holds tissuewhere I need it held is a challenge. This was almost perfect. It’s cute & affordable. If you have prosthetic inserts, they won’t fit in this bra. This bra requires I use alternative “boob pillows”. I don’t mind. Prosthetics every day is too much! Ugh."
4.0,Craftsmanship is good.  Looks nice.  A little overpriced.
4.0,"2nd time I've purchased these. I bought a pair over a year ago (actually two pair and gave one away that had the deep black lenses, I prefer the lighter purple tinted pair). I finally broke my first pair while in Italy (lots of stone roads took their toll after the glasses kept falling off the top of my head from a lot of looking up/laughing :-)) but thank goodness they are still available and for the same great price. Will continue to purchases these if needed again and available."
4.0,"I read some reviews prior and purchased a size larger than what my daughter needed.  Our 2 year old daughter loves these slippers, they feel very soft.  The snowflake designs on top are hard plastic , the grippers on the bottom could be made of a stickier rubber."
4.0,"I love this at certain angles and then hate it at others. I ordered the xs, I'm 5'7&#34;, 135, 34b. It's very billowy and I'm not sure if people will wonder if I'm trying to hide a baby belly - which I'm not. The material is not cotton, more polyester and no stretch."
4.0,So far so good strong and durable only been using a week so we will see
4.0,Buy this two sizes larger than what you wear. It SHRINKS!!!!
4.0,Only thing I wish it had was button covers so maybe they'd be easier to push
4.0,"I like them...wish they have better colors, but for what I paid perfect for my daughter bowling..EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"
4.0,Very cute but the back has see through lace.
4.0,I really like this item. It fits a little bigger than I expected but I could still make it work. My guy likes it as well!!
4.0,"Really stylish, looks very pretty and does make a statement, considering it's inexpensive fashion jewelry... it does tend to tangle up."
4.0,soft material . great to wear under anything
4.0,This dress fits well but the color I ordered does not match the photo on this item. Mine showed up as a yellow-ish white looking fabric and to me that color is slightly awkward. I would’ve much preferred a beige color as pictured. Nonetheless the dress fit nicely and hugs my curves in the right places. I recommend a different color than the one I Ordered
4.0,I should have sized down these gap at waist on me. I am usually small/medium size 6/8. Still good for my run/workout.
4.0,"I bought this to be used as a hand fidget.  I have it clipped to the inside of my purse and whenever my hands need something to done, I can just fiddle with this.  The leather feels soft too."
4.0,"Love this tank. I'm a B cup and wanted something to wear under sheer work blouses.  The built-in cups are great to give shape and hide high beams, not super supportive though. I could see this being uncomfortable for a C or D cup.  Silky soft material and long enough to cover my super long torso. Took one star off since you can clearly see the cups through the white tank (and therefore can't wear it alone). Maybe the darker colors wouldn't have this problem."
4.0,It is practical but does not leave a indication of what actual pressure that you are working at.
4.0,"This dress is true to size. The fabric/print is pretty, though thin. I am 5’7, 150lbs and a 36D postpartum. I am returning the dress because I was uncomfortable with the amount of cleavage it showed. Also, I hoped it would go to the knee, but it was just above the knee. Though the dress fit well, I didn’t find it flattering to my figure, as it accentuated the chest more than I would have liked."
4.0,Just the right size but then I have very slender wrists
4.0,Very sexy fit as expected
4.0,Good for price just odd fit
4.0,This was great for a cocktail event. It held my phone and a lipstick. It matched my shoes perfectly and it served its purpose. I was happy with the product besides the shedding of glitter. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small clutch for an event.
4.0,"I love this shirt, the length was perfect. I am 5' 4 and I weigh 140 lbs. I ordered a medium, the neck was too large and showed my undergarments. I layered with an undershirt and now I love to wear with leggings."
4.0,Gloves were a little big but still work
4.0,"Super cute, especially for the price. Used the size guide and it fits great. Minus one star because the leg holes are a little tighter than I'd like. I get tons of compliments on it, though. (I got the teal dot suit)"
4.0,"Runs small , be sure to size up"
4.0,Diameter is much smaller than I'm used to. But all in all a good product.
4.0,Love them! There was a tiny scratch on one of the lenses but isn't noticeable unless you are standing very close to my face.
4.0,They are extremely soft and they’ve help up really well. The color is exactly like I expected. My only problem is with the size. I read a lot of the reviews before I ordered so I thought getting my regular size would be fine (9) but I should have got the size smaller. I was torn between the two sizes because sometimes I can wear 8 1/2 but they didn’t offer half sizes and I didn’t wanna go too small because my feet are a little wide. They’re just a little too loose but I wear a pair of really thick fleece lined socks so that kinda helps. For the price I might just suck it up and order another pair in the other size anyway.
4.0,"Very pretty as pictured. Sheer material as expected. Sizing of this item has a wide range and it's a little long for a slim, 48 inch young lady, which would also be as expected.  I don't expect this item will outlast a lot of long term rough wear and tear but will do it's basic function of adding a small modicum of modesty with the flair of some pretty colors, which is all we were looking for."
4.0,"very comfortable.  I wear a size 10 and these fit a little small, but I can still wear them"
4.0,"Arrived with a hole by the tag, and a much lighter yellow than pictured. Normally I love Sarah's Silks, so I was a bit disappointed. I couldn't return it because the moment my kids saw it they were playing with it, and so excited about the hole. It probably won't last long, sadly."
4.0,"Fast delivery, good product.  thank you"
4.0,Arrived as stated everything was great.
4.0,"really cute!!! wasn't expecting it to be that good of quality, though the gem looks a lot bigger and shinier in the picture, it's kind of dull IRL. other than that, it is really cute and I would buy it again"
4.0,Good product just a little big
4.0,Pretty dress but tight in the bust.
4.0,I have used all of the suitcases to go on plane and back. they moved very nicely and no complaints. ill update if anything comes up
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter's 4th birthday along with a couple of dress up costumes.  These were the biggest hit.  When she talked to her Mamo on the phone, she talked about how she got ""up"" shoes as a present.  Somehow these girls just notice details like heels and whether princess dresses go to the floor.  She wears them more than I'd like - even though we restrict her to wearing them in the house.  I justify it by thinking it's better than her twisting her ankle on one of my pairs of heels - which is what she had been doing.<br /><br />For the other reviews - yes, I'd read them and knew I had a glue gun and was prepared to use it.  Good thing too - I was repairing two within the first week!  I have two more in the works, and it's still less than a month since I bought them.  However, it's not rocket science.  So if you have a glue gun, 5 min of time and a girly girl who would love some ""up"" shoes, I highly recommend.<br /><br />July 24th, 2014 update - we've had these for 9 months now.  My daughter still loves them and I am still making repairs.  One night the flower will come off the shoe, the next night the gem will come off the flower, the next night the flower will come off the stem!  I stand by the original review - if you have a hot glue gun, the repairs are so easy.  If you don't have one, invest in one because it'll be handy for repairing other cheaply made stuff you buy for your girl...  costume jewelry, costume crowns, etc."
4.0,"Decent, plain shirt for the money; note that having bought three in three different colors, they are each made of a different material.  Not a problem but odd.  Buy big.  Purchased XXL in order to (after washing) wear as an XL."
4.0,The dress is beautiful and luckily the fit must be slightly on the bigger side as I ordered a Large but received a Small. It will work for the event I got it for but it's going to be a little more snug than I was hoping.
4.0,I’m 5’1 128lbs 34b. Ordered a medium based off of reviews and it’s way too big.  I usually wear a small so I should have stayed true to my size.  It’s a great winter dress.
4.0,"I love this little dress. It's well made, light weight, cool, and very comfortable. I will be ordering others. Only reason it is not a 5 star, is the chemical smell. First washing it did not come out. We shall see about subsequent ones. (Wear a US xl and ordered 5xl. Fits perfectly)"
4.0,Nice and good quality.  Necklaces could be just a little longer.
4.0,material is somewhat thin.
4.0,The metal is a little flimsy but this is a cute little set.
4.0,"The original jacket I ordered was too small, but they replaced it with another jacket that fit wonderfully! It was a size 7XL, but in reality, it is US XL in size."
4.0,It's small but perfect I love it
4.0,Giving it a 4 because it is on the smaller size but is a very stylish blouse.
4.0,"I love how this top looked and the sizing was as expected. However, the material reminded me of a plain t-shirt. It wasn't thick enough for this type of top in my opinion."
4.0,"Very pretty, but thin fabric."
4.0,"I was so surprised how ""silky"" these pants felt. I didn't feel chafing when working out. I am a big & tall girl  so comfort and stretch and durability is important. These were perfect for the price... don't want to spend too much on stuff when I am going to have to replace it because of weight loss.  I am waiting to see how these feel after washing them a few times. I have had many that have broken down after a few months of washing. Have washed 2 times so far and seems to hold up well."
4.0,"It's a nice quality and pretty color, but the way the clasps is on the inside makes it so it always looks about an inch open. Not hard to see what cards I'm carrying. The clasp doesn't open that often given how easily things are able wedge between, but I don't like how it looks and feels to have a gap like that. Also, it's a pretty tight fit to get cash in and out of it - the tiniest bit longer would have been better.<br /><br />There is plenty of slot organization space and I like that the license slot is perpendicular and easy to access.<br /><br />Still a decent wallet, love the color, and feels durable. I think some people would not be bothered by the above. Personally I regret buying it, but will keep using it because it's still nicer than my cheap $20 wallets."
4.0,"These work just fine underneath thinner tights, however I wish the seam was not as visible."
4.0,This product was exactly as described. However it did not arrive when I needed it to. But I think that was the post office's fault.
4.0,"Nice & roomy, just like I need 'em. The black looks like ashy grey but roomy and chic looking enough to keep."
4.0,"I  didn't enjoy the color, of the sweater!"
4.0,"Great product,  multiple uses.."
4.0,A little see thru
4.0,Easy to put on. Stretches well . Light weight and works a a face and neck warmer.
4.0,"I love this seller and the earrings are pretty, but the omega backs aren't straight so they fit tighter than they should."
4.0,"I use this to play soccer during the fall and it keeps me relatively warm while playing but the collar fits kinda loose and sags, the bottom portion of the shirt also keeps moving up while I run but overall it's a comfortable shirt that does its job."
4.0,"Great quality! Held up well during travels. Smaller than I anticipated, but the bright blue color still catches your eye when searching for your luggage."
4.0,Arch very hard to use!!
4.0,"There's a crack in the center of the crystal, I know it's an imperfection, just would have liked one a little cleaner looking.  The clasp did break the second day I wore it, but I'm a guy and tend to be hard on things.  Otherwise, very pretty and very nice."
4.0,Fit a little bigger than same size at store...I would suggest getting 1 size smaller than you wear
4.0,"This product has such a charming sentiment.  It was a gift to a friend and the card it comes on says it all- it is a well thought out make you or someone else feel wanted, seen and loved. The pendant is classy looking however paired with the chain it makes it look cheap.  I recommend purchasing a gold chain and putting the pendant on it for a more classier less fake jewelry look.  Otherwise you loose the sentiment and a not so cheap gives looks like costume jewelry."
4.0,"Its cute, but not as cute as its presented on the pucture. It has a more rusty color to it and you have to tighten up the connecting little chains in the back before using it the fisrt time."
4.0,"They do not leak, I've used them a half dozen times and stayed dry. That's the biggest thing. I did not care for the belt-- it is hard to fiish thru the belt loops when getting in and out of them, so replaced it with a good web belt. They seem tough enough to shed a few briars and such, but  they might get a little hot in 90 degree weather  But I can usually wet wade then anyway. I'm fully satisfied with them for what my uses will be."
4.0,a little large in hip but love that they are stretchy jeans
4.0,"Love, love, love this top! It's very baggy and oh so comfy. It's perfect for over my swimsuit or just a big lounge top."
4.0,Bought the jacket as a semi formal compliment to a long summer skirt. The cut is slimming.
4.0,love the style wish they were darker tint
4.0,Just a little too big but my granddaughter loves it.
4.0,"The shirt is not fitted at all, definitely a unisex style. However, the material is soft yet durable. It runs true to size - I'm a 38C and bought an XL. It hangs loose and does not pull across the chest."
4.0,"Bought it as a gift and it's a little smaller than I thought, but still a good bag. My husband thought the inner liner that goes all the way through the bottom as a little weird."
4.0,They are very pretty but a little heavy. Definitely worth what they cost.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:c365db6b9e8606a3b6aa372c284eebe1]] It kinda loose maybe because it’s not xtra small but they didn’t have that nd I’m usually a xtra small but its still  pretty Nd I like the dress still
4.0,I love this dress but it is shorter than I expected it is more like a shirt than a dress. With that said it works great with leggings and boots.
4.0,"Good price and value, really like these glasses. Only bad thing is, when you order stronger there is nothing marked on the glasses to know what the magnification is!"
4.0,The ruffle stands up a little more than I would like but after washing it’s okay and sometime I just wear a cardigan over it to hide the ruffle
4.0,"Not a spectacular top but when you consider the price?  A super great deal.  Note, this top has a tiny rhinestone on the front, just below the neckline.  Weird.  But it's comfy and it was cheap."
4.0,Only issue was it rides up a bit after washing
4.0,"The Black-Red Wizard Robe Costume by Artemisia is much better quality than a normal costume piece, but leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The Black-Red Wizard Robe looks great and drapes well.<br />It's length is just about perfect for my 6 foot frame.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The seams between the black crushed velvet and ruby red satin are sewn very inconsistently. In some spots the two materials are not even sewn together.<br />The velvet is a little thin and the lining will show through in brighter rooms."
4.0,Its seems a bit smaller on the photos but it a really good size. The only bad thind I nothice is the leather its feels a bit cheep. But in general terms is really good.
4.0,Little tighter than I 'd like but still a top I'll wear and enjoy
4.0,I like how the top is made from a different material.  It stretches which work bc I have large breast!
4.0,A little disappointed that the stitching on the middle seam is loose. Trimmed a few loose threads.  Hope it lasts.
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, but the matching necklace with 2 leaves, one of 2 wouldn't lie flat. I contacted the seller who asked for photos which I took but have never been able to attach a photo. Could the seller have a cell phone # to send the photos that way, I hope?"
4.0,"This is a nicely made mini leather travel wallet which I am actually using to organize some of my excess museum membership cards,  passport card, nursing license card, CPR card  and credit cards that I don't use very often.  Its really small so for me its a backup card case.  I may also use it for a travel wallet when I want to go really minimalist."
4.0,"As advertised, looks nice. Chain is very thin which is what she wanted. Will see how it holds up."
4.0,I wore these shoes out today and Can honestly say it is not bad. It is not really for prolonged use but overall does the job and looks really cute.
4.0,I bought these for myself because I saw Khloe Kardashian wearing them on TV :-) I really like them!! I want to try a different color though!
4.0,"Comfortable inserts and great arch and heel support. Runs a bit large imo…usually wear a 5 or 6 in women’s depending on brand. Went with smallest option (6), but could of easily worn a 5. For an inside house shoe/lounge shoe, not a big enough issue to return."
4.0,It is just ok!
4.0,Beautiful earrings… Just smaller than I thought it would be. They have stayed in perfectly though. They would actually be perfect for a young girl because they aren’t too big.
4.0,"Bought these boots on sale, not for USAF or military use, just daily wear.  I bought them because if all the extremely positive reviews and constant comments about how these fit like a sneaker. Hot weather military boots I wear a 7.5W, insulated or gortex boots, 8W; these fit like my other commercial boots, 8W. I wear custom script orthotics. These boots are hard to break in if you need a thicker insole or use orthotics.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lightweight<br />Very good grip on all surfaces<br />Laces make the fit very secure and comfortable<br />Flexible and does fit like a sneaker<br />Strap on the back helps a lot to get them on<br />True to size<br /><br />Cons:<br />Factory insoles are a joke (too thin, no arch support, no cushion)<br />LOW VOLUME (wish I knew that before I purchased)<br />Custom Orthotics aren’t very compatible<br />Aftermarket thicker insoles aren’t compatible<br />Required a long break in to fit with orthotics<br /><br />So, yes they are good boots, very comfortable, but if you have high volume feet or wear orthotics, prepare for a hell of a break in period. Even with aftermarket insoles that were thicker there wasn’t enough room for my feet. I’m on week 2, and they finally are fitting well and the hot spots are gone. What I had to do was as follows:<br /><br />Put orthotics in the boots, stuffed the toe box with paper as hard as I could, and left them for 4 days to stretch. After 4 days I could fit my feet in them, but I had hot spots where the ball bearing eyelet is and over the top of the toe box on the outside lowest eyelet both sides. I then wore them for a couple hours and when I took them off they were a little better. Have been wearing them almost every day now and 2 weeks later, they finally fit really well."
4.0,"There's not too much that one can say about this product, it's a wallet insert. It does appear to be well made, only time will tell how sturdy it is. The pages are a little bit larger than the ones that came with my wallet so it is much easier to remove and replace credit cards, driver's license, etc."
4.0,This was a gift and seems to fit well.
4.0,Mine actually came with the belt loop broken but it was cute and I needed to wear it to a party. Great fit and length for a curvy girl!
4.0,"Great googles, wish they had foam to comfort your face, but honestly no fogging issues at all"
4.0,"Very cute swimsuit.  It covered my mom ouch well and gave my boobs an extra lift.  I like that it is sort of a push up built in.  I gave it 4 stars because it gave me an odd shape vs the hourglass I was hoping for.  I have more of an athletic build so I'm not totally blaming that on the swimsuit, but I have found others that fit better.  For reference I'm 5'2"" and 135.  I bought a medium.  I feel I might could have gone with a large but the medium did fit."
4.0,The non-painted sections are highly reflective and not satin like in the pics. When the shield arrived it was coated in oil in plastic bag. Had to spend at least a good hour buffing the oil marks off of the shield. Overall it made of a sturdy metal and a great addition to my Marvel collection.
4.0,I will return it for bigger size.  I thought it was long but was short a bit.  I need a bigger size.
4.0,They were amazing while they lasted. I got tons of compliments. But they only lasted about three uses before the back broke off of one.<br /><br />Update: The seller replaced these for me and I'm so super excited because I loved them so much! A+ for customer service. I have only gotten to wear them once since the replacement got here. If I wear them some more and they hold up I will be raising my review another star because I think they are that cute.
4.0,"It is such a beautiful ring, it is good for gift.<br />It does look gorgeous, and fits well on my mom's finger.<br />Price is affordable, yet quality is good. Color of this ring is<br />just like the picture, and came in safe package. Lovely..!"
4.0,I was a little disappointed but it fit okay and with jeans to go 🛒....
4.0,Fabric is OK It feels just a little stiffer than most Coolmax. . Breathable. Wicks OK.
4.0,"I collect watches, so I have avoided Luminox watches for years because I always they were gaudy. This Sport Timer ticked all of the boxes I was looking for. My goal was to find a black and white automatic watch, with day date function and luminous hands to wear at work.  Something that if damaged, would not cause me too much grief if I damaged it, unlike a Tudor or Breitling. To my surprise, I wear this watch a lot. I have a 7 1/2 wrist, so the strap accommodates it nicely. The face glows very well in the dark, lasting thru the night. If you want a Rolex Submariner-styled watch that you can ding around at work, this is a good option."
4.0,This I should have ordered in a smaller size but it the photo seems pretty accurate for the most part. I really really wish the pink part had a button but I will add one myself but it is very flattering and classy yet girly.
4.0,Fit great and was very flattering.
4.0,Fit very nice in my gascans.. Good replacement lense seems to be of similar quality to the oem polarized lenses. Seems to be a tiny bit lighter of a tint but works just as well. They had me sold when they said made in USA anyways.....
4.0,Shoes camo design faded quickly but I do work in a machine shop so I don't if the different kinds of fluids that get on my shoes had anything to do with that. But very comfortable.
4.0,I got this mask and i was real satisfied with this product even though it felt smaller like a child size mask.
4.0,Top is super cute. I like the bottoms but they weren't near as high waistef as the picture shows. Stops just under my belly button.
4.0,Necklace arrived quickly and was nicely packaged
4.0,"The dress itself is adorable, unfortunately it was way too short when I put it on."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, but not the best look for women with a large chest. Because it comes up so high on the neck it makes my breasts look 2x larger (I'm already a 32DDD). It would be so much prettier with a lower neckline. Other than that, it is a nice material and pretty colors."
4.0,"Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a wedding. She’s 5’5” about 130lbs. It is very pretty (she received many compliments) and fit as expected, however; the top is low cut and the quality matched the price- i.e. the materiel was a little on the low-end side and the stitching at the top of the side split was coming undone. Luckily, my mom knows how to sew and fixed it in a matter of minutes. Overall, satisfied with purchase."
4.0,Great lightweight rain jacket but sizes run a bit small.  It fits okay but if you like your rain wear loose you may want to order a size larger.
4.0,It's very pretty but a little big and heavy.
4.0,I liked the looks and warmth of the socks.  I always get cold feet at night.  I love the style.<br /><br />The feel of them is cushy and comfortable but they do cause my feet to itch more.
4.0,"The quality of this underwear is good, material stretches out and is comfy. Be aware size is way too small. I am regularly a M sometimes L, and this time I got XL which barely fits me. I had to return the items 2 times (at no cost) until I got the right size, but in the meantime I waited longer than expected."
4.0,The fabric on this shirt is really soft and feels very nice against skin but the fit is way baggy with sleeves that are a good 3-4 inches too long. I’m average size wearing a size 14-16 xl in most clothing. This shirt may have fit me nicer if I’d have sized down. I gifted it to my niece so I won’t be ordering it in a smaller size. For reference I’m 5’7 and 200 pounds but Im proportionate 42/36/38
4.0,Toddler size
4.0,Love these shoes! I had heard this style runs small so i purchased a size up an that worked out perfectly!
4.0,Nice shirt. I was expecting it to fit like a maternity shirt so I ordered a size small. It’s a fitted T-shirt so it was tight on me. Still nice shirt and I still wore it because I got it the day before Thanksgiving and that’s what I ordered it for. So order what you wear in normal shirts not maternity
4.0,"This is not a maxi dress! I got mine and it is adorable. But it came just below my knees. I am 5&#34;7 and I ordered a medium, navy with polka dots. I ended up just tying it in a know in the front and it looks cute still."
4.0,It’s cute but pretty big. I should have ordered a small but not sure if it’s worth trying to swap out the sizes or not. The material feels like a cheap Halloween costume but for the price it’s pretty cute.
4.0,Great sandals fit great very comfortable. And simple to adjust.
4.0,"They came with no instructions at all. I tried to use just the needle threader it came with but that didn't work because it was double thickness elastic. I guess you are supposed to attach them prior to sewing the elastic into the mask?  It took some experiments to figure out the best way to attach the slide.  They stretch easily over 1/4"" elastic and they are comfortable providing you don’t get your elastic too small when you make the mask."
4.0,"this was a pretty well made dress. I will say the slit went VERY high, like it if opened you could see my underwear, but I didn't see that as a big deal because a slip can easily be sewn up, so id rather have to too high than not enough. also for me, the little see through areas on the top, while super cute, made it hard for me to put a sticky bra or anything on with it, without it being seen, and I decided the side holes were a little too close to the center for me and what I felt comfortable with. a bigger size may have helped this issue, but the waist on this fit me well and I didn't want that too big. but other than that, I really liked the dress and recommend it."
4.0,Ordered this to dress up black dress pants & a blouse. Looked very pretty.
4.0,had to thin the toe thong down --- then good
4.0,"It's fine, I just didn't end up really liking the style, so I will be returning. Lots of compartments and pretty roomy inside. Seems like a pretty standard duffel bag quality construction."
4.0,"Good masks, but to big for 6 years old child"
4.0,"I love the super bright color and the breathable mesh. There could be a little more structure to these bags, I don't think the items inside will stay neat unless I really pack the bags full. This set definitely comes with a lot! Two shoe bags, two intimates bags, and 4 &#34;cubes.&#34; The zippers and stitching seem very well made, and I expect these bags to last quite awhile. I love the idea of separating the items in my suitcase to make finding things so much easier. If my opinion of these bags changes I will update this review.<br /><br />I rely heavily on reviews when making my purchases, so I strive to make my reviews as helpful as I can. If you found this helpful please click the button below. Thanks!"
4.0,"Good product for the cost, simple easy to use"
4.0,"If you're broad shouldered or have a larger set of breasts, I'd suggest going a size up. It fits me (short and curvy) but it's a little snug at the shoulders. But super cute. Definitely need a jacket if you're going out to NYE or a holiday party. It's pretty thin, but good quality material."
4.0,"Really pretty, super light reflective and colorful. The chain has never oxidized or changed color on me, but one of the little hooks did unbend once, its easy to bend it back into place though."
4.0,"Wool is the best natural fiber for activewear.  Let's give these wool socks by Merino.tech a try.<br /><br />What's good:<br />Crew/mid-calf wool socks for a wide variety of uses.  I'd use them for hiking, snowboarding, skiing, sledding, etc.<br />Decent quality merino wool and fabrication.<br />Wool fiber is superior to polyester/polypropylene/synthetic fibers in terms of warmth, breathability, less odor retention, and repelling water.<br />Fits true to size: L (9-12) fits my size 8 feet almost perfectly, with slight room to spare in the heels.  That's alright because even processed merino wool will shrink slightly after washing.<br />Easy care: hand/machine wash, line dry.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />Wool socks cost more, are less durable than synthetic fibers, takes longer to dry, and are vulnerable to moths if not washed after use.<br />Socks have medium thickness and are not suitable for temperatures lower than 40°F.<br />$29.99 (Mar. 21, 2023) for one pair of wool socks is too high.  Competitors sell 2 or 3 pairs for approx. that price."
4.0,Lurve there’s but they are not ideal for like actually blocking the sun and the ends are a little blunt but other than that they are cute as hell. You know why your buying them. It’s not rly for the UVA/UVB protection.
4.0,"I am going to give this 4 stars because of the price, however they feel pretty flimsy. I but they fit well, look good and aren't too dark. Just be careful with them. For the price, they are great!"
4.0,"Love the dress, fits nicely on top but lower half is a bit larger and more flowy than expected. Also, length is very long and requires hemming (I'm 5' 7&#34;) fabric is on the heavier side too. All around, a nice dress!"
4.0,"Very cute, I just hope they dont break, they are plastic."
4.0,"My girl is 5'11"" and it looked great on her."
4.0,This is a beautiful blouse. It does run small. I had to return it and I’m saddened that they don’t offer 3x which would have been perfect.
4.0,I liked the assortment of colors but the clasp should be bigger
4.0,"They pass the squat test, super cute and comfortable. They don't have a lot of compression and are a mid rise waist. Over all for the price they're good."
4.0,I love these but I should have gotten a medium.  I wear a 10 and got a large .... super comfortable ! I would purchase again !
4.0,Well worth for the price....delivery time great
4.0,I like them alot but they are a bit small-- they are suede so they will stretch. Got here fast and correctly!
4.0,"I mis-measured, but it's still beautiful. It's hard to find actual denim anymore, and this is it."
4.0,They keep their shape and are very comfortable
4.0,Just a little tight on arms
4.0,I overall like the glasses however they were very small despite being adult size
4.0,A little smaller than pictured but still really cute. When it arrived it was a little bent but easily fixed and remained so. Really good quality and really cute even for everyday wear. Love it
4.0,"This item fit well.  Not as loose as in the picture. I was expecting it to be more of a cotton like material, but over all it is very flattering and a good purchase.  I am happy that I purchased this item!<br /><br />This item was purchased at a discounted rate for a fair an unbiased review."
4.0,"This phone cover is cute! Only thing that is disappointing is that the sides don't come all the way up and over the edge of my phone. That will be unfortunate if I drop it. The design on the back is etched on I think so it's impossible to peel off, which is nice."
4.0,"It's a nice coat, but the sizing is very small. I usually wear a small, and the coat fit, but it was very tight so I would not have been able to wear a sweater under it. I bought it for very cold days and needed to have room to layer underneath. I would recommend going a size up (but it is also very long)."
4.0,These high waisted fleece leggings are just the ticket for cold winters. I wear skirts and boots almost every day and the different colors although subtle keep my wardrobe from getting to predictable.  I ordered two sizes larger because I can't stand the muffin top I get from a too tight thin waist band.  I honestly look slimmer in the larger size. Gotta like that!
4.0,Fast shipping. Good quality
4.0,The filter is great very breathable just tight
4.0,"The scrunchie part it a bit loose, but they're cute and of good quality."
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars if it was real leather, but it seems nice and a bargain with lots of zippers and pockets. Nice lining also. But white, it is not. It is the color of the photo. More of an ivory color. I will do nicely,  I believe."
4.0,Comfortable shirt and can be used in an office setting or causal night out .
4.0,Good looking shirt. Just a little smaller than expected.
4.0,"The blazer looks as if it was tailored to me, nice fit!"
4.0,Daughter very happy
4.0,"Definitely worth the money. Some shapes have small extra pieces of plastic, but other than that this product is great."
4.0,The bottoms fit like weird and kinda look like a diaper. But the top is really cute and fits perfect.
4.0,Waist is high
4.0,good value for the buck
4.0,Material a little too thin but it'll work. i like it
4.0,"This chain arrived suitably packaged.  It's a simple design, no frills, but it is good looking.  Not quite as lustrous as I'd prefer... it's a little bit dull (not as shiny as I expected).  That being said, it's a good looking, delicate chain of good quality at a reasonable price."
4.0,It's cute. I will probably air dry it as the material seems as it might nap up in the dryer. Order 2 sizes up. I'm 36A. 5'4...145 lbs..normal medium... bought an XL..fits nice.
4.0,They fit very well and looks nice. I love the little pop of colors.
4.0,This is just a simple case but well built.  Good protection for my phone.
4.0,Love it. Fblack will fade a little
4.0,This does make you sweat but I wish it had extra supports to train your waist better.  Good value for the money though.
4.0,"Shorts are too short for me. I prefer longer.Elastic waist band rolls, Great material, very soft.Very cute pajamas.However I wouldn’t recommend due to waistband."
4.0,Nice material. My teen likes the shirt.
4.0,"This skirt is pretty and the fit is flattering (for me). The material is a little strange and shiny, but not unattractive."
4.0,"The product is comfortable, but doesn't have much support.  The quality is good and is easy to wash."
4.0,Very very pretty but also very small.  The sides were cutting into my neck the whole time and it was very painful.
4.0,"Good  product, wish the straps were oriented horizontally in order to strap on backpack better"
4.0,"I really like this dress.  I first bought a small and it was too small so I bought a medium.  It fits but I think its the material. I am not curvy, kinda boxy. I think it would look better on someone with curves. It does cling to the body but does have some stretch. I'm 5'-4"", 130lbs."
4.0,"This product is amazing, it really working! I use it to wake up in time for work. I used to wake up late sometimes but as soon as I feel the zap it wakes up my mind knowing I have to get up so im not late."
4.0,"I just got this top and I honestly wasn't expecting much for the price.  It is a lot softer than it looks and the lace is very good quality to my surprise.  I am giving it 4 stars because I ordered an XS and it's still a little loose on me.  The lace has some stretch so I would have preferred a shirt a bit tighter (I am 5'1 and 110 pounds with a 34C bra size if that helps).  It fit nice around the bust but it was a little baggy around the waste/tummy area and in the arms.  It doesn't look bad but I am used to wearing tight shirt to show off my full chest and small waste and this didn't hug tight enough to extenuate the goods.  There are also no tags on it whatsoever so I have no idea what size it is or how to wash it or even if it's new.  Also this shirt is not for the tall (I don't think many products from this seller are).  The sleeves were barely long enough to cover my arms (and I have short arms).  There was also a small rip at the end of the left sleeve (this was no biggie because I loosely sewed the lace together so the rip didn't get bigger).  All in all, I am still happy with this purchase.  It is on trend with the lace and for a lot cheaper than you can find in stores."
4.0,This is a beautiful skirt. I wish it had fit. It was delivered as promised.
4.0,"Here is what I liked:<br />-Comfortable material that has just enough flow and stretch and does not cling. And it has pockets!<br />-Size xl fit perfect and I am a size 16/18 bottom heavy with a smaller top. 5ft 4in and about 220lbs.<br />-Perfect length (especially if you want something that will cover your knees).<br />-The charcoal is such a pretty color and I got complements on it all night. The stripes and bow make it just a little fun.<br />-Dressy enough for a wedding but also casual.<br /><br />Things I didn’t like or that could be better:<br />-the belt is very difficult to tie in a bow that stays up. I had to use pins to get it to stay.<br />-the top material is just a little sheer, but was ok with a white bra.<br />-the sleeves are kind of an odd length and shape since they’re fluttery.<br /><br />All of the different women at the wedding complemented my dress from the color to style. It made me feel good which is hard since rarely wear dresses. Side note: many of the women were teachers and said this would be a great dress for their classroom and wanted to order it in different colors, lol."
4.0,"I loved the shirt so much I ordered 6 more in various colors. Living in FL, I'll get use out of these practically all year round."
4.0,"clip needs to be looser on my sweaters, maybe if it had a little more stretchy or if there was a chain or something to give it a little more stretch."
4.0,This is a very nice shirt but is not made with a larger woman in mind.
4.0,"This purse is great for special occasions when you don't want to carry a lot of items. Unfortunately, I now have an iPhone XR and it's a tight squeeze, but the phone does fit. The material is soft, and it folds away nicely when not in use. Highly recommended. Plus, the soft grey color goes with just about anything."
4.0,Beautiful fabric is thick but front area does not fit right in my chest.
4.0,"The ability to store all cases within the smallest one is great for when you are not travelling.  There are many different ways to configure them in the suitcase.  My only concern is whether they are durable.  I have only used them once so it will take a few trips to see how durable they really are.  But overall, I'm very happy."
4.0,Fun to put on my JK Unlimited swaybar disconnects
4.0,"Adorable suit with great coverage, but runs about 1.5-2 sizes too small."
4.0,"I love this bag. It looks great! I was skeptical of it at first since it is really cheap but I've had it for almost 2 months now and it's held up better than I expected. The zippers seemed like they would break easily but they're all still fine. The only issue I've had is that the two little vent things in the shoe compartment have fallen out but I don't even notice them anyway (this is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars). The wet pocket is pretty small, I can't even imagine fitting anything other than maybe one shirt it in, so if you plan on using that for the purpose of keeping sweaty clothes separated then you may want a different bag."
4.0,"Live the tanks, they fit very comfortably. True to size."
4.0,Love the shirt but as a guy who's in somewhat good shape and is 6'3 the shirt rides up when I sit down.  Not for tall people!  Make LT sizes :]
4.0,Just as pictured but had to glue one button back on the wires
4.0,"I love them! The only thing I wished is that the feather was a little heavier or something because it keeps getting caught in my hair. Otherwise, I love them."
4.0,Fabric is thin but top is very cute. I ordered a small. I'm 5'1&#34; tall and 132 pounds. A size four.
4.0,"Seriously the best masks I own! I went and bought another set so I wouldn’t have to constantly do laundry! They are super cute, lightweight and breathable. I am always receiving compliments when I wear them- from friends, family and random strangers! The rhinestones don’t fall off when washed (I wash in a delicates bag and hang dry) and the masks fit comfortably. I am a teacher and can keep it on for 6+ hours straight with no complaints! The only things would be if they came in solid colors (I love the rhinestones but sometimes I need to be less fancy) and if there was a filter pocket (they are snug enough and seem secure though so I feel safe). Love these masks!!"
4.0,"Trying these socks out to see if they help with my foot pain . I have two other types that I ware to try to reduce the pain .<br />So far I have only worn them one time , they do a good job of staying up . Will see after a few wash's . My foot feels ok while wearing them . I guess I would like to see how they holdup before giving a 👍or 👎."
4.0,Pretty...but have to wash it first they smell
4.0,It was what we expected and it served the purpose it is nothing fancy you get what you see.
4.0,"I bought this ring for my husband. His original wedding band doesn't fit anymore and it got super scuffed up being white gold. He is a cop so I needed a tough ring and wouldn't bend or get scratched easily. This ring does the job!!!! I want to order more as back ups because it is getting a little scratched but you can barely notice. It has stood up to him working on vehicles, installing pipes and garage doors without taking it off and the scratches are very minimal. The edge color is more of a gun metal grey also which is awesome. He loves this ring!"
4.0,It was the perfect birthday gift. She absolutely loved it! It was a bit itchy on the inner sleeve sewing line though.
4.0,"I thought the charm would be bigger; it's Beautiful, just a little small"
4.0,They have done what I wanted. Typical in looks for the style.
4.0,This is a nice purse/tote.  I went by the other reviews and bought it.  It really is soft leather.  I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the leather is especially for the price.  You can't go wrong.
4.0,Work great for beach time or a pool visit - protects babies bare feet! We’ve enjoyed having and the shoes are very cute and easy to put on.
4.0,"I like these sunglasses! I little flimsy but it's $6 so I wasn't expecting that much. The heart shape is cute and I love the rainbow lenses. Because of the price, i ended up buying 4 more pairs for my girlfriends when we went on a weekend cruise to Mexico. They are flattering for all face shapes and my friends all loved them. Only complaint is that 1 of the 4 pairs I ordered was missing a nose pad. But again, $6 from China so you get what you pay for. Overall I really like them, they look cute, and they're inexpensive  enough that I'm not going to cry if I lose them or break them."
4.0,"It is a really nice cardigan. I got a size bigger than I normally would because I like my sweaters to be larger. However I am glad I did because these do run pretty small. It fits, but not the way I want it to. I suggest getting two sizes larger if you are going to wear anything thicker under neath it."
4.0,"They look just like the pictures. Decent quality. They all have bent nose pieces, easy enough to straighten out though."
4.0,"The size is correct and they are soft and comfortable. They are made in Korea. Based on the quality of the workmanship I am thinking North Korea, but for the price you can't go wrong. The US made one from Raine I got was too small."
4.0,"Runs a little on the small side, should have gotten a XL."
4.0,Super cute.  A blogger posted this shirt and I had to have it.  I got a medium and it’s a little tight across the chest but still works. Good material that didn’t feel cheap.
4.0,"The netting is very pretty and makes the hat.  The sparkles are a little cheap looking, but I'll keep it anyway.  Perfect for my Derby party this weekend."
4.0,"I love pendant necklaces especially layered ones! 😍 This choker-like beauty layers closely with three pendants on three different chains. It sells for $5.99 and of course is not gold. It is gold toned which means you will need to remove if perspiring or in the water. Cute to wear if needing something affordable with fast shipping. It looks great and can be worn dressed up or down. Surprisingly it hasn't tangled as most of my layered necklaces do within a few minutes of wearing it. For the price, I'd say this is worth purchasing... Possibly giftable to a preteen or teen. Can't beat the price."
4.0,The top was too small I ordered a small and I am a 34A and I could not fit in it
4.0,"This top is nice and fits fine, but the picture gives the impression it has a bit of a flared bottom.  It doesn't.  It's just a basic tunic top.  But it's fine so I'm keeping it.  Sized well."
4.0,I got these for my daughters unicorn party to go in her favor bags. Im not sure how durable they are since they are in favor bags but they are adorable. They came with a little paper with the moods and colors on it. My first order didn't come amazon sent me another order of the rings right away though. The girls all loved these rings they were the most popular item in the favors bag.
4.0,Thin material with a little stretch. Super comfortable! Great for layering. Would buy again if more colors we
4.0,Very pretty like the look. They go with everything.....
4.0,"Product is exactly as pictured and described. A bit flimsy, but great for price."
4.0,Nicely colored to wear with fall and winter outfits.
4.0,Tight around the waist but I like em
4.0,"I bought this because it reminded me of the trip I took with my mom before she died, so there's a lot of sentiment attached for me.  It's a nice enough little necklace, and the chain is sturdy and pleasant to look at.  There's a big 3D pooch to the turtle's shell--reminds me of a pearl cage or something--which I wasn't expecting and makes it a little more difficult to keep clean, but I like it.  It's a happy turtle."
4.0,"Great product. I like them, I bought 5 packs."
4.0,"The last bucket hat i bought is kind of snug fitting. I saw this one and figured i  would give it a shot.<br /><br />It is great. It fits better than my other hat, and was also cheaper, and arrived in good time"
4.0,Please with my purchase and quality for the price. I will<br />continue to look for  a larger one for men.
4.0,"Gloves are very nice, but the fingers are a bit short for the size (medium). We measured my hand & confirmed that we ordered the correct size. They are substantial gloves for cold weather & look classy."
4.0,"Nice glasses, protects my eyes well and a very budget-conscious option."
4.0,Love the thicker cotton material. Just wish the sleeves were a bit longer
4.0,These are super cute! They look a little less polished in real life but it’s hard to tell when you are wearing. I’ve gotten tons of compliments
4.0,Purchased this as a gift---too early to comment on how it holds up but it's pretty and I'm satisfied so far.
4.0,"I like simplicity, mostly. But I loved the way this looked. It's very comfortable to wear but a beast to clasp. Make sure you have all hands on deck if you want to wear it."
4.0,A really nice blouse for casual wear but just runs too small!!
4.0,"Its such a unique bracelet , I love it , An it was so admired by my Daughter ,  so I  got one for my Daughter too."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8d22712bb7035726a57b125ba6ac297d]] This is a good value for a luxury brand replica watch band. I don’t like the fixed retention loop next to the buckle, especially with such a long strap. Hopefully the band will loosen/soften with use because it is a little stiff out of the box. The print appears to be a film wrapped over a leather band. Installs securely on the Apple Watch with no concerns."
4.0,It was very good for the 4th of July activities.
4.0,I purchased a 4T-5 for our grandchild and it is a little big on her. She just turned 4 but she is tiny. I figure she will grow into it!
4.0,The suit is really cute but not a great fit for the amply endowed.  The bust pads were tiny but I was afraid to remove them for fear of saggage.
4.0,These are very large in size..I loved them and the detail is beautiful... I purchased these for my daughter that served in the Navy
4.0,"Great value for the price<br />Very well made.<br />Earrings seem a little heavy, but they are good size stones.."
4.0,I am on the busty side and shirt fits great.  Shirt fits as expected and covers my Mom tummy without being baggy like a potato sack.  Plus this shirt can be used on the reverse side so the criss cross is on the back.
4.0,It's so soft! And fits perfectly which is what I was scared of most. It is kind of see thru so another tank will need to be added underneath
4.0,The bottoms where one size bigger than the top
4.0,"Generally I'm a small or medium in patty tops. Since this is a wrap style i went with the medium. I can barely get this to cover my chest. It will have to be worn with a cami underneath for coverage, and it sits pretty high up in the front, not as long as it is on the model in the picture. I can still make it work and it's great quality but there is inconsistency with sizing in this brand, and for this particular shirt you really need to size up."
4.0,Sometimes I have to get into attic’s or a crawlspace this will keep you fairly clean but I found it to be very itchy and annoying to wear in the beginning but you get used to it better than having insulation and spiderwebs all over you. Good product for a good value.
4.0,"Love the material and style, but XXL is realy like a Large and i needed a bit more room since i life weights 5 times a week. My shoulders,chest and back are a bit fuller than average. So i have to give them 4 stars."
4.0,I like it and it looks good on
4.0,"This is one of the prettiest bracelets that I have had in a very long time. The magnetic clasp makes it very easy for me to put on. The clasps just attract each other so well that when they are in close proximity they connect. The connection, however, is not very strong and it comes apart easily with a small amount of strain. But for that, I would have given this a 5 star rating. Still I'm glad I bought it and would do so again."
4.0,It needs hooks!
4.0,"Super soft, very cozy, very pretty neutral colors. Comfortable to wear & stylish."
4.0,You do not want to walk very far in them. Fun shoes though.
4.0,Love the way it fits and the material.
4.0,The mask is beautiful and sparkly. It was also heavy and uncomfortable. See it more as a decoration than a mask for a party.
4.0,A little thin might not last long but it worked for me
4.0,Cute tshirt for the price. .odd stitching at hem but otherwise nice shirt
4.0,"Very nice sized back with cotton interior. Nice leather detail. I didn't give it 5 stars because the bag smelled so back I had to air it our for 48 hours. It appears the plastic packaging masked an unruly smell that almost made me return this item. If the bag wasn't so cute and functional it would have been a fail. Once it is aired out, it is definately worth the cheap price for this leather bag."
4.0,The sweater is just OK. It looks thicker and more textured in the picture than it actually is but it will do.
4.0,"I purchased the 8929OB as a temp replacement for my stolen Rolex. The look and dimensions seems to about the same (IMHO). However the wristband feels a little lighter than the original. I've owned this watch for about two months so I cannot attest to it's durability over time. It does come with a five year warrantee. It does look good as arm candy. I've tracked it's accuracy against the U.S. Atomic Clock. This watch gained 20 sec in seven days. If you want an accurate chronograph do not buy this watch....nor a Rolex for that matter. My Oyster Perpetual kept lousy time. I used the timing of my GPS to measure the Rolex. It would be off by a couple seconds daily. If you want an accurate watch this is not for you. I'd recommend a battery powered Casio or similar watch. I'm told mechanical watches (like this and the Rolex) simply cannot be accurate due to the nature of their mechanical bits moving about. True or not, I do know this watch does not keep accurate time. So why the four stars? For me, the look and feel of this watch as motivation to purchase another Rolex is more important than an accurate time piece. It does look good, so I'm putting looks over performance in this case."
4.0,Really nice looking for the price!
4.0,These outfits are usually a bit small but this one is actually a little larger than I expected. It is nice material and super cute!
4.0,was what I thought it would be.
4.0,Beautiful summer dress. Fit to size but I have average size breast. Could run small in breast area. Very comfortable.
4.0,"My kid love he shoes, for now the light seem to work fine. hopefully it will stay that way."
4.0,"If you go by the measurements, it'll fit fine. The skirt part is a little longer than I'd like for a wednesday addams costume, but that's the easiest part to tailor.<br /><br />The sleeve cuffs are weirdly long."
4.0,Looks and feels great. .
4.0,"I love almost everything about this dress. The quality is great, the fabric is soft & durable, the stitching is perfect. It’s just too big. I ordered a Large & I am 5’9, 170 lbs. it’s too big in the shoulders. I will have it taken in & it will be perfect."
4.0,Shirt is super cute. Fits Great! Wish it was just a little longer in length.  Can't wait to wear on my Vacation!
4.0,"Actually mistaken and purchased a XL and had to get it altered. Buuuuuut, I purchased it for a 1920s Harlem night party and I, along with EVERYONE else, loved it and the accessories. The only con about the the dress is that the tassels got hung in just about everything lol, but other than that, it is a great deal and a must purchased."
4.0,Fits smaller than other tops of the same size
4.0,"Loved it, cute and simple"
4.0,"Works great for keeping the sun off of my head, ears, and part of my neck. It also looks good with the brim turned up. Seems to be very well made and I certainly can't complain about the price. It's a little on the stiff side but that's a good thing, all in all, a good buy..."
4.0,These are very comfortable tanks. I use them for lifting as well as during yoga. They are very light weight. Sizing is good. They are not as tight as other compression tanks. They wick sweat well and dry quickly.
4.0,"Good enough for this price. I bought it for college; big enough for my books and folders. The inside zippers kind of cheap, but I did not expect much for $21. I like the color, size, and price."
4.0,Very cute and dainty. Turned my neck green but still a pretty piece.
4.0,Light isn’t great. It basically only lights up the hour number.
4.0,Me queda tal como se ve en la foto. El vestido llegó en buenas condiciones
4.0,A great peace of American pop culture.
4.0,"The lace on this was super cute but the cut just wasn’t doing it for me. I thought the flowy material would compliment a shapely body but it sort of just looks like a tent. Pretty style and material, but had to return"
4.0,"Nice rings, one was broken upon arrival. Good price"
4.0,"I bought this band because the one that came with the watch wasn't very comfortable but I liked that it was pink. The band isn't quite the color I expected, it's more of a peach but I don't mind it. Unfortunately it was too long, my wrist is about 6"", so I had to cut it. When it arrived, the texture of the band was slick and it was somewhat uncomfortable, but once I wore it for a bit that feel wore off and now it's very comfortable. Even though it wasn't perfect, I wear it all the time and I'm happy with it!"
4.0,"Good quality, a very attractive and solid band, good value for the price."
4.0,I love the way the bracelet arrived and the jewelry bag it was placed in. I have worn  not removed it since it arrived. It fits my small wrist perfectly and it has a tight stretch for larger wrists.l would definitely recommend this
4.0,I would say this runs a size small
4.0,Good Quality..  Heavy Weight..Runs a little Large.  Quick Shipping
4.0,This is my favorite beaded bracelet. I like the small heart that hangs nicely. I have a few colors. To match my outfits. I like the selection of colors. Very pretty. The stretch is a nice fit and comfortable. I also like the way it has the beads and a flat piece on back side. Good design. Good price. Thanks!
4.0,Straps on right shoe were more loose than those on left shoe.  Liked the design and overall appearance but straps were to loose to keep shoe on.
4.0,Dad loves it. Got XL. Runs small.
4.0,great for price used for Great Gatsby party
4.0,Well satisfied cute
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:420cdc59d2cb1802558ab0ebb5e89b6c]] This Rose Gold Heart & Key Necklace sure is Pretty! I love the Stone in the Key! It's Bright & Sparkles when the Light hits it just right! Lightweight, but not Cheap/Flimsy. There is a tiny but somewhat noticeable 'ding' on the Heart. Nice piece of Fashion Jewelry for the Price!"
4.0,I bought this more for fun but found it is a very good hat.  The quality is good and is comfortable to wear.
4.0,My 2yr old lovedit
4.0,These were fun to wear on my gambling trip.
4.0,"Very comfortable band, great quality leather. I tend to switch bands on my watches."
4.0,Fits a bit large for my 5 year old but it's ok for the most part.
4.0,"super soft leather, good fit."
4.0,Too small and fabric was a little thin.  Gnomes were cute
4.0,"Nice sweatshirt for the $$$... Serves the purpose well, at least for me. Kind of an all weather sweatshirt, barring harsh winter days.<br />The zipper is not a heavy duty zipper and can sometimes come through defective. The stitching on the pockets can also pull away easily but Russell usually stands for quality. I have a Russell Sweatshirt that I still wear from 1982.<br /><br />If Russell could fix the zipper setting so it does not lay above the double zipper molding, I would give this sweatshirt a 5 star rating. When looking at the sweatshirt, the zipper should not be the main feature. The zipper should be sewn in more recessed.<br /><br />I ordered XL and it fit perfect. Sleeves, shoulders, neck, hood and exactly right to the waist."
4.0,"It’s light weight and soft. I ordered a brown one and really liked the color as well.<br /><br />My only concern is that it is a bit big. I do plan to keep it though, so it’s not that bad."
4.0,"Bigger than expected, vice color, plan to buy more."
4.0,"Definitely prefer the polarized lenses. The hinge holds firm, meaning I was able to walk without the tinted lenses creeping down."
4.0,I liked this dress a lot. It runs a little larger. I ordered one size down. The fabric and pattern are as pictured but the design is not laid out as in the picture. I had a different mandala over the chest. Tge dress is flattering. I wear it over leggings. It is a bit long for me. I am five foot 4 inches and it was almost down to my knees. Will probably hem it.
4.0,Love this brand and this is a very cute top. This is a very reliable brand that I can always depend on for professional clothing at a reasonable price and great quality.
4.0,Muy bonito igual que en la foto
4.0,"I love these tights, although I bought them a size smaller than I normally wear due to the fact that my last pair became loose around my waist. These fit okay, but I think that I will stick with my normal size M for next time. These are a little shorter than shown in the photo by about an inch. The quality of these capris are great, they are thick enough not to show through, the fabric is a matte, and they are durable. I do a cross fit style workout everyday and these perform great and the waist doesn't roll down. I will be buying more soon."
4.0,I ordered a size larger because reviews stated that they ran small...and they do.
4.0,"These shoes arrived today and are not the advertised brand,Chillipop. Instead, they are Lilly of New York shoes.  I googled that brand and these same shoes sell for $18 on another site.  Looks like Amazon got us a great deal !They do not come in a shoe box. Just a plastic bag. They are on a plastic hanger like flip flops at WalMart. They're really cute,though and our granddaughter will love them. The velvet is very soft and for the price, it's worth taking a chance."
4.0,So far so it works fine!
4.0,"I really like this sweater.<br />It’s super cute and comfortable<br />I ordered true to size and it fits great.<br />For reference I’m 5’5, 140ish lbs and wear a Medium.<br />The only issue I have with this sweater is that when I wear it I feel like I’m having to pull the bottom hem down a lot.<br />It doesn’t fit tight or anything but for some reason it seems to creep it’s way up to my waist while I walk and stand."
4.0,Got this to have on me when i’m out. Wanted a small cross body to fit my phone and some cash / credit cards. It’s the perfect size for me and I love the color. Has a little lock on front so everything you put inside of it is secure. All in all it’s a good buy.
4.0,"These were so cute on, but kept sliding down my nose. After a full day of wearing them, the arms widened out and they kept falling off my face. I need to tighten them before wearing again."
4.0,"Ordering this was a bit of a shot in the dark. The size is listed as large, but there isn't anything in the listing that explains the sizing of this sweater. Is it US, UK, or Asian sizing? Nothing like getting a real surprise in the mail!  Turns out this is more like an extra large/16-18 which is great. I can wear a short sleeved top underneath and not feel squished by my clothing. I do recommend wearing something underneath as the material is thinner than a usual sweater and the edges of your bra will be quite visible without something underneath to help smooth them down. The fit is VERY loose and forgiving. The sweater is really comfortable but won't do anything for your figure. I'd describe the fit as ""I suppose I have to be presentable to leave the house in order to run errands, but I don't really want to and wish I was home wearing my pajamas instead.""  I don't mean to say you will look horrible. The sweater looks good on - it just won't do much of anything for your shape.  A brooch, bib necklace, or a few longer chains layered really dress up this sweater.<br /><br />As for laundering, washing on cold in the gentle cycle is best, and if you dry this in the dryer make sure to remove it promptly as this sweater will wrinkle. If you hang this on a hanger, even a padded one, you will end up with those little hanger 'points' on the shoulders of the sweater.  There hasn't been any sign of pilling yet after a couple of wears, and hopefully it remains that way. The material is very soft and smooth versus very soft with a fluffy feel (think cashmere with the soft fibers that come up from the weave of the fabric). This should keep the pilling and snags to a minimum.<br /><br />Overall I am really happy with this sweater. The fit and feel are better than I thought they would be, and I love the comfortable, loose fit for running around on fall weekends."
4.0,I've bought this shirt in many colors and they fit a tad differently. I loved the color and the fit was good. I am a size 16-18 with a larger chest and I wanted it to fit loosely so I bought a 2x and it fits pretty well.
4.0,Works as advertised! Will lose water weight quickly. Great product!
4.0,"I love this romper. Ordered a large per the other reviews (I'm 5'2"" and 130 lbs) and it's perfect. It's easy to unzip, comfortable enough to lounge around in, but nice enough that I can spruce it up with a funky necklace and metallic sandals for a casual work or family outing. The only complaint I have is that the pockets are a little weirdly placed, and the corner pocket seam is beginning to fray after a couple months of wear. Might just get another!"
4.0,"Order a half size smaller than what you normally wear. I am a size 7.5. and I read reviews, that said they were true to size, and some that they were too big. Listen to the reviews that say they are too big. I originally ordered a 7.5, and had to return them and get a 7. But they are really cute, and comfy to wear."
4.0,Was a gift out of state...
4.0,Very nice pair of pants. They fit like they're supposed too. Light weight and comfortable. I do recommend this item.
4.0,Wrinkles something fierce. Style is great; fit is good; workmanship is good; color is great….but the material blend requires ironing. Would prefer that it could be snapped out of the dryer and hung up and the wrinkles not be a factor to have to deal with.
4.0,The necklace was shipped in good order and fast.  It is very pretty.  The only thing I don't like is that it is 3 separate necklaces.  What a pain to get them all on.  I assumed it was 1 combined. I would give it 5 stars if it was 1 combined necklace.
4.0,"Comfy, easy to take on & off. Hopefully they're doing their job! Seem like quality material."
4.0,I don’t know why I can’t ever find larger nipple piercings. I ordered the larger size just smaller jewels and they still seem to be the exact size of my ones I got pierced with. I may just have to go to a local tattoo shop. My nipples are small but they have not healed correctly hence why I’m looking for larger bars. I may keep them . Not sure yet
4.0,"I ordered pink and purple and received the blue variety. It isn't the end of the world, but if I choose a color I expect to get what I chose. Aside from that, the goggles fit my children well, they are 11 and 8 years old. The 2 pack is very convenient and affordable. The goggles don't fog up like some others do which is very nice. They seemed to be comfortable on their heads also since they didn't complain about how they felt. They use the goggles in our swimming pool all the time and have no complaints yet."
4.0,Quality fabric and well cut with attractive styling.  Only returning because it seems to run somewhat small.
4.0,"This product does work well to add shine to a leather boot, once it dries and you give the boot a good buff with horsehair brush. I have had mixed results in the actual waterproofing applied. One pair of boots beads up water better than before, but another pair has little change to its beading performance. It does not have any effect on the color of the leather I've tried it on. If you don't want to add shine, I've had luck applying it, letting it dry, and not buffing with a brush.<br /><br />Also note: this is basically a spray-application wax. This is not something like mink oil paste or hubberds shoe grease, or sno-seal, or some other really heavy waterproofing compound. It's also not a silicone spray."
4.0,Excellent coverage of the front body.  Also durable.
4.0,"Full disclosure- I have been searching everywhere to find glasses that look like the kind Nicole Kidman's character wears in &#34;Big Little Lies.&#34; I'm obsessed.  So when I found these, I thought they were close enough.  My biggest problem is that they are less the beige color pictured and more light pink.  I'm also not a fan of the cat-eye style, but that's on me because it's clearly pictured. Overall, they are not bad, but be warned- the color is more or less just pink."
4.0,"Expecting OD Green socks, or something sort of tan-greenish.  These socks are more like maple tree green socks.  Not what I expected.  But socks are being used for the purpose of socks for mid-calf high military boots and military desert camo, so color might not be an issue since the socks are not higher than the boots.  Socks reach a bit past mid-calf for a large size sock, where shoe size is size 7 (men's size) - perfect height.  Socks are very soft, well constructed, with extra cushion in all the right places.  Giving a 4-star instead of 5-star because the color does match the photos online and the actual color was an unexpected negative surprise.  Technically, the description just says ""green"", and that's what they are -- like maple tree leaf green, not tannish green or olive drab green.  Socks are decent deal for the quality and I can deal with the miscoloring, so I'll keep them."
4.0,I really love this cute holiday dress but I had to only give it 4 stars because it appears to run very big!!!!  I plan on wearing it with leggings and a belt since it is so huge.  Shipment was super fast and the dress comes with a cute Christmas ornament too.  Perfect little dress for some holiday fun without having to spend a ton of money....
4.0,Love the shirt but didn't realize it was 3/4 length. Picture show long sleeve.  Change your picture .
4.0,they don’t shine as much in pictures as i thought they would. the fang is a bit too big. overall would buy again.
4.0,My husband loved this shirt
4.0,Block out blue light
4.0,"This is a beautiful watch, but it is on the heavier side. Had to size down and is still too large for my wrist, but I push it up my arm and it's OK. I love the look of  the watch."
4.0,Shoulder straps not firm enough to provide minimum breast support
4.0,"The quality of these sandals is great. Be sure to tighten all the spikes upon receipt, all mine needed 1 to 2 clicks each. I wear a size 10 shoe, all other sandals fit fine. These are like a size 11. I got the straps tight enough so they didn't slip and played a round in them. They worked as they are supposed to. Lots of strap overhang, I may just trim it and not worry. My suggestion would be to order a size down if you're on the low end of a size."
4.0,quality is not as good as I expected.
4.0,"Nice style, casual, comfy. I like the material-kind of like high tech hiking cloth, windbreaker material, light, stretchy, not see thru. Pockets could have been finished a little better-seems are raw inside pockets. I’m going to try to sew down the button front to stop gaping. It does a little-I’m 36-38 DD. Not too bad tho. I like it and bought the army green & the rusty orange."
4.0,"I gave 4 stars only because I didn’t like how these sat on my earlobes. The post is too long and so they don’t hug your ears like they should. You could see it hanging from the back of my ear, and so they just looked like oversized barbells instead of plugs. If you have big ear lobes, maybe they’d work for you."
4.0,I love it the color perfect but is little big for me I am 160 pounds I bought size small and was big
4.0,"The fabric isn't breathable so it might be hot if you wear it out, but it's cute. Shirt is cropped and fit fine, but the shorts were tight on me. For reference, I'm usually a 2XL in Amazon sizes, 16/18 in other stores, and I ordered a 3XL. I think if I would have gotten the 4XL, the shorts would have been wearable. I recommend sizing up two sizes from your normal size."
4.0,"This shirt is really comfortable, and the color is pretty spot-on with the picture.  The sleeves are short on me (I'm 5'9&#34;), so I'll probably be wearing them as 3/4 length style (the wrist holes are snug enough that they'll hold on my upper forearm).  The fabric is pretty thin, but for the ~$10 this shirt cost, I'm not complaining.  I'll just have to be careful not to wash it with any velcro pieces..."
4.0,"Okay, the good things first. There are no parts extending from the watch or band so that it works well for a potter. It's a lovely blue, one piece, all is just fine. The only bad part is that is loses a couple of minutes a week but I've learned how to reset the time and can live with that."
4.0,"Arrived real fast, way before the said delivery date, however fit a too big but my son will grow bigger and will fit then so no biggie for the price I paid"
4.0,"The watch works well and seems to be of good quality especially for the price. The watch arrived in about 4 weeks and was working and preset for my time zone. The watch is very well represented by the pictures shown. I was most interested in a low cost watch for night and power failures which we get a lot of. It's easy to read in low light conditions without shining a light on it first. To get the brightest green background as shown in the pictures you'll need to shine a bright light on it for a minute or two, the green background light will gradually dim over a few minutes time and your ability to read it will depend on how good your night vision is. If you need a watch that will self light at low cost I would recommend a Timex &#34;Indiglo&#34; watch with a white face."
4.0,"I bought this in the hopes of reducing the amount of static electricity I wake up with, and to help prevent breakage - and it seems to be working.  It's comfortable to wear.  The material is soft & very vibrant."
4.0,Sleeves are a little tighter than I'd like.
4.0,"ok i really love this dress. i usually wear about an 18, and ordered a 2XL. it was very snug in the chest and under the arms. other than that it was perfect."
4.0,I get lots of compliments on this watch. Hands are easy to read. Setting the month and date is almost impossible. I usually give up after my fingers are sore trying to turn the tiny setting stem.
4.0,"This is a good umbrella, first off you get 2 in the pack and that's great. They're a greatbsize and can be easily stored in a small or medium handbag or hung somewhere easily. They're sturdy in the wind and surprisingly to me the reflective strip really looks cool and is visible at night once there's a little light to bounce off of it. I also really like that it's sobeasy to open and close and it dries easily. This is a good quality umbrella and it comes packaged nicely."
4.0,"I had LASEK and have to wear sunglasses whenever outside for the first year. I think everyone should have a few pair of sunglasses everywhere. At work, home, car, etc. Its always good having a pair near by. These aren't Maui Jim's or Oakleys; however, for 1/20 of the price I dont think thats an issue either. These are lightweight, polarized, and overall are great to have."
4.0,The black one fit perfectly. The blue was a bit big
4.0,I wear a size 14 pants and 38 D bra and wanted to have a nice summer dress for the beach or vacation. Bought the XL and it is a bit too big all around. It is comfortable but suggestion is by your size down.
4.0,"When I received this robe it was so long it almost touched the floor, so I washed and dryed it in very hot water & high heat and it shrunk in length 2 inches. Now it's just right. Warm too for cold evenings."
4.0,The sizes run small so be sure to order at least two sizes larger than you are in US sizes. I'm a large and had to buy an XXL to get it to fit.
4.0,I always get compliments towards this hoodie. -1 star for the price
4.0,"I purchased in size Large.<br />Approximate measurements laying flat unstretched:<br />Chest underarm to underarm 20.5""<br />Length shoulder to hem 26""<br />Across hem 20.5""<br />Across mid body 19""<br />Shoulders sleeve seam to seam 15.5""<br />Sleeve length shoulder seam to cuff 26""<br /><br />I typically wear a size Medium in basic relaxed t-shirts, 36C bra, size 6 American Eagle jeans. I've purchased Harley tops and hoodies and they tend to run small and short so I sized up. This is actually fairly true to size. The size Large on me was loose/relaxed, I could definitely have worn a medium. The length was normal, not almost cropped like some of their other women's hoodies. I'm approximately 5'6"" with average length arms, the sleeves were quite long, just my fingers sticking out, but that was actually a plus for me as I prefer longer sleeves. Nice soft mid weight sweatshirt fabric. Love the dark grey on black logo, subtle but still noticeable. Overall good quality and I'll keep the large as it'll be good to wear over sweaters in winter."
4.0,"This is a very pretty top.  However, I’m a medium (5’5” 130lbs 34DDD) and bought a large. It’s still tight. The material is thin and your skin will show through."
4.0,"It was a paaaaaaaale yellow, smelled a little funny. I went down to a large could have done a médium.  Tucked in the back and made it work"
4.0,No Zipper
4.0,"This dress is super cute, but the belt doesn't really do much so you might have to use your own.  Also, the fabric is a little stiff so you may need to run it through the dryer to soften it.  Overall, though, this dress is the perfect little summer dress!"
4.0,Love this dress. Love the color. Took me a few tries to figure out how to tie it correctly without looking too bunched up.
4.0,"I needed this purely for the utility: when I walk to and from my office, I'm always facing the sun and that, together with shiny cars, hurts my eyes. These glasses cut out most of the glare so I can see things clearly without hurting my eyes. They're not very strong, but I didn't buy them for any activity that would need them to be."
4.0,"Cutest skirt ever.  I did feel, however that it was over priced.  After all it is a finished piece of fabric🤨"
4.0,"The color is not quite as pretty in person as it was online, but it arrived quickly and nice sweatshirt! We’ve had North Face sweatshirts that have lasted (still look great) for years! True to size."
4.0,Nice and thick. Warm.
4.0,6/10
4.0,a little bigger than i expected
4.0,I love the style of the romper. I love the color. It’s a bit big that I had to roll up the pant legs. The material could be a little better but other than that we love it. Nice breezy outfit for summer.
4.0,Great hat but a little too small for me a male with 7 5/8 size
4.0,"I am very pleasantly surprised at how well these work!! I have very light-sensitive eyes and cannot afford to have the transitions lenses in my glasses. When I had an opportunity to purchase these on sale, I jumped at it. They really provide excellent protection and do not distort your vision like others I have used in the past. Most likely I'm just uncoordinated and forgetful, but I have found them to be a bit awkward to attach and remove without actually looking in a mirror or using both hands. That can be an issue if you are driving and suddenly need eye protection. Otherwise, they are great!"
4.0,"I liked the pants, they just weren't as soft as I thought."
4.0,I liked the dress but it was a little short but for the money it's good
4.0,"I have an XL head, this cap worked great for the patrol work I was doing. The fit was good and comfortable. I would like maybe a little more brim surface, it looked a little small for my big head. Nice thick quality material, it should be able to handle standard patrol abuse we put on our gears."
4.0,good belt do need to remove a certain length but cuts easily
4.0,Love them.  Very comfy
4.0,"sturdy band, little stiff and hard to install, but once on, it was perfect."
4.0,Definitely runs small.. Should've listened to the other reviews and went a cup size up but still happy with what i got.  I'm a 36C and got exactly that. It wasn't tight but my boobs were really out there and perky
4.0,got this a year ago it was pretty good
4.0,The  watch is astonishing! Just what I  wanted...the only problem is that it  keeps dropping time...I'm  frustrated I keep having to  set it.
4.0,Material is strange. But the dress is cute!
4.0,Love the belt and style but definitely not an everyday belt it can be used on several occasions it will break with over usage had to opt for leather after this but for the price most groovy
4.0,good hat good price buy again
4.0,Bit larger than what I expected
4.0,Belt is nice but a little short. Very stiff.
4.0,Very stately pins to support our President.  Caution-small writing means liberals can't read it until they are very close to you.  This means they might get triggered and freak out in very close proximity to you or your family.  You don't want to get pepper-sprayed or beaten to a pulp by a mob of them.
4.0,"nice socks, a little tight"
4.0,This is another older peace and mad of plastic not real metal but it's still cute and looks cute with my turtle neck
4.0,Too thin prefer the standard SOX
4.0,"Very cute, I love how dainty it is.<br />Only draw back is that it's more of a jeweled sculpture of an alligator, so it doesn't lay flat and flips over onto its back. But that's not really a big deal."
4.0,"The dress was nice quality as well as the material. The straps were long, had to Cinch all the way down. Planned on wearing dress to work and I could if I wanted too."
4.0,"I was sent the wrong color.<br />But aside from that, it isn't a high quality product which I wasn't expecting because it's so cheap. Good shirt for the price and cute on. Elastic on arms are a little tight and I have small arms."
4.0,Well made nice shorts but runs very big
4.0,Ok material but design is not too impressive
4.0,The mask are ok i like the design but they are grown up size not kids size
4.0,They were smaller than expected. But it will work
4.0,Looked great and fits well and wore this to husbands reward trip!
4.0,"Ordered a size Small for my 10 year old step-daughters birthday … she liked it, & most importantly , it fit her. For comparison purposes, she is 4’8” & aprox. 100lbs."
4.0,Good quality and price. Bought this as a gift and it was a little more tight than expected for the size. We thought it would be more flowy. She was still happy with it.
4.0,"Fits good and color is correct, but the design is a little different from what is shown in the picture. Overall good for the price."
4.0,Good looking watch. Durable and elegant. Good for a hike or a night on the town . I have the blue dials and have no complaints. The watch is very easy to read in dark conditions. Have no issues with it not being Brite enough.
4.0,"Love this dress! It’s not that thick though so if you get a light color, it will be see through. In black, it’s ok. Note, I’m 5’2 and the length was great!"
4.0,"Well made item, mine had a broken zipper that I was able to fix with my tools. It looked a bit more masculine than I would have liked so it was a perfect gift for my brother that travels a lot."
4.0,"Arrived on time. Wasn't exactly burgundy, more like a pale red. Still super cute!  I am 5&#34;4, about 180 pounds, I wear a US xl top and US 17 pants and it fit PERFECTLY. The sleeves are a little long-But I love longer sleeves. Its comfortable and cozy! Its my first bodysuit and i'm not upset! I do wish it was more burgundy but I will be buying black and gray soon! I love it already &#60;3"
4.0,"Shining, Brightling!<br />Best price for special"
4.0,It’s a colorful casual dress for summer. I originally purchased for a trip to the Bahamas. I ended up wearing it as a swimsuit cover up. The straps are a little awkward to figure out which way they go. Otherwise cute dress. The top part is a little snug. I’m a 36DD.
4.0,Quality shirt depicting the Frank Zappa Uncle Meat album
4.0,"Good clarity, low internal reflection. Tint is not nearly as dark as factory lenses though; in open water or on snow you may still feel some minor discomfort from reflected sunlight. Price is right, though."
4.0,"It's ok, not terrible, not great. Keeping it because it was cheap. You get what you pay for."
4.0,Perfect size and nice quality.  I wish the &#34;ends&#34; we more rounded so it wouldn't pinch my toe.
4.0,"Shipping was prompt and packaging was just fine. The dress wasn't what I was expecting though. I was expecting it to be a bit lighter, the dress is actually a bit heavy. I also expected the material to be different. It comes with a waist belt. I ordered an XL but could have fit a L comfortably. The material is stretchy, although heavy but the dress is of good quality. Overall, I am happy with the dress.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair, honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I wear a size 12 shoe or boot. I purchased the XXL or size 13, with a pair of medium to light weight socks my foot fits snugly into these with my toes touching the front of the slippers, no room to spare. When I walk my heels have a tendency to slip out (I'll have to do some work to fix that). I don't know if they stretch or not or if the shrink when washed. My recommendation,  That it's up to you to purchase or not."
4.0,Beautiful watch but uncomfortable strap So I’ll be changing the strap soon.
4.0,"So my Tahoe key is super awkward in this, unfortunately it won’t stay in the middle of the casing and the plastic is rigid so it makes moving it around to push the buttons pretty hard. It’s pretty much exactly what I wanted and what it says it is and it’s great quality from what I can tell but it’s just hard to make work for my key right now"
4.0,"I ordered it a size bigger to be safe, and the material is FANTASTIC. Its so so soft and strong, not cheap feeling whatsoever. I love how comfortable it is. The fabric is buttery smooth. I definitely could have ordered one size smaller, but I was trying to be safe. Great suit, amazing fabric, extremely comfortable and it fits my body shape perfectly."
4.0,Very Dainty. Lovely
4.0,Have only tried it on - have not yet worn it.
4.0,Pluses:<br />- This nylon strap fits my Watch3 perfectly<br />- Included quick release bars are a nice touch<br />- Metal hardware rings included<br /><br />Minus:<br />- The nylon is quite rough which detracts from the overall experience.  Ended up switching to a silicone band due to this.<br /><br />I've also added additional holes to better fit my wrist using a soldering iron.
4.0,The item is very nice .I love it .Hope this is good gifts to my friend ! I will update soon when after I will give to her .
4.0,The thingamajig looks and feels nice but doesn't fit around my boot. Even when adjusted to the largest size.<br />Edit: I added a start. I bought new boots. It fits perfectly now.
4.0,This works great! It's a little bulkier than I had first pictured but it's looks good!
4.0,Came in time and the size is prefect.
4.0,The slippers were exactly as described in the Amazon ad. My daughter loves Hello Kitty and fell in love with these which we gave her for Christmas. the only problem is that they are the correct size but they slip off of her feet. Besides that they are wonderful.
4.0,"Overall liked the item, was smaller than expected based on photo, but was decent quality."
4.0,The collar is not right but the rest of the dress was perfect.
4.0,"Not made of the best material, but it holds my Mi Band 1 snugly in place."
4.0,"One start deducted because one of the pin is not straight, I had to bent it back and the plastic looks/feels cheaper than in the picture. But to be fair, the tool worked like charm on my wife's Omega Constellation watch."
4.0,Very cute but it's not very thick and is somewhat sew through. For the price it is good though
4.0,"This watch is almost perfect.  It is thin, comfortable, legible, accurate, durable, and stylish.<br /><br />It measures 9mm thick, which looks bigger on a ruler, but feels great on your wrist and is lighter than most other watches.<br /><br />The problems were that it did not ship with the box pictured; it came in a plastic bag in an envelope, and that the light on it only illuminates from one side, casting an dim and uneven light.  For this reason, I think that the [[ASIN:B000GB1RAU Casio Men's F105W-1A Illuminator Digital Watch]] is a better choice; it is the exact same, except it has a much better and more useful light and costs only $3 more.  Sadly, it's too late for me, since i've already bought this watch, but once I lose this one (which I'm sure I will before it ever breaks or runs out of batteries), I will definitely buy the other!<br /><br />Also, the button on the right side of the watch changes the clock from 12hr to 24hr in it's normal mode.  Sometimes, when my wrist is bent, it gets pressed unintentionally.  This isn't that much of a problem, but I don't think it needs to be that easy to change the time mode.<br /><br />One last note:  be best viewing angle for this watch is around 60 degrees.  There's a bit of unclarity if you look at it straight on at 90 degrees or if you slant it too low.  This may or may not be a problem for you, depending on your own personal habits, but I think it'd be better if there were wider viewing angles."
4.0,"After a crazy debacle trying to get them, the rings were well worth it. Comfortable, and a nice look, would recommend to someone looking for quality at an affordable price."
4.0,Love the material and the pattern. Well made and a great price. It is just a bit smaller than the normal size smalls that I normally wear. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,"I loved this scarf! I bought it a couple days ago, and have worn it twice! Super soft and comfy especially for the inexpensive price! It's warm, but not too warm! My only two complaints, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are that I'm unsure of how the hem will hold up over time, it already seems to be pretty loose, so who knows, and also, I keep my nails relatively long and squared off, and when I would go to arrange the scarf around my neck or to take it off or move it, my nails snag the fabric easily and loosen it, so I have to be more careful! Other than those two things, this was a great buy!"
4.0,"It is a beautiful scarf, it just smelled heavily of cooking odors"
4.0,"I ordered this for my step daughter and she loves it.<br /><br />The note card that comes with it is a nice personal touch.<br /><br />It’s exactly as described. Nice adjustable chain. My step daughter has worn it swimming and while showering and it has not discolored or tarnished at all.<br /><br />The chain and name plate are thin and fragile, but not a bad deal for $10.99. Just be gentle with it."
4.0,These sandals are true to size and are incredibly comfortable.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that the straps are a little to long and stick out a bit on the sides. Comfort comes first . . . looks second.
4.0,"This would be great for a party.  Lightweight, affordable and easy to customize"
4.0,This was a gift for my son. He loves them!
4.0,Cute and fits well. Material is thin-but they are leggings!
4.0,The dress was great for what i needed it for.  The fabric is kind of thin but not see through and it fit comfortably.
4.0,Very nice quality. Was a bit disappointing that the MSRP label was $9.95 cheaper than what I paid.
4.0,Strangely wasn’t green and blue... the print was a different color then just monochromatic green on blue but still a great shirt!
4.0,"Colonies are slightly off, but still a pretty scarf! Very comfortable!"
4.0,Ordered these for my daughter. Came quickly and are a great fit. The bottoms are not completely solid so wouldn't recommend for areas that might include sticks and rocks that might poke their feet but perfect for pools and water parks!
4.0,"Chain length works well with winter dress (collars, turtlenecks).  I find pendant a nice size, catches the eye, but not overbearing.  Picture respresents the product well.  I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,I would get the 18&#34; the second time around but I really love the necklace. It is very pretty though the chain is very small--if you don't like small chains this necklace isn't for you and by small I mean thin.
4.0,"I like this trainer, however it does take time to learn how to adjust it. I ordered a large and I wear a size 11 in jeans due to my thick thighs. I have ordered an xl in other waist trainers. I have no problems working out in it."
4.0,"It’s a great dress, well made and I love that it has pockets. I ordered a medium (I’m 5’4, 150lbs) it’s a little big. I’m hoping it will shrink a little when I wash it."
4.0,"Love this dress! The material is  light and this makes it super flowy. It is as see through as the picture shows, I wore it with a black shorts body suit under it and I was good to go. Just wish I ordered a size smaller as it was a little big on my arm area."
4.0,This mask is much more beautiful in person. Not flimsy and the design is gorgeous. The only thing I would change is the ribbons. I can't wait to wear it at our masquerade party.
4.0,It was a lil long but I still loved it.
4.0,The style of the shoe is very nice and the shoe is very comfortable.  The only small complaint is that it does not provide that great of arch support.
4.0,Love this dress but it is too big. It has lots of stretch.
4.0,I like the color and it fit me perfect tnx
4.0,I received a lot of compliments on this dress.  It is well made but is a bit tight in the chest/bust area.  Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"Kinda hard to get in, but very pretty"
4.0,I love Pandora and it is a wee bit cheaper I will be keeping my eye out for more of the special deals on Pandora
4.0,This is really very nice for such a low cost. I love it!
4.0,Nice piece of costume jewelry
4.0,This is actually super cute. Not sure how long it will hold up as I just got it and I haven't worn it yet but for $5 it's a fun costume piece that will jazz up a lot of outfits!
4.0,Much easier on the eyes than regular reading glasses
4.0,Very nice looking love the sparkle it has with it
4.0,Runs small.<br />Isnt very stretchable.
4.0,"These are closer to the old-fashioned rubber boots, rather than the more recent lighter plastic type. Sizing is a bit odd. Slightly short for the advertised size, and a little wide. I suppose you need to order a size up and wear thick socks if your foot is narrow. Feels good around the ankle, doesn't rub. It's great to be able to slip them on to go out into the wet grass, and to wear them for short periods of time."
4.0,Very Pretty Top. It is very thin. Feels like PJs fabric. Tag says dry clean recommended. 😱😱
4.0,"I really like this bag.<br /><br />I got in in the colour Black 3- the pebble leather. Oh, I also bought it out of the warehouse, used but in &#34;like new&#34; condition and only paid $28 for mine and it is flawless :)<br />  It is quite roomy, has dividers and pockets that make sense ( some just get in the way), and is well made. It can lie flat or expand to accommodate quite a lot of items, including a larger laptop. It IS real leather unlike a lot of products that claim to be and then aren't.<br />  Best of all the cross body removable, ADJUSTABLE messenger strap can expand to a very long length. I am tall and find most only reach my waist/natural hip. That is annoying, especially once a winter coat is worn under that strap. This one actually expands to a longer length than even I would want so I just adjust it to about mid expansion. It is also a wide strap so if you are hauling around a lot of stuff ( I feel like a pack mule sometimes) it doesn't cut into your neck and shoulder like some straps can.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because that said strap is not leather, it is nylon. This might be why it is so comfortable, but the nylon is shadow embossed with the brand name &#34;BOSTANTEN&#34; repeatedly along the length.<br />I didn't notice this in the pics. I really don't like logos on anything I own ( be they hi or low end).<br /><br /> [[ASIN:B01N444IWA BOSTANTEN Leather Briefcase Handbag Messenger Laptop Business Bags for Men Black]]"
4.0,"I got my first pair of compression socks when I was pregnant and 5 years later, I still wear them when traveling or when my legs start to ache or feel tired.  I bought this pair for my husband, hoping he could use them, but his calves are too large.  These are TIGHT, but they work great on my legs.  My husband wears a size 13 shoe and has very muscular calves, and he could not get these up all the way.  They do provide great compression, so I still think they are a good purchase; just be careful with sizing if you are larger or really muscular."
4.0,i purchase about 4-5 of these after realising the gold piece thats attached to hanf isnt completely close. i alway lose within few days. i owned a 14k as a kid and was stolen from me as a grown adult from my wrist in the Dominican republic when i was having surgery. woke with it off
4.0,Great for the price. Nice knit. Fits like a medium US
4.0,The robe was light enough that it wasn’t uncomfortable to wear for several hours
4.0,"It's beautiful dress.  More wrinkles than I thought though.  And it runs a size smaller than usual.  I will still keep it because I like it well enough, but I will order a larger size next time."
4.0,I ordered this outfit for an all black party and wanted something that made a statement and this dress really did. It was tight but not restricting. the material looked better in person than on the website because at first I wasn't sure if it would thick enough material.
4.0,"Really pretty sweater, but if you’re 5’3” or shorter, it’s almost to the floor."
4.0,"This suit is very well made and extremely comfortable.  I ordered a plus size.  Like most women, I dislike purchasing swimsuits and never ever thought I could buy one by mail that was as near perfect as this suit.  My only problem was the length; I'm just 5' and expected it to be extra long on me.  I shortened it by about 4&#34; and now it looks more like the suit in the photo."
4.0,Great retirement gift
4.0,Very nice but a little smaller than I thought.
4.0,"Wedgie prone, but otherwise ok for running."
4.0,It was just a bit long on me and not as flattering but it is a beautiful dress. Came right on time.
4.0,"I bought this necklace together with [[ASIN:B07C2TQPS8 Heart Abalone Earrings Colorful Paua Shell Pendant Jewelry Super Light Weight Earring For Women Girls]] so they make a pretty set. I think the quality could be better though, the chain is very thin."
4.0,"Earrings show a deep blue color. However, when it arrived, it was a light blue color. Does not stand out due to the color."
4.0,Boyfriend loves the belt
4.0,"If you are like me, you have several bands for your Apple Watch, to wear for different occasions or with different outfits. I needed someplace to store them and keep them dust free. This fit the bill. My only issue, is that the elastic loops to hold the watch bands should be a tad closer, to hold a smaller wrist size band, without undoing the clasp. Otherwise this works great."
4.0,"I found that the footloop style really holds the shirt more taut, and thus looks better. I still prefer the &#34;Y&#34; style though because being taller at 6'3&#34; it doesn't stretch far enough to prevent it being pushed up against my leg."
4.0,"These serve their purpose, now I’m not always misplacing my readers. They are a bit small on my face. It looks like I have a large kid’s glasses on. So if you have a big head (7.25 hat) or a big face I like do, they may be too small."
4.0,"Cool product, exactly what is advertised"
4.0,Beautiful top! Pairs nicely with slim fit pants or jeans or a pencil skirt!  Sleeves are pretty and helps make it unique. Really love this top. Would love to keep it but have to return because the cut is a bit too big for me
4.0,Beautiful shoes arrived Quickly however not true to size. My daughter normally wears a one. I ordered a one and it didn’t fit. I needed these shoes for an event she was going to attend. I had to rush out and buy another pair. Seller issued a refund. I do recommend however order a size up. Thank you!
4.0,nice travel bag
4.0,"I’m 5’6 and 185. I bought the large hoping it would fit. It fits perfectly and is nice and thick. It’s not sweaty hot but keeps you warm. My only complaint? The black looks slightly faded (but does have tags). For $9 though, I’ll still use it."
4.0,"Runs pretty small.  The 5x didn't fit me or my sister.  5'4"", 215 lbs.  In corsets I'm a 4x.  My sister goes between 5 and 6x in corsets and has a substantial rack on her.  (Perhaps an e cup or bigger).  It did close over my DD's but was felt too tight.  Customer service is great as well."
4.0,"These shorts are nice and thick material. Thought they would last but after a month of wearing, the button came off. Thankfully I was able to sew another one on."
4.0,"I purchased this dress for my Tauriel costume and I think it'll work really well! The front is a bit shorter than I thought, but I'm wearing it with leggings so it's not too bad. The material is VERY thin and much clingier than I expected. Definitely something to be aware of. You could see the divot of my belly button through the dress. Again, once I put on some leggings and stuff it wasn't too bad. Really satisifed with the sizing otherwise-- the sleeves fit comfortably and are a good length and the hood actually comes up over my head all the way. Got it about 4 days early, too!<br /><br />I typically wear about a size 12 or 14 and I ordered an XL. I was a bit worried because I usually would order an XXL for something I buy online but this fit comfortably! Not the most flattering pics but I thought it'd be helpful."
4.0,There are small and they get lost easily. Other than that they look well.
4.0,Would buy again only an extra large for a 6'2' GUY WHO ONLY WEIGHS 180 POUNDS
4.0,"Love these pants. Missing a star because some of the stitching is coming undone. It’s double stitched, so there aren’t any holes yet, just a random string every now and then."
4.0,It's pretty and it has a lovely chain.
4.0,Quality product with nice look.  Could be longer and wider to be more versatile.
4.0,I bought this case to protect a pair of reading glasses i keep in my backpack.  The case is sturdy and does a fine job.
4.0,"These pants give you that retro baggy pants vibe.  They are meant to be big and baggy (and they are), however the elasticated waist with the draw string make sure they stay firmly in place.  The light material also means they don't feel heavy or hot on you.  Nice pants, nice retro feel, but they do crease easily."
4.0,The look and the price
4.0,Boots are comfortable.  Really like the elastic in the sides.
4.0,Love this bag it’s the perfect size.
4.0,They are very nice.  Just a little too wide and stiff not as comfortable as my other one (diferent brand).  But they are not bad. Got my hubby a pair too he likes it . I guess because the rubber is not as flexible as my other ones (diferent brand) I find them a bit stiff. But I wore them they were not bad.
4.0,"Very cute this little dress with lemons! :) The fabric is smooth and nice to the skin, fiber content 95% cotton 5% spandex. Too bad it runs a little small, maybe these are junior sizes. I bought size XXL and the dress bust measures 42"". Length from HPS (high point shoulder) is 39"". I am 5'6"" bust 43"" weight 210 lbs. I might keep it though, I do hope I'll shed few more pounds soon. LOL! Price was only $16.99 --- I bought it last week during a Prime Day sale."
4.0,"Its best for medium faces, I do like the chin piece that helps the fit, the nose wire is ok, it would be better with a longer piece. The ear loops are comfortable and adjustable. Its a bit difficult to breathe through, as it's a tightly woven poplin type material."
4.0,"I purchased this dress for my Halloween costume (a jail bird). Sizing matched perfectly, as I got an XL and normally wear a 16 in dresses. The fabric is quite stretchy and the dress hits at about my knees (I'm 5'11). It's a smidge see-through if you're bending etc, so watch for that.<br />My real only complaint with it, is the pleats around the mid-section/where the belt is. They add quite a bit of extra poof in that area, which isn't the most flattering. I'm sure it's different on each body type, but it was the only downside to the dress for me. Otherwise it's lovely."
4.0,They are ok for what I need them for.
4.0,Other than this being somewhat large I think it fits beautifully.
4.0,"THIS TOOK FOREVER TO GET HERE, BUT IT WAS SHIPPED FROM OVERSEAS, AND IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. IT IS VERY CUTE. IT IS WELL MADE. I HAVE BEEN BUYING SEVERAL BRACELETS IN THIS STYLE TO FIT MY MOODS AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES SO FAR. IT SAYS FINAL FANTASY ON BACK, BUT I AM NOT SURE WHY THAT IS... IT IS A NICE SIZE, AND I AM SO GLAD IT FIT! NOW, THE ONLY CON IS THAT IT WAS SMOOSHED TOGETHER DURING SHIPPING SO THE INFINITY SYMBOL SEEMS TO GET LOST. I MAY REMOVE IT, BUT I AM NOT SURE.<br /><br /> SHIPPING WAS FAST ENOUGH AND THEY HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE MY OWN AND I HOPE IT HELPS. I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT!.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34; below where it says &#34;Was this review helpful to you?&#34;"
4.0,Great fitting dress. The red was a bit brighter than I expected. Wore to a fall wedding
4.0,"Very nice and slim, doesn't seem to be as schock absorbent as advertised."
4.0,pretty color but it ran a little tight..
4.0,"Happy with product, happy with purchase."
4.0,Really comfy and hugs your curves. Love it
4.0,"I teach science, so I love to collect nerdy tops. This works perfectly for my chapters on Marine Bio. The fabric is so comfy and soft. My only problem is that I am petite and the size is long from shoulder to bust and I can not wear it without something socially acceptable underneath."
4.0,"The artwork on it is beautiful and matches the picture, but its alot thinner then i expected and super tight on my head its like child size."
4.0,They were just as expected and I loved them as they are comfortable and cool at this time of year.  Good quality
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): This is a fun piece of costume jewelry.  It is much larger than I expected.  Definitely a stand-out piece.  The green is bright and the faux diamonds are sparkly.
4.0,Awesome dress! It's fun yet great for either an event or professional setting. The button loops need to be tightened to ensure the buttons stay closed. Other than that it's a great buy!
4.0,I have never had a pair of no shoes that really worked.  These are great.  My only complaint t is that I am a size 11 and these are rather snug.
4.0,"Purchased as a gift for my Papa, ended up returning. Item was larger than expected. Was a nice quality shirt. Soft & well made. Plan on purchasing in a smaller size. Has a nice Paisley print, not overly bright or too busy. He normally wears a large, when he tried it on the sleeves almost hit his knuckles. Other than the size he really liked the shirt."
4.0,"I labeled this dress, &#34;fit as expected&#34; because I was skeptical about how the medium would fit me, but based on other reviewers talking about fit and stretch, decided to go for it. Unfortunately my instincts were right, and although I could get into a medium, it was uncomfortably tight. In fact, I had a hard time getting into it. It's too bad, because it looks kind of sexy since it's holding everything in. I'm 5'3&#34; @ 156 lbs, and measure 36D-33-43. The smocking in back helped it fit, without it there would be no way. The seems that are probably meant to go around each breast were nowhere near their intended destination. I wasn't thrilled with the material. It seems stiff and thin. The dress isn't lined, so underneath the print is muted. However, the print itself was pretty and vibrant, and I do wonder what a large would look like on me. 🤔"
4.0,The band fit very good. But it’s not as flexible as the original.
4.0,I wanted  it to work but way to small
4.0,"I got these boots for my husband that works outdoors in all weather and wanted a good pair of durable boots. He had tried a variety of mid-price boots before, non of them lasted more than a year. So reading the reviews about the Dr. Marteens, he felt comfortable paying about $50 extra dollars than he normally would on boots.<br />He wears a 10.5 US size and because these don’t come in half sizes he figured he would need to size up to accommodate his socks and all. Wrong! The 11 he first ordered were huge. Sent them back, got the 10 and they fit perfectly.<br />He’s been wearing them for a few months now. The boots are comfortable, durable, truly waterproof. He wears them 11+ hours a day and they don’t hurt his feet. Worth every penny.<br />I did take away a star because of the sole threads. There are very deep grooves that trap a lot of dirt, more so than other work boots he’s had. So, if you work in a muddy environment, it might not be as easy to get your boots cleaned at the end of the day, he has had to spray the sole with the garden hose a few times and take the boots off in the garage. Other than that, great boot, seems like it will last him a while."
4.0,"Fabric: I probably would not wear it with heels the way the model is wearing it, but I could imagine dressing it up a little bit. There's no question about it -- the dress is SUPER stretchy, but it's soft.<br /><br />Color: I purchased the green and it looks slightly darker in person than I had imagined, but it's perfect. I'm still tempted to order the Burgundy as well if the colors on this are as rich as they are.<br /><br />Styling: The pockets are much appreciated. Despite being a little big (5' 5&#34;, 148 lb, 34 FF), it's a very comfortable dress. I recommend styling it with a slim belt if you feel like it's too loose in the chest."
4.0,"I bought these sheepskin inserts to put inside of some slippers that are a bit too big for me.  I ordered one size up from my normal shoe size.  They fit nicely, are super comfy and i like the thickness. My only complaint is the placement of the tag.  I don't wear socks with my slippers and i can feel the tag on my heels.  I find it a bit annoying so I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5.  I've been using these inserts for a few weeks now and they have definitely flattened out, but that's to be expected with sheepskin.  I tested these inserts in a pair of boots that hurt my feet due to the footbed being really hard (but the boots are super cute)....and...it was like heaven on my feet!  I will be ordering another pair to use in these boots!"
4.0,"Don't let the product description mislead you. This will not work for a tie pin/tack. The detail of the jet is great. If a man wore the on a lapel it would look good. Just not good for a tie, too big."
4.0,"I bought the XS nude girdle for use in getting into vintage skirts and dresses that have a smaller waist measurement than mine.<br />I am a 24 waist and it's VERY hard to find a girdle to cinch you in at that size, but this one gets me down comfortably to a 22 waist and I can still breathe so I would say this girdle definitely works for smaller sizes. I thought it was a little tight around the thigh area, but I am a 36-38 hip which might be larger than the girdle is supposed to contain? No wedgies though, so that's a real plus.<br />The only issue one might experience is in the length of the girdle.<br />I have a short torso and it only went up to my waist, not as high up as shown in the picture so if you have a long torso, this one might not be the one for you, but I have no complaints!<br />Now I want the black one... :-)"
4.0,Looked great under a black dress shirt.  Had to exchange L for an XL since it was a tad too tight once buttoned in the front.
4.0,It fit me a bit to small. Perfect length. The quality of the material is very good.
4.0,"These were adorable and just what my child wanted but they were slightly too large for him. He wears a size 1.5/2 in boys and these had about 1/2&#34; of space in the toes. One thing to note, my child has a slim foot. If your child (or you) have a chunkier foot it may fit better.<br /><br />The quality seemed good but the insole did seem to slip around and was not attached at all. These water shoes may carry you through one or two water and sun filled summers but they are not going to last you years and years... for the price I don't think any of us expect that right? We returned these and ordered a different pair due to the fit but would have kept them if they did fit."
4.0,"The large is too small for my 16# morkiepoo. It’s super cute, but feels like it would tear easily. I do wish They made it larger."
4.0,"I love this wristlet. I bought this to downsize . I've always carried large tote bags with a bunch of unnecessary items and wanted something I can just Carry in the store easily.  I do wish I would have read the reviews better since I thought this was big enough to carry an iPhone 6, which it is not. I don't see how it would carry any phone at all. So due to that I only give it 4 stars."
4.0,"I have a couple of these to wear around the house during the warmer months so I can be comfortable but still look somewhat presentable. I personally wouldn't wear it &#34;out,&#34; but I did run over to a friends to drop something off and she commented on how cute I looked.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the plastic along the shoulder seams is really pokey and annoying, but I just took some nail scissors and trimmed anything not directly under a stich and that seemed to do the trick."
4.0,"I bought these for my husband. It's a set if 3 that came in a nice box. Three different colors to choose from. My husband works out in the oil field and can't wear any metal jewelry. At one point he would take his wedding band off, leave it in his truck when he went to work, then put it back on on his way home from work. I didn't really like the idea of him leaving jewelry in his vehicle, especially something so sentimental. For some time he just wore it to work anyway, he had to sign a waiver that if anything happens it wasn't their fault. He could easily get the ring hung up on something and loose his finger, a risk he was willing to take. Eventually the ring wore down and began to Crack from all his strenuous work. We had it re-shanked. Now it sits in the jewelry box again needing re-shanked from continuing to wear it. These rings seemed like a perfect option for him. The weren't metal, so no risk in hurting himself. No waiver to sign, and no ruining his priceless jewelry. The first one he wore was the gunmetal colored one. It was shiny and looked almost like the real deal. It looked nice on his finger but after 2 days the (painted?) finish on the outside wore off. So he put on the grey band. That one seems solid colored all the way through. He has been wearing that one ever since with no fading or anything. It doesn't pinch and because it's silicone it flexes with whatever he has to be doing at work. Now he can still wear his symbol of love with no risk. I really don't know how long this will last, hopefully awhile, either way nothing can replace a finger.<br /><br />I recieved this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

4.0,Love this beanie however a week after I started wearing it the knitting is coming apart at the back - very dissapointed however for the price I cant complain
4.0,Quality is superb...very pretty
4.0,"Good value for the price.  If I was a person that could keep track of my glasses I would have spent more for better quality.  These look good and are of acceptable quality, for the price.  If you are expecting Ray-bans, these are no where near that quality, but again, the price is the difference.  They are good enough for me, very inexpensive, and for someone like me who loses a pair of glasses once a month, price is a huge issue."
4.0,"A lot of board shorts typically have a more athletic fit with a less baggy look than these. I prefer the slimmer silhouette, but these are OK standard swim trunks with a liner. Nothing remarkable. They look fine."
4.0,"Material is a bit thinner than I expected,, but still nice and warm."
4.0,i was expecting more of a cotton material but its more polyester. it fits well and well worth the price
4.0,"Cute little dress. I was hoping to get a picture, but she gets it dirty before I get a chance. It seems to be a pretty comfortable material, moves very easy with her as she goes ninety to nothing most days. I normally do not order animal prints, but something about the grey and black and the simplicity of the little cats is just too cute with a pair of black boots!"
4.0,A little snug you'll have to stretch them out a bit so the clasp won't be uncomfy. Great design.
4.0,"Super soft and sretchy. Fits well, not too tight. (I have wide feet 8 - 8 1/2 for size reference) Reason I'm giving 4 star, they do not have actual silicone grips on the back. Only wore them once, so far so good. And, when I received them they smelled soo good. Like fresh washed laundry!"
4.0,"I wear a10.5 or 11 so I bought 11s. They are very snug, I probably would prefer 12s. Otherwise they seem quite warm and comfy so far."
4.0,My son loves all but the gray. Great for school!!
4.0,"They fit well and are comfortable, I do wish the fabric was softer but it’s not too stiff."
4.0,Love the shirt. Haven’t actually worn it yet my husband will be home for Christmas and I plan to wear it when I pick him up from Boot camp 😍
4.0,these are soooooo awesome! they just add that extra sass to your rave outfit! I'm 5'3&#34; so the shorter length was perfect for me...I feel like the longer ones would be too much and drag across the floor.
4.0,"Quality is on par with the value. Colors are nice, but these are tighter than normal medium. I am a 36B with a 32 waist and they are snug."
4.0,kind of heavy
4.0,"I have a 25-26 inch waist and ordered the size S. I normally wear a size 2 in jeans. The legs fit really well, but the waist is tight. I’ll have to stretch it out a bit so it doesn’t squeeze so much. A size small is supposed to fit a size 2-4, but a size 4 might want to order up a size."
4.0,"The necklaces were pretty. I think there could have been a few more shells on one of them, but they were pretty shiny.<br /><br />I’m not sure if the pearl is real, but it’s nice enough looking that I don’t know either way.<br /><br />My daughter is into the VSCO stuff, and so this apparently passes with her friends for that look. Decent price too."
4.0,"Perfect size for my taste, nice looking purse a lot of space love it"
4.0,"had some crooked metal parts on it and one of the stones fell out during deliver, but i just glued it and it worked fine for prom."
4.0,Love this ring!!! The pain from my wedding rings while lifting was beginning to become a problem! The Wodbottom ring has helped greatly!! No more pain and I still get to where a symbol of my marriage while I lift!! It fits true to size and is extremely comfortable!!! It is made very well and you really can't beat the price! Part of me wishes it was a tiny bit thinner as a women's band... But that is simply my esthetic preference.<br />Overall a really great product!
4.0,Nice and comfy sunday look
4.0,"Moyabo Women's Halter Neck Sleeveless Floral Summer Casual Swing Sundress with Pockets<br />Size Medium - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. The medium fits GREAT!<br /><br />There is a bit of hard plastic at the waistline where the top meets the bottom of the dress. Sometimes this can be scratchy on your skin but this dress is very comfortable and doesn't irritate! The dress has pockets! Super cute and very comfortable! Well made! I really like how it looks like a skirt and top. Can be dressed up for a special occasion or just wear with sandals or tennis shoes for a casual look. 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,"I have to change my first feedback not because of the shirt, but because of the quality of care that I received from the company.  I didn't like the shirt and I tried my best to give constructive criticism so that they can do better.  The shirt on the model was very cute design, but the material was wrong and was inexpensive.  So was the cut and the sewing.  With better material and better seamstress, this top could be wonderful.  The company took the advise and refunded me the balance without the shipping.  I didn't ship it back but gave it to a thrift shop.  This is a wonderful company who want to learn from their mistakes and get out better products."
4.0,5'1 125lb 34B. Bought a medium<br />Like the colors. Usually wear a small but wanted a little loose. T-shirt thin.<br />4 stars because I don't like the elastic ban on the waist. Keeps riding up
4.0,"This dress fit well and looked great! It was very soft and comfy. The only thing is that I did have to pin the sides of the chest area as they gaped outward awkwardly. I am a 32D for reference, 5’0, 165lbs and bought a medium."
4.0,The tank fits great just wish it was alittle more longer
4.0,Gloves were nice but they need to come in a box  not the cheap plastic bag
4.0,The only thing that I don't like about the suit is the white lining. The lining should be black.
4.0,"Nice shirt can dress up<br />A skirt, jeans, or pants"
4.0,"Adorable, but I normally wear mediums and this fit A bit big."
4.0,"These are adorable and fit well. So cute and I have found several uses for them, the only issue I have found is that they are very delicate and you have to be careful with them."
4.0,"XL Dress almost true to size. It was a bit long in the sleeves and length (right up to knee), so I took it to my seamstress and she altered the dress very easy. I also had her cut a lower V neck in the front, because it was a bit to snug in the neck. I worked the dress to a wedding and I received so many compliments on this dress. I would highly recommend ordering a slightly larger size and you can always alter to your liking. The material is very easy to work with. Loved the pattern!! I will definitely be wearing this dress again!"
4.0,The product runs a little shorted than advertised.
4.0,fit prefect
4.0,Like and purchased this shirt because of its roominess.  Not disappointed!
4.0,Looked great with a maxi skirt I also purchased off Amazon. Wish it was a smidge longer but received as shown. Wore a crop black tank underneath.
4.0,The Sherpa lining is thicker and softer than most others. That gives a snug fit and better warmth.
4.0,Light weight and good coverage. The color shown here looks like light blue but its actually more aqua color.
4.0,Nice!!! Would buy again!!!
4.0,My daughter loves this watch.  It is very slim and comfortable.  After reading one of the previous reviews we were able to adjust the band just fine.  Hope it lasts because she loves it.
4.0,"little smaller than expected, but okay for the price"
4.0,"Its a beautiful dress, sequins are staying on, the fit is a little weird, not made for curves"
4.0,very comfortable. Perfect for summer wear.
4.0,For the price it was very well made and the colors are beautiful. I would have paid more to have inside thicker therefore warmer in winter.
4.0,These sunglasses definitely get the job done for everyday driving. They are comfortable and large enough to cover your full field of view. I like the bridge of the nose subtle non slip material. The frames curve slightly but not excessively. The frames seem slightly large to fit both men and women which could be an issue depending on head type. They work well for me. Great for the price.
4.0,Very cute. Little support provided if you have a bigger bust.  The nipple is exposed through the fabric so I wouldn’t suggest wearing this out. For the cost though it’s very cute!
4.0,"For the price, are you kidding? Love this watch. Waterproof. On my 2nd. 1st lasted a little over a year. Battery replacement did not fix. Will buy another one when this one does. The light does suck."
4.0,Cute shirt & fits nicely. Good purchase.
4.0,"Fast delivery, products as described only complaint is the hard time I've has locking the ring in my septum, and the gold cocorina has started loosing it's color after wearing for some time."
4.0,It was okay. I guess I expected more. It looked a bit dull so that disappointed me.
4.0,"Great quality, durable fabric. 5 year old can carry it just fine, slightly big for her but she will grow into it. Great for soccer and dance!"
4.0,"Great breathable and squatproof, great compression and high waisted!  A little bit of rolling on the waist is the only reason not 5 stars"
4.0,"I ordered this thinking it would be a larger scarf - but it's a standard size neck scarf. Good quality, beautiful color."
4.0,"Nice product, looks good.  good quality. Great value for its price"
4.0,"Emblem was not embroidered as I was hoping for, but will be fine."
4.0,"I ordered this bathing suit to wear to the beach in a few weeks.  I definitely agree with the other reviews on this product.  I am normally a medium and ordered this in a XXL.  It fits well.  I really like the top and how it hides the front of my belly.  I'm not a big fan of the string ties holding the bottoms together, but it does fit good.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted rate to give my honest opinion on the product.  I would recommend it to my friends but would definitely tell them to order it in three sizes larger than you would normally wear."
4.0,The summer dress is beautiful and fits perfect! I will order again
4.0,helped during hot humid weather
4.0,"Beautiful pair of harem pants, I love how they lay and the patterns. Very stylish and super comfortable. They were a bit tight on my waist, mainly because of the higher waist, but definitely worth it. I will do business again"
4.0,excellant value and service
4.0,The gloves were good just a little to thick for working gloves
4.0,"This is a beautifully made dress.  The lace is heavy enough to stand up to wear and laundry.  The workmanship shows good attention to detail, the facing around the neck is neatly finished, the lining is long enough, the zipper is a good quality and length works well.<br /><br />This could be my new favorite dress if not for thing - it is at least two sizes too small.  I had carefully measured myself and checked the size chart before I order.  In theory this dress should fit me with a little room to spare, particularly around the hips.  I went to put it on and could barely get it over my behind even though it wasn't zipped.  This Large which should fit a 10 to 12 would probably work out great for a 4."
4.0,"This is very comfy and soft set of PJs.  Unfortunately they run a little to small for the size so, I recommend ordering a size up or refer to the size chart.  I do not see why you can't wear these outside of the house.  It looks like a normal short set as it is not see through or revealing."
4.0,"I really like these scarves, they are really long and wide, the problem with my order was that it took too long to get there and the seller only sent half my order after I have asked to double check to send my complete order, the seller was so difficult to contact and understand my problem that after 6 or 7 emails I had to make a claim through Amazon and Amazon as usual did an excellent job helping me with this really fast.  As for the product it is a beautiful scarf, very light and you could wear it with almost anything since they are really trendy, try looking for other sellers, if you have a Prime membership use the sellers that have them for $6 or something which is still a great deal, I have nothing against this seller but I made another purchase at the same time for other product from the same seller and didn't get what I paid for so looking for other buying options would be my advise."
4.0,Cute shirt. I'm in between L and XL because of my bust and I could of gone with a L for this one. :)
4.0,Great looking. A lot of compliments. They give some glare protection. I would like to have more.
4.0,These earring are nice and what I expected for what I paid. The only thing is the silicon ones aren’t great. They have rough edges and aren’t cut perfect other then that they seem great!
4.0,I love the design! It's bright and hasn't faded! The only flaw that I noticed was that it was a bit rounder than I had expected. It fits a bit awkwardly on my head but it's still cute!
4.0,"Was not the same as in the picture but I still like the chain,perfect for our 80s/90s event coming up."
4.0,"This is my revised review, i initially gave this product a poor rating due to the t shirt design which actually is as stated by vendor and i failed to read that .So overall it is a quality product as described. The fit is great and the material is very soft and comfortable. The customer service has been very good and they offered to refund without hesitation but I decided to keep the shirt , i like it , just dont really dig the shirt style but thats just me and im ok with now that i know its not flawed."
4.0,"Soft and flexible, warm and functional! I like these, they don't ""fight"" for space with the sleeves of my jacket. They wash easily too (would like to suggest using a twist tie so they don't get separated/lost from each other.)"
4.0,"I had to adjust with pliers to fit my fingers, but they are as described. Good quality. I thought there were little circles, not hearts, not complaining though. Also slightly wish they were more pointy, I guess I could just get a file. If you are planning on getting more than one, you should know that they are exactly the same and kinda look weird together as I bought two."
4.0,Super cute and comfortable!<br />5”4 120lbs - dress size bought - small.<br />Material snags easy. Keep away from the Velcro on your kids shoes and don’t lean on cement lol
4.0,Nice for ice skating concert.
4.0,Pretty but didn't fit well.
4.0,"light, very forgiving, great arm length. Hemline is in bit of a strange place-- could be slightly longer or shorter but as-is quite boxy and not quite long enough for long vest or sweater"
4.0,"I would like to give it 5 stars because it fit perfectly and looked great. Unfortunately, even though the fabric is nice and heavy, the stitching is pretty shoddy. It also arrives stuffed inside a tiny bag that was folded like a magazine in my mailbox. This leads to ridiculous wrinkles that were quite difficult to get out and also was not pleasing to the eye. The black was not blackest black, but rather a soft black. I am scared to wash it."
4.0,"It has good, well wide for round face sunscreen, I like."
4.0,"Lovely, if a bit smaller than I had hoped."
4.0,"I like this, use with everything."
4.0,"I hated showing my cleavage so this is perfect. Fits well, high neck. The material is as expected and no it is not as thin as others says."
4.0,Lightweight but warm. Size medium fit well (I'm an 8) but at 5'3&#34; and the front points are at my knee - I would say probable too long for anyone shorter.
4.0,"The piece is beautiful. The chain is not very long, but it still fits nicely. Very glad I made this purchase!"
4.0,Color is great deep green. This item took a while to arrive but other than that the size and fit were good.
4.0,Way bigger than I was expecting (although I know it’s supposed to be oversized). Nothing a little bit of fashion tape won’t fix. Otherwise I’m in love.
4.0,"Love it! This is a head turning skirt and I’m about to order another one . I just wish it was more fitted at the bottom, like a mermaid fit."
4.0,"I absolutely love this piece of hardware. I can wear it all day w/o discomfort. Twisting it in my PA was a bit different, but it went in just fine. It's even more difficult to urinate standing w/ this ring in as opposed to a regular horseshoe ring. If jostled about, the ball can slip through my urethra pretty easily. I wish there were an option for larger ball ends"
4.0,"I definitely love it. I ordered for my baby first bday photo shoot. I don't regret I bought it at all, looks cute, just like the pics, the legs warmer are a little big and too thick but beside that it's perfect!"
4.0,"After just one wash, the black looked dingy. It is still good for the price and looks great on."
4.0,"I bought this as a sort of all-in-one for cash, cards, passport, boarding passes and misc bus/train tickets. I wanted it to fit boarding passes specifically because we had 8 flights in a 2 week period and I wanted to stay organized and be able to keep my passes handy. It worked well enough for our vacation although I was a tiny bit disappointed that it wasn't tall enough to fit my boarding passes in the designated spot. That being said, I'm continuing to use this after our vacation because as a normal everyday wallet, it's freaking adorable, and it seems to be well made. I LOVE the yellow color - it's a bit lighter and softer than the picture shows, but it's beautiful"
4.0,"I am 5'8, 160lbs and a 36D. I ordered a medium because I wanted a more snug and compression fit. It worked. Normally with things like this, I sometimes order up because of how tight I've seen people write in comments. I decided to take the risk and order the medium instead of the large, and I believe I made the right choice, but order your size or a size up for a looser fit. It's all in how you want it to fit."
4.0,The shirt is great. It’s nice and thick. Should have a long life. Took twice as long as they said to receive it.
4.0,This is my second pair i bought they are really good for the price !! I also have a wide face and they fit good on my Face.
4.0,"its super cute, it doesnt really look like geto but its stull nice"
4.0,"I ordered in small, if they had XSmall I would order.  It's very cute but small is more like a med. I kept to use under a button sweater."
4.0,"Looks awesome, fits well, and I really am enjoying the new band. A bit stiff out of the box and there seems to be a brownish hue to the ""black"" band, but my wife says I am color blind so who knows."
4.0,The lace doesn't like to lay flat... otherwise a nice piece
4.0,"The provided pins are too short, so anytime the band is manipulated in an awkward manner (which it will be during normal use) the band unclips. I was able to resolve the issue by using the original pins in the old band. They are longer and thicker. You’ll need to jam the pin in to get it all the way through though. The band itself is constructed fine. 3.5/5"
4.0,"The blue color does not look the way that it looks online, it looks like a bright cheap blue instead of the deep true blue that is shown"
4.0,"It's a little bit longer not unless you wear a high heeled shoes. Overall, it's a great buy for formal parties.  I bought this item for a discounted rate in exchange of my unbiased review."
4.0,"For transparency's sake, it seems prudent to admit that I am in no way a hat person. Actually, I kind of hate them. Always have. And I'm from Buffalo, NY, notorious winter capital of the Northeast, so imagine all the mornings my poor mother spent jamming knitwear on my head before I went out to wait for the schoolbus in the snow, shouting at me through the front window when I threw the hats into the yard, her voice lost to the relentless, driving wind. Later in life I'd decide headwear of any kind makes me look short (shut up; it's legit), and the cycle continued.<br /><br />However, I shaved my head on a feminist whim a couple weeks ago, and I don't regret any part of it except not preparing for just. how. cold. my head would be. My hair must've been made out of fiberglass or something, because without it there for insulation I've been shivering like a chihuahua. A bald chihuahua. A week in and my lifetime hat boycott went down the drain (and probably got stuck in that clump of hair I mistakenly assumed wouldn't get caught just past the trap). Apparently proving your worth as a human being isn't dependent upon patriarchal beauty standards doesn't keep you warm.<br /><br />Since I'm a hat n00b, I just searched for &#34;knit hat.&#34; Obviously the results numbered in the zillions, so I just picked the first one that cost less than $15 and wasn't hideous—two days later I was as warm and toasty as I'd been with a full head of cozy curls. In other words, this hat does its job. It's doing its job right now, actually, saving me from the scalp hypothermia I'd otherwise be battling in my 68-degree house. Honestly, I'm still not entirely sold on the concept. I got two additional knit caps in addition to this one—y'know, for variety—both from different companies, with different material and different linings, but the result is the same: my head is warm at the expense of its freedom. Eventually my scalp gets itchy and claustrophobic, likely due to a mix of my own neuroses and having very little hair to provide a buffer for my bare, never-been-exposed-to-anything-before skin. Maybe I'm just not used to wearing something on my head.<br /><br />Either way, none of the hats are at fault. They're decent, hardworking hats. This one in particular has an excellent fleecy lining that feels like you're pulling a lamb onto your head, which feels a lot nicer than it sounds, I promise. The pattern on the knitted shell adds toughness in both look and feel, adding just enough flair to ensure you'll have a different hat than everyone else in the room without having the ugliest hat in the room. I can't speak on the other color options, but the charcoal grey I chose is the perfect dark dove shade to compliment my Goth Lite wardrobe.<br /><br />My only issue is with the shape, which when worn creates two points on my head that look like a lowkey attempt at wearing a cat costume in public. Luckily it's roomy enough to allow for some reshaping at the back, but if you have a large skull you might want to carefully consider how concerned you are with people thinking you're storing a book under your hat."
4.0,Bought this for a trip coming up. Price was reasonable and fits true to size-unlike others like this! Fabric is thin and does wrinkle easily
4.0,"I love this key ring and would give it five stars if I had received it in the color I ordered (rose gold). I instead received what I believe is the champagne gold, which I also like. However, it isn't what I ordered. I now see that it isn't offered in rose gold anymore so hopefully they have fixed the problem and future customers will receive the colors they prefer.<br /><br />Besides the color switch, this key ring is exactly what I wanted. When I go to work, I only bring my car key and my phone. I can easily fit my phone in my pocket but my car key is harder to carry. No matter where I put it, I worried that it would either fall out or poke me. With this key ring, I can just attach my car key to my belt loop and not have to worry about losing it or being poked by it. At the end of my shift, I can simply clip this ring back onto my main key ring and keep all my keys together.<br /><br />I'm impressed by the quality of this key ring, especially with its low price. The clip is very strong; I expect it to last for a long, long time. The material is fraying a tiny bit but that doesn't really bother me. Overall, the key ring is well made and doesn't look cheap. I'm happy with my purchase, although I would have been happier if I had received the correct color.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I could have swore I purchased a different brand, but no matter.  The material is great, so soft, nervier wrinkles.  The fit is perfect.  The length is right at the ankle and I am 5’9”.  So it’s perfect.<br />My only drawback on these pants would be the pockets.  They are odd.  They are not placed well or the shape is wrong.  They do buckle a bit which I do not like.  I am not a fan of pockets any way and these are just not flattering.  I am a seamstress as well and I will figure out what is wrong and correct it. Other than that the pant fit well."
4.0,"I wanted a dainty necklace for everyday wear but this is perhaps almost too thin, I've worn it a few weeks and I do love the look of it but I fear this isn't going to last long before snagging on something and breaking."
4.0,Fits well but I don't know if rhe quality will keep
4.0,"The shirt fits well and is pretty comfortable as well, but as a workout shirt, feels like it doesn't quite breath enough and the material has little give to it. Still, it definitely isn't a bad choice and feels like it would be durable for those with a rougher use in mind for it."
4.0,"As the years go by it's getting harder and harder to read the Garmin, and surprisingly almost no one makes a reader in a photochromic lens for the US market unless you go custom and pay over $350.  I was shocked to find these for about 1/6 of what I would have to pay to get a pair of Oakleys made custom for this purpose.  The style is nothing to write home about, but they WORK.  They are light and clear in the early morning and evening, and get nice and dark on sunny days.  No need to change lenses.  The readers are placed perfectly for me to see the Garmin when I'm on the hoods or in the drops.  And I save $300-ish to spend on kit.<br /><br />While I would prefer to have Oakley or Roka frames and lenses with bifocal capability, these more than fit the bill.  The only drawback (besides conservative styling) is that there are no vent holes to help deter fogging.  On a less than a handful of cold mornings over the last year, while stopped, I've noticed they begin to fog up.  So I just tuck them in my helmet until I'm moving again, and the fog dissipates.  It happens so infrequently it is far outweighed by the versatility of the photochromic lens and the ability to read the computer with the bifocal reader.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm surprised lens options like this"
4.0,"Cheap material, but okay for the price."
4.0,I have to take in the sleeves because the amount of volume it creates makes me look 2x my size however the body fits loose n fine
4.0,Its alil big but I'm a sucka for red so I just couldn't pass it up
4.0,Perfect for lounging after a shower.  Nice weight. Absorbant.
4.0,"These feel true to size, good quality, although a little on the thick side. Would recommend for fall, warm winter and beginning of spring maybe. Not for warmer seasons - your child will sweat."
4.0,It was super cute and I got lots of compliments! Fit as expected.
4.0,"these earrings are a great gift , and along with the sterling silver Oval Blue Sapphire and CZ Princess Diana/ Kate Middleton Pendant with Chain , they match perfectly. She absolutely loves them."
4.0,Nice sweater necklace. It kinda grabs though.
4.0,"Sharp 👀 chain. Will hold only bout 4 keys, with larger vehicle key sometimes getting in way."
4.0,A nice idea for keeping your glasses safe.
4.0,"Love this band, my only complaint is it slides a bit."
4.0,great cap. keeps me warm at night while at work and it helps that it is all plain and without any writing to distract other people
4.0,"Darling little bag for semi-formal to formal occasions! I plant use it for my daughter's morning wedding this summer.  Large enough for the necessities (wallet, phone, lipstick & tissues). It looks exactly like the picture, except the metallic trim is true silver, not the gold tint it appears to be. beautiful plum color and fabric looks like good quality, not cheap."
4.0,"These hats were so cute, all the kids at my daughter's birthday tea party loved them! They seem a little flimsy for the price, but have survived being played with better than I would have expected, as so far only the bands are coming off of the ones we kept."
4.0,Really like the fit good quality material A + for the extra room in the pouch<br />laundry up nicely with a little shrinkage
4.0,Love this top!<br />Comfy and cute!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, however the top part of the dress was too big (granted I don't have much going on in the upper area) had to return. Would fit beautiful on anyone with larger bust."
4.0,"These are nice items, the only con is that the rubber tubing that slides on the the earpieces of your glasses are a bit small. I would imagine some glasses would have earpiece ends that are too big."
4.0,"Love tha top, its beautiful. Bought several colors. But back button came off on all of them but it looks fine without it so i dont care, could easily replace button anyways but beautiful top"
4.0,Liked the pockets
4.0,Have some other styles by coobie. Very comfortable bras. I especially like the lace on this one. Although I ordered the same size as before this one is a bit tighter then previous ones.
4.0,I have only used these about 4 or 5 times for showering at the gym but have not had any issues. My shoe size is 9.5 so I got a size 9 sandal and they fit comfortably.
4.0,"Super quality product.  Well made, nice packaging.  The magnified section was just a little too low for me.  I needed it straight on with no magnification above.  Nothing wrong with these glasses.  I'm sure they would work well for someone who needed to have magnification just when looking down."
4.0,Love the band but hard to remove links
4.0,Fabric is thicker than expected. Not the best for summer days. Maybe summer nights.
4.0,My regular size is 6. I ordered 8. It is too small :((
4.0,"The Good: This wallet has many divisions to accommodate a number of credit cards as well as three visible compartments needed for cards you do not want to remove such as driver's license.  I like the separate internal snap which secures those cards that you do not frequently access.  Also there is a snapped pocket for change.<br /><br />The Bad: Would have given the product 5 stars except that when it came it had an odd odor.  It was a mixture of a leather smell, which I like, with a musty smell similar to old books in a dank basement.  But with the passage of a few days the smell has considerably lessened.  I am giving it a week.  Otherwise it is destined to be returned.  Will update review if it is returned."
4.0,"Love it, super cute. Reason I gave 4 star, I don't like how plasticky it looks in the back. I wish it was covered or the same red color of the heart."
4.0,"Very nice , fit  perfect."
4.0,I was so excited when I got it. However it’s definitely not good on breezy day. It flew off my head when I was walk outside. Just took a little wind.
4.0,Beware though most rings in this bulk are like a size 7 .. maybe six.. i love them color wise and feel wise!!
4.0,I will be buying more 👍🏽😊
4.0,This is a very cute product but they are a bit fragile.  I used them for making keychains and out of the 100 I broke maybe 5 to 7 of them with not a lot of force.
4.0,"Adjustable ear loops make this attractive mask a winner! Others have no adjustment and usually suck! This one is nice.  Does it stop Covid? Probably not, but helps."
4.0,"I personally think this would make a great gift for a child or someone who would like to wear a pendant reminding them of their faith, but not risk damaging or loosing an expensive piece of jewelry.  It has a decent weight to it and looks nice. Only time will tell if it will loose any plating or color.  As to if or when this will happen or not, I don't know yet as we've only had this about a week.  So far, so good.  I'm sure it'll be the right amount of bling bling for that person you know who likes these things ;)<br /><br />The 15 year old daughter says:<br />This gold plated cross necklace is well fitting and is not at all that heavy when worn. The clasp is easy to work. The chain is about 24 in. long. The necklace comes with a velvet bag to keep it it. I like this necklace and think this would be a great gift for someone in the family or friends that would like this item.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product for my honest unbiased review."
4.0,It is cute. I like it. I still need to fix the net though coz it’s flattened. Its not curving to my face yet. I’m glad I have more time to mess with it.😉👍🏼😊
4.0,"The only reason why it didn’t get five stars is because the zipper on the dress is cheap. When I first zipped it up, it immediately created a hole so there were gaps. I ended up removing the zipper, sewed it up a couple inches and adding a button to the top to make it a key hole back and absolutely loved it even more! Besides the zipper malfunction, this dress is cute and sexy. I just suggest buying double sided tape to help keep the dress down. The price is worth it, and it has pockets!"
4.0,"It's a nice skirt but even I ordered size small, it's too big."
4.0,I trusted the reviews and went with smaller sizes. Got a Small and Extra small. (I usually wear Medium) 5'4&#34; 130lb 34DD and the extra small fits perfect! I won't have to wear a bra with this dress which is amazing! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the other dress (small) has a little stain and also fits bigger so I was going to return it anyways.
4.0,Fit him extremely well. He loved it
4.0,This onesie pretty much looks as it does in the photo. It is thin (like t-shirt thin) so if your buying it for warmth baby will definitely need a shirt underneath. I bought this for my 12 month old he's about  20 lbs and he still has a little room to grow.
4.0,very resistent material
4.0,Cute suit but fits small and ties are a little short
4.0,"Wear and tear happening a little faster than expected, but my son uses his shoes hard. Basic Nike sneaker - what you see is what you get!"
4.0,Works great for sports for teens.
4.0,"I’m 5’6” 145 lbs and sized up to a large. It fit perfectly with the bagginess that shows on the model. It seems well made and is embroidered rather than just printed. The colors are exactly as shown. I think I was expecting cotton but the top is polyester but not see through.  It also has sizing under the embroidery which doesn’t help eventuate your waist, but I’m pretty sure the sizing will be less stiff when washed. Overall, it’s a cute top for the price!  Shipping took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive from China which was faster than Amazon estimated."
4.0,This ring is a great value but I do not wear it very often because it's a little rough around the cz.
4.0,"Delivered on time. Seem like nice shades, can't much at this point because they will be a stocking stuffer for Christmas."
4.0,I purchased this for my sister in law. She loves it. Very good quality.
4.0,Nice bow tie. Just to small for my dogs:(
4.0,"I have a pretty thick neck and this 'choker' has to be wrapped back to the front in order to make it tight. but other then that, its cute, arrived on time, and looks great."
4.0,The dress is very cute but the pink color is dull
4.0,"I got this for a casual house/backyard dress so no one, except a neighbor, will really see me in it. It's cute, and light which is what I wanted. It does run a little small. If you're a size 14 with a bust maybe go for xxl."
4.0,"Love the leather, zipper pull with a large opening. Holds a lot of stuff."
4.0,Made well and sturdy for price.  Look nice also.  Satisfied wit my purchase.
4.0,Fabulous compression for my 15 yr old daughter with POTS and the resulting blood pooling in her legs. Only thing she notices is that her thighs get sore if she wears them every day. She has very sensitive skin. They work better for her though than just wearing compression knee high socks.
4.0,"I was disappointed when I received this mask as the photo showed it was BLACK on the inside. The white shows every little mark. BUT... the mask is comfortable, well made, it has adjustable ear straps and came with 2 filters. The blue camo print is adorable. Highly recommend, very fair price as well!"
4.0,I bought these socks for my husband and he absolutely loved them! I will be purchasing more in the future~
4.0,It wears well... comfortable fit and stays in place....keeps head warm
4.0,These are pretty comfortable and easy to wear. My only con would be that the top is not a smooth elastic and stretches a bit so I find myself adjusting them a lot.
4.0,My cousin loved it and told me it was well worth it.
4.0,This product is adorable.  The material is a little see-through but it's cute.
4.0,"Weird combination of odd length and thin guage, which is my own fault for not double-checking description. Four stars because my wife likes them (gave them to her) and she has a lot of non-standard piercings. She also had a lot of metal sensitivities, and these have caused no reaction after months of use. If they are what you are looking for, they're great, just read measurements carefully."
4.0,Great party favor. 34 out of 40 worked which isn't great but I figured it would be worse. They were a huge hit anyway!
4.0,"I absolutely love the shape of these glasses. Based on a previous review, someone had mentioned that they were darker than the picture alludes to. This is not the case, they are extremely bright. I love the way they look when I wear them, but these are not bright sun glasses. I primarily wear them at dusk when the sun is just slipping down or during cloudy/rainy days. Very comfortable, stylish, and appear and feel well made. If I break the pair I have, I will definately be ordering another."
4.0,Very cute !!!! Comfy and flexible
4.0,The are good for form and functionality but they don't last.
4.0,My son likes these for working out because of the vented sides and he can pull them down.<br />I have to tighten the adjustment string and it leaves a line across my face.  Also uncomfortable with a string across my face.
4.0,Great product! Well made and will order again.
4.0,"I was happy with this swimsuit purchase. As I expected, the top was nowhere near large enough (I'm a 36DDD, and even in an XL the top was way too small, probably a B cup at best). The bottoms fit great, however, and are super cute. Since I ordered in plain black, I was able to find a strappy top that matched for relatively cheap at Target, and it really does look like a matched set. If you're smaller on top, then you can't go wrong with this suit. If you're like me, I'd say it's worth the price even for just the bottoms. I get tons of compliments on them and they are super flattering. They come up high enough to cover your belly button and hide any lumps you don't want to show off. I was a little worried I'd look like an over-stuffed sausage spilling through straps on the sides, but they actually lay really nicely and I don't have that problem at all."
4.0,"I like the dress, comfortable and flattering. I did expect it to be wax cloth not polyester but i still like it."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6b9c36a844c9c35aa536be73a5cc2593]] I just received this product so haven't really used it yet. I did set it up and it's super simple. I put a few small ice cubes in the back tray and some cold water. The fan seems relatively powerful for such a small unit and you can see the mist emitting from the unit when you look at the video. I also like the little tray in front that catches the water droplets.  One thing, I can't figure out how to get the back tray out to clean it so that's why it only got four stars."
4.0,"I should have ordered a large. I’m in between a medium & large in so many tops. This one is lovely in person, but it’s just tight enough around the chest to make me not want to wear it. If in doubt, order the larger size."
4.0,"This jacket is very soft. I am 5’6 and 190 lbs. I got a size large and it’s not too tight. I originally order the XL but it was way too big. The sleeves are a littler shorter than I would like, but it’s nice. We"
4.0,"When this top arrived I thought it was kinda meh! Once I tried it on, it went from meh to yeah! The fabric is soft and it fits true to size. I would order again!"
4.0,These sunglasses fit well over my glasses and the quality was good. I ended up returning them though because I got a headache within the first 20 minutes of wearing them. My eyes couldn’t adjust to having lenses on the side of my head.
4.0,"they play a lot, nice ones although they could improve quality but cannot complain as paid very less price on it"
4.0,Very comfortable and fits me well! Wish they were in more colors.
4.0,Absolutely loved this band. I wear it every day all day after a while the print has rubbed off which makes me sad as I've got a rose and a lily daughters and a print with those flowers is hard to find. It's super comfortable to wear with the push snap button thing.
4.0,Bought this for my husband. He likes it. And can wear it across his back when he bikes to and from the pool.
4.0,"Beware it shrinks a little after the first wash , comfortable and v good , but get the size taking into consideration that it shrinks a little"
4.0,These were a gift. She did not want to return them.
4.0,"Very cute and I like the material, but as others mentioned it does fit small around the neck. Still happy with my purchase though."
4.0,Beautiful scepter. Matches nicely with the heart details in my crown. The heart on the scepter is bigger and heavier than I expected. Almost a yard long and the heart is almost the width of my palm. Was hesitant about getting it since there were no reviews but glad I did. One star off because it arrived with a few stones falling out.
4.0,I love these ! Very nice material ! The only thing I didn't like was that the picture makes it look like it scrunches at the ankles but really it's straight pants . No scrunch but still cute I just folded for capris
4.0,"4/5 stars because it's polyester... I don't see that anywhere in the description.  Shame on me for assuming silk, like the one on the Tottenham shop.  Next time will buy direct from the club site.<br /><br />COYS!"
4.0,"Kinda hard to see through the nose holes, but the kid loves it."
4.0,"It was a little flimsy, with cheap velvet glued on. Nice marriage silver,it was okay for the price"
4.0,Nice dress but it runs big. I still wore it and would purchase another later die the road. It's 1 size to big.
4.0,"I got the product before I was expecting it. The earrings are pretty good quality and stay on really well. The only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is because the o rings were not quite what I was expecting. One was missing upon unpackaging the items, and the rest fell off during use."
4.0,Runs big but he material
4.0,"Very nice, exactly as described!"
4.0,This will Be an awesome Christmas present for my aunt!!
4.0,"These are lovely and I like them a lot. The down side is that they have a very strong musty sort of odor: like something that has been sitting in a foldded up Army GP Medium tent for several months. I've tried a few things to get rid of the odor: Febreeze, sunlight (be careful since they can bleach if you leave them in the sun too long), etc, and the odor seems to have reduced a little. Probably a matter of how they're stored.<br /><br />Taking off one star for the smell. Sorry, guys, but it's very strong. :-)"
4.0,My 11 year old loves them.
4.0,super cute lil belt
4.0,"I just received these and based on other reviews ordered the size I normally wear in other styles of jeans. Other reviewers had stated that these run large - not on me. They run at least 2 sizes smaller than I normally wear. I'm returning these because although I can get them on I don't like them that tight. I'll try ordering 2 sizes larger and hopefully they will be just right. I also wouldn't say these are mid rise - more like low rise on me. They are really cute so I am hoping that 2 sizes larger than the 4 - i.e. an 8 will fit just right. Hope this helps other shoppers. Jeans are tough to buy as each manufacturer sizes them slightly differently. I'm 5'1"" and 128 lbs - wear a size 4 or 6 depending on make of jeans but in these more than likely an 8. The dye that is used on these does have a strong smell and hopefully that will come out in the wash or diminish."
4.0,Comfy & Cute
4.0,"Got this for my daughter. We were conflicted on the size, (she wears a size 12-14 girls) so we got a small. I had looked at a few similar to this one and it seemed that small would be perfect...<br />It is baggy on her, but honestly the fit isn't terrible. She likes baggy stuff and the length fits nicely, it doesn't sit at her ankles in a pile.<br />Also, it came much faster than expected!"
4.0,"The adhesive sticks well without being too sticky and hurting your skin. The sticky adhesive has holes I assume to avoid too much clinging that will just, well, hurt. I do feel like the adhesive comes off just a bit when you sweat though.<br /><br />And the string is thick and noticeable under clothing. Another thing to be aware of is that the cups might go up to high for very wide scoop necklines and be visible."
4.0,The dress was tight around my breasts area but it fit perfectly And it is stunning. I shouldn't gotten a size up
4.0,😃😊😊
4.0,"Great dress for costume! Soft fabric, not see thru.... A little small for my tall-ish 8 yo."
4.0,"I got this for my girlfriend (now an ex) for her birthday. She wouldn't wear it because she &#34;doesn't wear jewelry&#34;... even though it was a nice product. I eventually convinced her to put it on, which she did. It was a very pretty necklace, but the chain became reddish with wear."
4.0,"I got these and immediately started wearing them. They are very comfortable but there are 2 things that I found annoying. First, the actual zippers were a real pain. I don't really feel that are needed. Second, the cord to tighten around the waist is way too short and I find that they were lost inside the waistline."
4.0,"Little tighter than the other bands I have so it leaves impressions in my wrist. The bad thing is that it is so sharp that it snags clothing and ripped my keyboard wrist pad. But, I do get lots of compliments on it."
4.0,Nice gift for a pre-teen.  I would order again.
4.0,"I really love this, it is a perfect fall top without being too heavy. I wear a Medium and I ordered a large based on the reviews. Yeah, SO did not fit. I returned it and got an xl and it fit, but it JUST fit. So the reviews saying size up one size, you may need two based on your body type. Since it only goes to a xl that may be tough for some. I get a lot of compliments on it and may order one in another color."
4.0,I love this jacket. Super cute. Bought for a concert
4.0,Great fit and extremely comfortable. Can not beat the price for 3 shirts. Would recommend to anyone.
4.0,"Super, super cute Kimono, Cardigan, cover up or whatever you want to call it. Unfortunately way too small. But the quality is nice, the print is nice and I really, really wish it would fit. The sleeves are shorter than it looks on the picture. 3/4 sleeves more than full length sleeves. I ordered a XL and received a L. But it is that small, that I dont think a XL would have fit me. So definitely want to order at least 2 sizes up. If you do, and if it fits you, it is absolutely adorable."
4.0,I haven't wore this piece of jewerly..I have to have the right outfit..That will be coming very soon..My friend thinks it look corny..We will see
4.0,"The purple was much darker than the purple in the photo. I got a dark/deep purple instead of the medium purple shown above (I've viewed the product on several screens). It wasn't a huge deal because they fit great and it's still a pretty color, but just be aware that the colors are a bit off."
4.0,Shirt is not off the shoulder like it shows in pic.
4.0,Very nice wear it all the time.<br />Thank-you.
4.0,I ordered a XXL and they look and fit like a medium
4.0,"Good quality, lined on the front, however, that is just so small. Barely got it on 10 years old ( tall one), so I dont see how it could fit 12 years old ( large is for 12 y/o)"
4.0,"I think all the confusion and bad reviews could end if they just updated all the images.  I was hoping for a very flowy dress to bum around in by the pool... not easy to find in my size.  Everyone says it runs big, so I thought maybe I'd have a chance.  Nope.  Thing is, the dress fits.. soft light lovely thin tshirt material... it just doesn't fit like it does on the model.  The only way you're getting that look is if you're an XS and order the XXL.  I did just notice they added a new color with a new image, but just one.  THIS IS EXACTLY HOW IT LOOKS.  Cute if that's what you're expecting.  Im 5'3"" and it just grazed the top of my feet.  Im 42DD, very curvy shape and the XXL fit well. The white is pretty sheer."
4.0,"Nice hat, just too big"
4.0,Great rings!
4.0,Little bit thin layerbut its does the job and fits perfect
4.0,Very cute! Only disappointed that one of the silver unicorns on the head was not stitched. It was a birthday gift and didn’t have time to send back before her birthday.
4.0,"These are super comfy, but a little short for my long legs and narrower than I was expecting. I still wear them anyway. :)"
4.0,"The quality is very good., I can't believe the price. Of course, I know to handle the beautiful earrings with care. So far very good."
4.0,Very big and heavy.  Probably can only be pinned on a very stiff fabric like a wool blazer or heavy coat.  It would pull on thin fabric.  It's pretty.
4.0,"This product is well constructed, sized and fitted enough to give a nice uniform look to a group of 13 girls without looking too cheap or costume-y<br /><br />EDIT: Update - first time students put on, we split 2 zippers. I had to sew them into their dresses for their first competition. Very stressful and annoying. We were able to fix one, but the other is now a complete loss.<br /><br />SECOND EDIT: Company customer service was fast and awesome. Gave a full refund or option to send another dress. :)"
4.0,This outfit is very cute and I really like it. We are expecting our first boy and picking out clothing has been so much fun. The fabric is very soft and the outfit all together seems well made. The yellow screen printing is a little bit see through almost. It isn't as bold as the yellow in the item picture. It still gives the same effect it just looks a little different. I would say it also runs a little bit large. I have found that most items that are size 70 that say they are for newborns or 0-6m tend to run a little large. No big deal because baby will grow into it soon enough. I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 because of the yellow screen printing and the fact that it runs a bit large.
4.0,"Pants are nice and long. Fabric is soft and comfortable. Design is forgiving. The only thing I didn't 'love' about this jump suit is that I wish the top (the v part) came down a little further. The top (slightly) cuts across my chest instead of under the breast, the way it looks designed to fit."
4.0,"Well made, but a bit small for my head. It does not look very bouffant on me at all."
4.0,Looks like picture.  Have not used yet but believe it will be an attractive means to keep glasses close.
4.0,"the product only comes with a pebble when the photo seems to come more, it is a nice and delicate product, I loved it."
4.0,Nice little necklace.
4.0,Very lightweight.  Excellent fit over my large  glasses. Fit much better than o<br />ver frame glasses available in stores
4.0,"One breast zipper ""pocket"" is fake. But all in all it works out! Size matches most criteria as described"
4.0,Skirt colors are vibrant and beautiful. The fit is true to size. Arrived on time and packaged well. Would have given it 5 stars but the skirt wasn't as flowly as i thought it would be. Its a little puffy and stiff.
4.0,Only four stars because it almost has to be a child’s size. It definitely is a CHOKER.
4.0,Nice material.  Runs a little large.
4.0,"If you want it to look like the picture I would suggest getting a size larger then you usually wear. I got a large and it looks good, but not like the picture at all. It is very soft and comfortable, worth the money I paid for it, and shipped quickly."
4.0,"Really nice, but also really tiny"
4.0,Nice accent piece
4.0,Had so many compliments with this band. Ordered another as the first one broke after using it once while hiking.
4.0,"Very nice and warm. Turtle neck is nice and high, the sizing is just a little big, sits a little baggy on me but it works."
4.0,"My modest daughter loves how this suit fits.  She is a young teen and was a bit horrified by swimsuits that are meant for her body size.  This suit fits her well and suits her personal style. I am glad I went with a larger size, if I had ordered the small one, it would have been to small.  She is between womens and girls sizes currently."
4.0,"These shorts are so very comfortable. They move well with you while working out or biking. I loved these shorts; however, I've only worn a handful of times and I just found a seam that is coming apart - clearly a manufacturing issue, but too late to return/exchange. I'm so bummed."
4.0,Ive had my Spy sunglasses with the original lens for nearly a decade. The old lens were getting so bad that i could barely drive with them on. I bought these as a replacement. Since replacing them i have been wearing them everyday for a week.<br /> Few things will have a holographic tint but its not an issue for me. The lens dont fit exactly but they are snug enough that they wont fall out of my Spy Logans. Im very pleased with these lens. I highly recommend it.
4.0,Dress fit well. Very feminine and flowy.
4.0,"The material on this dress is really nice. It is thick and drapes well. The only negative is that in order for the ruching at the waist to sit right, it has to be pretty snug. It was a bit too big for me and I didn't want it tighter across my butt, so I am returning."
4.0,"I was looking for a new line of caps to match the new &#34;stretchy/tech&#34; scrub material that a lot of scrubs are made of. .. this was a perfect item.. except it's shaped like a cone head . I kept trying to flatten it out but the seam lies in a way that it creates a cone shape right in the middle top of your head. I washed it, smashed it, tried to get it  to lay flatter.. tried wearing it forward more etc... Nada. Love the material, seems like it will last a long time, breathes well, washed well, rich color that appears it won't fade etc. But can't get past the cone. Being that I already washed and wore it I kept it, I keep thinking I'll find a way to fix the cone. Until then, I push it to the side daily when rummaging through my scrub cap drawer. :("
4.0,"been using them for a while now...<br />fit my big size face well..<br />great quality hinges.<br />nose pads needed a little adjustment, but that's about it.<br /><br />will update if i run into some problems"
4.0,"I got a size small and I am 5’7” 135 lbs with a small chest.  That last part is important.  The sleeves are a bit tight but I’d be swimming in a medium in the chest area.  Keep that in mind.  If you are thin-ish and small chest (B cup), go small.<br /><br />Material is a nylon not cotton.  Sateen almost but very stretchy.<br /><br />Overall I like the look.  Perfect for work or a night out that’s not too flashy."
4.0,"its just what my daughter wanted, good fit, nicely made"
4.0,"Great quality, fits true to size and I love supporting Tom's."
4.0,"Earrings are light and solid for the price. I was thrown off by the title ""...for women"" and wondered how large it would be. I dislike the size. For an adult they are very small, and stud indeed. I have small round studs larger than these. I would've paid more for a larger version as I adore the unique texture. These would be perfect for a child. I will wear them as a secondary pair or give them away."
4.0,"The Chain Stitch Plaid shirt is made from a lightweight cotton fabric which is perfect for the summer. The more dominant color of the shirt is the navy blue since that color has the biggest blocks in the plaid. Inside around collar and the top of the back is an oxford cloth lining, which adds some nice detail. One thing I find kind of weird is that the top button buttons OVER the collar on the opposite side. I have never seen this before, all my other shirts button under the collar.<br /><br />I can only guess that the fit of this shirt varies widely since some reviewers indicate it is too large, while others say it is too small. In my case the shirt fits well across the chest, but tight in the shoulders, it just barely fits there. I’m afraid to wash the shirt for fear of shrinkage, even though “Shirts Are Water-Processed to Ensure No Shrinking”. The sleeves of the shirt also have an athletic cut, which means that they are cut on more of a diagonal and are shorter that a standard shirt. This saves the manufacturer fabric, which also saves them money. I’m not a big fan of athletic sleeves.<br /><br />Overall, the Chain Stitch Plaid shirt is well constructed, they even give you spare buttons sewn on one of the shirttails. I’m still concerned about the shrinkage. I will follow the care instructions. Four stars for now, but if there is shrinkage after washing, down to three. I would say for most people order one size up."
4.0,"These r very cute and colorful and a good selection for the price, I’m always getting compliments on how cut they r"
4.0,"Not what I expected in terms of the weight of the belt, but a nice quality overall. Dimensions are exact as specified, and black color matches picture. Planning on ordering more in different colors."
4.0,Very nice quality; only problem is the larger one is very sharp and can hurt you or someone else. Gave to friend who welds and does art... he might wear as weapon also. Ha. The other ring we love personally. Bought 3.
4.0,Very cute suite I love the top and it’s super supportive. I was super disappointed that it is a full bottom the headlines read as a thong bikini but it is not . I will not return because it’s $7.99 lol so alone the top is worth it .
4.0,"Small/dainty - and a nice gift for a girl (or if you love pineapples)!  Pineapples are a sign of 'welcome'.  Nice. You could possibly remove it and use it on a charm bracelet, too, I think."
4.0,"Cute dress. Shows off your legs but chest gapped a bit on the side, even with a larger chest"
4.0,"Amazing quality, it works great with my Halloween costume.  Seller very easy to deal with."
4.0,I love that I can adjust the ties to fit my desired style. Top looks exactly like the picture.
4.0,"Slightly large -- sort of a uni-size fit.  A little big for my Womens 8 feet.  Comfortable, fine for swimming.  UV protection is good.  Reinforced toe & heel appreciated."
4.0,Sheer<br />Not great for gym unless you want your buttcheeks visible. Flattering though
4.0,"Fits great, stayed cool during my workout and didn't seem to build up too much of a moisture issue, however, they do roll up and I have to pull them down here and there, I'm a curvy girl, that may be the difference. Would still buy them again."
4.0,"I took a chance on these, and for synthetic uppers they are very comfortable, even between the toes. The footbed is surprisingly comfortable and somewhat supportive. I usually wear Vionics or Orthaheels, which have a built-in arch. These are really quite comfy, as flip flop sandals go. They do keep my heel fairly stable, more than what I expected. A bit pricey but I'll keep them."
4.0,Material super comfy and shirt us flattering
4.0,Nice gown. But very thin
4.0,Truly love the fabric.  It looked so much better than the picture.
4.0,My daughter loves this watch! Plays with it all the time. Unfortunately the screen is glass and she dropped it and cracked the screen.  So I had to take it from her so she doesn’t cut herself trying to play with it 👎 I did not see any screen protectors for it.
4.0,It's a little cheap looking but I adore it. It feels nice on the skin. It arrived quicker than stated! I have no complaints- I'd buy another one! I'm 5'5 135 and got a small/it's pretty tight but that's the look I was going for
4.0,pockets show through the rips
4.0,I liked the quality.  I use them at work.
4.0,"It’s an excellent sweater vest, but it is HUGE!  I’m 6’1”, 210, and a Large is too big for me.  That is just ridiculous."
4.0,"Super cute, I normally wear a medium to large shirt bc of my bust but could of ordered a small in this style. Great quality."
4.0,"Nice and cool shirt, I wish the sleeves were a bit longer. Still love the shirt."
4.0,"I took a chance on buying this dress and it's pretty good! The fabric is heavier than I thought it would be; it's jersey, but a heavy jersey. Still has some give, but the dress has a nice weight too it. I had to get a bigger size to fit my shoulders (which are very broad) which meant the waist wasn't fitted. I did, however, wash and dry and it did shrink by just a smidge, so it fits a big better now.<br />Still, for the price, I would recommend.<br />Color and shape looked like the picture."
4.0,"The sweatshirt at a medium size for a 5'7 height goes down to over the waist, so the make it shorter just roll it up a bit. The jacket is very soft and warm, definitely was sweating wearing it."
4.0,"Runs big, order a size or 2 down, otherwise very cute"
4.0,Fits nice and looks just how i expected! Buying more for sure.
4.0,Love these legwarmers! They are super long and very warm and soft. They do slide down; it would be nice if they put little silicone dots around the upper leg part to keep them in place. Other than that I would recommend them to anyone.
4.0,Nice look to add to your bags. Glitzes it up nicely
4.0,"Good quality, nice length, light weight, but strong enough to hold my glasses."
4.0,Very good item but not slim as I thought
4.0,"I really like these earrings. They are just the right balance of bold and chunky but also tasteful and classy. The only issue I have is one of my earrings has a slight dent on the bottom part of the earring. If not for the defect, I would give them 5 stars."
4.0,The best purse i have.  and most of my purse i buy cost fity to hundred dollars. i light it because of all the pockets and it is light weight. i gave it only 4 stars be cause i dont like the color. i will probably buy  another color when i see one on sale again.  love love love it.
4.0,"I biught two of these lovelies and the only downside to this dress is the cheap material. Thank goodness it's stretchy and doesn't itch much, but I would have preferred something in cotton (my fault for not reading the materials before buying). I love the placement of the flower design - it elongate the body and helps hide and tummy you might have. It's also very work appropriate, as the length is right above the knee and looks great with a blazer."
4.0,"Beautiful but the material is not what I expected, I expected this color and got red and it's kinda like a cheap mesh but I am sure my hubby will love it just the same"
4.0,Only reason I’m returning (for a different style) is cause the mock turtleneck makes me look more short waisted than I really am.  The fabric is comfortable but the pants won’t hold in tummy.  The top covers it however. If you are taller than 5’8 the pants will be too short
4.0,"Over all love the dress but it runs larger up top than what the measurement chart stated. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 153 lbs. I will have to have it altered to fit properly up top. I am a 36 DD so my bust measurement was 39in so I went with the XL which fits my other areas great, just gaping some in the front and at the arm holes. Most other things I purchase are the opposite giving the 36 DD. So kinda bummed I'll have to put out a little more cash to have it altered and get the fit just right. I got the same dress in black with cherries and the white with cherries and all three have the same issue. So keep that in mind when ordering. Hip and waist was just right though. I also ordered the petticoat to go under it, fills it out nicely."
4.0,The watch band looks and feels as though you purchased it from the apple store. The color is exactly as described in the listing. Shipping was fast. I would recommend this watch band.
4.0,It's so comfy and warm.  The print started to come off in the wash a little and I never dry it in the dryer.  I always hang it to dry.
4.0,"I am 6 foot tall, so this would never work as a dress.  It's perfect to wear with leggings, which is exactly what I needed it for!  Loved it to much, I bought 3 different colors!"
4.0,I got an Xl and it’s fits good my only problem are the sleeves they are too short
4.0,"I've been wearing Hain whitie tighties for a long time and this is my 2nd pair of pouch underwear.<br />I have to say I like the pouch style.<br />I wanted them for traveling so I could wash them and have them dry overnight.<br />These are very quick drying and the only reason for the 4 stars is they are not as comfortable as MeUndies brand but, still very comfortable.<br />The pouch was similar but, the waist rolled over and dug in a little. Could be my pot belly's fault but MeUndies don't do that.<br />Compared to MeUndies, these are a good value."
4.0,"They were good quality glasses but they didn’t fit over my seven yr old grandson’s glasses. He is small for 7, but has a wider face. I think they would<br />work for a younger child."
4.0,Remove white rubber protectors on snap on shades
4.0,"I thought it was very nice...good quality. I would've liked it better if it had been lined, but for the money I can't complain. The camel color was right on. First time I wore it I got a couple of compliments."
4.0,"It does not come with a chain. Once you know that, it is beautiful craftsmanship."
4.0,"I had to return the first pair as even though I ordered a whole size larger han what I normally wear they were still too small! That being said however, I really liked them, they are light and I could tell they would be comfortable so I ordered another pair 2 sizes larger than I normally wear and I think I’m all set now! I have not hiked in them yet, I’m hoping they will work out on the trail."
4.0,"I love these cute little earrings. They are comfortable, somewhat heavy and even better in person. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that when I received them a few of the posts were slightly bent but, I straightened them with no problem. Very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"I love these, but I wish they had made them stain/water resistant. They discolored and stained so fast."
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected but not uncomfortable, very soft on the inside, feels a little tight around the neck, but I do have a somewhat thick neck for my size."
4.0,I dislike it because I bought it as an XL for my brother. It was in men's size. It didn't fit him. So he gave it to his teenage daughter. I loved it for myself but it was Christmas time.
4.0,My son really liked this one when out on the water all day.
4.0,One pair for a stocking stuffer for my daughter and a pair for me.
4.0,"Great fit, super comfortable, and nice fabric. I just wish they would have been available in a slightly longer inseam."
4.0,very nice.  nice and long like i wanted
4.0,Bought and transformed into a pikachu case for my son he loves it!
4.0,"I usually wear a petite small/medium in women's and have an athletic build. It's been hard to find cargo pants that actually have useful pockets and are not skin tight/any other useless women's clothing characteristics. These pants are great. They have actual pockets, are flattering (not too tight or baggy at least for my curves) and the cargo pockets aren't chunky with over the top embellishments. The length is just right for me so I can't imagine they'd fit anyone above 5-foot tall unless they want ankle pants/capris..?"
4.0,"I must've accidentally ordered the wrong size. I'm 5'4 and 185, wear a size 14-16 pants. and I ordered the 4xl. I should've atleast gone with a 2xl. I don't know what I was thinking. It was way too big for me. BUT, the wine color was true to the picture and really lovely. There was a little extra give of the fabric in the hips which would be good for very curvy hips. I was really sad that it was too big and I had to return it. I have a grey off-the-shoulder top I was going to pair with this skirt. Girls, have a good shape wear ready to wear with this, it hides nothing. It's the clingy polyester blend type of fabric. Definitely worth the price though."
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture !
4.0,It was more of a gunmetal silver. Doesn’t match my other silver jewelry. However the fit is great for a small neck and doesn’t change color (rust).
4.0,Came as pictured<br />Comfortable<br />I had my prescription lenses put in
4.0,I really like the heal of this shoe.  Just enough but not too much so it's comfortable.  They are a bit tight and stiff at first but as the leather softens are very comfortable.  I will be ordering another pair.
4.0,"If you are a fan of bikini style waist bands on boxer briefs, these are the ones!! No one has ""band less"", regardless of what they say, there is a 1-2"" band...not these. Used to get Equipo brand and they weren't available as boxer briefs anymore so tried these...bought a 2nd set. Very happy"
4.0,Very cute ring. The prongs are weirdly placed so I'm a little worried about the stone falling out. The prongs are smooth so it shouldn't catch on your sweater. I did test it and it didn't catch.
4.0,"I'm breastfeeding my four kid and this bra doesn't seem to keep my breasts in when I am full, I'm a 34D"
4.0,These earrings are nice but smaller than I expected. In the images they definitely seem bigger.
4.0,"I like it, but definitely too small. I normally wear a large and get xlarge when I want things baggy. I got an xl and it is very snug. Maybe fits more like a medium/large. It's cute but I was looking for more of a baggy look. Not sure if I'll end up wearing it or not."
4.0,"Was better than I expected for fit and look. Sturdy enough to last several years if taken care of. Felt type costume material. Its of course stiff but a little light stretching and use helped that. Overall very please. My head measures about 23” so the opening at 23.5 is a good fit. If your head is over that 23.5, look for something else 👍🏼"
4.0,Love the soles of these slides
4.0,I really like this dress. The color is beautiful and the material is nice and thick. The dress was a little stiff but it softened up after a wash.
4.0,"I originally ordered XL, which is my usual size.  I could get these joggers on, but they were too snug for comfort so I went up a size.  The XXL fits perfectly.  Overall, comfortable."
4.0,"Puede usar ropa que te quedé como está, no busque más"
4.0,"Love the size and diversity of this purse!! The color is exactly how it's pictured and there are so many pockets!! Exactly what I was looking for! Only downside is the leather does have a slight smell, it has gotten better since I have been using it, but it was pretty noticeable as soon as I took it out of the box. That's why I am only giving it 4 stars."
4.0,I love this outfit and its almost perfect except its too tight at the bottom of the shirt that I had a difficult time taking it off my daughter. I wish it had a little side slips to help with the dressing her. My daughter is 12 months old 16Lb and 19inch tall.
4.0,More light weight than I thought but great for my kid who keeps losing hats at school. I can even wear them!
4.0,"Love It! Love It! Love It!  The color is great, a muted army green, and the fit is perfect!<br />Previously I ordered a L and had to send it back. It was too small. I ordered a XXL in order to get the correct fit,and room for shrinkage.  It looks great!"
4.0,Cute top. Fits well looks good with jeans
4.0,The vest has inside pockets to store phone iPad and keys also use as CCW
4.0,"I have purchased these earrings 3 times now. I would give it 5 stars for look and feel and 3 stars for longevity. They look great and are the perfect dainty addition to any outfit or occasion. I have sensitive ears as well and these do not irritate them at all. However, I have had to purchase these so many times because the backs tend to get caught on things, causing me to lose them. If the backs were a little tighter, I imagine they would not fall out as easily. Regardless, they are so cute and high quality so I would recommend."
4.0,As expected. Wld buy agsin.
4.0,"I originally ordered this for myself, it came fast and the quality seems good. But it's too big for me, so I gave it to my mom, she loves it."
4.0,"Fabric: Thick & there's not much stretch so it's important you get the correct size<br />Sizing: I'm athletic build, 95 lbs & purchased a small. Fits perfectly<br />Top half: Conservative design but wish they used better padding<br />Bottom half: Designed just like a cheeky bikini bottom; cut comes up really high on the hips<br /><br />Tip: This is a very simple 1-piece, in other words, there's nowhere to hide the belly so if this is an area you're trying to hide, maybe go with another swimsuit or purchase the black one"
4.0,"Made quickly, the engraving seemed a little cheap"
4.0,"I have an ample chest and at first thought the dress fit great but as the day went on the neckline kept getting lower,  I’m still going to wear it though, it’s a flattering cut and women with big boobs know the struggle.  I can make it work,  Soon I’m hoping to buy it in a different color and print since the silhouette  is so flattering overall.  It’s  a versatile piece thats easy to dress up ot down."
4.0,Club 👗 anytime .
4.0,"The pendant and chain arrived in the estimated time. It is truly a canary yellow and it is beautiful. Since it is all about the pendant, the chain does not overpower it, but still complements it due to the &#34;round&#34; structure of it. The length of the chain is just right, because when wearing it is not to low."
4.0,Fits a little tight. The green is a lighter than it looks. And the elastic on the bottom and arms are pretty tight. Still a nice jacket.
4.0,Great shirt to pair with black pants for the office.
4.0,"Outfit was so cute on looks just like picture, wasn’t crazy about the pants could have been a little tighter at the bottom but overall was happy"
4.0,Size runs a size or two smaller
4.0,"it didn't come with a panty liner which i dont like but they'll go straight in the wash. The bottoms are a little tight oh well, but also SUPER cheeky so if you like that you'll be happy. A bit much for me but I love the top so much that I'll pair it with something else. I have very small boobs and choosing a bathing suit top for them is actually hard and this looks so good and fits great!"
4.0,Fits perfect for 5'5 and under. Wish it would drape better it's a little stiff but it does look great 👍
4.0,So my daughter burns through backpacks like it is cool! She really needed a new backpack for basketball. The HUASTA Military Tactical Backpack Army Molle 3 Day Assault Back Bag is perfect. I got this for her in hopes it would hold her ball and gear for practice.<br />The backpack holds everything she needs. It also has the water bottle holders and spot for her slides.<br />She is loving it and it doesn't seem like she is going to break this one right away. The reason for the deduction in star is because she doesn't like that the straps are rather rough.
4.0,"This is really cute as a tunic.  I cannot wear this as a dress at all.  I'm 5'3&#34; and the hem is right at my butt.  That being said, it is still really cute and summery.  Just need to pair with shorts."
4.0,"I've had Citizen Blue Angel watches before and, to me, they have always felt cheap. I gave them away or sold them. This one is built better. It feels solid. The band is heavy and well built. You can almost spin the compas  feature all the way around with one swipe, yet that's minor. The only reason to give it less stars is the face is substantially darker than it appears in the photo on the product page. A bit too dark, I think. Regardless, this is a nice watch for under $400. If you have to pay more than $400, there are better choices. Yet for the amount I paid, it is well worth it."
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and 120 lbs, and ordered a small, this one was very very short on me. Size wise, it fit okay but super duper short.. won't work unless you ordered it as PJ's or lingerie! On top of that, it is very hot when worn. Needless to say, I haven't worn it outside the house (or while trying it on)."
4.0,good quality and very cute! better then expected for the price very happy
4.0,Fast shipping! Great product. Make sure you hand wash if you want the color to stay. I wish I would have read the directions. Still overall it's a great product and it's soft. You won't be disappointed.
4.0,"I only gave these 4 stars as the inside tag says a size six but the rubber sole says a six and a half, definitely a half size to large, but with inserts and a thicker sock for winter months they will be fine. Super cute though so I will keep them!"
4.0,Fight fan? Show Joe public that you are with these Tees. Some of the greatest ever are listed . Rocky Marciano 49-0 ! Marvelous Marvin Hagler 62 and 3 52 Knockouts both from Brockton MA just like yo mama
4.0,I do like the way my sunglasses look and feel BUT...you have to clean the lenses a lot.  But overall i'm happy!
4.0,"It's a beatuiful shirt. I ordered the pink and blue ones. They fit good, and look good. Only issue I had was that the sleeves are a bit short."
4.0,"These unicorn charms are adorable! They arrived on time. The only complaint I have is, the “locket” does not stay closed. It easily opens when hanging on a necklace. I’m trying to figure out how to keep it closed without making it permanent. I hope someone from the company reads this and can offer suggestions or send me some that definitely close and open securely."
4.0,My daughter got these for Homecoming. They were just the right size and  had enough dangle to catch the light without being too long and in the way. They looked beautiful with the Blue dress she wore.
4.0,"My fiance is quite thin so everything is a little loose on her. Overall, she loved it"
4.0,Nephew loved them.
4.0,Beautiful necklace. Looks just like real gold. The pendent is about the size of a dime. I thought the chain would be a little longer but it's fine. Would definitely recommend to others.
4.0,"This is a very nice little charm and a good value for the money, as are most Soufeel products. The details are pretty and the stone is large enough that you can see it. My only complaint is the fact it does not come with the Soufeel  gift box as pictured, but rather a small tarnish resistant bag. That one aspect diminished the presentation."
4.0,There’s an extremely fine line between too tight and too lose. Meaning literally 1 notch difference Between too tight and too loose. If I wear it on the tighter side my sensitive skin is not happy if I wear it too much. But for the price the details are cute
4.0,My brother liked it
4.0,I have to return too small
4.0,"I order a large and the sleeves were too short, so I ordered an XL and the sleeves still fit a little short for an XL."
4.0,"The ratchet belt is handy since it enables me to adjust the belt for gradations of less than one inch, which is handy when your waist size is between inches.  The belt is easily trimmed so that a proper fit can be attained."
4.0,"I live in an area where rain is very likely on a weekly basis and often we get several inches in one day.  Therefore, I was really interested in how the umbrella would work.  So far so good. It has kept rain out of my car and has been easy to open and close with the cardoor only slightly cracked. It has kept me dry.  My  only complaints are the lack of an automatic open and close and the large physical size of the closed umbrella itself.  My husband on the other hand is definitely not a fan, primarily because of the handle.  He finds it impossible to comfortably hold the umbrella in one hand (large hands).  While I don't have a problem holding and using the umbrella, I will probably buy another one that has a normal handle when I need a new one.  That is the reason for a lack of 5 stars."
4.0,"I bought the beige color and it looks exactly like the pictures. It’s a pretty beige/cream color. The hat came in good condition, no dents or anything. It’s super cute! My only complaint is that the belt doesn’t fit. It came in a separate bag and when I tried to put it on,  wouldn’t fit. It was way too small for the hat so it made the hat cave in a bit and look weird if I force the belt on it. Other then that it’s really cute and looks like the pictures!"
4.0,cute-the rose gold matched the Pandora bracelet perfectly
4.0,"Shipping took awhile,but I am satisfied with the product"
4.0,Lace not as sturdy as expected
4.0,It is a very fancy key chain but the rim where the keys go is a bit to big
4.0,"It's a good basic black hoodie, It's a little shorter than I would like, but over all it's held up rather well over time."
4.0,"These are very good quality. Enough stretch to be comfortable when exercising, but still firm enough that it holds you in a bit. The only problem is they're a little are through. The black aren't as bad as the patterned gray/black, but if you are in down dog the color/style of your panties is definitely viewable. I have not had this problem with gap and Lucy pants in similar patterns."
4.0,Pretty! I'm 5'9 and it was short.
4.0,Very satisfied with this purchase. Easy to use.
4.0,I like this little bag except wish the strap was a bit longer.
4.0,"I purchased these slippers hoping they would be warm, durable enough to wear outside for light chores, but without retaining a sole too rigid to wear indoors for extended periods of time. I am extremely happy to say these slippers meet all these versatile requirements.<br /><br />These are sold as indoor slippers but because of the leather, wool insulation, and gum rubber sole, you can wear these for many outdoor chores. One caution: The deerskin is extremely supple so do not wear these in wet or moist areas. The leather acts like a spongue. While I suppose you could treat them with a silicone agent, I want to wear these inside and I don't want to smell that chemical everywhere I go.<br /><br />I found my slippers were inconsistent in size. The right fit me dead on: Size 9M, but the left was 9 1/2 approaching Size 10. By wearing light socks I found the difference negligible.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly agree with a previous member's review- These slippers are darn ugly. The leather toes look too long and it seems like your wearing elf clogs or clown shoes. I swear my cat looks at me twice when I first walk in the room. But like another reviewer said- At least these do not have those leather laces which are constantly coming untied. Yeah, your friends are probably going to poke fun at you when they first these these.<br /><br />Finally, comparing these slippers with a brand name or an established outdoor company's product, these are 50% cheaper for what I feel is equal quality. Granted they are made in China but politics aside- you must put this in perspective to the money you save. Overall I highly recommend this product. Thank you.<br /><br />Respectfully submitted,<br />Seacoast, New Hampshire"
4.0,Was for a friend.  Don't know anything about it.
4.0,"I usually wear 10.5 and they were WAY to tight. Size 11 is also tight, and I'm thinking I should have gotten 11.5 instead."
4.0,"Ordered this for wife, was too small, did not see reviews showing small, she likes it loose to wear as an over shirt, re order larger size and its fine she is thrilled-just order the larger size if you want this shirt"
4.0,The shoe itself is well made but I bought the wrong size.
4.0,I just wish it said if it water resistant or not..
4.0,"Very warm, good quality, but runs a bit big if you wear a 7-1/8 or smaller."
4.0,not comfortable :( but looks good
4.0,"They are a tad narrow and my daughter doesn't have a wide foot.  very cute though and if your child can get past that, then they are great."
4.0,"Nice, basic digital watch at a good price.  Perfect size for a kid - would look a little small on an adult wrist."
4.0,"Great top, form fitting.  Husband loved it."
4.0,"they keep you cool, but they get dog hair/hair in general stuck in them sometimes. i haven’t had any problems with sweat showing through. they don’t have a tag on the inside so if you struggle with finding the front and back it might be a struggle, maybe add a sticker or something."
4.0,"Really nice quality, and a good sole to the shoe.  My daughter loves them."
4.0,"These gloves are absolutely beautiful and they arrived promptly. However! I ordered them hoping for longer gloves that would cover my wrists and arms under coats in the winter. I have large hands, so I ordered LARGE. When they came I could not even pull them on forcefully. My daughters both havevery  small handsl. Guess what? They fit them perfectly. So I recommend these HIGHLY for people with small hands!"
4.0,ITS LITTLE BIT BIG BUT AWESOME I LOVE IT
4.0,These are quality and work well. I wish I didn't need them though.
4.0,"Cute shoes but everything sticks to them. Grass, leaves.. a bit of a pain."
4.0,"These were better than expected for the price. They were a smooth material that my teen daughter really liked, but ultimately we ended up returning because the smallest size was a little too big. The pockets fit a tennis ball."
4.0,Good for the price but not the best.
4.0,"I wear this hat when I'm outside doing yard work. Even though it's kinda small, I'll make it work."
4.0,She is a small two year old so I hope I will get at least two years out of it.
4.0,"I like them, they fit my big head well, and they are not super dark like most mirrored sunglasses.  Also they have amber/tan lens color which I prefer to the dark gray.  Would have liked a bigger lens size.  But for the money, they look good and work well."
4.0,The headband and the jersey were a Christmas gift for my son and he loves them both.
4.0,"The tie received many compliments and is well-made. The blue really stands out, although not as much as the picture would have you believe. Unfortunately, the pocket square was folded during shipping and had crease lines in it."
4.0,Bottoms were too big but top was just right
4.0,The small just fit my son who is 5'9&#34; and 120lbs. Order up a size if you want them to fit a bit loose/long.
4.0,"I love the design and fabric of this wallet. It fits all of my cards, cash, and coins. The only thing it doesn’t fit is my phone (iPhone 7). Which is a disappointment given that is the purpose of the front pocket. But the pros outweigh that con."
4.0,"The necklace & pendant I received are different from the one shown in the pictures. Instead of a clean silver finish, it is the antique finish pendant. Nonetheless, a stunning piece. The chain is short, so I switched it with a 20' sterling silver chain. I love this item, very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Roomy, fits my needs."
4.0,I teach aerobics classes...fun messages for my &#34;aerobiteers&#34;.
4.0,It's a fun top if you do CrossFit. It is a little too sheer though.
4.0,Would have preferred gold but like as it is.
4.0,I really like it but it is a little snug and I ordered a size up expecting it to be that way.  So maybe 2 sizes up would of worked out better.  It's just not long enough.
4.0,"My husband tried out some of these type rings recently so I was happy to try some out also. We have our wedding bands tattooed on so we never wear actual rings, but we thought it would be nice to have options that wouldn't get damaged. For me this was a great set. We do outdoor stuff daily. Between swimming at the lake, fishing, and our garden I love that I don't have to worry about these being ruined.<br /><br />I ordered size 7, they fit perfectly.  I wore one to the beach and into the ocean with no issues. The only complaint I have about them is their thickness. They just feel too thick at times. I've gotten use to it over the last few days, but they are actually thicker than my husband's. So that is the only real problem. Otherwise they look nice.<br /><br />I got this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I am in no way affiliated with this company, and I was not obligated to give a high rating."
4.0,Got this for my son and he loves it wish there was a way to erase but overall cool concept
4.0,"If you are needing 1/2 size, do it. I got an 8 and 9, needing 8 1/2. 8 too small and 9 too large. Sizing seems fairly exact. Cute, though and comfy."
4.0,"As you can see I am a bit of a heavy bloke (6', 16 1/2 stone), so I was a bit concerned with the Chinese sizes being able to fit. I would normally wear a US XL. The recommended size was a Chinese 2XL but due to the pot on my belly, I ordered the Chinese 3XL (per the size chart recommendation), in both top and bottom and they fit great. Very Comfortable. I would say if you are over 6' 3"" or my height and a bit heavier, this may not be the product for you. I have a small amount real estate in the waiste but not much.<br /><br />The padding in the bib pants are tremendously good so far. Only about 2 hours worth of riding but so far the most comfortable out of the bibs I have. Also, seems like the set will hold up well. The Zips are durable enough, even when stretched over my frame and did not feel as though they will tear any time soon.<br /><br />Only Complaint... The top is quite breezy. Winter would be a stretch. Fall for sure. Even as I worked up a sweat it was quite chilly and I had to put on a wind vest. It is -6 C out here in Michigan. And the Color is a bit more greyish or graphite in color, which is to be expected.<br /><br />Please thus far, to say the least. Would recommend."
4.0,This bikini would have been great if it wasn't for the fact that the bottoms are a bit big even though it's a thong. Like it has too much fabric and looks a bit bulky. The top is cute and the material is comfy and everything else but the thong is great. But it's still a very cute bikini.
4.0,I watch similar to this one in junior high school. Recently found the instructions to that watch in some paperwork. Missing the days of simplicity. I stumbled across this watch. The strap is too small for me. So I ended up strapping it to a backpack or anything else I can.
4.0,"In looking at this item, I was almost certain that this would be the kind of bag and kind of decor that a younger member of the family would have found instantly appealing.  What surprised me more is that the older member of the family actually laid claim to this bag (though hasn't switched to making it their primary bag) and no they couldn't have it.<br /><br />The decor on this bag is colorful and appealing, and the bag itself seems to offer plenty of utility and usage.<br /><br />Smell (which is an issue I've seen and experienced in the past when it came to purses/bags for Mrs. Terpfan1980 or the next generation of potential users) wasn't off-putting or distracting at all.<br /><br />4 solid stars from the potential users in the household here."
4.0,They are so cute! The only thing that my son didnt like about them is that they are so easy to slip off his feet.
4.0,The band is a perfect fit.  My only issue is the finish of the band is a matte rubber and my old band was a shinney rubber. Still looks good.
4.0,"The dress is cute and has a nice shape, the material is substantial and not thin.  I'm short so it's a bit long on me, but I love the color and am going to keep it."
4.0,"I have no complaints about these bras, I would definitely buy more. I’m a 34D, and bought a medium. They fit great, and give plenty of support for a good workout."
4.0,Nice bright colors and decent price!
4.0,"So far, I've only used a couple of the tools.  My watch band was too big for the link remover so I used the band holder which worked but was a little difficult to hold steady.  Beware of the pin punches as mine bent as I was using it.  However, the collections is pretty much everything you need in a nice storage case and I was able to easily remove a couple of links from my Invicta watch."
4.0,Love it! Its been on vacation with me several times since I purchased it. Its comfortable and its really nice.
4.0,i love these dresses they are so easy to wear to any function
4.0,no glass in the lenses but awesome just the same!
4.0,I loved these sunglasses.  So fun to wear and my granddaughter love them so much I ordered a pair for her.
4.0,"Fits great, perfect for a low key night out"
4.0,"Adorable summer dress, but the elastic around the top wasn't sewn on properly."
4.0,Not as easy on/off as claimed.
4.0,"Not the best fitting case, it also makes my phone look a lot bigger. It doesn't completely fit around the sides like most cases do. Also, pretty difficult to use the side sound buttons. I probably won't be purchasing again."
4.0,"Nice dress, especially for the price. Material is very light and soft. I ordered a large based on size chart but usually wear a medium. There is definitely some stretch to the dress so I may have been able to do a medium but I’m keeping the large bc I still think it looks nice. Great casual dress for dinner"
4.0,this was purchased as a gift for a friend. It is cute and seems to be well made and priced right
4.0,Thin light and great price
4.0,"Very small. Plain and simple, cute."
4.0,I’m a size small/ medium in clothes. 125-135 lbs depending on the time of year. 5 foot. Medium is what I got and I fit just fine. Looks a bit boxy due to the pockets. You’ll also want to find something to keep your tatas covered. I used a safety pin because it’s a very low cut.
4.0,"A little boxy if you’re lean/ good color/breathable/ little short if you’re tall, but works."
4.0,"Very nice, attractive and sturdy."
4.0,Since I've started wearing it and still going to the gym I've lost some girth so its beginning to hang. I would buy again.
4.0,The color shade blue is a little bit different then the picture. But I like it!
4.0,"Material is comfortable and the pattern is bright. My only issue is when you bend over the pattern stretches making them slightly see through. I am 5'2, 120 and usually wear a size small so that's what I ordered. If I got a medium, the transparency may not be an issue. Overall happy with the fit so I'm not trading in."
4.0,"Yes these are cheap, but gorgeous as a set."
4.0,"I love using this for groceries! I fully realize that is not what most people use a backpack for...but in living in a huge city without a car this is perfect for me. The backpack is just big enough to have the styrofoam trays of meat fit flat on the bottom and then I can stack the rest of my groceries on top. Much easier than dealing with canvas totes and once the groceries are on my back I hardly feel like I'm carrying anything on my walk home. I also use it to carry a change of clothes for the gym. It is super lightweight and definitely water resistant and so it cleans up very easily.<br /><br />The reviews that complain about the quality/durability - I can fully understand why they're not satisfied. I would NOT buy this for any extensive hiking. Carrying food and water bottles, sure.  But the nylon/polyester material is truly paper-thin and I would not recommend that you try carrying more than 20-25lbs in it. I would not even use this for textbooks really...but it does exactly what I need it to so I'm thrilled with it."
4.0,These are super cute. They fit my newborn but can also stretch to grow with him. They keep his little legs warm. He was born almost 10 pounds and they fit nice and loose but at 20 pounds it still fits a little more perfect. Only thing is I washed it and kinda fuzzied so i turn them inside out when washing so far not so bad.
4.0,Very pretty. A little long as I am 4’10 I like the thickness on the boob part and I wish it was like that through the entire dress since it is see throughish on the bottom but overall well made.
4.0,really pretty perfect for hot days. I get lots of compliments...would give 5 stars but it seems to have a smell that hasn't gone away yet after  washing
4.0,"the quality is pretty nice and incredibly soft. the color is really good and the price for it is really good. dont zip with this jacket it just doesn't work (as a style not the zipper by the way). another thing, don't wear it when it's raining and never mix colors with this jacket. You'll ruin the jacket if you mix and colors (trust me I have). The color is really white and well done so if you mix it with any by accident or whatsoever it'll ruin it.<br /><br />tldr; good jacket go get it."
4.0,Just as it appears.  My great granddaughter loves it!
4.0,"Overall I'm very happy. It's beautiful and the top feels secure but sexy. The skirt is flowy but not little girlie: perfect for church, a night out or in my case a brides maid dress.<br /><br />A couple things to be aware of.<br /><br />The dress came in a paper bag packaging so you may want to plan on washing and drying it to get wrinkles out before wearing.<br /><br />I am 5'4&#34; 114lbs and my bust is nearly 53&#34;. I bought a medium when I usually wear small in women's sizes and it fits me perfectly. Please use the sizing chart provides!"
4.0,"Great equipment for leg day and leg work outs, very comfortable."
4.0,"Nice weight material. The shirt was larger than the old Russell of the same size, but after letting it dry in the dyer all the way, it shrunk to fit (just a tad large, but comfortable). it appears clothes in general are larger than they were some time ago."
4.0,"Good watch. The only thing I don't like is that the strap isn't very strong, and if you catch it on something while doing anything strenuous it can easily snap. My last one broke, and the one I'm currently wearing has a gash going 3/4 of the way from one side of the strap to the other, so it's on its last legs."
4.0,Perfect for my teen son
4.0,The sweatshirt is very nice but make sure you go up at least 2 sizes.
4.0,excellent scarfs. printed on only 1 side;
4.0,"I loved this wig when I took it out of the package.  The fibers feel silky-smooth, the wig is full, and the color is brilliant, but unfortunately, it starts to get tangled very quickly.  I tried to comb it out with a wide-toothed wig comb after wearing it, but it continued to get more tangled and rough.  I will probably cut it shorter next time I use it, to remove most of the tangled part, but I don't think I will get many more uses out of it.  I think the curl in the design encourages the tangling.  A straight style might not have this much of a problem, but the curls are part of the appeal of this style.<br /><br />Note: I was probably especially hard on the wig, as I wore my costume to work, and had to pull the wig back into a low ponytail to keep my hair off my face.  That is probably very hard on the fibers.  You may have better luck!"
4.0,"I like the style as far as a sports bra goes, it's one of the better looking and fitting ones"
4.0,"I like the comfy fabric and they fit great.  But on my body the legs seemed wider than on the model, and therefore a bit frumpy.  This is probably because I need petite length and the model is likely wearing the long length. They are described as straight leg, but perhaps a slight taper would be more flattering for us short gals."
4.0,My husband loves it! My only concern is it might not hold up for too long. We'll have to wait and see.
4.0,Liked that tanks were wicking but were a bit snug. I am size M/L in tank tops depending on cut thus I bought L to wear by themselves with my hiking shorts. Ended up wearing them under tank tops for yoga and exercise activities.  I would suggest buying a size up if u want to wear them by themselves versus layering.
4.0,Good piece of clothing. Will order another color.
4.0,"These are very comfortable, but after a couple of washes, it's a bit looser."
4.0,I really liked these pants so comfortable but run small and in length  I'm 5'8.
4.0,"I'm a girl who wanted loose pants to wear over workout cloths on way to/from gym on cold days. Reading other reviews about the low rise seat, I knew the small would fit perfect (fits like a ladies 8). Haven't washed them yet, but they are warm and soft!"
4.0,"I am 4'11 and about 130, I got a medium because I am curvy; it fits great when you first put it on but expands after a few hours of swimming, no big deal, but take that into account."
4.0,"Some how it looks different in the photo,fits my face nicely"
4.0,Love this hat. Mostly because it is packable and folds flat though maintains a decent shape. I took it on vacation twice and it really protected my face from the sun without being so floppy it covered my eyes. Only issue is that leather tie keeps falling off so I had to go without it for a while.
4.0,"I absolutely loved this dress, although I think I should've ordered a small instead of a medium bc it was a little big in the chest area for me. I'm 5'0 130 lbs and I'm not really top heavy. This was perfect to wear to the beach back in July. I plan on purchasing other colors."
4.0,Bought as a Xmas gift
4.0,"Looks nice, just a little bigger than I wanted. Great quality!"
4.0,Love.  Some are stuck together but they are great
4.0,"These are really cute little boots. My daughter loves them and it's well made. I love that we had no issues with size or comfort. She is really into this print and we have many cheetah print shoes but she loves boots the best. It looks nice with so many different things. Romper, dress, pants, leggings."
4.0,Hat is very cute. Nice size. Only complaint is that one chin strap broke immediately as I tried to detach it.
4.0,"little miffed that there isn't a light on each side of the watch for total illumination when you press the button, but one is still enough to make it entirely readable in darkness. killer watch for the price."
4.0,"Cute, but it was a little small and the fabric isn't to giving as to elasticity."
4.0,"The color is pretty, the fit is perfect.  The only complaint I have is that the sleeves should be tapered more.  They were a little wider than I like.  I had that fixed already from my alterations lady.  Super soft."
4.0,"My daughter loved necklace. It was very pretty.  The only problem I had was trying to track my order, not enough shipping info givin but got in time for Christmas."
4.0,"I purchased this to wear as a tunic, but it is long enough to wear as a dress as it comes above the knee, but not too short (I am 5'6&#34;).<br /><br />It is more of a &#34;swing'&#34; type of A-line dress with it being more fitted at the top that is wider at the bottom (like the letter &#34;A&#34;) and flattering for most figure types as it can show off your assets while still hiding your flaws.  The only thing if you are a bit busty, the piecing at the top is a bit off and can give you for of a maternity dress/top look, but you can easily disguise it by throwing on an infinity scarf<br /><br />The material is comfortable and wash and wear and not too thin of a material, but not overly heavy either,  The ad indicates it is made out of 95% polyester and 5% spandex."
4.0,Super cute. Fun pattern. Good quality  Super great if ur hippy!!  But absent that it runs pretty big. So go down a size.
4.0,"Fit well, not as comfortable as other brands"
4.0,these worked out.  did fine in washing machine after. so many people asked me about these in airports. so many compliments
4.0,works well. I forget this is in all the time. I had one bend on me and dig into my ear one night. I got drunk and bashed my head against a wall. Hurts to get punched on also. Nice product stays nice looking. Have been wearing it for a few years now.
4.0,They are good and they can break easily but don't forget its cheap.
4.0,Nice! There are many categories I don’t need though. Would buy again
4.0,"way too  big  for earring,  They are beautiful, but j just too big  for me only"
4.0,I love these sun glasses they  make you stand OUT
4.0,"They fit perfectly.  Wore them at least 7 times but strap already broke.  Would recommend, they are cute, comfortable but are plastic."
4.0,Great face but band was a little tricky to adjust.  My son liked it so it is really unisex.
4.0,The color is great. The dress wrinkles easily though.
4.0,"I was expecting a brighter green color from the picture but still a great sock that I gifted to friend, and he loves them. He's partial to Weatens tho..."
4.0,It looks well made - but I am not absolutely sure I like it being so boxy. It takes getting used to.<br />The strap is well sewed - which can make or break a purse - tacky or elegant.
4.0,"Good medium support sports bra. Classic fit with lots of stretch. If you are between sizes, you could easily size down for more support or up for more<br />Comfort. My only beef is that the elastic is the kind that gets crunchy and breaks down quickly after a couple of runs through the dryer so I would recommend line drying."
4.0,"Very pretty. I thought they were bigger because of the picture but they were a but smaller than expected. Overall, nice earrings and fast shipping."
4.0,"I'm a US xl so I read the reviews and ordered a 5X, It fits perfectly. I love you!"
4.0,beautiful shoe.  the heel is a little higher than I have had previously with Reiker so they were not as comfortable for me.  Will wear them when I don't expect to walk too much.
4.0,"These are great earrings, simple but pretty. They do catch the light but that’s hard to capture in a photo. They are the perfect size, not too big or small.  They are going to be my new default gold earring!<br /><br />The only negative I have is that they rattle a little when you touch them. I’m guessing the stones aren’t a perfect fit in the setting, but it won’t stop me from wearing them on a regular basis."
4.0,"Great workbag, durable bottom. Only wish the shoulder strap was detachable by a clasp."
4.0,"I really like this shirt.  It's nice and flowy.  Thinner material, but I like it for the summer.  I would recommend ordering your normal size and it will flowy still."
4.0,I fill these with Hershey Kisses and drop them off with a packet of information about our hotel to prospective clients.  They love it!
4.0,Fits the IPhone 5s without a problem. So far so good!
4.0,"Cute, but definitely made for tall, leggy ladies. Looks odd on my short body (5'3). Swishy sounds wherever I go."
4.0,They look awesome! Threads are really small so be careful not to strip them. Came with nice little pouch to carry them in and a FREE bracelet. It's a brown braided looking bracelet that is very nice looking and adjustable to the size of your wrist. Product feels really nice I just wish the post was a little smaller but still good. No complaints really besides shipping time(2 weeks) but they're from China so it's expected.
4.0,I ordered an XL for my brother in law but the XL is cut small. Needless to say he will never be able to put it in the dryer. I suggest to anyone buying this shirt to buy the next size up.
4.0,The wallet is so nice I luv it goes great w my bag I purchased
4.0,Great dress! Fabric wrinkles a little easily but I get a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,Used these gloves for Tahoe on spring break loved that it was still warm and manageable to move around with . Kept hand nice and dry .
4.0,"Received this watch a few weeks ago and I am happy with it.  I previously had many watches like this growing up so there is a nostalgia factor. I have other more expensive watches but find myself wearing this a lot.<br /><br />PROS: Cheap, durable, no frills simple watch.<br />CONS: the light function isn't very bright but will get the job done in the dark (and even low light). My previous one had a metal clasp (thing you fasten the band with) with the rubber band, this had a black plastic one, but its not a big deal."
4.0,"The glasses do feels like well worth the price i would but them again if these will ever brake . For people like me who cant decide what lens color to get , green lens is great cause it makes less strain on your eyes ."
4.0,"Good fit.  Goes higher up my leg than I had hoped.  Provides a &#34;mild&#34; compression that really helps when I'm walking.  I use it under socks with athletic shoes and I even wear it with my Tevas.  It's not a cure-all, pain reliever for Planter Fascitis (wish there was one), but it does help."
4.0,Use to play indoor pickleball.
4.0,"This is the second one I’ve bought. I gave the other to a friend. It won’t last forever. and the leather straps or snaps can come off, but for the price you could buy a new one each year. I love this bag. Perfect size for a modern compact laptop."
4.0,Simple with no frills and serves it's purpose. The colors are fast and don't fade. I don't know about looks as I'm an old bones biker and looks don't matter.
4.0,"This product is amazing quality, but yes it does run smaller than American sizes. I’m 4’10 and about 95 pounds. The small fits me perfectly and I have a 22 inch waist and a 28 inch underbust. They are comfy for sleeping in especially in the summer, and the tail is removable so you don’t have to worry about uncomfortable poking while sleeping. It’s so very soft, my only complaint is shipping experience, I do not know if it’s because of the product itself or the mail services but it kept saying it would arrive and it went back and forth from being close and far from arriving, which was very confusing and took 11 days of “arriving today” for it to actually arrive.<br /><br />**But overall, it’s amazing quality, super comfy, but shipping was weird and it runs in asian sizes so beware if you’re a small in American size you may want a medium."
4.0,This shoe horn is a good basic extra long shoe horn.  Seems best suited for use while standing.
4.0,The designs are amazing and the material is great. The only thing is that it is a little uncomfortable for me and my nine year old son. It was a little too tight for a child and an adult behind the ears. Maybe if it were adjustable straps then it would have fit better.
4.0,Pretty and sparkly and seems sturdy.  It does run small.  My wrist is 6&#34; and it's snug.
4.0,Comfy and wonderful!
4.0,"Hoody looks amazing. It’s a little snug, but otherwise fine."
4.0,I ordered a size up and it fit good but I thought the top would be at least at my mid stomach but it was about 3 inches above.... it is definitely a shot crop top.  The fabric is cool and comfy
4.0,Cute and my daughter loves it but the bracelet always comes loose.
4.0,This suit is great for the price. Party City and other places like it sell just the jacket for $10 more. Used for a costume in a show. Painted the fabric. The material absorbs paint quickly so go light and paint in layers.
4.0,Great for price.  Not too dark like some cheap sunglasses. Good for the price.  Won't cry if I lose them.
4.0,The stones are very nice and I like this combination. Too bad the elastic band is too tight. After a few minutes it felt uncomfortable. I had to return this one. I bought several items already from Amorwing and their stones are of very good quality. Customer service is impeccable.
4.0,Love it I want another one 👌
4.0,"Super cute and comfy. The material isn't what I expected, kinda silky like basketball shorts but good quality and quick delivery"
4.0,"The hat's &#34;TAXI&#34; is off just as you see it in the picture.  Should I give it one less star because of it?  Not sure, the picture is 100% correct...  The hat is not adjustable, but since I have a large head and it barly fits, I guessing it would fit most men just fine.  Ladies may have to pin it."
4.0,I really loved this dress. It was very comfy and the material was soft and washed well. Also very flowy and long which I love. My only complaint was the coverage on the boobs was not good for me. I'm 5'3 220 pounds and 9 months pregnant. (Boobs are a 40dd). I ended up putting a shirt on over because I was literally bursting out of the top. But other than that it was perfect! I got a xl.
4.0,I purchased these for my 7 year old son who has large feet.  I read the sizing information and decided a medium would be best.  They arrived and they are HUGE.  I wear a women's 10 wide shoe and these fit me with room to spare.  I re-ordered a small and hope they will fit!  They are super cute and very colorful though!
4.0,Fighting as expected
4.0,"I thought that this would come in a cotton/rayon material, but it arrived as a thicker, polyester material. I think it makes it look a little cheap. I am 5' 5&#34; and 200 pounds. I bought the large and it fits great, it is loose and has pockets! I normally wear a size 16 in pants and XL in dresses and tee shirts normally. The quality of the way it is made is nice, I just wish the material was different."
4.0,"These are cool, I like that they're different than other scale prints, just wish the fabric was more comfortable. These are like a less stretchy swimsuit material. Definitely not warm."
4.0,"Very cute, but definitely run small. I'm usually an 8.5 across the board in all shoes, but after reading reviews about how small they ran, I ordered them 2 sizes bigger. I got a 10, and they fit perfectly. I am NEVER a 10. They're a little big around the ankle too, but not a deal breaker for me. They're very comfortable."
4.0,"This watch is really nice and unique. The face doesn't have any numbers , just dash marks so you will need to know a clock face. Which makes this watch different. You can see all the way through and look at the inner gears working. Although it doesn't have a front and back clasp to open and close, it really does catch people's eye.The body of the watch is perfectly round and looks like a piece for a gear to go into. Almost like it should be inside the watch itself. I think thats why I enjoy this watch so much."
4.0,"Comfortable, good fit and breathable."
4.0,Too small but it's a beautiful hat
4.0,A little bit smaller would be better but can put it in my levi front pocket and it is well protected.
4.0,I like the style and the shirts fit better than most on thus site I bought several colors
4.0,I already owned this product. Have been very happy with the quality
4.0,"I bought this a couple months ago to replace a messenger-style briefcase, and so far, I'm happy. The materials - leather, metal, canvas - all seem to be of good quality and strength. The leather isn't thin and doesn't feel like it's going to come apart. The zippers are reasonably tough, and it's nice that it unzips down the sides so you can open it up really far if needs be. The shoulder strap is good - sturdy and plenty long for me. It's got a number of pockets inside, but I do wish that it had a few smaller pockets. But that's a minor complaint. Overall, I'm quite happy with this item, particularly for the price I paid."
4.0,They were okay for the price and purchased my size but the foot indentations made them uncomfortable. Delivery time was very quick. The seller was great with communication and a resolution.
4.0,Too big. Events
4.0,"I'm an idiot sometimes, and I just can't figure out the best way to wear these.  I'm super used to the Apple band, and I guess my brain just can't handle change.  These are nice and soft and look GREAT.  Now if I can just figure out the best way to wear them.  lol"
4.0,"I think that my head might be a bit too small for this cap.  I have a shaved head so that might also have something to do with it.  Functionally, it works well but wish it came in a tad smaller size.  Not tighter, just smaller."
4.0,"Fits great , love the material, not sure about the white lace"
4.0,"Very pretty, the bottoms fots perfectly but the top is way too small. This suit is for sitting around the pool only. If you raise an arm a breast will come out of the top, lol"
4.0,Great basic girls leotard. Quality you would expect from Capezio. Shipping got screwed up but Amazon made it right!
4.0,"I like dresses in the summer. This was inexpensive, nothing fancy but good enough for everyday wear."
4.0,Shirt looks good but I need smaller size
4.0,"Love the pattern and the way it fits me, but the elastic around the top come undone the first time I wore it. I ended up having the elastic attached to the dress with safety pins to finish out the day. I am going to re sew a different strand of elastic, better quality and hopefully get to wear it a couple more times."
4.0,"sleeves are too tight, dress it too long and can't tell the front from the back, but besides that it's really cute."
4.0,"Nice romper, do not size up. I am inbetween a small and med 5'1 124lbs. Bc of reading a review i got a med and it was more like a large. But nice material, may reorder."
4.0,"Granted, the pug face on this case is adorable. How could it not be? I got this as a gift for my sister who has a rescued pug. The case is sturdy but is basically a small eyeglass-shaped hinged cookie tin with a felt lining. It seems to be made well but I guess I didn't read the description closely enough to realize the case wasn't fabric covered. I am worried that the finish may scratch easily, the way cookie tins do, but the finish does appear to be of better quality. Had I known it was a metal case ... well, I would have ordered it anyway. It's too cute and I know my sister will love it. She'll have to let me know how it holds up."
4.0,Different and fashion forward her steam punk
4.0,I love the bra and will be purchasing more but I do feel the cup size runs a bit small. This is my first sports bra so maybe that's the norm? Either way the bra is great. I like the support.
4.0,Bought for my husband who loves that it is waterproof and light as he always walks the course however within weeks the zipper on the waterproof cover broke.
4.0,Comfortable and  just what I wanted.
4.0,So cute! Four of five stars because it is not really comfortable to carry on the shoulder. The straps aren’t very long.
4.0,Fit my newborn nicely. Washed up well.
4.0,"Overall it fit just as expected, exactly like the photos of other reviews. I ordered the dark gray. It wasn't as dark a gray as it looked like it'd be in the picture. Maybe just a tad bit lighter. It's for a cosplay, and I needed it to be a dark gray. Overall, though, it'll work just fine for what I need it for. I'm 5'1"" and roughly 160lbs and ordered the XL. It came down to just above my knees. The dress itself isn't super flattering, but that was fully expected."
4.0,It’s a really cute purse. All the grommets really make the purse very unique looking. I actually saw a purse very similar to this at the Micheal Kors store for many times more than what they are asking for this purse. And it’s my understanding that Coach has a similar one as well. Upon receiving the purse I wished prior to ordering I could have seen the way the “wrap” on the tassel just appears to be glued there; I wondered how long that will stay secure (I will include pictures). The seam sewing looks good. There was some glue and light scratches on the purse upon receipt. Nothing that was a flat out deal breaker. Worth the price.
4.0,could be a tiny bit larger for credit cards to easily slip in and out of..I struggle to get them in and out.
4.0,I like these pants. I've been wearing them for years.  Glad I can find them on-line because in stores the pants aren't available.
4.0,This is an adorable time piece! Reading other customer reviews made it very easy to figure out that you open the face by pushing the top part in and set the time by gently pulling out the smaller knob on top of that (and then turning it of course). Another reviewer said to assist the face open to help the hinges last. It is very small which I love and seems to be keeping time just fine! Great purchase
4.0,"Loved the look. It was a little larger than expected. I went based upon reviews and never had to do any cinching as it came cinched as tight as tight as it goes already and was still a bit big. I really wish I would've bought a Size Smaller because my weight fluctuates. But it looked GREAT for Halloween And my Steampunk Costume. I added a bit of my old Jewelry as adornments. And a fluffy petticoat underneath the Skirt with Safety Pins to make it a bit Smaller to fit my waist. I, also, bought my shirt thru Amazon.<br />FYI: I am 5' and was around 132lbs at the time of the pic and a 34DD and I believe I bought the XXL based on reading ALL the various Reviews. I weigh 5lbs less now AND SWIM in it, because at 5'0"" those 5 lbs are significant."
4.0,My niece loves it and fit as expected.
4.0,It is really good.... cute baby outfit
4.0,"These scrubs are great, especially the top. When you have to have your top tucked in for surgery, the breast pocket comes in handy. The first thing I would change I would make is to put the back pocket on the right instead of the left, threw me off the first day I wore them. The second change I would make is to add another cargo pocket on the other leg."
4.0,"Super cute but watch the band, doesn't want to stay in the buckle."
4.0,"The top is smaller than the bottoms, I’m a 38DD and it doesn’t fit me. The bottoms were ok though."
4.0,"Good, pretty and fit!<br />I like it :)"
4.0,"Cheap quality, the necklace is much smaller than the picture makes you think. But for the price, does the job for a Halloween party."
4.0,"I have used this for a couple of days now and have been very impressed. It does not roll up like others I have previously purchased and it stays in place.  Great plus is this is machine washable! It gives support to your back as well so if you have back issues, this may be a good purchase for you.  Item was purchased with a promotional discount or received for free in exchange for testing and giving my honest unbiased opinion of this product. If you found my review helpful please feel free to vote helpful for me below. Thank you"
4.0,I thought the largest hoop would be bigger.
4.0,"Beautiful Rings. However, they are a bit lower quality then I was hoping. Some of the gems are a touch off center."
4.0,Exactly as Shown.<br />Definitely up the child's size.<br />I'm glad I did.
4.0,A little too heavy for me. Otherwise great.
4.0,"As others have mentioned, this is a light, casual material. I didn't really like the rolled hem look either. I ordered this dress among many to try for a funeral and this one worked the best, but even in black, I felt a little too dressed-down/informal because of the fabric. It was flattering and comfortable, but definitely not for formal occassions such as a funeral, formal parties or cocktail attire. I probably wouldn't wear it for a formal church service or business casual, either. It's great for casual wear and contemporary church service type attire, such as what you might wear as a baby shower guest."
4.0,Nice and colorful but it doesn’t stay up with mask on
4.0,Not the most durable - one broke with not *that* much abuse.  But they kept the dust out of my eyes!
4.0,I'm 5 2&#34; 160 pds and 2x runs small thank God I got 2 of them.The other 3x fit great.<br />I don't like your size chart it doesn't match up to U S A. Charts But I love the 3x one.<br />By the way I wear a miss size 12/14 a long ways 3x.  Great if it fits.
4.0,they do the job and were a lot cheaper then buying them at a store.
4.0,Stiff leather pants
4.0,There is elastic in the cuff that doesn't  allow for any swelling. They have a snug fit when the elastic was removed. So far they are holding up well to the washing machine and the non skid grips are perfect for slick floors.
4.0,I may not own a purple Challenger now but I did own a Challenger back in the day. Now I have a cool key fob that works really well for my needs. It is lighter weight than my old fob and I appreciate that.
4.0,Prices is right.
4.0,The band is a little short - Had to use last hole.
4.0,"The band is very sturdy and comfortable, although the velcro is slowly deteriorating. I remove the watch once daily and I'm noticing some velcro falling off when I remove it each time. Still staying secure on my wrist but over time I'll have to keep an eye on it."
4.0,"The shirt was made a little cheap, but overall my daughter looked so cute!"
4.0,"It's a fun and sparkly bracelet. No one is going to think it's made of gold, much less real diamond. But I'm also not rich. I enjoy having it on my wrist."
4.0,"This product met my expectations.  It looks nice, but does not have as much weight to it as I would like"
4.0,"I bought the cover for 2021 Silverado. The cover doesn't fit as tight as I would like, the strap that goes around the receiver fits really tight. Drove through the car wash and the cover came about half way out but the strap is tight so I don't think it will come off in the wash? Other than the car wash it stays in. I live in Michigan so I bought the cover to help keep the salt sludge out of my receiver. As for price, it is a good deal for 2. I guess time will tell."
4.0,"They've started to shrink a little despite being hand washed and dried flat, but it's not all that noticable unless I walk a lot in one go."
4.0,I like the dress. The only thing it was way to big. Maybe wear a belt with it or something. Just make sure to review the sizing chart.
4.0,"Nicely made jersey. Looks and feels great.  Sizing is small and the arm holes are a bit off. For the price, this is great."
4.0,Worked perfectly for my party! Didn't rate it full 5 stars because it came with a pearl broken off. Would suggest better shipping methods to ensure that the product is protected properly.
4.0,"Images are not as clear as expected; they’re in a pretty low resolution. Also the colors are not as bright, all kinda dusty. But still pretty cute I must say. Pretty comfy too."
4.0,The ke se came out very easily ! After only 3 month !!
4.0,Nice!!! Looks like it will last a long time.
4.0,"More sheer than it should be, but cute"
4.0,Just what I was after for hot days. Fit great.
4.0,Easy to wear. Very comfortable.
4.0,"Nice, substantial fabric. Very soft. The colors are good and just as I expected from the pics online. I like to layer a tshirt under my hoodies, so I bought a large rather than my usual medium (I’m 5’6”, 140 lbs), but I wish I had stuck with the medium. The hoodie is plenty roomy enough for layering without ordering up."
4.0,"Nice for sleep, lightweight. Did not wash well the first time- make sure the knots in the ties are secure otherwise they pull apart in the wash."
4.0,"This cloak is actually very nice for what you pay for it and absolutely deserves at least four stars. I like the clasp which holds it together and thought it was a nice touch. Unfortunately, I wish it was a little thicker but that's me. While it is certainly thicker than t-shirt material and I do think it will be durable, I am not certain how long it will hold up. So for anyone looking for a cloak for cosplay or a Renaissance Faire, I highly recommend it."
4.0,"The shorts are cute, reasonably well made for the price, and they fit as expected. But - the fabric is very thin. If you are using these as a swimsuit cover up, they will be excellent. If you are wearing them as actual shorts to go running around - be aware that the fabric is very thin. If you get a lighter color - make sure you wear correspondingly light colored underthings, or whatever black or polka dot or striped unders you have on will show RIGHT THROUGH.  That being said, I am still giving up to a 4 because they are as cute and comfortable as they are.<br /><br />As lon as you take into account the thinness of the fabric, they are great shorts for the price."
4.0,I get lots of compliments when wearing this bracelet
4.0,I should have got a large. I'm a womens size 6/8 jeans
4.0,Hot it for my girlfriend to replace matthe one she lost. She loved it.
4.0,I'm constantly getting compliments on this glasses case. My glasses fit perfectly in it.<br />The only complaint is have is the liner inside has separated frome the case. It's still stays in place but occasionally will come apart. Still happy with my purchase!
4.0,I nornally wear smalls but I ordered a medium and it fits like a small. The top is a tad big. Other is gorgeous and its everything I expected.
4.0,Looks very nice for the price.  One is very hard to clip shut.
4.0,The Windowpane® Women's Sexy Zebra Print Side Ties Underwear Comfort Lace Panties Briefs arrived wrapped up in a plastic bag inside of a box and undamaged. There were no snags pulls or loose strings. They look very cute on that's for sure. I recommend tieing them ahead of time to get on then on tieing each side one at a time to get to a more comfortable snugness so they are not to tight or too loose. The lace is actually quite comfortable and soft as well as the print in the front very cute! The only thing I am not fond of is that even with the l/XL it barely even seems to cover the front which is I'm sure great for your other but does not help some one feel more comfortable in then I would have absolutely adored these with just a tiny bit more coverage. Bug if you are kk with something like that then I definitely recommend these other wise I would say maybe a different cut or bigger size.<br />* I  received this item at for free or discount in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.
4.0,I like the feeling of it. It is soft and comfortable but only negative part that it gets flat fast.
4.0,Got this earlier than expected which is always a plus. Very pretty very thin as I expected. How ever it is not as wide as expected or the picture makes it look. Still very hair with it for the price
4.0,"I purchased this item promptly after seeing how cheap it was.<br /><br />Upon receiving the sweater a couple weeks later, I noticed that I had received the burgundy colored sweater instead of the coffee colored sweater. I promptly filed a claim on amazon about the mistake, and the company responded promptly and shipped me the correct color free of charge. Needless to say, I am definitely impressed by their promptness and customer service.<br /><br />The sweater itself is of quite decent quality, and it fits me very well.<br /><br />Great price, great customer service."
4.0,Material was stretchier than expected but looks exactly like the picture
4.0,"Waist fit is ok. Length is kinda short. The other style is longer...maybe it says it's length and I just didn't catch that before ordering. Other than that, good shorts"
4.0,Love it just wish I could put it in my ear. Sadly my ear is too small.
4.0,Love the color; not faded. Comfortable fit. Nice look on curves. Very flattering.
4.0,"A little larger than I expected, but great compacity. Seems very sturdy and well made. I recommend it to any EXO fan."
4.0,"Very cute and nice for the price. Good fit.  Does require some touch-up ironing, and one button fell off first wearing. Nice stretch to the fabric. Glad we bought it."
4.0,"Love these shoes. Good fit, very comfortable too."
4.0,Renegging my previous review:<br />The nike store said it was authentic the employee taught me how to reshape the hat. Gave it a try since it will most likely get dirty in the future and need hand washing. Spray all over with water bottle mister. Put hat low on the forehead and blow-dry while moving the drier constantly. She mentioned that you will need to do this a couple times. I still have one crease but I'm keeping it. It's a really pretty visor with no velcro. Don't dry in the drier.<br /> It was sent to me in a bag so It arrived damaged. But I'm revising the review because it's authentic and chic AF.
4.0,Sent it back laptop did not fit. .
4.0,Very nice. Charles.
4.0,Nice boots. I like the style.  Good business casual.
4.0,"It's cute, soft, and looks just like the picture. I ordered an XL and it was about the size of a Large. My only complaint. 😊"
4.0,"Beautiful. The bracelet came safely well packaged and on time.Most of all, it made my little grand daughter give me a huge smile and a big hug."
4.0,They were very pretty the shoes needs a buckle instead of the Velcro it doesn’t last long
4.0,"I would not call this a formal evening gown or prom dress unless you’re a free spirit such as myself. It isn’t high quality, however I absolutely love it Bc it has the look I was hoping for. It’s more of a “gypsy” type dress. Very thin but very comfy."
4.0,"These are ok. I have only worn the wings once, but I absolutely LOVE the studs by themselves. Beautiful!"
4.0,"Quality for the price , cool wearing ."
4.0,"Bought this for my girlfriend, she loves it and it looks good."
4.0,"As others have said, these do make things darker than normal sunglasses, but you can still easily see when looking through them. They are decent quality, but you can't expect perfection when you get a 3 pack for $6 (I purchased them 2 years ago and 2 of the 3 pairs are still going strong). They are also fairly comfortable. Can easily bend the frames without breaking if they get uneven. Good bargain."
4.0,I got these for a philtrum piercing that I can’t wear at work. I would have just left it out but it kept somewhat closing & was uncomfortable to reinsert. These are not bad! However I’m glad there’s multiple in a pack. I had a few instances where the top fell off during my day and was lost. So I’m now on my second pack of these. Pro: no one notices I have it in. They are very comfortable and flexible though.
4.0,Its a beautiful dress. I just wish it went by the exact measurements posted. Purchased a 3x and my normal size is an 16 to 18. I purchased the 3x to be safe and it very fitting with no wiggle room.
4.0,The dress is very nice. We followed the measurements listed and the dress was WAY TO BIG
4.0,"Fantastic dress for the price.  Wore it to a new year's Eve celebration. The sequins are beautiful. I purchased the black and gold one in size large. I'm 38D and size 10, and it fit a bit loosely but was perfect because the sequins did not irritate my skin anywhere. Loved it. Thanks."
4.0,2 pack of blue light blocking glasses. Both frames are the same shape with the key difference being its color as one is all black and the other is clear and transparent. The frames and lenses are lightweight plastic making them very comfortable to wear over the entirety of a workday.
4.0,Nice but difficult to tie first time
4.0,"I think that the shoes are absolutely adorable, but they are not for narrow feet. My daughter has a narrow foot and the toe box is way too high for her, even in athletic socks. These will probably be perfect for a child with a thicker foot. The design is comfortable enough for play and cute enough for a party dress. The tiny buckle is definitely for an older child so make sure that if you are buying for a four year old or younger that you are okay with putting them on and taking them off. I had to return them after trying them on, so I don't know how durable they are, but the fabric seems easy to wipe clean or throw in the wash. I would definitely recommend them based on our limited experience."
4.0,"Very nice, classy look."
4.0,Great sturdy little bag with tons of pockets. The bag is def more lavender in person than it is in the picture
4.0,"beautiful swimsuit, only thing is the jewel in the middle loses the gold color a little after a few wears in the salt water."
4.0,My son needed this for a 'slenderman' Halloween costume this year. It was perfect for what he needed it for but I took one star away because it was hard to see through at night even with streetlights.
4.0,Small bag.  Good for carrying small items for lunch that dont need to be kept cold or for a quick run to store to pick up a few small items and avoid bag tax.
4.0,I really like these glasses but they came all black and not with bamboo colored arms as stated and seen in the product description. I am ordering another pair in hopes they come they way they are shown. I like them so much I'm keeping the all black ones.
4.0,Very cute my daughter loved it. The chain was cheap but all in all it was worth it.
4.0,"I order these socks for the characters. The colors and characters look great, except for Rex. I order size 4 - 7for my 2 year old toddler, because of the reviews  and his current shoe size. My child is not tall nor big and yet these socks were way to small. I imagine they are best  for a 18m -1.5 toddler. In the photo, you can see how small it is compared to my 2 year old toddler current shock size."
4.0,Great fabric thick and colorful. It’s not a true high waist but it’s still great. Fits well. I’m going to buy other colors!
4.0,"It's a warm sweater for home I feel , it's kinda huge but other then that it's a good sweater to chill back in . Worth the price for something to be comfy in"
4.0,"I scored these with a promo code from my Facebook group, Bomb Deals-Promo Codes-Coupons... I think I paid $10 at the time and that was a great price!!!!!<br />I love these kind of socks. The rubber kept the socks from slipping. Definitely recommend them"
4.0,Nice quality belt. This is NOT a gun belt.
4.0,Great scarf for a gift when traveling.  Doesn't take up much space in your suitcase and scarves are always appreciated by the ladies.  Lovely colors too.
4.0,"I think this dress is super cute, it's a little bit big on me especially around the waist, but not too much bigger than it should be. It's comfortable and very light, and the pattern is super cool (looks like it does in the pic) the only thing is the material is sort of weird, its like a really thin smooth but sort of rough texture, but that doesn't make it uncomfortable, I just hadn't realized and was a little surprised."
4.0,I love the idea behind this. It’s a good gift. Doesn’t seem very sturdy but it’s beautiful
4.0,"Nice quality, will get lots of wear.  Runs a bit large."
4.0,Nice light material. Easy wear. Love it.
4.0,a little see-through​ but shorts fixed that problem.
4.0,A little shorter than expected but the fit is nice. Material is thick and warm yet soft and comfy.
4.0,Bag is a great size for carrying my laptop and all work stuff. Leather seems to be of good quality. The color is a cognac color and it's nice.
4.0,The quality is good although a littler bit larger than expected.
4.0,great product for the price. Very nice.
4.0,"I originally bought this coat for my daughter, her and I are built very different. I checked out the sizing chart several times and decided to choose the large but the day it shipped I noticed that I had ordered the extra large by accident. Being it was only days away from Christmas I decided to make the exchange after the holiday and sometimes things happen for a reason. Well luckily I did, when the coat arrived I pulled it out of the packaging, attached the fur hood piece, and tried it on, it fit me comfortably over my huge sweater, I knew it would never fit my daughter because the shoulder area runs small and if you are &#34;well endowed&#34; as my daughter is, there is no chance you are going to get your &#34;girls&#34; to fit inside! I loved the coat so I bought her another and kept this one for myself, I don't normally do something like this but the fit was perfect for my shape, just remember to buy at least one size bigger or even two, I normally wear a medium but the coat is very fitted and if you have any larger areas it might be a smart move, I'm not a large person but at 50 my backside isn't as tight as the good old days ;)<br /><br />On another note: I received an email that said I was the first one to buy this coat and they were offering me a credit for $15 if I tagged this with 5 stars, I would have given it 5 stars but I don't like to be bribed for a good rating and by the looks of all these reviews, I am not the first buyer!"
4.0,"I love the back. It's a little long and somewhat loose even though it hugs my body enough. I feel like if I wear it out, I won't be able to move around so much without exposing my butt"
4.0,"The wallet and design are very nice, but the wallet and pockets run smaller than other tri folds.  Too small to fit more than a couple of cards in. Had to return due to this"
4.0,"very unique jewelry.  Will try the 8mm next time, but the 6mm is good too."
4.0,"Thin and lite, very comfortable for sleepwear and lounging around the house."
4.0,"I love sunflowers,  so I thought this reasonable.  The only thing I didn't like was that the dress runs big. I ordered a size small and it feels like a large"
4.0,"Purchased this as a bday gift for my daughter’s godmother. Simple, classic, and looks just like the photo. Only wish it had a little more weight to it - it’s extemely light weight. Came with a little blank card for s note to receipient."
4.0,Fit a Lil big. Buy ur regular size. The belt needed a safety pin to make it stay in place. Overall was cute.  Put hairspray for the tulle to stay down.
4.0,"Material is a little thin but, I used this for a Halloween costume so it was okay for 1 day."
4.0,Great boot for my line of work
4.0,"Nice color, warm and nice looking."
4.0,Good band. I didn't really like the loops but it is strong.
4.0,"This dress is absolutely stunning and very light, comfortable to wear during the spring/summer.  I ordered the black and pink dress with the cherry blossoms. The dress can be worn with or without a petticoat, although with a petticoat you may seem to appear to be a little larger than you actually are. I am 5&#34;3, Bust 35, Waist 29, and wear a 34DD, and the medium fit perfectly. There were a few loose threads on the dress when it came but that's an easy fix with scissors. The colors for this are very accurate, and there is enough variety to accessorize and make different styles with the dress. Wouldn't buying from this seller again, this dress is comfortable and cute!"
4.0,"I really liked these shirts as an extra layer during the polar vortex that hits IL  in winter and the spring chills! These compression shirts did not ride up or snag easily as others I've tried have. In fact, they actually were long enough to cover my slight muffin top and thighs AND DID NOT ONCE (!!!!) RIDE UP MY BACK DURING AN 9 HOUR SHIFT AT WORK!!!! Loved it as I do a lot of bending, twisting, lifting, etc working retail. I will be adding more to my clothing repertoire in the near future (just wish more colors).<br /> The only thing I would caution is that you need to order a size larger than what you normally would even when it says 'true to size'.  I've used that piece of advice with almost all my clothes and it works (only with shoes/boots does the true to fit actually work)."
4.0,"I loved this top but unfortunately had to return. The ruched sleeves were great, the zipper was fun and unique, and the material was soft, but this is not as flattering with a bigger bust. I’m a 36DDD and the v-neck was too low to wear a bra, and the top had no support without a bra. Tape could be helpful but tape doesn’t work for me so I had to return."
4.0,"I love love love these shirts!!  They keep me warm and they don’t seem to leave “pit stains” because I have to wear 3 layers to keep warm so my arm pits get toasty warm and sweat.  I’ve had to throw away countless shirts because they either have pit stains or have a smell from sweating all the time.  These don’t seem to do that.  I only gave them 4 stars because the sleeves are a little short.  I like them to be long enough to go over my hand a little.  These don’t go anywhere near that.  I had bought a 3 pack of black, white and grey and the black and white ones do.  I was hoping the grey was a defect and these would, but they don’t 🙁.  I would have given them 5 stars if they did."
4.0,It looks exactly as it shows in the picture. Fits me well. I wish I would have got it a little bit bigger. My only problem with it is it did fade a lot in the wash. But that could be my fault
4.0,Very very nice but a bit too big.  I ordered a large and it fit a bit big.  Maybe when I was it it will be ok.
4.0,"We've just started riding our bikes again after a bit of a hiatus, and man did I forget about how sore your gluteus maxiimus can be after a short 5 mile ride! Trying these padding bike shorts I thought was worth a shot, after all, I had seen the ""real bike riders"" with them so I figured this amateur could benefit. I was right! They were snug fitting, yet still comfortable, breathable and made a huge difference in my ""seat"" comfort. They laundered very well, not twisting of the seems or shrinking - I only dried them for about 3-5 minutes as with most of my athletic wear I was concerned about the nylon being compromised from too much heat. I will most definitely purchase another pair."
4.0,"fits true to size, is every bit as cute as it looks.  is slinky-stretchy fabric.  I did size up to avoid a bodycon fit I dont have the figure for, glad I did.  it drapes over body nicely with no squeezing.  I love the appliques that cover the back of my hand, a real stand-out top.<br /><br />the reason for a 4 rather than 5 - it arrived crumpled into as plastic bag terribly wrinkled, cant even iron them out.  in desperation I hung it outside in the rain.  this trick usually works well for stubbornly wrinkled clothing that I wont put in dryer.  if the wrinkles are temporary from shipping I will buy the dk and lt blue also."
4.0,"works great, just wish it were thicker"
4.0,"Love it! I ordered an XXL and I am a 40D. Fit great, a little snug around the arms, but otherwise comfortable."
4.0,Just so bulky and wont lay flat on me but that could be a me thing.
4.0,Very helpful while sewing.  The needle seemed a bit wobbly but I could work around it.
4.0,I like it but I thought it was going to be bigger. But I guess  I'm happy with my cute butterfly
4.0,Bought this for a birthday party and I'll ask girls  have them on  We all like them
4.0,"My first impression: When I opened up the package, I really liked the case that the ear muffs came in. The case will allow the muffs to fit nice and snug with the rest of my gear, when I get a chance to go out on the range again, without fearing that they will get smashed or ripped. A dislike I have is that the material surrounding/cupping the ear looks a little cheap. My first response was, &quot;I hope these last longer then they look...&quot;<br /><br />The camouflage look is appealing look to me and upon trying them on, they fit comfortably over my large head. I'm looking forward to these replacing my ear plugs!"
4.0,They’re not as heavy as they look. I got a second pair and the color is different from the picture.
4.0,Great sun protection. Ran a little large but a couple of washings brought it to size.
4.0,very cute.  Used it for a photo booth - kid's loved them.  Only issue is keeping all the parts together...
4.0,"I really like this camisole.  I wanted a longer style that hit slightly above mid thigh, as I like to cover my tush and mu upper thigh when wearing leggings. This was the perfect length for me. It doesnt have a lot of stretch, but it's 95% cottonI so that was expected. If you get the right size, it should fit comfortably. I ordered a small and am 5'0&#34; 118 lbs, 34DD and wear a 2/4 for reference."
4.0,"very light, will be wearing it a lot."
4.0,"Lovely pattern and like the multiple pieces for the seasons.  Runs small, so I returned and ordered up a size."
4.0,They looked nice and I wish I could’ve kept them but they were the wrong gauge. But arrived super fast and looks good.
4.0,"The shirt is fantastic. Great quality and fits well. I am 6'2"" and 210ish and ordered the 17.5"" 36/37 size. It is both long enough on my torso and arms without being too baggy. A slim size would fit better but I couldn't find a slim in this collar style from anyone. I gave this four stars instead of five because the white collar is plastic instead of fabric. I would have only dinged 1/2 star for that if I could have. All in all, very happy."
4.0,This dress is gorgeous. The blue is gorgeous. It’s a little short in the front but it’s not too bad. received A Lot of compliments on at a holiday party
4.0,"SUPER CUTE! But, the fit is a little small... they rise up your butt... They don’t go over your belly button as “high waisted” would, but still stylish!"
4.0,Returned this sadly though I liked the bag and fabric a lot. The shoulder strap is an ugly cheap vinyl that I didn’t like at all. A shame.
4.0,Ive not worn a dress for months! So I was very surprised at how perfect this one fitted.
4.0,"I bought these socks for my soccer playing son, who is 12. He wears a size 6 shoe, and I was debating between the size small and medium. I got the small and they were just right, but not much room to grow, so he might need a medium next season. The toe area is strong and does not seem like it will rip easily. It has arch support in the foot, support around the ankles, and top of the calf area, with good amount room for shin guards. The material is dry-fit so it absorbs sweat, but it is still comfortable. My son wore them to play soccer, then removed his cleats and shin guards, and then commented when he went to bed that he had forgotten that he was wearing soccer socks and had inadvertently worn them until bedtime. I would purchase these again."
4.0,"Love the dress, Just a little tight in the bust."
4.0,I wear small but ordered xs for fighter fit still lose but love!!
4.0,Dress was normal everyday dress. Too casual for special event.
4.0,material is of good quality and not thin.
4.0,"Necklace, bracelet and earrings were a pretty set.  Arrived in a timely manner."
4.0,"Thick enough to not be sheer, but not so thick it's too hot. High enough in the underarm that it doesn't show my bra."
4.0,Soft and nice. Fits ok and nice colours
4.0,Santa brought these for our 15 month old. She wears a size 5.5 shoe and they fit perfectly. She loved walking around in them!
4.0,Cute lil' number. Would recommend sizing up. Item prob not ideal for those with long torsos.
4.0,"I normally wear a 38 waist so that's what I ordered.  When the shorts arrived I could instantly tell that they were much too large.  I could put them on and take 'em off without undoing the zipper or the button closure.  Despite the care instructions I machine washed them in hot water and then machine dried them on high heat hoping they would shrink to size.  No such luck.  They may have shrunk a little but not much and are still too large in the waist.  They have both a drawstring closure and belt loops so I will be able to wear them with a belt.  IMHO the drawstring closure is a bit dorky unless you're at the beach so I'll probably just remove the drawstring altogether.  The pockets are all decent sized with the two rear pockets secured by buttons (you get two extra buttons attached tot he inside of the shorts).  The shorts are the right length for me, just above the knees.  The material is fantastic, nice light weight.  I ordered the white shorts and they are somewhat see-through so you might want to be a bit choosy in what you wear underneath.  I like the shorts and they would have been a clear 5-star had they fit a bit tighter.  Recommended but recommend ordering at least one size smaller than you normally wear."
4.0,I was upset with getting this set at first because the color was nothing like the picture BuT... after trying the item on I LOVE THIS SHORT SET! THE MATERIAL IS SOFT. the colors are calm and cool looking. I will purchase another set from this company. The outfit runs true to size as well and will expand according to your body. I gave this purchase 4 stars only because of the color being different.
4.0,Cute dress fits well but paper thin fabric so needs a slip or worn as cover up
4.0,"They are kinda small and I ordered a large, and I fit a large. Definitely wasent a large"
4.0,Worked really well! Previous reviews forewarned me so the XL was perfect!
4.0,Fits true to size. Soft material and I love Hamilton so it’s definitely a win. Only issue is some of the stitching could be better. Lots of threads in the armpit area.<br /><br />All in all a good purchase very comfortable to wear around
4.0,Pricey but a big hit for my 5 year old
4.0,"Read prior reviews on this item.  Fit is smaller than usual.  Go by the size chart included as the waist tends to run small.  Otherwise, I consider the product a good value for the price."
4.0,Me quedó pequeña
4.0,I probably should of checked the length before buying because they were about 5 inches shorter than expected.
4.0,"This is a pretty dress but gave 4 stars because of the zipper in the back  is so hard to close for me,  too wrinkle and it isn't a real wrap dress (what I thought it was) I orderer a L and have to return it because of the difficulties to close the ziper! I would love to try the XL to see if works better for me, I recommend to go a size bigger then you are."
4.0,I really like the wood and did not have difficulty shortening the band (although I used to work in a jewelry store).
4.0,"Although I found the sizing to be too small , the construction seemed pretty solid and the fabric was comfortable."
4.0,"These are really cute, but not for 'every day' wear. The material is really thin which is not ideal but they are so cute and perfect for the outfit i bought them for."
4.0,This is a very nice necklace. I would give it 5 stars but the chain was way to short. I didnt measure it but i can guess it was 10 inches. Way to short for a womans necklace.
4.0,"I purchased this as a fun gift for my adult daughter and she loved it . No it's not the best quality and won't become a family heirloom but it's cute, waterproof and protects her clothes from spills so for the few dollars spent ,it's great. Produces smiles whenever she wears it"
4.0,They are great. Wish they were a little bigger for my face.<br />They are very light. I like them.
4.0,My daughter likes the case's style.
4.0,"I guess I should have looked more closely at the description.  I did not expect these to be so long.  At any rate, the seem well-made, I just wanted shorter ones."
4.0,I am only commenting on size as I didn't have a need to wear these on a recent boating trip I took.  I am thin but bigger in my butt and thighs.  I typically wear a 6 or 8 so I ordered the medium which unfortunately was way too tight in my curvy areas.  I returned and got a large which fit great.
4.0,This is less harsh than polishing creams and more convenient.
4.0,This tie is made from quality material and the colors are very bright.
4.0,I got these robes for myself and bridesmaids for the morning of my wedding. I ordered everyone a size larger to make sure they fit and no one complained. The robes are thin but for the most part cover your body. The colors are close to the pictures. I hope this helps.
4.0,"Works pretty good, not 100 percent but it helps alot"
4.0,"I like this hat a lot!  Its really good for the price I paid for it, I only give it 4 stars because I have another Tokidoki hat that is much nicer quality, but this one is still good just lacks the silk underbill.  Sports the Tokidoki logo and their characters as a background."
4.0,"The pendant is lovey, the chain not so much... but that is an easy fix."
4.0,Beautiful and not exlpensive. I like it
4.0,I order 1 size lg then what i wear
4.0,"I'm giving this 4 stars only because the description is misleading. The hat is not slouchy, it's definitely fitted and I have a small head. Good quality material. No fraying and thick crochet work."
4.0,"I've been into wearing small/thin dainty bracelets like this bracelet lately. This bracelet did not disappoint. It is well made for the price and does not look cheap. However, the bracelet in the photo has a spring ring clasp, but the one you get has a lobster clasp. Given how small the bracelet is, it is not that noticeable and doesn't really impact the look, but I would have preferred the spring ring clasp instead."
4.0,"The material is nice and thick, and it's well made.  It's clingy, like most of my PattyBoutik shirts, but this one is almost too clingy.  Taking one star away, because normally, I can wear this size (large) but this one, is in the closet until I can lose a few pounds.  They were out of this color in XL, or I would have exchanged.  Did wear it one day and it was soft and comfortable."
4.0,"I purchased the black ruched bottoms and they look different then the picture, not as ruched... However I still really like the fit. Very flattering on. I don't usually like the way my butt looks in bathing suit bottoms but these I like. I purchased size small and they fit great, love the tummy control. I'm 5'2, 126lbs with not much in the trunk 😳. I went by the size chart. I would have given 5 stars if they were exactly as pictured."
4.0,Very pretty.  Very small in size.  I have a small wrist and it just fits.  Very bright and sparkling and very elegant.
4.0,Happy with our order
4.0,"It's super cute, but runs small. I did size up when I ordered it, and it worked fine! The only thing I might complain is the material is not as soft as I expected, but overall, a cute and good quality parker. My son got a lot compliments!"
4.0,"I have to say these are amazingly cute!  Thank goodness, because they fit a little oddly, hard to get and keep on my daughter's feet.  Also I'm spoiled with velcro shoes for babies, and these tie.  It's a little hard trying to tie them when my daughter is wildly kicking to avoid having to wear shoes.  But yes...they look great on once they're there!"
4.0,Way short ! Daises Dukes
4.0,Love the quality of the glove. It is almost perfect except i had to adjust the finger straps to fit my hand and get full movement out of the glove.
4.0,"Beautiful and I loved it. A size 2x fits like a size 14, so make sure you order a size or two, bigger. I thought the front would look like the back, it didn’t, it’s just st solid black. Despite the snug fit and plain back it’s soft, well made and beautiful."
4.0,"Just got this in the mail today. Was pleasantly surprised it got here well before the estimated delivery date. Ring fits to size. It is slightly larger than I thought it would be (overall size, not the fit)."
4.0,"I really liked this watch when I had it. People would always ask about it when they saw it and you'd be able to strike up a conversation instantly. The design is simple. It does not glow in the dark, but it's still good."
4.0,"Fit me well. Im a 10, regular. I like that the band is adjustable. I can wear them most of the day. But the band starts to rub  a little on the top of the foot, its minor. Foot bed is mostly confortable. Overall they are pretty comfortable. I  work in an office, but I get up often to walk to other rooms. I would say they have a 6 hour wear time. They are stylish also. I would buy another pair in another color and use for work or going out to dinner only, not for long walking periods."
4.0,"Although for a mask-wearer in a cold climate, I don't think there's anything that will completely prevent fogging, this product comes close. I highly recommend."
4.0,Quality is good! Burgundy color is beautiful! Only issue is that I am 5’4 and 125 pounds and the small size was too big on me!
4.0,"This was a good value for the price, but there were 13 keys and 9 parts that were not charms but assorted bails, beads, and connectors. The rest of the selection was varied."
4.0,I love it.not too big nit to small. Good quality feels great to the touch.
4.0,Good Value and nice fit (Im a bit shobby)
4.0,Was a gift and the receiver says he loves it.
4.0,Although pretty it is very small. I wear an XL normally so I thought it will still fit. It was like wearing a short shirt. I wrote the company and the refunded me. So very great company that wants to please :)
4.0,"This is a lovely color romper and good material because it is not see through at all since there is a lining piece underneath The piece looks exactly like the picture. My only issue is the V cut is extremely low so unless you wear something underneath like a tank or bralette you will be showing way too much chest. I believe this piece is more flattering on someone like the model. For reference I am 5'3, very curvy in the bottom half of my body."
4.0,"I really like my necklace, pretty in person but one of the hoops was broken but the necklace is still wearable."
4.0,"Nice watch, more feminine than manly."
4.0,"The length is great but the waist elastic is a little too tight. It isn't the nice wide band elastic. I have the same problem with their shorts. That being said, the material is soft and breathable and comfortable. I would buy it again."
4.0,My husband really likes them.
4.0,"Cute, but I expected a little more cushion."
4.0,"Gloves feel amazing! They go on easily and the material is light. The stretch is also comfortable. My hands don’t feel tight nor my fingers. I got chunky hands and the medium was perfect. I gave it four stars because they are a little short. Wish they were a little longer on the wrist part. Also, the neck pull up mask was a great little bonus. Not the greatest material but it’s breathable and light."
4.0,I’m 5’ 11” and have long arms. The sleeves were too short but I just pull them up so they’re more like 3/4 sleeves. I also have a long torso and it’s very hard finding shirts that are long enough. This one was longer and fit well. I wear it often. The material is a little thinner than I expected but overall still nice.
4.0,"I love these leggings! I ordered the &#34;purple impressions&#34; color, although they don't really look purple, they look much more blue than purple (see picture) I still love the color. They are very comfortable, and not see-through which is a major plus. I would definitely ordered these in other colors :)"
4.0,They fit well except too long.
4.0,"Okay, I’m not gonna lie, there’s sort of a “fakeness” about it that I can’t put my finger on. Maybe it’s the mixture of too many materials: gold chain, suede, and patent leather. Yet I still find myself drawn to it and I like it for a change every now and then. There’s plenty of space, one big open compartment and several pockets. Plus the top zips to keep your goodies in place. Final verdict: not bad at all."
4.0,These socks are great! My only complaint is that I didn’t get the colors I ordered..
4.0,I've ordered from another place and never had this happen....<br /><br />The first 2 uses the ink just got everywhere usually it takes a little for the ink to start coming through the felt.<br /><br />Also when we were almost done with it the top came off... luckily it was pretty much empty<br /><br />Could of just been a bad top
4.0,weirdly large
4.0,It fit well and it arrived on time i weigh 110 and i am a 2/3 in pants so i got the large and it fit me well. I love it and have also recommeneded it to a friend. The only issue was the stitching it does look like it would fall apart but overall it is beautiful
4.0,"I received my bracelet today. Its a very nice piece it has good weight. The only problem I have with it is it is very petite. its almost not expandable like some of the others I have, however I would recommend for someone with a small wrist. Thought about returning it but will keep"
4.0,This dress is cute but runs very small. The medium size looks like a small but my niece loved it anyway and will wear it gladly whole taking her senior pics in a couple weeks. The colors are true to description and very bold.
4.0,"Got cpl hrs ago from (box lumber store) they run small. I have large palms and long fingers. Lrg is tight. Extra pad on lower palm and inside knuckles. Outside almost from ring finger to past pinky is the (gel) basicly knuckle buster, just noticed additional knuckle gel Protection on middle to pinky fingers . Ordered xlarge now that ive worn them. The right size will help. I do recommend these. There are the &quot;tabs&quot; on the fingerless (thumb, index, middle fingers) to help pull them off. Seem good quality. These say carpenter gloves, even on the packaging they list every type of work. Wierdly they were cheaper where i got them. They didnt have xlarge, found some on ebay new cheaper than I paid. Purchased them. Waiting now. I think they have great potential, im a self employed (painter, flooring, carrpentry) business owner my self. There is also knuckle &quot;gel&quot; protecters on last three fingers. (outside) I will try to get good pic of top of glove."
4.0,"For someone with a very small neck, it is hard to find a small choker that fits. This one is adjustable and soft. Waterproof and durable, this necklace is in for the long run."
4.0,Amazing!!! Light! And great color! I love it.
4.0,"Good support for the boys, they look good on and are comfortable."
4.0,A nice inexpensive staple.
4.0,Love the design and sparkle.  The only glitch is that it seems to twist around on my wrist so that I am constantly seeing the back rather than the front.  I wish the sparkle design went all around the back as well.
4.0,I love it very pretty
4.0,A little to big but not bad
4.0,Good hand protection
4.0,I liked the material and feel of the skirt.
4.0,"Adorable, could have used a smaller size but that’s on me! And it works anyway!"
4.0,Had a few that weren't working when I opened them up. But I am not too concerned since the price was so good. I do like that it has a switch to turn them no not like some of the others that are on because of pressure of the finger. (little fingers do not keep those other kind on) I do have to say these were a bit loose. I had one fall apart. But again the price was great for what I needed.
4.0,Looks nice and right price. Did not come with a box but a bag. The ear rings are nice and pretty.
4.0,I'm 5'5&#34; the very definition of a size 14 with 38F breasts. The XL was good. But the cup area was so so small.
4.0,I really liked the fit and the warmth of the gloves. They also look great!
4.0,"The dress fits perfectly and looks wonderful. The only problem is that it is SUPER delicate. I washed it when it arrived (as I do with all my clothes before wearing them) and lost my mind and didn't read the washing instructions. I machine washed, cold water, delicate cycle. The fabric actually tore. THEN I read the washing instructions and see it was supposed to be a hand wash. If you order this be very careful when you wash it!"
4.0,Nice hat and fit for an adjustable!
4.0,"Gotta say, this is a much better product than I expected; especially for the money.  Heavy, cute turtle; hangs nicely; looks much more expensive than the trinket price that it was."
4.0,Adorable but a bit small for size listed
4.0,This is my go to everyday shoe for jeans and leggings. There is a stitching near the toe area that makes the sole a bit rough. Cute shoe. Would recommend
4.0,Nice socks at a decent price
4.0,It works for me but the material could be better and the stitching should be a lot better to match cost.
4.0,Fits true to size. It looks better in the picture than it looks on me.
4.0,"Pretty sweet addition to my watch with these types of links.  I failed to realize how small it would be, but everything is extremely legible for the limited amount of space."
4.0,"This fits my iPhone X nicely. hold is secure enough and it fits well on the Xbox controller.<br />My only gripe is that It only has one viewing angle. it's comfortable when playing sitting up, but the ability to tilt the phone further back would make this nicer for playing games when reclined all the way back or in bed."
4.0,"delivered quickly, fits a little snug but it will work."
4.0,"I really like the tie/belting around the waist, I think I could wear it in the back or front. I ordered the green and it is true to the color. The sleeves were a little loose on my arms, but I also am not use to wearing this style of sleeves."
4.0,Very colorful and cozy.
4.0,"The cap itself was nice enough,  and it will serve it's purpose,  but in looking at the reviews and so forth  and different views, I was expecting to get 3 caps and only received one :-("
4.0,"I really liked this dress but after putting it on I could not get over the stark contrast of the dress and the overlay. Had they been slightly closer in color I would have kept the dress in a heart beat but sadly I did return it.<br />If you are looking at this dress be aware that it does show as a cream colored dress more than it does as blue.<br />It is well made, stitching was nice and it went on and off comfortably, the length was also flattering and the material easy to wear."
4.0,Bought them for fun to wear on a vacation. They are good for the price and not crooked or unbalanced. Water smears on them and is hard to wipe off. Would buy again!
4.0,"I got these for my husband for our trips to the beach and just wearing around the yard. He loves a good leather flip flop and for whatever reason they need to be leather. I saw these and thought I would give them a shot. He has a bad arch and also suffers with plantar fasciitis so knowing that these are specifically designed to aid in the arch support and to be ergonomic is awesome.<br />He gave me his thoughts...""they are very comfortable especially between my big toe and second toe. They have a good deep heel and I don't have to work that hard to keep them on. They fit good across my foot and are very cushiony. I have long toes so it is great that the front of the sandal is a bit long. The back however is long as well but not so much that I can't wear them. Be aware tho that they do run long. The leather is good but it does look a bit on the inexpensive side up close however the sandal fits and wears well. I like them with jeans and shorts.  I am very happy with them.""<br />The price on them is not cheap coming in at just under $50 at the time of this review and I do highly recommend just know they run a bit long."
4.0,lengths of these varies slighty but still does the job
4.0,"I got this as a gift for an English teacher.  Although I love the wording, the quality of the print is...eh.  I'm sure others might like that acid look but I don't.  It makes the words harder to read.  The receiver appreciated it and that's what's most important."
4.0,These leggings are great and make your butt look fantastic! The only reason I’m not giving it five stars is because it ripped very easily in between the divets.
4.0,Nice for the price. Looks well made and not to  much like costume jewelry but can definitely tell it isn't the real deal.
4.0,"These are awesome Arm sleeves, Everything is good about them. The only issue I had is they are little small for me. I have long hands and find them to be 2 inches short.But again they do the work."
4.0,"I got this pack to be my fishing bag while while on multiday kayaking trips and has not disappointed me all summer. I'm able to hold all my fishing gear and most of my camping stuff like hammock,  mosquito net, small cook set flashlights etc..<br /><br />  Now summer has come and gone and I've converted it into my hunting pack because my other pack is too small to accommodate holding my bow and I need to be hands free while riding my bicycle down the trail. Ive now used it in this manner several times riding miles at a time down some bumpy trails and then usually hike an additional mile or 2 through really dense woods and thickets in Texas. Yet it still hasn't faltered. It holds my bow, quiver safety harness, binos, rope, flashlights water and more all while still being pretty comfortable. I did have to rig it with a couple D clips to make it hold my bow but it worked.<br /><br />  My only 3 complaints are: 1. The outside pouch in the middle I generally carry my first aid kit while on kayaking trips and the strap will loosen over time. 2. A camo color scheme would be nice only because I now use it for hunting. 3. I've seen several other reviews saying this but very few pockets to organize. What I do to compensate for this is pack things accordingly to how likely I'm going to need to use it or when in my trip will I need to use it. For example on a kayaking/ fishing trip I pack all my camping gear first in the bottom with my 3 tackle boxes on top in the main compartment. I usually fish before I set up camp so this way I dont have to dig through my entire pack while in the kayak looking for fishing line or hooks."
4.0,"Gives a great shape to the derriere, very confident while working out cuz the top gives excellent support"
4.0,Nice band for my fitbit blaze
4.0,"Comes in handy, repair needs to be thouroughly prepped before applying"
4.0,I'm a DD and so had to wear a bra as there is Z E R O support here. If you are not wearing a black bra it will show. Bad. This is def for a small chest if you don't want a bra hanging out all over. Still wore it lol still loved it. Just know it'll turn into your bra being the coverage.
4.0,I really like this shirt but definitely order a size larger than you actually wear
4.0,"one pair a little to small, unless you are sleeveless. other pair is nice but really warm, but still get bruises, but no cuts."
4.0,These are really cute but run small! My daughter is still between a size 1 and 2. We got her 2’s and they’re sadly too small. Definitely size up!
4.0,"Great looking handbag. It fits my laptop, a few paper files, make up bag and my iPad.  The strap clasp broke after two weeks, but hopefully I can get support and help from the seller/manufacturer.  I received a few compliments on this bag. It looks very professional."
4.0,"I love this dress so much because it's long enough to be work appropriate, the material is great, & of course because it's so darn adorable. I'm 5 feet & 7 inches, 190lbs."
4.0,"Most clothing items on amazon I end up needing a medium as they are too big. I ordered a large after reading reviews and it was way too small. Exchanged for an x-large, this fit was better but not great. The sleeve length seemed a little abnormally long. Seems well made not thin fabric."
4.0,The color is bright and as expected. The robe is soft and pleasant to the body. The fabric is really lightweight though.  It feels like a cotton robe rather than flannel.  Good to wear in the mornings of warm spring months.
4.0,nice quaility. a little heavy for my 5 year old son.
4.0,"I love the fit & the material, but didn't look at the mirror until I got home an hour later realizing sweat gathered under the boob area & I walked around like that, quite embarrassing lol! It's still a great shirt as a base layer though & wished it had better moisture-wicking capabilities. It'd be perfect for a light workout when youre not as sweaty I'm sure!"
4.0,"This is a nice band. It looks great. The latch mechanism works well, and the watch connectors attach easily and are secure. There is one small problem that will be a huge problem for some people. It isn’t as large as the description says.<br /><br />“ Size:Comfortable fits Wrist sizes 5.0""-9.4""(127mm-239mm),including a professional adjustment tool to resize and all links can be removed.”<br /><br />My wrist is 8.3” and it just fits my wrist. There is no way this will fit someone with a 9.4” wrist without adding links. This is made worse by the fact that the manufacturer says there is a link in the description to buy more links, but that link is not there."
4.0,"I ordered this for my husband and it doesn't look as nice in person on him. The shirt is wider and feels baggy, compared to the more slim fitted look the model is wearing. The name printed across the pocket is also a little weird.  He is 6'2"" and around 180-190lbs, and it still feels like a ""large"". The material is soft and feels like nice quality; but that wasn't enough for him to want to keep it.<br />Hope this review was helpful."
4.0,It’s a good length color and weight just what I expected from this skirt. -1 star only because it’s not my ideal waist belt I’d much prefer a zipper close than just an elastic band but over all it’s very nice!
4.0,"So I really like comfy sweatshirts so I ordered a larger one hoping for that. It’s sooo nice and toasty! It’s kind of awkward shaped like the width is very wide and square -ish. But it’s perfect for my needs!<br /><br />Also if I didn’t order a larger size I think the length of it would have been too short. Which is odd because I’m only 5’2”. So If I had gotten a medium it would’ve been almost a crop top situstion haha.<br /><br />Anyway, I’m very happy with it!"
4.0,If I had something like this as a kid that would have Been nice!
4.0,got this as a gift for my wife. She loves it. perfect size
4.0,"This is a much thinner chain than I was expecting but it is gorgeous, I bought a charm just for it because I want to use it for something, even if it isn't for its intended purpose."
4.0,"Very cute and arrived on time, my only complaint is that the color is not as dark as it looks in the pictures.  I was looking for eggplant purple and I got Barney purple."
4.0,"I love these jeans! Normally, I wear a 14, but I sized up. I will definitely buy again. Perfect length and plenty of room in the butt and thighs"
4.0,"I liked it; wife loved it.  Bought the matching earrings, too."
4.0,Good bag and works just fine.
4.0,They look right.
4.0,Does the job of protecting little feet in the sprinklers.
4.0,"This ring looks real and expensive. What can I say it's $35 bucks and not $3,500. I'm sure my son-to-be fake wife will love it."
4.0,"Good little shoe horn.  Took a while to get here, though."
4.0,A well made shoe for any little girl.  My daughter wore these until she outgrew them - sometimes with and without socks.
4.0,Comfortable. Pockets hold my cellphone easily. Good material. They fit well for the most part. Only complaint is that they baggy at the ankles.
4.0,I do like this product. I'm a 32 DD and the large is a little big but fine when I wear a bra with it. Honestly I was planning on wearing one anyway. And horribly made but you get what you pay for. It's super cute.
4.0,I would buy this again for a gift for someone special.
4.0,I liked the thickness of these glasses and the quality just feels really good for the price point. I bought these for my boyfriend and he really likes them.
4.0,Comfy and not tight (didnt want it to be too tight around the stomach) bigger than I thought so you may want to go down a size
4.0,I got this as a gift for my mom she loves it.  But to me it just didn't dazzle me like the picture online did.  Yet considering how much I paid for it it is perfect.
4.0,"For the price, it is exactly as I expected.  It is a little difficult to get clasped by myself, and the fit is a little big even on the smallest clasp, but overall I really like it."
4.0,"3.5 Stars<br /><br />Soft, silky, lightweight material. Two front/side pockets. No coin/key pockets. Drawstring is the same as the material and not knotted at the end. My husband has a 34-36 waist and the large fit him just right.  I found the print to be beachy, but he would have preferred a surfboard print instead of the palm leaves."
4.0,my natural body shape is on the slim side and these medium pants fit me pretty good. My legs aren't swimming in them and they look good on me
4.0,warm and very cute!
4.0,Good quality and nice simple statement.  The only improvement would be a stiffener behind the front (like a baseball cap) so the Bitcoin logo stays prominently displayed at all times.
4.0,I'm 5'5&#34; and 115lbs these could definitely stretch more and fit someone with more meat on their bones. They're cute and not crazy thin.
4.0,Kids loved these! There were a couple that already had dead batteries though.
4.0,"SO cute, runs a little big, but not worth the money or time to send back.  I will keep and give away as a gift or save for a sunning day, not a swimming day."
4.0,"Good product, great price, but I'm 5'4&#34;, 120 lbs and the S/M was a bit short for me. I had a hard time keeping the back end down. I wore tights to keep myself covered. But overall, it wasn't a bad costume."
4.0,Taking to Europe.  I know they will be perfect.
4.0,"The are just what I wanted,  could have been a little darker,but they do the job."
4.0,"Pretty classy for you be protection, my hands get affected by heat and Sun so these will work while riding in the convertible"
4.0,Great quality dress for a low price!
4.0,really bracelets and fast  shipping. It took only a week when it said it would take a month. Also included every bracelet that you see in this picture
4.0,"This necklace is really pretty with out paying a lot of money. It's well made and the color is gorgeous too,<br />I really recommend it"
4.0,"Great product for an excellent price have had this watch for a month now and item has not faded , this is a very stylish watch, only problem I have with it is that it is a little too big for my hand , otherwise it is a great watch."
4.0,"like:  bring home money, fits in pocket, nice looking.<br />dislike: a little bit hard to put money in. should only put in twenties.<br />overall  4 star"
4.0,"So far, good.  Not impossible to put on/take off.  Does a decent job for its cost. Relatively comfortable and not too hot."
4.0,My son really likes this pullover.
4.0,I am very happy with my purchase but now that I have them I think these are a little expensive for the size. They are small and I would say these are more like 18$ earrings for sterling silver.
4.0,"This dress is cute, it fits me but it was not as tight as it was on the picture. It's a little baggy on me, I think if you're a medium, try ordering a small"
4.0,"Classic design, Packaged well, it's a Nice watch.For the price it is a good deal, Overall a great watch for the price"
4.0,Got this for my bf for xmas- the shirt fit really well but the sleeve that comes with the shirt was small
4.0,Smelled horrible when it arrived. Not a pleasant surprise for a child.
4.0,The only complaint is with the navy/white ring. The white is applied over the navy and the navy is showing through the white and looks rubbed off in places. Everything else is wonderful.
4.0,"You cannot see through these at all the block letters actually block the view, but they complete the outfit perfectly. They worked excellently to compete the ensemble and I will definitely use them again for that costume."
4.0,"Shipped quickly, sturdy, clean. Will be a perfect for the wedding I am in. Well worth the reasonable price!"
4.0,"The band fit perfect.  It looks good, feels good.  It is a little ""thin"" so we'll see how it holds up over time.  Well worth the price though."
4.0,Very cute and good for my little cousin. Smaller than expected
4.0,"I was in need of a wallet and this was good enough. It has more than enough space to hold cash. However, I wouldn't say the same for the coin pouch, which looks fragile. If you are planning on storing a lot of coins, I would recommend getting a separate coin purse. It isn't the most well made wallet out there, but it does the job. There were a few frays here and there and the design is a bit iffy in places, but overall it looks good. And as cheap as it is, that is to be expected."
4.0,"Although these were too large for her feet, my granddaughter absolutely love them! It’s better to be two large than too small, I guess. We just stuffed paper in the toe area, and she has been wearing them everywhere. They were a great addition to her Dorothy costume for Halloween.  Other than the size problem, they are cute, sparkley, and well-made.  Perfect for the occasion!"
4.0,"Cute, but very cheap material.  Almost afraid to wash it."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c76a272eaa7144cd3fb5d969d1b84a2]] I could tell these are made really well. I ordered 15 for my group for Burning Man and they arrived quickly. They're super bright and have 3 light settings, the only cons I would say are there aren't size options available and the ""easy release"" basically means you have to pull one side of it hard, which leads me to believe that over time the clasp is going to break. Still great though!"
4.0,"I love this dress, wore it the day after it was delivered. But it does run a tiny bit on the small side. Im 5ft, about 170, 38DDD. It's really snug in the breast. And the buttons gape most of the way down. I had to put a stitch between the buttons to keep it from gaping. I ordered the XL, I usually wear a large. There is no stretch to the fabric, and it's a bit sheer.  I wore it to work and received so many compliments. Worth the money and the extra stitching. Great buy."
4.0,"Love the dress; however, I upsized my purchase per other reviews and wish I hadn't. I float in it! Keeping it regardless, using it for when I hit the beach so the extra room isn't an issue."
4.0,Works as expected.  I wanted it for a coat that the buttons were loose on & it worked fine. I have RA and have a really hard time sewing so this was a great help.
4.0,The reviews were good on the seller so i gave them a try. This jersey is GREAT!!! Nice tight stitching which is always a pet peeve of mine when buying anything. Got the Medium and the fit was good but the sleeves were a little long. Seems to be made to have pads underneath so keep that in mind when ordering for casual wear
4.0,3.5 stars. Fits nice and is warm/comfortable except there is a hole on one end that lets air in. It doesn't seem to effect much but the design choice had me scratching my head.
4.0,"I would give the shirt 5 stars but it runs small. The first shirt I ordered I had to return and reorder, but the shirt I reordered fit nicely. Order up one size."
4.0,Beautiful dress but it runs a little bigger than size. I need to have it taken in. I am 5'5 120 lbs and ordered a small
4.0,Very nice classic look for a 3-piece suit.  Wish the chain was as shiny as the watch; I got the silver one.
4.0,Nice jacket. It does what it’s supposed to do...break wind.
4.0,This would work better if there was some kind of a grip on the handle
4.0,Loved the necklace. I bought it for my 8 yr old. The chain could be a little better but for the price it's not bad. Necklace was a little bigger than the picture shows. Looks expensive. She loved it
4.0,It's beautiful!! It's a lil long and roomy but I'm pregnant so my bump will grow into it.
4.0,Love this shirt. Very comfortable. Got a lot of compliments
4.0,Very good product. My four year old loves it and it gives good protection
4.0,"This bra is super comfortable, despote not having my size!  I am a 32DDD.  I tried both a 32 DD and a 34DD, since they don't have my size.  The 32 of , course was a little small in the cups and the band on the 34 is a little loose (not significant, but i like a little more snug).  I will keep them because of how comfortable they are despite the sizes.  I gave 4 only because they don't have my size.  But overall it is very comfortable.  But size technically is as expected, just that they don't make my size."
4.0,"Great fit to form dress. The neck ties are really long (18 inches) So hope you can tie a pretty bow, otherwise its ruins part of the aesthetic of the dress. The dress is smooth but not silky. Feels like it could take a little wear and tear without ripping. The lace at the shoulders is a little poofy but very cute."
4.0,It fits him good. And I like the color and t he fabric.
4.0,"Very long overall, but great quality otherwise!"
4.0,Nice... Order 1 size smaller
4.0,"I like these socks...however the sizing is misleading.  This is for 'Sock Size' 10-13 which is not the same as SHOE SIZE.  They fit shoe size 6-12.  So, if you are looking for socks to fit a size 13 foot, like my husband was, these don't fit.  They fit me just fine."
4.0,"These replaced a Sam Elderman pair of sunglasses that I lost that look almost identical. They are cute, a little unconventional, and the frames are too big that they overwhelm your face. However, they broke the first time I dropped them :/  For $4 it's not bad, but the shipping did make it more than I would've liked to pay for a cheap pair."
4.0,"Nice shirt for the price.  The pocket is a bit baggy, but that`'s always the case with silk shirts"
4.0,very pretty and breathable. not sure if this is a great way to cover completely from germs. it might need a filter.
4.0,I ordered a size M for my 5yr old son and it looked like a dress on him. The material looks and feels cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.
4.0,"Great light weight dress for Summer. Perfect for curvy girls. I'm 5'1 145lbs, ordered a size xl fit perfectly. Could have got away with a large but still works"
4.0,Bought this for my wife because she always has lots of cards. This wallet has enough slots that there is no excuse not to be organized. She loves it! Thanks
4.0,Good Qualitiy but the Kukuis are not quite as big as advised.
4.0,The material is more polyester than I was expecting. I feel like it looks like a night shirt. But the colors and sit were exactly like the picture.
4.0,Love this necklace.  Think what I got was equivalent to what I paid.  Took off a star because I'm not sure about the durability; but it is a nice piece.
4.0,"I love the bracelet itself. It looks great--exactly as I always imagined my Alta would look, when I first heard about the upcoming release of Alta. But I found it impossible to shorten the band following the directions and the alternative directions. I have a very small wrist, so it needed to be made a lot shorter. My husband tried too and angrily said that &#34;this is a defective product!&#34; I took it to a jewelry store, where the guy shortened it for $10. It's not super-easy to open and close the band, but is MUCH easier than the rubber band that comes with the Alta."
4.0,The patterns and warmth are good just runs small
4.0,My son loves this warm and comfy robe.  My only complaint is there is no loop on the inside of the collar to hang it on a hook.
4.0,Like this inexpensive baby blue cotton L-sleeved shirt with OK graphics for the reasonable price. I will buy again in the future.
4.0,"The stripes are black, I thought they would be the same navy as the skirt. Besides that it's super cute and comfortable"
4.0,Very cute and stylish. Nice length.  A tad bit thin and odd fitting in the front. Over all cute.
4.0,Love the stretchiness of this shirt!
4.0,"3 stars because the quality is there but it didn’t me fit like the picture. Then again my ear might be smaller than the model hence why it didn’t lay flat on my ear. Overall, humble chic is my jam and I’ve purchased many earrings from this company and will continue."
4.0,Looks lighter in color thann it is but still like it
4.0,This heart is exactly as pictured and the colors are gorgeous. It looks nice on a longer (20-22&#34; chain) when worn with a T-shirt. I would be very pleased to receive this pendant as a gift!
4.0,"This dress is super cute for the price, however, if you are large chested, I recommend you order a size up.  I have to wear a camisole for this dress to cover my bra, but I am an F cup.  I get lots of compliments on this dress.  It is cute and comfy; you can wear it out or as a swim cover up."
4.0,"good product,but after I followed the size  guide too big for me I wished I had bought M instead of L"
4.0,"This skirt has a lot of stretch to it! I am a 10/12 and ordered the large. I suspect I could take it down to a medIum, but I do tend not to wear tight waists for comfort, so I like the fit. It has so much give, it doesn't feel like the usual high waisted skirts, it is so comfortable! I am 5'6.5&#34; and it comes to just over my knees. Note that I had to iron it slowly on a high heat using a good pressing cloth to protect the synthetic fabric, but that was the only way I could get the fold lines out of it, so minus one star."
4.0,"This set is comfortable, and very lightweight material. I was thinking it would be more like thermals, but it’s thin, more suitable for summer time. Quality stitching, comfy fit and super cute!"
4.0,"I bought three of these matching Christmas shirts. One for my 2 yo toddler and 2 large for me and my husband. I like to wear my sweaters and shirts oversized so the large was perfect. I’m 5’5 and 124 lbs. Just to be clear, these are long sleeve shirts and not sweatshirt. For some reason when I bought it, I thought they may have been sweatshirts and was a little disappointed. But with that said, the shirts are made of nice stretchy material that will be warm enough for winter but not overheating. We are excited to march for the holidays."
4.0,The cost of this item was fair. It was shipped quickly in just a couple days. I liked the pretty red string style adjustable closure. My only complaint is that the stone colors were a bit off and one was a different odd shape. Heart chakra and throat chakra colors are barely distinguishable. They are pretty stones however and the style is nice.
4.0,"Love the dress, colors are bright and the fit is as expected.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's pretty transparent, even with white underwear."
4.0,Love Vera Bradley products and love Plum Crazy pattern. Fits in my Vera Bradley crossbody that I purchased.
4.0,"I have bought Shocker Abssorber Ultimate Run Bra in the past which this is basically the same thing.  I did go up for this bra from what I got in Shock Absorber.  For my SA I bought my true size 32DDD (32F) and I loved the bra but I felt the lower band was too tight and the hooks broke on that one.  I found this one and decided for the 34DD (34E).  The band seems slightly loose but it might just be from being used to be uncomfortably strapped in.  I haven't tried it runnning yet.  I have jogged in my house and bounced in my room and it seems comfortable.  I still wear a cheap underwire bra underneath even with the SA one because I like having an encapsulating feel and I felt like without it just wasn't enough.  I love that the fabric is light and breathable, especially for summer running and that I don't get a uniboob feeling.  I have used the Moving Comfort Fiona bra for years but I still felt like it pulled me in and created a uniboob look, even with an underwre bra underneath.  Supper excited that I don't have to pay $80 for the SA and can get the same thing for signifcatly less."
4.0,"These were cute, but clunky,and heavy, and not refined,they had edges that needed filed,"
4.0,"These are such cute tights and I love that they have grippies on the bottom! However, after a few wear/washes they do start to thin out where they get the most wear."
4.0,"Purchased it for my mom for a trip she's going on. Loved it!<br />The turquoise is actually green, that the only thing I disliked...now it did not match the rest of her accessories..."
4.0,These are very comfortable with the whole stretching material. They have that soft feel to them. Cons: Bib pocket is also stretchy and anything I put in falls out when I lean over. The hip pockets are a little shallow and tend to turn inside out if you are doing a bit of walking and moving around. The legs are stop a little more than halfway down my shins! That for me is the worst part them
4.0,"Great looking and unique but as other customers have said, this necklace is extremely heavy and wouldn't be comfortable to wear for any extended period of time."
4.0,Soft and pretty !
4.0,"Fits really nice. It's not see through. Nice casual look. I purchased the black and white checkered dress in size large. I'm 5'6, 180 lbs."
4.0,"Comfy but a little long for me, I’m 5’7”"
4.0,Very stiff but so far looks good and fits well.
4.0,"My daughter and I both have our ears pierced....so we go through a lot of earrings.  My son is very much into anything emoji....but doesn't have his ears pierced.  These are good quality earrings but I was a little disappointed with them though.  The stem of the earrings do not have the notch at the end that holds the back on.  The back of the earring if played with will just come off.  There is nothing to secure the back of the earring in place.  To me these aren't meant to be left in for several days at a time and should absolutely be taken off at night or they will come off.  Other than that issue (which is an issue for my daughter to wear these) they are very light earrings.  They weren't heavy on the ears.  I wore them all day and didn't have an issue.  The back didn't slide off, just I can pull it off easily.  They are super cute to wear!!<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review of the product."
4.0,"Very cute and good quality for price, but very very small."
4.0,"Smaller than I anticipated. It's only about the size of a nickel but it is extremely beautiful and very well-made.  I had to get a different chain because the chain it comes with pulls my hair. Other than that, I am very well pleased with it."
4.0,"I love this cosplay. The only problem was I needed someone else to help me get in it, there are a lot of pieces to it."
4.0,This is made of really scratchy material.  I like the bag but it is very big.
4.0,"They were tight around the waist but I got them snapped.  Couldn't really zip them, but they worked great.  Our grandson from Florida had a great time playing in the snow!<br />'"
4.0,"Hood and thumb holes ripped out the first time I used it. Hood is pretty deep, and the jacket was longer than expected. Overall, it kept me dry in Ireland during the rainy season."
4.0,They are made well but they are really really tight. I bought them for my husband and I to wear at an amusement park this weekend but at this rate I think I may just return them. I could barely get it over my head and its so tight around my neck. I'll update my post if I end up keeping them and using them at the park.
4.0,"I am a 34B and use the smallest hooks on regular bras.  This came labeled as size &#34;F&#34; (&#34;free&#34; size/one-size) and appears to be the same as the XS/S I got in white, so I think it is Asian sizing since it fits exceptionally tight and just covers my breasts.  If you are not petite, this will not work for you.  Also, if you are wearing something that exposes the back of this bra, only the front is covered in lace - the back is cotton except for a lace border on one side.  As far as I can tell, the bra is fairly symmetrical in size, so you could wear that lace border either up or down, although I am pretty sure it is meant to be the bottom, since there is stronger elastic at the top.  Quality seems good - I think it was worth the low price."
4.0,They are gloves.
4.0,Runs really small if you normally wear a xxl get a xxxl.the shirt it’s set is really cute
4.0,"these are a great little set to have. the quality is not bad i was surprised. they fit nicely not to big are small. I was thinking that the five pack was more of an assortment but i only got three styles. the tops are a little different then i anticipated but overall not a bad product, they seem like they will hold up like normal fishnets to me. they do not feel bad to the skin not scratchy either.  Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount/free for my honest and unbiased review. The discount has not influenced or impacted my judgment of this product I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their products.. I try and post honest and unbiased opinions bases on my experience with the product."
4.0,Cute dress. Fit is nice. Just a little sheer & came very wrinkly.
4.0,Well made bit missing the plaques.
4.0,They’re great! Super soft and not too thin. Great quality and for sure worth the money!
4.0,It is a beautiful top. I wore it with a blue skirt and nude shoes and it looks awesome! I recommend to buy it larger because runs small. I usually wear small and medium tops and I ordered Large and fits perfectly...
4.0,"Pretty material, not too thick. Its definitely loose at the waist and hip. I may alter it.<br />Not overly impressed with the XS fit considering the price point. It looks like the photo, to be fair.<br />XS<br />25 in jeans, 5'5"", 23 inch waist, 110lbs, 32B"
4.0,"Wish I would have ordered a size bigger. Usually wear a medium, should have ordered a large. Still fit though. Cute. Just like the pic"
4.0,the dick hole is a little small but you can stretch it out
4.0,Does what it's supposed to. And price is ok.
4.0,Picture looks higher quality than actual seems to be
4.0,The colors are really nice. After you wear them for a couple days they become a tad bit big but not too serious. They are cute and reliable shoes and for a good price!
4.0,"It' fits snug in the arms, but ok overall.  It is thinner than I expected and a little less intense in the red color.  It is alright though and I would consider ordering it in another color having a different expectation.  -Niki"
4.0,Looked well made.  Gave it as a gift so I don't know how they will hold up with washing.
4.0,Use it quite often
4.0,"I really like the fit and the length.<br />I had to wash it twice because it smelled like fuel oil, not sure why"
4.0,Underwires hurt after sometime
4.0,"I really like these bras. They fit great! And unlike a lot of push up bras, they have a lot of push without a crazy amount of padding. The only downside is that they're a little on the itchy side, but hopefully that will go away after more wearings."
4.0,"UPDATE: after purchasing in 2018 and it now being middle of 2022 the watch is still just as great. the watch band is still intact and going strong, battery and time keeping are excellent. It is probably the watch I am most connected to. the F91 is easily forgettable on wrist. I love this little watch. I will go a few months without wearing it but unlike my mechanical watches its still ""ticking"" and ready to go. if the size is a concern id reccomend the w17 as its basically a modernized version (larger, better water resistance, backlight).<br /><br />I've had this watch for 2 years now and have worn it off and on during this time. When I wear it it's on 24/7 in the shower and work for long periods. I've worn it on a deployment in the desert and it hasn't let me down. The backlight is ok, I personally don't think its as bad as people say. It allows you to read the time in the dark. The band has held up so far. Oh and it keeps excellent time. Many would opt to throw it out when it breaks but ill replace the battery and maybe put it on a NATO strap. Just because its cheap doesn't mean it's meant to be disposable."
4.0,"It was good. But when you find the same thing with lower price, it was really pitty"
4.0,"I bought a red large. I am 5'6&#34;, 160lbs, 36C, US size 10 or 12. The model must be shorter than I am, since in the picture the top covers her crotch. It barely covers mine. I bought it to wear with leggings. The material washes well and I hang it to dry because in my experience red tends to fade. I don't know if it shrinks since I have never put it in the dryer. Overall, I am pleased and will probably buy other colors."
4.0,Very comfortable and got lots of compliments when I wore this.  Cute!
4.0,Was a little small otherwise good quality more of a sage green
4.0,The logo and letters are stitched into the hat. The hat is also of good quality. I would buy again.
4.0,Only gave it four stars cus it runs big but outfit is adorable.. Good quality..
4.0,Two of the bands broke after a few months of wear.
4.0,"Very nice strap, thicker than the nato strap my Suunto came with. The pins on the other hand are tiny, and not long enough for my traverse alpha. Will use the strap but I now have to find pins that are long enough and as tough as the ones my watch came with"
4.0,"I would have given this bag five stars ALL DAY LONG if it were just 2 inches bigger (all the way around).  If you want a very petite, lightweight crossbody - this is absolutely perfect.  The quality is top notch, the leather is SO rich looking (olive green metallic) & the hardware is beautiful.  The horizontal straps are such a unique (although still 'simple') design.  I just can't get this tiny size to work for me.  If you look in the pics, the top opening is slightly smaller than the base of the bag.  I see myself getting frustrated trying to get things in & out of the top opening of the bag.  This bag IS offered in a larger size - but it is too large for me.  That bag is called the &#34;Vance&#34; & I'm trying to talk myself into that bag - because I love the look of this little crossbody SO much.  I've searched & searched for the right size bag for me, everything is either too small or too large.  Of course I finally find this perfect bag & it is offered in a size that is both too small & too large - LOL.  Latico makes beautiful bags, so I will keep trying to find one that will work for me."
4.0,"I did not like the heavy cotton that formed these shorts. Once set, I can’t imagine them drying.<br />I did like how well they fit and were not too long to the knee."
4.0,Cute<br />Exactly what I was looking for
4.0,Love the dress just disappointed that first time wearing dress and the button is gone. Check button and loop closure to make sure button is not going to fall off.
4.0,"About me: 20 weeks pregnant, 129lbs, 5’3, wearing a size medium shirt, and size 5 pants.<br /><br />I’m docking a start because the shirt I received was a flat black, but the shirt pictured is a heathered black. The image needs to be updated to reflect the actual color of the shirt.<br /><br />The black runs TTS, I normally wear a small, I sized up to a medium, and fits as expected. Sleeves are cuffed, but still long in length. The graphic print is large, easy to read, and high enough that you can tuck the shirt in, and still read everything. Cute/fun shirt for the holidays!<br /><br />Thanks for reading, hope this was helpful!"
4.0,It's a very comfortable fit. My wrist is on the smaller side and it is big. It would probably be too big for a petite wrist. The pins are not attached so it's not easy to attach and it doesn't come with instructions
4.0,"This shirt is really cute on.  I like the fabric, it seems like it may be more moisture wickering once summer months really hit.  The fringe around the neck and arms looks ok but I would prefer without it.  But it's not itchy at all and really comfortable to wear."
4.0,"You can kinda make it as long or short as you want because of the ties, which is super helpful because I’m 5’9 and didn’t find it too short! The top is slightly see through- but not if you have a nude colored bra"
4.0,This fit my girlfriend perfectly. Only complaint is that it wasn’t quite true to color.
4.0,so far no indication that it wont last<br />thank you
4.0,It’s not exactly like the one displayed however it’s close enough. It’s ver warm and soft! I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable blanket scarf!
4.0,"Very nice, the elastic around the cuffs were surprisingly comfortable. Lightweight and like it's a little longer in length than most today... Would make a very complimentary gift this holiday season, or present for yourself. If the weather where you are is as warm as it is here in FL? Nice for holiday zoom get-togethers."
4.0,"Got here super fast, the bar and triangle were a little bigger than expected but I still like it. Only thing is that it tarnished really easily within the first week I wore it"
4.0,"Other than being a little on the small side, my wife loves it. She can't wait to wear it around her family at Christmas"
4.0,very hard to zip up on your own fits me good 5'9 190lbs xl. 35inch waist wish it was flipped looks better on backwards but for price cant beat it.
4.0,I received what was advertised.
4.0,"Cute jumpsuit! There is a little too much fabric up top which makes it look a little frumpy, and I think the shorts should be a different length to be more flattering. The shorts jumpsuit is a little tough to wear as someone curvy. The long pants one is way more flattering on us curvy ladies."
4.0,"Great quality for the price. Unlike other reviewers, my scarf did not have a strong chemical smell to it, thankfully. I was unaware that it came with the free key chain (it was folded into the scarf, as if to hold the shape) and threw that piece away not knowing what it was. Oh well."
4.0,"This is my second time buying these, and out of the 80 that i bought this time, only 3 did not work out of the package. One was dead batteries and the other 2 were something in the switch cuz they'd flash on, but only stay lit if you held the button in just the right spot. The only complaints I have is that they came from China and when they arrived 2 of them were on, but maybe that was a careless package handler, and that they take a month to ship. Out of the initial 16 that i had first purchased, only two have quit. Overall, great toy for kids and teens and easily amused adults."
4.0,"I love the fabric and color of the dress, although it has no leeway in it. It's super cute, but ended up being way shorter than pictured. The little belt that it comes with and the ruffles on the dress make it a really cute twist of modern meets the 60's."
4.0,Holds everything in place.  Good bra but great bra considering the price too.
4.0,"I liked only a few of them. But as other reviewers said, they did not come broken.....every bangle was in perfect shape....and they cam nicely packaged...."
4.0,"The shirt is very comfy and I like the thicker, but not too thick material."
4.0,"Cute, but WAY too small."
4.0,"Not as soft/stretchy as I was expecting, but seemed good durable quality. And the green was a real dark Christmas green. I didn't feel like the neckline was too immodest, sometimes those crossover neck wiggle down too much for me but this one was fine, I think the velvet kept it in place. Fitted a good amount of tightness. Not constrictive but I felt like my curves we're nicely noticeable. For reference I'm 5'5"" 120lbs all leg and 32DD"
4.0,"comfortable , looks as expected firm support great colors"
4.0,"4 stars- because I had to return it. Nothing wrong with it, I just wound up needing a different color. I will order from them again!"
4.0,I'm 5'6 and around 140 pounds. Usually I wear mediums but all the reviews said that it was a smaller fit so to buy a size up. I got a large and it fits fine. The top was a bit small like people said but I'm a 32C so it wasn't a problem for me. I have to say though that if you have a bit of a belly then the skirt might not fit well
4.0,"I think this is a really beautiful swimsuit. The color is gorgeous. The ruffles on the neckline are so cute, and the ruching around the middle is flattering. I felt like the size runs a little small as it was a little snug. I had to wrestle it to get it on all the way. The straps are pretty thin which doesn't give a lot of support for the ladies. But they are adjustable so that was nice."
4.0,"The bracelet is small, yet very attactive! The colors from the picture are accurate. The bracelet fits me well, but I do have a very small wrist. Despite the fact that the description says it is adjustable, there were no instructions included on how to change the size on my own. So don't count on being able alter the size. Overall, I am very happy with it!"
4.0,Item came earlier I was so happy love the unicorn boot order a size 2 but she really needed a size 1  half but that's ok love the boot fits perfectly it's definitely a true to size
4.0,Easy to use as it sits around my neck
4.0,Nice belt for the money. I am a 36&#34; in the waste and ordered a 36&#34;-38&#34; and it fit perfectly.
4.0,"I bought some of these last year in a store somewhere and they broke,  these frames are a little smaller,  but I love the bling/flag combo!"
4.0,Nice comfortable watch band. A little struggle to keep the pins depressed while installing but totally nice on balance.
4.0,"The mask is well made.  Just wish the inside was black, not white.  Clearly this will be worn while wearing makeup."
4.0,"Easy to adjust, looks nice, good weight. I love it."
4.0,A little cheaply made but very cute!
4.0,"This is the second band I’ve ordered from this company. I like that it makes my watch look a little dressier. The first band lasted about a year and a half through rough use (many workouts) and I was happy to order the second. It’s comfortable, easy to put on, and cute."
4.0,Love this shirt but I’m thicc so it’s right around my boobs.
4.0,The material is very soft. It is so comfortable. Very elegant and classy which is how a woman should look not trashy. The only reason why I did not give it five stars is because I followed the instructions and washed it by hand and some of the black dye bled into the cream color on the sleeves. I was sooo disappointed and not sure if I can wear it again or fix it. I DO NOT recommend washing it by hand. Take it to the cleaners.
4.0,"I bought this for my Mom, who gets uncomfortable when she drives to work.  She uses this pillow every day and loves it.  After about 2 months of use the pillow couldn't stay inflated for more than 10 minutes.  I wasn't there to check it out, but I suspect there was a problem with the air nozzle /stopper or the airtight skin.  Eagle Creek has a fairly good return /repair policy so I sent it back.<br /><br />My Mom liked this pillow so much that I bought another pillow for her while she waits for the Eagle Creek return"
4.0,The skirt was a bit big but nothing a safety pin couldn't fix<br />Super cute! My boyfriend loves it!<br />Also I'm 5&#34;1' and 110 lbs for reference
4.0,Its a cool looking keychain for the GTI fob. Only complaint is the finish is starting to come off
4.0,"The Caduceus Charm was beautiful and the perfect gift for her birthday. The chain, on the other hand is extremely fine and appears to be easily broke, particularly if she wears it to work. As such, I am ordering a heavier chain as a replacement."
4.0,"So, caveat...I have not had the opportunity to wear these outside for what I purchased them for. I will come back tomorrow after I have and update that part.<br />BUT...I have very short fingers! My middle finger is less than 3"" long, I was really worried that these would be like all other women's gloves, fit great everywhere else, but have an inch or more at the end of my fingers, NO!!! There is maybe a quarter of an inch! I can live with that. They are snug, but perfectly snug, I can move  my hands and fingers and they feel like they will be warm. Again, I'll update that after tomorrow.<br />Very soft leather, and lining. Love that!<br />Update: They are warm!"
4.0,Fits great but I have little to no waist so that part is not sucked to my body like the rest of the underwear part. But very nice. I love it
4.0,"I really like the look of this watch  but the band doesn't have a way to make it smaller. Other watches have a link you can remove but this one does not so I have to take it in to get it shortened. It also got water residue in it after washing dishes which hasn't dried out after 3 days. (No it was not submerged.) Overall it's pretty and I like it, I'll just like it better once I get the band shortened."
4.0,"I bought this watch as a gift. But after seeing it, I don't know. It may find it's way into my collection."
4.0,The pants are perfect the top is a little small and looks like a different color I don’t wear them together now.
4.0,And great price. I bought another pair for a gift.
4.0,"This is nice looking but I would've liked a more generous fit, it's a slim fit and so the pockets bow out a bit instead of resting flat against the body. It's soft, and warm though, and a lovely heather grey. You can unbutton the neckline or button it all the way up in cold weather. It will be worn!"
4.0,This makes me look like a grape.
4.0,"I love the style of these pants. Unfortunately, I had to return them as I am a short person (5'1&#34;) and at my tender age of 79, I have a fat tummy! So, I cannot state the 'how' these pants fit. The elastic waist is very, very wide, which emphasized my tummy AND the pants are very, very long. The length would not be a problem as the fabric is pulled in with elastic, making the pants have the 'baggy' pants look which I really wanted. The fabric is lovely and the pants appear to be very well made. I wish they had worked with my present body style.<br />The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that the waist band is so very wide... too wide to look fashionable. JMO"
4.0,very comfy but a little snug
4.0,"I bought this in the fall of 2019 so I could ride my motorcycle comfortably in the cold. I used it all winter and it worked beautifully. I did order up a couple of sizes, so it's big enough to layer and be easy to move in. The battery I have lasts 5-6 hours. I really like this vest."
4.0,"The length is good the color is good and the Velcro is good. The only thing is that it’s not comfortable material is kind of stiff. so when you put it around your stomach, it leaves red marks.."
4.0,I ordered up one size and I was super nervous because there were no reviews. But this fits wonderfully and looks exactly as advertised. It's also pretty warm!
4.0,"This is the second pack, and the first one was a little more adjust to the size, this ones have a few small size"
4.0,Cute leggings. I have a very small booty and they don't stay up.
4.0,It's very comfortable and the size is true to fit. I am a size (D36) When I run my boobs stay in place and they don't hurt while jumping up and down.. that's why I love this sports bra so much! Def recommend
4.0,The dress is good quality and very pretty but its 2 sizes too small I ordered a 2x and I really wear a 1x and the dress was still too small. I loved it so much that I'm going to reorder a 3x that's should fit.
4.0,"Esta muy lindo, lo único que el cuello, no tiene una buena terminación"
4.0,"Handkerchiefs were fine.  Ordered 4 sets for a funeral.  3 came as advertised.  The 4th was colored handkerchiefs with a different floral pattern.  They were for a funeral, so we had to make due."
4.0,They're very pretty but wide for my feet. I need to add insoles.
4.0,"PROS: Great price, cute cards, added sunglasses as well!<br /><br />CONS: The envelopes don’t have any adhesive to lick, so you can’t seal them. It’s just plain paper. So we’re gonna have to find envelope glue or something. Another weird thing I noticed is that one of the cards says “Will you be my groom?” which doesn’t make sense when the Groom is the one handing them out."
4.0,As you can see your toes will get caught on the excess material on the inside. Other than that absolutely love my knee high Duke socks.
4.0,These are cute. I love all the different colors. No allergic reaction. Super sparkly.
4.0,"Fun product - my daughter loves her shoes. There is a small glitch with a couple of the LED bulbs, but they are on, and provide fun options for fashion."
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" and I found this suit a bit shorter than I would like. It felt like the cups were just a tad lower than I really would ideally like them. The effect is that they make my boobs look a little saggy. Maybe if I had a smaller stomach, it'd be fine. But I do carry weight in my tummy after having eight babies. So, perhaps that is where some of the torso height went."
4.0,Wonderful except for the tight fit.
4.0,I love this leotard on my daughter. My only concern is the cut around the bust of a child. She is a bit young to have to adjust her top. I’m not sure it sizing would make a difference because it fits perfectly on her. The side cut just seems to go in a bit.
4.0,Very cute shirt. The back seam is a little weird. If you are a heavier set girl (as am I) this shirt hugs you very weird. The front looks great though!
4.0,"Very Nice quality but may appear &#34;cheap&#34; looking due to the plastic frame and transparent color.  I have these in black which are very sharp!  Well-made and classy! Comes with a very large, nice quality cleaning cloth that actually removes all smudges."
4.0,Great if you like vintage.  Strap is thick and I recommend you change it.
4.0,very pretty dress but a little small
4.0,good prodect
4.0,Note these are 18 gauge.
4.0,Love the look and fit of this dress. The only downside is that I got it to wear on hot days and the material is HEAVY and traps heat for sure. Just something to keep in mind!
4.0,"When i tried it on it felt good, blocked a good amount of noise out but it seems too tight? I bought it for my 2month old son in anticipation of a wedding reception in july but i  most likely won't use it for that."
4.0,XL is a good fit for size 12 - 14 top
4.0,looked great on my daughter but it's definitely a lot longer then in the picture.  My daughter is 5'5&#34; and it was to her knees.
4.0,"I bought these compression shirts to wear under scrubs, the material is exactly what I was looking for. I am 5'6 and 105 lbs, it has been hard to find fitted shirts, these shirts are a little loose on the torso and a little more on the arms, my waist is 24, and my chest is 32. However, they are by far the most fitted I've found. I also tried Neleus Women's 3 Pack Athletic Compression Long Sleeve T-Shirt Dry Fit shirts, they were A LOT bigger despite coming from the same company and their sizing chart said the chest fit 31-33'' (an inch smaller than the size chart for these shirts). If you are looking for a true ""compression"" shirt for fitness neither of these shirts will work if you have similar chest and waist measurements."
4.0,Great shirt! There became a hole in armpit after wearing it the first time. They may have been accidental. Other than that it's comfortable and fits great.
4.0,Great boots once they are broke in. I added extra padding to improve the fit but if I had ordered a half size smaller they would have been to small.
4.0,"I read other reviews and ordered an XL when I would normally wear a M.  For the price, the shirt was really cute. It's simply made, a few threads here and there and a little boxy but I tuck it in to a skirt for work and it looks really cute.  I love polka dots so it was what I wanted.  I have hand-washed it, which I was nervous about but hung it to dry and it was great. I've worn it twice now and am very happy with it.  For that price, it's worth it!"
4.0,Great summer wrap
4.0,"Good liner, turns rain boots into snow boots."
4.0,I was very happy with this ring. It is very pretty and fit perfectly. I wear it even in water and it still looks great.
4.0,I liked this item and it shipped on time. I felt like the material could have been better quality. Other than that I was happy with my purchase.
4.0,"I really love these bands, they look nice and are really comfortable. The only down side is they can be a bitch to get on."
4.0,Looks great but size is just right and i expected it to be a bit bigger.
4.0,"Beautiful color and style. The bodice fit very well, but the skirt was too full for my body type. Very good quality construction and materials."
4.0,"I got the blk ,tan but looks chestnut,an the berry that's how much I love this shoe so comfortable looks so hott"
4.0,"*Girlfriend here* (I'm the one who used the bras, haha.)<br />I always had an issue with items of clothing that needed to be worn either braless or with a strapless bra. I couldn't figure out how anyone would feel supported with the regular strapless bras, as it was always an insane amount of adjustment and sagging - always lacking the amount of cleavage I wanted. I had been seeing ads for bras like these but was really wary of them - thinking that either they wouldn't support me or they'd be a one time use type of thing. I took a chance and got these! I love them! First of all, the fact that there are two is great for the price. I used these while on a road trip and it was so nice to manage with the case they come in. Being able to adjust the amount of support and cleavage is great. The only drawback were that after sweating for a bit, the sides start to unstick and the outline can start to show through. I think I might have gotten a size a bit too small as it is also a bit of a time eater to try to get an even hold/placement for natural looking/even hold. Overall though, it was great!"
4.0,Beautiful...lots of complements
4.0,Nice looking quartz beads-little longer than my other bracelets.
4.0,"These, honestly look and fit great. I'm 6'2 and surprisingly these fit me perfectly. They look great, I have been complimented on them by random people and are light enough to almost not notice. The leather is comfortable and good looking. My 3 flaws are:<br /><br />1.) Like someone else posted, the black metal emblem slides left to right all day. It doesn't bother me but I'm gonna use some hot glue to fix it in position and to prevent ruining the leather.<br /><br />2.) If the brass on the brown hits anything, it will dent the rounds on the top. I recommend going ahead and taping each on something flat to help but its super minor. Not mad about it. #Character<br /><br />3.) The magnetic clips work great but if you test your hands on a desk, it takes a little to get used to having the clip under your wrists. Otherwise they work fantastic and wont come off easy on an accidental snag.<br /><br />For the price I say snag em. They're great"
4.0,"Comes in a cute re- usable drawstring bag, comes in hard to find colors"
4.0,The ballon separated from the bottom seam but was able to tape it together and tie it off with a ribbon. Lost some air but the tape did well to keep most of it in.
4.0,very happy with bracelet.<br />very good service and fast. I would recommend this to anyone.
4.0,"Nice fit and fits great, nice so for"
4.0,"Not exactly the warm type of sweater, it fits great tho! I just didn't really like the material ☹"
4.0,"I'm a big guy, 6ft close to 300lbs with a round belly and usually wear 3xl clothes so i ordered a 4xl thinking I'd be ok. This shirt was well made and stylish but fit more like a 2xl not a 4xl around the waist. If you're large in the chest & shoulders without a belly than order 1 size up & you'll be golden. If I lose my belly I'll reorder it again."
4.0,It fit okay but a lil tight
4.0,Great little watch with less weight and think body.
4.0,"Like, but lost weight and they fit oddly now. May order a smaller size."
4.0,"Good material, I purchased for work so opted for the medium. 5'3 135lbs. Cuts just above the knee and is well fitting but looks professional."
4.0,"The elastic in the top of the socks is too tight.  Other than that, I love the socks and they are very comfy."
4.0,"The pearl beads seem like their going to break off the dress, like they weren't sewed tight enough. Other than that my daughter that she was a princess, I mean she is. It's super cute!"
4.0,"Where this ring all the time, great quality for price. It does scratch kinda easy though."
4.0,"I love these. I bought a pair last year and never took them out. Unfortunately, the finish wore off, but I liked them so much that I bought another pair. They did not irritate my skin or stink. They are pretty and unique but not so crazy that people stare at the office."
4.0,"Looks good, works good. I'm not blown away and the picture is a  blurry on the mask"
4.0,I bought this dress to wear to Oktoberfest here in the US and then in Munich Germany. It is very high quality and my German mother-in-law was impressed with it. She couldn't believe I found such a high quality German made dirndl online! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the sizes run very small. I returned the first one I got and bought one two sizes up from what I normally wear. The dirndl is very sturdy and even has a pocket on the right side!!
4.0,I like this a lot my only complaint is that the straps are about three inches too long for me and cannot be adjusted though this is usually the case with me as i have to shorten the shoulder straps on everything i wear
4.0,"Lindos pero muy angostos, no es fácil ponerlos, ni sacarlos"
4.0,"Ordered these for my daughter who needs some warm boots, the price you can't beat for these they are super cute and the lining is nice but my daughter must have small feet. I ordered 24 month as she is 20 months and they are big, I can put her in her other shoes and then put these boots over them! No worries though for the price she can grow into them."
4.0,cute ring. comfort fit.  looks nice on finger
4.0,"i wore this to Diner en Blanc with a white cami and white shorts.  great item to pair with any outfit or at the beach!  the only think i didn't love was the large emblem in the back and two on the front that resembled, to me, snowflakes more than flowers.  i just didn't realize this on the photo."
4.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter. Of course, it was a little big, since I had to order an adult size. But, she likes it and so do I."
4.0,"I really like this piece of luggage.  We ordered two and kept them both, even though it is not expandable as advertised. I contacted the seller but never got an answer and for those reasons I give it a four star review.  It does not hold as much as our older carry on pieces but at this point we value the light weight and easy pull. It was very easy to lift these fully loaded cases overhead, as if putting them in the overhead storage, but we decided to check them in.  They held up quite well with minimum signs of wear."
4.0,Amazing job done!!
4.0,"This is certainly an eye catcher and I would have given it a 5 star review except for one issue, not with the watch but with the seller... This watch is actually a Master Calendar aka Multifunctional watch. The details list chronograph and tachometer functions that do not exist on this time piece.<br /><br />I still would have bought this watch had the description been correct because it is down right gorgeous,  I've only wore it for 5 minutes before I found peoples eyes gravitating to my wrist.<br /><br />Shipping was quick and packaged correctly. This will be a nice addition to my collection.<br /><br />Seller, Please correct your description of this time piece."
4.0,I have small feet. Usually a size 6 in US women's fits just fine. The smallest size I could get is too big. The heal bunches up and sticks out of my shoes. Bummer! I guess I need to shop the kid's sizes next time.
4.0,"Bought this for Christmas. It is a super cute shirt.  Didn't love the fabric, but still nice."
4.0,"What I'd expect from Locs brand. It was smaller than I expected, though. Not too dark at all. Especially as compared to other models."
4.0,"Love the mask it is very comfortable and  breathable , will say I was disappointed when the mask chain thing didn’t come with it."
4.0,"This is a nice, relatively comfortable shirt. The texture is great for one of those days when it's cool enough to want something on your arms, but still warm enough that you want breathability. It's also a flattering cut, overall, even with the horizontal stripes.<br /><br />The neckline is a bit odd and doesn't always lay like it's supposed to. The corners will fold over and leave the shirt looking like something's not quite right. But, it's not bad. Nothing I don't feel comfortable wearing."
4.0,"I have a friend who just had a baby and really needed a car seat cover.  When I saw this I knew it would be perfect for her.  The fabric is super soft and stretchy.  It is very well made and fits on the car seat very well.  It is a thinner fabric and is perfect for covering baby in the summer to keep the sun off of her, but thin enough that it doesn't get excessively hot under there.  I know that you can use this cover for many things and I love that.  I love that you don't have to carry a separate cart cover and car seat cover, but this can be a little bit hard to use as a nursing cover at least while the baby is still fairly small and needs a lot of nursing support.  A mom with an older infant that doesn't need to be helped as much under there might find it easier to use as a nursing cover, but it does work great for both of the other uses.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  If my opinion of this item ever changes, I will update this review to reflect that change."
4.0,"Bought this watch as a gift and am very satisfied with it AFTER you get it set.  The instructions that come with it are not understandable.  2 minutes out on the internet looking up ""Touch screen LED Watch set instructions"" or go through the instructions in one of the other reviews and save yourself a lot of grief."
4.0,"The shirt looks great. It felt a little tight, but the material hasn't stood the test of time with multiple washes and worn multiple times."
4.0,"Keeps perfict time, band is easy to adjust. Crown pops a little too easy. I depend on this watch."
4.0,Like the jersey it’s very nice i should of got bigger one tho i still like it a lot 😀👍
4.0,"I really  liked these---but they were too small.  Tried to order larger size, but were out of stock."
4.0,"Cute but don't hold up well in the wash. Covered with tons of lint balls after the first wash, and more keep coming with every wash."
4.0,A little looser fit than expected but still fit nicely
4.0,"Cute masks. Got a lot of compliments on them. People loved then. Very comfortable and love that there is a wire at the top. I wear glasses and they never fogged up. If you have to wear a mask, may as well make it fun!"
4.0,"This dress was perfect for my bachelorette party dinner I absolutely love it! However since it is white it’s see through would recommend wearing a nude slip under it otherwise you can see everything, very light weight fabric and fit perfectly! And was plenty long enough over all I would recommend this product."
4.0,"I agree with other reviewers about the chest band being sized a bit small, but it still fit well even ordering my regular size. I ordered this bra as a racer back option to wear with some new workout tops and it has been great. When I put it on the first time, I was dubious about the amount of support and ability to stop the dreaded bounce during a workout, but it does the job. I'm a 40D and this passed the jumping jack, jump rope, stair sprints, and burpee test.  The hook and eye closures are a bit of a challenge to reach when it is on, but I will take the hassle in exchange for legit support. I just keep the top closure hooked before putting it on and can fasten the bottom one without too many contortions."
4.0,"Very cute, but not adjustable.  Great value.  I returned these because I purchased a second (different) style that was slightly dressier.  The elastic was stiff, good because it will not roll, but a little extra stretch would have been nice.  The metal is of good quality and weight."
4.0,"I bought 2 of these. They are too big but so pretty. The length was below their knees, which was good. The quality seemed fine. They were perfect for family pictures."
4.0,"Had a metal book marker for over a year, then lost it. Glad to find these as a set, so if I lose one I have replacements. Little disappointed the metal is so thin, have to be careful how pages I clip to. Kind of cute with the cats at the top, but the metal thinness does concern me, don't want to lose one due to breakage."
4.0,I love anything Kenneth Cole. Very happy with the quality of this bag. Just slightly smaller than I expected.
4.0,"This shirt looks so adorable in the pictures. I am a size Large so I thought the XL would fit, but it doesn't. I think this shirt is a size medium at most. It is a very cute, modern, top and it would look great on someone really small. I love that it has a crocheted back with the uneven hem. In the photos it looks gray, but it is jet black.<br /><br />The material is very soft and stretchy but not baggy and loose like the pictures. It is made from a cotton blend. The light cream beige crocheting around the back, lays nice and flat and doesn't pucker or bunch up. It is recommended to wash this using cold water only and laying it flat to dry.<br /><br />I would recommend going up two sizes if you want that loose, baggy look, like in the photos.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Opinions are 100% my own, are fair, truthful, and are not influenced by receiving a discount. I have not been financially compensated to  review any products."
4.0,"Well made, and felt really nice, but was too long for this short 5'0 gal, and too difficult to take up hem. Also lower cut in the front than I'm comfortable with."
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter. She seems to like it but it is a little big on her, she's also a skinny 9 year old."
4.0,Very nice wallet I love it the only thing I can say is wrong with it is that it has trouble closing  I can get it closed but it takes forced to do so.
4.0,"That mannequin must either be small or have small ears because that is definitely not a realistic ratio of earring to ear. But to be fair, it's my fault for going by the picture and not the measurements. Each earring is just a little longer than a quarter. I buy nice rhinestone earrings all the time and this was a little pricey for such small earrings in my experience, but I will admit you're paying for quality because the earrings are very lovely. Can easily pass for real silver and real emeralds. I just may have to return the four pairs I ordered because I needed them for the stage."
4.0,A little small but my son loves these!
4.0,Fit nice don't know if it will fade out but it nice fix on my husband
4.0,"Although the color, decorations and shape look exactly like the picture, they are thinner than expected, even considering the price."
4.0,I need a return label to send this back too little thank you
4.0,"Good for replacing the band instead of buying a new watch.  Seems a bit on the small side.  I should've shopped around more, maybe found something a lil bigger."
4.0,This bag its good  the only thing they could of done better its the magnetic botton. Over all good bag
4.0,FITS AS EXPECTED. I ALWAYS ORDER THESE SHIRTS FOR WORK
4.0,"For what it's worth, I have used iPhones exclusively since the first iPhone and the only Android phone I've owned was the S4 active. I've been wearing different versions of the iWatch since its inception as well.<br /><br />The Diesel watch was easy to sync but it does require downloading the Google Assistant app. I love the blue silicone color and the style of the watch. If you're not into the minimalist look of other smart watches and yearn for something similar to a G-Shock, aesthetically, this will fill that hole for you.<br /><br />The watch itself feels cheap, though, almost a ""hollow"" type of feel as opposed to something thick and rugged. I would have liked some weight to it, even if it's artificial. The strap is comfortable, but feels cheap--instead of the soft silicone you get with the iWatch strap, you get what feels more like a rubberized plastic.<br /><br />Something cool about this watch face is that it's ""always on"", so you don't need to turn your wrist to have the screen turn on. The battery life is good as well--lasts a whole day so you can charge it at night and use it all of the next day. There are different watch faces you can use, has a fitness tracker which works pretty well, has a wireless charger cable that's very similar to the iWatch one (it's a small circle that magnetically attaches to the underneath of the watch to charge wirelessly).<br /><br />Ultimately, when you look at this watch vs. something like the iWatch, it's going to come down to preference. I don't see myself every wearing this watch since my iWatch does everything this does an more, but I can see why people don't like the iWatch and would prefer this instead. I just think overall, the price is too high for what you get, specifically the build quality and the processor are lackluster for the price point."
4.0,Good but mine coming with damage package.
4.0,The fit was just right and I can't wait to wear it with leggings and a belt.
4.0,"I got these sunglasses for my husband to wear while driving and mowing our lawn. They're good quality, look very nice, and came exactly as described. The only issue is that they're too narrow for his head- wearing them for an extended period of time would give him a headache. For reference, standard sized baseball hats are very snug on his head. So, if hats generally fit your head okay then these sunglasses might be a good fit!"
4.0,Very nice. Gave it as a Christmas stocking stuffer.
4.0,"The material is soft, the top fits well with my large chest, and the light weight material is nice; but, the skirt material doesn't flex and it doesn't really breath well in the heat."
4.0,Fragile ! but I only paid 13 $
4.0,"Love the fabric, but is a bit large for the size. I had expected a cami, but this is a great top by itself in summer. It is on the short side, and tall people or people with longer torsos will have an issue with it. This is a great layering top."
4.0,Works great inside or out. Runs on highest heat for about 4 hours. Perfect for winter tennis.<br /><br />It definitely runs small. I have an XL and it fits like a large.
4.0,I bought an XL and it fit perfect. The waist band has some stretch. But the material could be better.
4.0,Pants are great but they fit very small.
4.0,Very pretty. Nice material. Like this because the color is neutral so matches with all swimwear.
4.0,"Love it, but too big or heavy to wear. Will return it."
4.0,"While I absolutely LOVE the quality and fit, the color and pattern are not at all what is shown.  I got the Hazelwood pattern and it looks like a taupe or beige but is actually on the green side, very difficult to find a top to match.  If not for the color, I would have gone 5 stars!"
4.0,"I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my husband and he really liked it.  However, there were no instructions included on how to attach the buckle.  Once we looked it up online, it looked so simple but he had to use a plier to attach the buckle as the leather was thick. The video instructions make it seem it just snaps on but it takes some work!  However, he really likes that he could adapt to his waist size and adjust to how much he eats for dinner!"
4.0,The quality is nice but I needed a pendant I could wear as a necklace. However. Anyone who wants a pin will love it.
4.0,"It's a cute dress but needs a petticoat to make the skirt flare as it does in the photo. Although I usually wear a medium, I ordered a small based on other reviews and it fits well. I am 5'4&#34; and about 120 lbs."
4.0,"Well packaged, and prompt delivery.<br />Generally pleased with quality.  Somewhat disappointed with locket part..a little flimsy."
4.0,Cute little set. The crown is flexible and has Velcro to adjust. Overall good price for the quality. Arrived quickly.
4.0,"I ordered my normal size. It's a bit baggy, but not enough that I would size down unless I wanted something more form fitting.  It feels nice and soft. I've washed it once with no problem.<br /><br />I ordered the pink, which in the pictures looked a little more like a slightly deeper rose/berry color. It was a lighter pink/heather red type color that's fine, but I don't love.<br /><br />Overall a cute and comfy shirt for being stuck at home."
4.0,The threading on these gauges make it very difficult to screw some of them together. Otherwise they're great.
4.0,"Good looking, easy and comfortable.  Trifecta :)"
4.0,I wish I looked like the model but I still loved it.🍒
4.0,"They look a bit cheap, but they are cheap"
4.0,I ordered a M and it was baggy in the wrong areas (the waist and hips) and didn't lay well.  There is a lot of material bunching at the bodice which makes the sizing more important.  The material is really nice just runs too big.
4.0,There not shiny like the picture. ..but I got them for my 4year old niece so there great for her. She'll most likely lose them anyways lol
4.0,Feels a little tight around the head but over all feels sturdy.
4.0,Was for my daughter and she loves it. She is 12 yrs old and normally wears a 10/12.
4.0,Cute earrings. Used for Halloween costume
4.0,"These are quality leggings. I love the pockets, they are essential. My only problem is that they are too big. I followed the size recommendations,  but they are definitely bigger than I prefer for working out.<br />I’m considering an exchange for a medium."
4.0,"Love the bracelets. The pink box it was in was crushed though. Luckily it didnt damage the product, but it could have."
4.0,"For reference, I am 5'1, 140 pounds. I am normally between a medium and large. I tend to buy large tops because I am apple shaped with a large chest. This is a more structured shirt. It is not loose and flowing like a normal sweatshirt. It is thick-not see through and comfortable! I wear this as a teacher to work, and it's perfect. The orange color is super bright-just like the picture!"
4.0,lovely if you like large jewelry
4.0,Too large and hot
4.0,Very pretty colors are a bit dull but can't wait to wear it. I'm a women's size 8 & got the medium. Its fits just right.
4.0,It was a bit small<br />Didn't realize there were no bottoms<br />My mistake
4.0,"It”s to thick,,,,"
4.0,"I found the bag to be well made and attractive. The bag was bigger than I expected but I know the manufacturer did give the spec's, it just kind of hard to visualize till you see it. From the other reviews I was ready to run the bag outside because of the oder, but I was pleasantly surprised that there was almost no unpleasant smell. This one is a keeper."
4.0,"Great price, love the pendant.  But the batterie died very very fast.<br />It would be better if the batterie at least lasted 6 month!"
4.0,Runs a little small but I'm satisfied!!!
4.0,This dress is gorgeous so light and flowy. The only thing i didn't like is that the belt was so small everything else fit perfect. I'm 5'3&quot;  187lbs 38DDD chest and the XL fit me just right.
4.0,"I know the bags never claimed to have a pocket, but not having an interior pocket made it just a little disappointing. We've got this big tote and I have to dig and hunt for items. But it is cute and adds a splash of color. On the first day of using my bag, a British lady on my travels called my bright bag, &#34;fetching&#34; against my all black attire.  Not really a word I usually use but once she said it I knew it was the perfect description. The only thing about the smaller bag is that the handles are too small to wear on your shoulder."
4.0,"These tags are great and seemed sturdy, but they did not survive a full trip and I'm not sure if it's the quality of the tag or thieves at United Airlines. I checked 2 pieces of luggages. The departing flight, both tags made it. On my return flight, both tags went missing. The quality seemed sturdy enough, so I can't imagine that they fell off or ripped off and even so, that may have happened to one, but two? I'm not sure. Anyone else find that these tags easily fall off? I have 2 more that I can use an another upcoming trip, but I'm questioning if I should even bother."
4.0,"Ordered on on the 5th and got it on the 16th, not bad considering that it's coming all the way from China. It's silver in the picture but is actually gold, I still like it but it's not what is advertised. It has one cuff at the top which is okay, but likely to break after a while but it's cheap so what can you do."
4.0,Super cute amd light weight it does run a little big tho :)
4.0,padding is decent - great value
4.0,"Good coat quality, runs very small."
4.0,"I have a 27” waist so I ordered a medium. Fit as expected and is comfy around the thighs and butt area. I also enjoy the cloth texture inside the skirt. The only worry I have is the top of the skirt. It has a thicker seam with leather on both sides of the skirt, so it sticks to my skin tighter than the rest of it. It has helped keep my skirt from slipping around which it cool but it isn’t as breathable as the rest of it."
4.0,Nice case for good price. Very durable.
4.0,"I love the print of this dress & the material.  It hangs very nicely.  But, the length is shorter than what I expected.  Instead of a dress, it more closely resembles (due to the length) a beach cover-up."
4.0,Good for the price.  These are very thin and definitely a one time use.
4.0,"Nicely made and fits like expected, just a little long."
4.0,"When giving your measurements, you should probably add a centimeter onto the length of your foot. They use *exact* measurements, so my boots are pretty tight but they aren't uncomfortable. Also, when giving the height, make sure you include the flap that goes over your knee - I wasn't aware that they counted that as part of the height, so the flap stops under my knees. It isn't too big of a deal - I doubt people will notice or care - but if you're picky then make sure you take it into consideration. Also, the soles are made of wood on the inside, so I'll probably buy a thin cushion to cover that up. Again, it isn't uncomfortable, but it might snag on socks a little.<br /><br />All in all, the boots look great and I definitely recommend them for cosplayers."
4.0,It's not exactly what it looks like in the pic but its still nice overall lol. It's a little shorter I think but that could just be the person wearing it really?
4.0,"My teenager loves this sweatshirt and wears it just about every day.  The only complaint he's had is that the ninja mask is rather tight, as in kind of difficult to get your head in.  Also it was thinner than I expected."
4.0,its somewhat small but lose. like the arms and legs are a little bit short but the crotch part is lose. i dont know if its actually like that .<br />but all in all the item is good! nice detail and color
4.0,It was a great dress.
4.0,It's all good holds the credit cards not so much on picture's.
4.0,"Very comfortable, and I had no problems getting my prosthetic breasts into it. This will definitely be more comfortable and cool for summer time than the industrial strength one that cost more than five times as much. The downside is that my prosthetics are not silicone, but microbead--sort of like beanbags, honestly--so they aren't going to hold their shape that well in this bra compared to the hot and not so comfortable expensive one. I'm thinking I can find a way around that though, or, maybe decide I don't really care."
4.0,Quality gloves from Hestra but thumbs are slightly longer than other Hestra gloves I own.
4.0,"Would have Loved these boots, If they were in the Right size. They Were what I Hunted for just upsetting. The Boots were Exactly what I Wanted"
4.0,"It's exactly like the picture.  Kind of swim suit material,  the white lace part it's see through bit it's thick enough to no be too revealing.  I love it and get compliments on it every time I wear it."
4.0,"Great dress but its not great if you have a long torso. I have a pretty solid hourglass but you can not tell in this dress! It hits too high above the natural waist and almost empire (but still in the wrong place for that). If you are a long-waist, hourglass this may not be the best fir or tey a size up.<br /><br />Also the Brick Red is really an Orange. Almost a pumpkin orange, and a great color for fall! I was super suprised when I opened the box but luckily I love the color."
4.0,Absolutely love these shoes. After reading all the reviews I agree and decided to size up and I'm glad that I did so definitely consider that. I have picked 'true to size' based on the opinion of others to go up one size especially because of the point in the front of the shoe. I am usually an 8-8.5 depending on the shoe so I ordered a 9 and they fit great. Color is true to the picture. They are not rigid and will stretch out after an hour or so of wearing them. IMO this makes them more comfortable. I probably wouldn't choose to wear these for the day if I was going to be walking alot because there is not alot of support but I chose these for the way they look. If you are not used to wearing pointed shoes (like me) you'd be surprised at how easy your feet will adapt. They are not squished and so far they do not hurt. Today is the first day of wearing them so if any of my review changes in time I will update.
4.0,Very cute; good quality
4.0,Cute but wish had bigger size
4.0,This is a super comfortable sports bra and the built in cups make it perfect for wearing by itself at the gym and not feeling self conscious. It also absorbs sweat well and breathes but the only thing I don't care for is that it rolls up a bit in the front depending on what exercises you're doing. Still worth the money though.
4.0,"The most comfortable thong I have worn--ever.  I expected a slightly closer fit, but the soft fabric still fits really well.  The cut and lightness make all day wearing thoughtless.  So far the material has held up to laundering."
4.0,While the piece wasn't exactly what I expected material wise(finish on the brown synthetic leather) the customer service was amazing. They contacted me to see how I liked the purchase and immediately refunded my money when I shared my thoughts on the material. I will no doubt use them again when I'm looking for a new update especially their ribbon bands.
4.0,While I loved this ..kids went to regular kids underwear. I guess it could be good if you're expecting to train for a long time.
4.0,Beautiful ring. Wish the stone was bigger.
4.0,Interesting size but excellent quality.
4.0,"Real nice on blocking out sun ,little heavy, love the polarized lens"
4.0,It's good material.  Fit a little big around the neck but nothing to complain about.  I'm 6'7 165 lbs.  Ordered a medium.  Fits good! Love it! Will order again
4.0,Came perfectly packaged and exactly as described!
4.0,"This bag is the measurements it says on the outside... the inside, what it holds, is a lot smaller because it is stuffed, its like wearing a stuffed animal that has a compartment big enough for a cellphone and not much else. However, that's only if you can get that tiny little shoulder strap to fit you, this is most likely intended for children, not cosplayers looking to carry snacks, camera, cellphone, gum etc. It is very small.."
4.0,Nice emerald color and very flattering. It’s inexpensively made (what do you expect for $20?) and the front opens when you sit. Definitely recommend a slip underneath.
4.0,"Alright, I have had this product for a while and I have a major piece of advice for you. Be careful where you put it! If you're a guy, you got to be super careful because the ink spreads when wet. If it's in your pocket and you get sweaty from like walking up several flights of stairs or something, the ink will spread on the wallet, the contents inside is fine but the wallet has this black cloud on it. Now if you're a girl and use a purse, you'll be fine. Like the wallet is great and it's big, but you do want to be careful about that. Another thing this is a note about a anointing this with the wallet. The flaps stick, so like you are putting in you're card and it won't push down all the way. I kinda just stick my fingers in there and push the flaps apart. so overall, great product but be careful!"
4.0,Nice set of belts. The leather ends and buckles match the belts nicely. They are well stitched and have a nice stretch to them. They look like they are expensive but the price was very reasonable. Well worth it.
4.0,"Good quality. Fits as expected. Lightweight enough to be ""breathable."""
4.0,"Great style and fit. Honestly, they are pretty fragile, so if you are rougher on sunglasses be warned. After leaving a 2 star review the company reached out and offered me a refund, which I appreciated since I assumed it wasn't worth the trouble. With such active customer service I would consider purchasing again if I find another style I really like."
4.0,"The glasses are cute and I love the color, but they are a bit big. I knew they were bigger frames, but this was just a bit larger than I expected or wanted."
4.0,I loved the color just a tiny bit off but they look good and can see very well while in house watching TV
4.0,😌
4.0,"I like the style of it but it is so large!! I have clothes that are smalls, mediums, and larges so I decided to still get a medium and it's swimming on me. I'm 5'3&#34;, 125lbs, size 6 and I'm considering returning for a small. It's a cute design and my interactions with the company have been mostly pleasant."
4.0,Very heavy for a small lady's wrist. Great looking though.
4.0,The material is beautiful the fabric also the measurements are badly calculated I had to ask for one size less for me because it was extremely big but it is beautiful recommended for the purchase
4.0,"I like that I can keep my kids things organized in these cubes.  It makes packing for a trip so much easier. I can just give each child their color coded bags, also I love that the top is clear.  I just wish they were deeper for the large and medium.  You cant fit many things inside because it is not deep enough.  Otherwise, a very good product.  I can see us using these for all our trips from now on."
4.0,A little warped
4.0,Smaller than shown in the pictures but still gorgeous.
4.0,They fit great. Long enough for 5’8”. Nice color and material. One star down for not relevant picture from seller.
4.0,"We were told at work that we now have to wear red tops 3 days a week.  Well, red is not my color people!  This was a nice option.  It fit as expected and seems to have the stuff to last.  I received loads of compliments and inquiries &#34;where did you get that shirt, it's so cute?&#34; Polka dots can be fun, they do make people happy.  Scientists should look into that.  The polka dot effect.<br /><br />So yes, good price good quality and accurate fit.  Bright colors, good buttoning.  I don't like it when  the buttons slip out of their buttonholes too easily! In my opinion, you can buy this with confidence."
4.0,"Looks great and is very, very comfortable! Did not like that it creases very easily, so I am a little disappointed in quality."
4.0,comfy and pretty colors i like it!
4.0,Just an FYI don’t dry this jacket in anything but fluff and no heat. It smells terrible when it arrives. Also this runs super small I normally wear a L/XL I ordered this in 3xl and I honestly could’ve gone up one size. The pockets are pretty teeny tiny really pretty useless.<br />The good.  I love the weight of it. It’s not heavy and perfect for cool weather not cold but maybe a good fall weight. I love the pattern. I made the mistake of doing mine on low heart for about 15 min. When I hung it up to dry the white moon patterns were all stuck together and I has to spend a good half hour or so peeling them apart.<br />I would order it again because i love the pattern.
4.0,"If I was still 140 lbs this would fit better, but still comfy."
4.0,I like the cut and color of the dress.
4.0,"Okay! So I worn this for over two years straight! It is super comfy, doesn’t catch on things, etc. The only thing is the color of the main gem turned from the beautiful blue to an okay green. I would recommend but do wish the gem was a little more resilient."
4.0,Like the color and style. Washes well.
4.0,The stress is really comfortable and I love the pockets I'm kind of short but it still doesn't touch the ground
4.0,Very nice for the purchase price. Granddaughter was pleased with it.
4.0,Arrived sooner than expected! Good quality and fit well. I'd order from them again.
4.0,"12 cute faux piercing pieces that could be used to imitate nose piercings like the septum or nostril.  There are ones that you could also wear on the ear like a cuff or cartilage piercing.  Just for the sheer fun of taking photos to send to your uptight parents to tell them you got your nose pierced, it's great.  Did that once to my mother using a piercing app on my phone, sent her the pic of my tongue ""pierced""...she wouldn't talk to me for a week, until I finally told her it was fake (I was 42, lol!!).  Aside from the pranks, they looked pretty cute for every day wear too, l think."
4.0,fashionable and i like it
4.0,very good hat and i love snow camo
4.0,"I really like it, fit me perfectly"
4.0,Very nice just a little smaller then I expected?
4.0,Love these glasses but they sit really heavy on the bridge of my nose and therefore I can't wear them very often; which is unfortunate since they are awesome at blocking out really bright sunlight!
4.0,I like that they kept their size after washing but the print is a decal and will eventually wear off
4.0,"The skirt was adorable, but a little too puffy and long for my liking, so I ended up returning it."
4.0,Good quality. Nice springy feel when you close them and sturdy case! Would purchase again Just make sure you know what strength to buy!
4.0,My husband says they are comfortable and keep his feet warm. He did say he would have liked them to have a more tempurpedic feel.
4.0,"Shorts are great fitting. But, the pockets are hard to get into. The opening is not wide enough. But they do zip up."
4.0,So far have not had anything to dislike with these panties.  They fit perfectly.
4.0,Head opening is a little tight. One snap or a short zipper at the neck would improve this or a child with a small head. Otherwise it is well made and as expected.
4.0,I like it however I thought it would be bigger
4.0,This dress is well made and the style is very flattering.  I got the blue one and it's a lovely color.  I would give it 5 stars if it was made with a little better quality of material.  This thin t shirt but non cotton material that is everywhere now is not a long lasting kind of material and I miss good sturdy cotton/poly cloth.
4.0,"Nice dress, a bit see-through so you need a slip."
4.0,Fabric feels good.
4.0,"Purchased these gloves for a cold metropolitan vacation destination. They kept my hands warmer than  expected and looked very stylish. Yes the fingers are oddly long on a few fingers, maybe it’s for those with long fingernails? The touch screen capability wasn’t reliable, which I believe is a manufacturing defect on my specific pair since there have been so many good reviews on that feature. I contacted the company and their customer service on the matter has been amazing! If you are looking for nice inexpensive leather gloves, I suggest you try these. The industrial scent is hardly there and goes away fast, for gloves under 30.00 these are good value. If you don’t like them (and have prime) just return them. The different colors are fun too!"
4.0,Like them so much!
4.0,Absolutely beautiful earrings! Very delicate.
4.0,"These are pretty good glasses. I ordered the 3 pack and I was pleasantly surprised at how straight they actually were, I love them but the lenses aren't as round as I'd like them, they're a bit flat but great price and product"
4.0,The printing worn off!!!! Really.....??!!
4.0,Works fine !!
4.0,"It’s true to size. I’m 5ft 6in and approx 137lbs and ordered a size 6, and it fit well. I don’t have sensitive skin but wearing the dress for a wedding-I became itchy, and broke out it little red welts all over. It was more snug in the gut than expected but it is lace up which I have no experience with."
4.0,"PROs:<br />- great fit for Men's Moto 360 Gen 2 46mm<br />- looks nice and professional<br />-quality seems really good, including strong magnet<br /><br />CONS:<br />- not long enough to easily get on/off over a large hand. Can barely squeeze my hand in and out of this band making it a bad choice for frequent travelers who need to be able to quickly remove their watch to scan a boarding pass in old fashioned narrow slot airport barcode readers.<br />- Does NOT fit on the original Pebble smart watch where the wholes for the watch pins are set back just a little too far for this design."
4.0,"This is super cute, bought for a gift for teenage niece. Problem is it is attached by the thinnest piece of the ribbon I'm afraid it will very easily rip out. Not sure how long it's going to last."
4.0,The socks fit perfect! There very comfortable and I’d buy them again.
4.0,I like the shape and the print but the fabric was a little bit unstrechy. It had a tendency to not fit to look the best around the body.
4.0,For my daughter's birthday
4.0,"Left labels inside on the bottom,miserable to remove."
4.0,"Nice and soft fabric. The fit is flattering. I purchased a large in order to have more room to work out in, I normally wear a medium. The colors are beautiful. Quality is good."
4.0,A little large in the cup. Fabric isn't the softest but it's not bad. Some had stray string I had to trim but not bad. Will get again.
4.0,"Top was much too big. Made well, but didn’t fit like the model. I’m usually a size medium"
4.0,"nice shopping bag for kiss fans, solid material"
4.0,A lot thinner and smaller than expected but nice quality.
4.0,Very nice charm. I love it. I just don’t like how some jewels have fallen out.
4.0,"Warm, took along time to ship but wasn’t really disappointed in the product.  Maybe a little cheap on cuffs but not too bad.  Haven’t tried to wash it yet 🤞🏻"
4.0,This is a cute necklace. Nicely detailed. Although you cannot remove the pendant to put on another chain. I needed a longer chain.
4.0,Love the style and the fit of the dress. There’s a little extra room in the shoulder area.
4.0,"a little bent on the brim, but steamed out nicely to get its shape back. mine came with clips and a headband which were interchangeable depending on what worked best."
4.0,"Outfit looks like the picture, runs a little small though.<br />But overall, satisfied"
4.0,buena calidad y fue lo esperado...
4.0,"I got a medium, which is my typical size. It fit well, but is shorter than expected. I'm not mad at it, especially for the price. I'll keep it, but I may not wear it often. Also, if you don't button it all the way, the collar lies strangely. I don't like tight things around my neck, so usually with tops like this I undo the top button and tie the bow loosely. With this top that's not super attractive because the collar flops to either side when not buttoned all the way. Ok for the price, and I'll keep it, but I might not have bought it."
4.0,It fit okay. A bit snug compared to other Large shirts I ordered for my nephew.
4.0,I actually love these. My only problem is that the left one hurts a bit so I can't wear it for long. I've tried opening up the loop but then it's too loose. I haven't found the perfect fit just yet. I got them as part of my wedding jewelry set so I still have a few months to work it out.
4.0,Great scarf ring! The color is silver and looks great!
4.0,like it lite but warm
4.0,"I loved these earrings. They are probably the cheapest earrings I have ever bought, but I really got value for money. I wore them to work and get lots of compliments. I have even been the inspiration for a few guys to get similar items for theirs. I get to have the multipierced look without the mulitple holes in my ear lobe.<br /><br /> They are very comfortable and do not move. I do not know how some of the reviewers figured these are fragile. They look delicate, but as long as you do not pull and bend them too much, they really stand up to daily wearing,"
4.0,This is stretchy so the XL could probably fit XXL if you're pushing it. It looks as described and the pictures are accurate. It does have a bit of an odd smell but that dissipated after a few minutes.
4.0,"Runs on the small size,but a size up or maybe two"
4.0,This blouse was very comfortable and people asked my cousin where she got it from when she wears it.
4.0,My ears are turning the rose gold into a more regular looking gold color.
4.0,"The product fits as expected and is very pretty, but unfortunately the fringe is cheap and falling off after just one wear."
4.0,Daughter loves it. Well made with a liner in the dress. A bit long so we shortened it....very easy to do. The only negative comment is tights are missing. We even ordered a replacement costume and the tights are missing in this package as well so we ordered separate tights.
4.0,"Shirt arrived on time.  Perfect fit.  Ordered a Large.  I'm 5'9&#34;,  210 lbs. & wear a 38D/DD. Fits very comfortably."
4.0,"The thumb holes are not the same size one is very small and one is quit big, other than that, I love them"
4.0,"Love the shoes and the zip makes it even better. I can't complain, I could do another color for sure"
4.0,"The only reason I took off a star was due to the clip being a real bear to use. The metal ones on other clippings are way better/easier. That being said, with a lot of practice this could be a one hand operation. As to how they work, the color is great (for me) of night driving and the polarization does help. I tried em and like em. Curiously, they did not pass the test where you put them behind a know to be polarized lens and turn one of them to produce the darkening effect, but turning this by itself did produce the same result as turning the polarized lens I already have which is to reduce glare in the vertical orientation. I'd definitely buy these again."
4.0,"I sized down like all the reviews said to do and they fit perfectly. The only reason these did not get 5 stars is because the inside is itchy, after two washes  the itchiness is bearable, hopefully it will fade more over time."
4.0,Cute skirt! Washes well but needs ironing after every wear
4.0,I got these for a catwoman costume and for the price they were great. Fit the look I needed well and I can also wear them outside of the costume so they were a good purchase.
4.0,Buy a size larger because the crotch area is snug and rides up
4.0,"These sweaters are very beautiful the only thing you have to watch out for is/ it is extremely SHORT in the front. Unless you're belly is very flat and you want to show off, this one's for you. But the sleeves are perfect //color blend is beautiful. Maybe I'll send back and see if a size up is longer. I wore the sweater with a really thin shirt underneath just to cover my belly and put this one over top."
4.0,A good fob or key ring.
4.0,The robe is very soft and warm
4.0,"Fits small, really thin material, but super cute."
4.0,"It’s cute, chain is kinda cheap looking. Would look so much nicer with a better chain."
4.0,"This watch is beautiful and it's my favorite - goes with everything. I bought it because it wasn't the usual silver or gold, or leather band. It was definitely a challenge to remove links with the provided tool, but after about 1/2 hour of fussing (and cussing), I finally got it done. I love it - keeps great time and I've received many compliments."
4.0,"Good gym bag, I really like it. Comes all folded up and you just unfold it and your good to go, for the price you can't beat it. I will say the fabric is thinner than I thought it would be, but that wouldn't stop me from buying it."
4.0,"Love the size of the purse and the soft material on the outside.<br />Giving a 4 out of 5 because I feel the material in the inside was “cheap”.<br />All in all for the price I paid, I would recommend to others"
4.0,Happy with the watch
4.0,"to be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect from these jeans.  From the pictures, I would have expected them to be longer and baggier, but honestly I love the way they fit. They remind me of Levi silver tab baggy jeans, which are no longer made.  I am 6'4&#34; 255, so with my long inseam, I understand why they aren't as baggy as in the picture, but like I said, they fit me perfect.  I've stopped buying Levi's because to get the length that I need that will give me leg room, I have to get them WAY too big in the waist.  these fit perfect to the point I don't even need to wear a belt.  I just got them, so I can't really yet say how durable they are or if they will last, but so far so good.  I'll probably buy more of these, if I can find some different shades of blue or even other colors"
4.0,"I'm giving this 4 stars because of inconsistency of products shipped. While the watchband I ordered from this seller arrieved on time and has had 0 problems and clasps nice and firm, I suggested this exact product to a couple friends and their experience varied wildly, one had a slightly different mesh pattern, and another the clasp didn't hold very well. If you get a good one like I did, its AMAZING, buy with caution."
4.0,"Great for the price! Be aware that it is quite sheer. We ordered these for bridesmaids ddresses and none of us (all very different dress sizes) had any issues with the fit. I wear a 16 in most dresses and an XL fit perfectly. We had some issues with the hems; on my dress it was uneven, but not in the cute trendy way, just in a weird and awkward way. The chest area on all the dresses was also strangely saggy. Thankfully these were easily fixed by a local seamstress, and these dresses were great for the price."
4.0,So cute! Love this fun bird dress. My only complaint is that basically all the birds of one type are on the front and another type are on the back. I would have liked to see them be more evenly distributed. Bird placement probably just depends on the luck of the draw.
4.0,Nice fit but don't like the poofy waistband.
4.0,"The material is standard for this type of dress, its stretchy but still has form. It was a tad bit shorter , im 5'6  and it hit me 3 inces above the knee but not too bad where i couldnt wear it to work. Very classy."
4.0,"Nice dress but it fits too loose on the top, fabric is nice too, had to return"
4.0,Like them all
4.0,"It was just a base model travel case not much special, works exactly like I’d wand it to, just a base model travel case"
4.0,I like them. They were cheap and look great on me.
4.0,"This top is quite long reached right above my knees, so it fits more like a dress. I do like the fit a lot dispite fabric is somewhat sheer. Keeping as a dress."
4.0,Arrived on time and great quality.
4.0,"beautiful quality and workmanship.  My only complaint with this bag is that there are no small zippered pockets or partitions as you find in other tote bags, in which to keep your keys, pens and other small items.  So either you have a big jumble of assorted items, or you must partition and organize into your own individual containers."
4.0,Very nice and sizing is perfect
4.0,"I bought this hoping to wear it in my conch piercing, but it's way too small. I'm going to get my cartilage pierced specifically so I can wear this though, because it's super cute! Just wish they would have been more clear on how big the ring itself is."
4.0,"The band itself has thr de feeling and style as the original fitbit band that comes with the watch. I was hoping for softer material but I can live with it for the price. Also, the decorative print is not white but more silver. Again it's ok foe the price"
4.0,"I have been needing a new wristlet for a while, as the zipper on my last one completely failed me.  I hate using regular wallets, because they are rarely big enough for me to stuff all of my crap in, and I oftentimes like to just carry a wristlet around - no bag.  It is just more convenient that way.  Also, since I am a vegan...most of the ones labelled 'vegan-friendly' are pretty....bad.  Or expensive.  This wristlet is PU leather - not real leather, making it absolutely vegan friendly.  It comes in a variety of colors and at an affordable price as well.  It is not the most durable wristlet I have come across, but it hold everything I want it to and more and looks decent.  It pretty much checks all of the boxes for me.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"These are so cute, but the small bottoms are super small. Unfortunately they don’t have another pair in a medium or a large. I just can’t believe how tiny they are. Fabric is very soft as well"
4.0,Not a bad products for the money
4.0,Very cute. But quite big.
4.0,Fit the glasses well and have a good tight fit.  Good value for clip-ons.
4.0,Like it. Good to wear daily.
4.0,Like them but waist rolls down when working
4.0,My daughter loved it and you cant beat the price.
4.0,I give these pants 2 thumps up but 4 starts because of the pockets zipper... I own 4 pairs...
4.0,This is a super cute top! I thought it would be a little looser than it is and would have ordered a size up if I had known! The white and black one is what I ordered!
4.0,Have had many compliments on these
4.0,"Nice, feminine, comfortable. I’m 5’3, 34c, 150 and medium is great. Don’t care for how the material slightly buckled at bottom of buttons but might be noticeable only to me I’ll still get another in a color I don’t have. I recommend."
4.0,You have to place it in a good spot on your ear. If not it will bunch up your bottom lobe. Very cute alternative for industrial piercings.
4.0,"Beautiful piece! I wore it under a blazer to work with a tank top underneath (because it's sheer). A little looser than expected, but would work great with leggings since the back dips like a tunic. 4 stars for the sheerness. I didn't expect to have to layer it. But for the $ it's a great and beautiful buy!"
4.0,Beautiful but ran large. Had to return...😣
4.0,"I've lost 1 earring twice, although we found it both times!.  This makes me afraid to wear these out in public! I wish the back ""locked in"" a little bit better."
4.0,My daughter would always get the cowgirl boots from Target...I decided to purchase these as they were close in price.  My daughter LOVES them and wears them everywhere.  She told me they are super comfortable and they look cute on her also!
4.0,"You could really size down one size if you want-- it's pretty roomy.  It has a high neckline, which is great... except it was really high and that's not quite what I wanted."
4.0,"Great hoodie. Ordered a Large, and it fit pretty much like I thought it would. The texture isn't as thick and warm as I thought it would be so it'll be a tough wear for when it gets really cold out. The only downside is that there are NO POCKETS. Do with that information what you wish."
4.0,Nice fit and comfy. Not sure they are worth $70. Scketchers feel better
4.0,Medium is snug
4.0,"Nice yoga leggings. Cute pattern, only issue is they are a bit see through."
4.0,these pants are awesome! I cut them to ankle length as they originally came well past the end of my feet. if they had come in a petite size certainly a 5
4.0,"I've been wearing the band on my Apple Watch 5 44mm for a week now, and I like it more than I expected.  If you've been wearing an Apple band or another band where the slack tucks under, in between your arm and the band, this one is a little bulkier - it's more like a traditional watch band.  It takes a little getting used to, but if you wore a watch in the days of yore before smart watches and silicone bands, then you should have no problem.<br /><br />One neat feature is the holes that run the width of the band.  I found that, when I first started wearing it, the ""extra"" band after I fastened it was too long for the holder loop to keep the band flush.  It was annoying, but at this price point it wasn't a deal breaker.  Then one day the holes through the band and the loop being in one clicked, and I had an ""Ah ha!"" moment - maybe the loop was moveable?  Eureka! I moved the loop down one notch, and it holds the band flush with no ""tail"" sticking out awkwardly.  To their credit, those holes also seem to make the band a little more comfy and breathable as well.<br /><br />All in all, well worth the price.  It's not pretty or fancy, but it does the job.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the holder loop protrudes out from the band more than I think is necessary - it being tighter to the band would be a better design."
4.0,Daughter loved these and they last along time
4.0,Color and Logo is great
4.0,It is a really good product. I gave 4 stars because I prefer the rectangle bottom bag design from the same brand that I already bought before. The rectangle bottom bag design can fit a lot more groceries items
4.0,Very nice dress; great quality.  I love how it fits.  I'm a US size 10/12 and had order xl but had to return it for a large. The L fits just right.  I love so much I also ordered it in yellow!!!!!
4.0,I have a small figure and a bit of a bigger butt for my size so it’s a bit tight on that area and the waist was a tiny bit too big but nothing a belt can’t fix. The area around the ankles were a bit baggy but nothing a little sewing or cute boots can’t fix.
4.0,"I fell in love with this dress on the website, and I feel deeper in love when I put it on.<br /><br />I normally wear a medium in most tops, and I'm typically a size 10 dress.  Checking the measurements on the chart provided was definitely the smart thing to do.  I ended up ordering a large based on the information given, and it definitely fits as it should in the waist and the bust...for the most part.<br /><br />I - like a lot of other folks - get quite a gap in between the buttons.  My gap happens between the fourth and third button, and it could pose a bit of a problem.  However, I plan on sewing a little snap in between the two buttons, and that will eliminate the gap problem.  I decided to do this because honestly - for this price - I'm not sending this dress back.  It's too beautiful and cute when I put it on.<br /><br />The fabric smells a bit like the plastic bag it comes in when you first open it up, but I'm betting it will dissipate with the first wash.  The fabric itself is rather light (lighter than I expected), but it's definitely not see-through.  It feels like a nice spring/summer dress.  The zipper on the side is nice for the ease of putting the dress on.  The belt/bow that's provided is nice and adds a great contrast at the waist.  I did expect there to be little sewn-in string belt loops like I have on other dresses so I could use those as a guide for the belt, but I didn't see anything like that on this dress."
4.0,"When these socks came out of the package, they felt really stiff. I was worried that they wouldn't be comfortable. But I was actually surprised that they felt really good when on. The bottom is ribbed and those ribs actually provide a little bit of ""massage"" while on. They also fit my size 8 foot really well. They didn't fall down into the shoe and stayed in place."
4.0,"Good size, works fine, good value.  Leaves fingers with residue that washes off easily."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, Pendant smaller than expected."
4.0,this product looks very nice on my neck and i like it very much. i broke it by accident because i put it on too tight and bent my neck but it was easy enough to fix with needle nose pliers. it was my own fault. if you buy it dont put it on too tight. its nicer looking than the inch thick ones i was glad to find a 3/8th option.
4.0,"Looks good, feels good, but is noticeably lacking in build quality. For the price however it’s a great deal for the quality and style you get. If your budget can be stretched, you might be better off with something more premium, but otherwise you can buy with confidence."
4.0,Dress is very cute!<br /><br />Downside: the armpits are small. I probably won’t wear it :/
4.0,"Love it, it’s soft and comfortable and something just easy to go with all outfits"
4.0,"Wow, I really expected to hate these but they are nice looking and very comfortable. I usually wear 34 30 jeans and the medium fits ok, a little tight in the thigh, but the material is stretchy so no problem. One thing I noticed over the typical jeans I wear are that these are high waisted. For me, they would look strange if I tucked in a shirt but I will wear these with shirts out and they will be great. Also, the fly is fake so you have to pull them down, bummer."
4.0,Love it cute made great for kids or adult
4.0,Very nice and as others have stated it runs small so i sized up an its perfect.
4.0,Took this luggage on a trip from DC to Vegas. It handled the trip exceptionally well.
4.0,I bought this to wear in Dubai. Its very comfortable and fits perfect
4.0,"Surprisingly tough material, yet very light and breathable. Used during a cruise to Bahamas as beach pants and all around liesure.  I’m definitely buying more!"
4.0,worked good. used in italy. I carried stuff.
4.0,I like the material. The straps are a little flimsy but i kind of like that.
4.0,comfy but cheapish
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:366f31e2f9e614c8ef5b6823d82c118e]] This Women Chiffon Bathing Suit Cover Up has its pros and cons, and here is why.<br /><br />I ordered a small size for my wife to wear over her bathing suit as she is petite in size.  This product's pros are that the fabric feels very well made and has a lovely floral pattern on top and a more sheer design below.  It also has side slits for the legs, and it looks good when open.<br /><br />However, when closed, this product's con is that it does not look fitted.  The sides go straight down without any shape.<br /><br />Overall this product is OK for the beach, and therefore I rate it a 4 out of five stars."
4.0,"Beautiful shoes. My 4 and 5 year olds loved them! Do keep track of the ribbons, though! They are not connected permanently to the shoes and my kids found the ribbons to be fun toys."
4.0,"My wife likes this and uses it. It absorbs water well and is comfortable to wear. She is a medium and we ordered medium, and it fits well. The brown is not the most attractive color there is, but it is functional and she doesn’t wear it outside the bathroom or bedroom, so the color is not really a problem. It is nice that it also includes a hair towel."
4.0,My son is rough on shoes and these have so far held up for the last month and still look new. They dark blue is great at disguising dirt. The only fault is that two tips of the laces have fallen off  so they had to be knotted to keep them from fraying.
4.0,"sleeves are big, i got a size small and it fits good on body but not sleeves, they are kind of cuffed. very see thru material, but very cute."
4.0,Fast shipping and great product! It's large enough to fit all my gym needs and is very comfortable  to wear
4.0,I just needed a smaller size
4.0,I love the cut and style of this dress. Although the material isn’t my favorite it fits well.
4.0,little larger than expected but great
4.0,"I researched the measurements. The neckline was loose and the dress is very long. Other than that, nice dress."
4.0,"These are okay. My son doesn't love them, because he's used to wearing brand name clothes like Hurley, etc. I purchased these for him to use at home when he's in the pool, just so he has an extra bathing suit. The colors are very bright, which is what he doesn't really care for, but someone else might like that. I think they look fine. They are well made and fit well.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. No particular rating was promised in return, and the opinions expressed here are my own following my first-hand experience with the product. Because I rely on Amazon's reviews when I purchase items, I truly give honest reviews. I hope this review was helpful in your purchase decision."
4.0,"I think the vest works as intended.  It fits well, makes me sweat, and does what it is designed to do.  Unfortunately, I seem to be allergic to the material and broke out in a rash.  I have allergic contact dermatitis to this product.  I am blaming the product, but wanted to mention this as it might help others with a similar situation.  If not for my allergy, I would say this is perfect for me."
4.0,It is what is expected for the amount I paid for it but I feel like the material could be better. Feels cheaply made
4.0,okay top but very large
4.0,Nice pants but thought they would run a little bigger and be a little roomier. My almost 10 year old is tall and lean (about 5 ft+) and this fit him just right.  I thought it would be a little bigger so we will probably only get 1 season out of these pants.  But still nice pants and glad they fit him!
4.0,kind of thin and stretched across my chest (42dd)
4.0,made to small..
4.0,"arrived on time, cute"
4.0,"These are very flattering, perfect length. They do make a swishing sound when walking, the material is somewhat loud. Water just beads right off which is great! Recommend these shorts"
4.0,Excellent price.  I bought this for my new CX-5 keys.  It looks amazing.
4.0,"This RFID Blocking Credit Card holder is nice and the color I ordered is very bright, I easily see the neon green in my bag.  It has six slots and I was able to put two cards in each slot comfortably.  The locking button is made secure and won't just pop open.  I tried to put more cards in the case and over fill it and found the button would not close.<br /><br />As for the RFID Blocking, I have no way to review and will have to take the manufactures word that it actually works.  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,My husband loves these socks. He was able to walk/hike for over 3 miles with no leg fatigue or foot pain. I would highly recommend these socks to anyone!
4.0,These slippers fit perfectly. They are very sturdy for outdoor wear. Nice and warm. Big complaint is that they are Not memory foam.
4.0,"Love it! Very sexy, but conservative at the same time."
4.0,"Washed and hung dry, still ended up shrinking (length). 5'5"" pear shape 250 lbs and the purchased 2x was loose.  Prior to wash the dress fit at the knee, after hit 1 inch above the knee."
4.0,"When I opened these, they were bigger than I thought they would be! I'm 5'8&#34;, and they are the size of the end of my pinky from end joint to fingertip. The next thought I had was how the picture didn't do them justice. The stainless steal is beautifully shiny and the hematite really adds to the bling factor. The amethyst stones are beautifully polished and shaped. I couldn't help but to pick them up right away! Absolutely stunning!! The clasp on it is very sturdy, and secures snugly. Of course, I had to try them on at that point and run to a mirror. They are stunning! But after a few minutes of wear, I realized that these are a little heavy for me and I had to take them off. LOVE the jewelry, handcrafted so well, beautiful design, but on the heavier side. My tolerance for much weight is low, so don't let that deter from these if you love the design. I received these at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review. If it weren't for the weight, I'd honestly give 5 stars. These could be worn with virtually anything...casual to fancy, so the versatility is great!"
4.0,Might be a good product if you have narrower feet.  They don't even come close to fitting my Sasquatch feet though.  They do look like nice quality moccasins though.
4.0,nice earrings!
4.0,It's very cute and very well made. But it's very big. Definitely size down.
4.0,very pretty. just scratchy at arms
4.0,I bought this to keep me warm while snorkeling in the Florida Springs.  The water was 72 degrees.  I wish I had bought a full body suit. The 2 mm is perfect for that temperature but when you swim the jacket gapes which allows fresh water in so it doesn’t work as a wet suit should.<br />Fit was as expected. It looks nice and is well made.  Just didn’t do what I needed.
4.0,Cute necklace. I bought it for my niece and she loves it. Already had another niece request that I get her one too
4.0,My husband is very happy with these cargo shorts. The lightweight material is perfect for FL summers (and just about year around).
4.0,"Aviator type sunglasses have been around for a long time, and have gone in and out of style more than a few times.  If this is a look you like, these sunglasses from Cool Shop may be of interest, as their version features large sized lenses which are shaped in a classic aviator style, but with tighter inner corners.  Build quality appears to be good, and they lenses provide comprehensive coverage of the eye, but if you have a smaller face, these glasses may look a little oversized.<br /><br />These Aviators are available in a variety of shades and colored mirrored finishes.  The polarized plastic lenses, and thin metal frame results in an extremely lightweight product.  Nose pads are typical for Aviators, and they help to provide a better fit.<br /><br />A sample was provided to me for evaluation.  While they are a little too large for my face, these glasses would be perfectly fine for some."
4.0,I love these but I can imagine these might hurt just a tad after a couple of hours.  They run a wee bit small but not too small.
4.0,This jumpsuit was super cute. My only complaint was the beck part should be more streachy. I kept having to pull at my neck because it was tight. Also was able to use my vibrant makeup on my face to go w costume.
4.0,"Great, comfy bra. For some reason, this one is a bit trickier than a previous one I bought. I'm just accepting that bc it's an excellent value."
4.0,"I love these rings I'm glad I ordered despite all the negative reviews. I bought midi rings much more expensive and they weren't midi, weren't adjustable, and we're thin and fragile. These I will need to put nail polish so it doesn't turn colors but they are great! Strong durable pretty and actually midi. I have it four stars instead of 5 because of the ring with the words. I can't read the words and they are smushed and I won't use that ring."
4.0,"Cool but just a tad smaller than I expected, especially the arm holes."
4.0,"I updated the review because this strap grew on me - I wear this on my Glycine f104, and l love it! I originally didn’t expect the butter soft leather so it felt different than some of the thicker waxed bands I had purchased. I do still maintain I received a previous return- to be fair, I think that was Amazon’s fault. — The band was sloppy and not worth the money paid. I could make this better at home with my kids leather kit. If you are looking for an overpriced haggard looking band this is a good choice. To be fair, w think they shipped me one that had bruised and then returned."
4.0,"A little smaller than expected. I wouldn’t wear it zipped. But, unzipped looks good.<br />Every time I drive the zipper catches on the sleeve weird. But not enough to ruin the jacket, at least not yet."
4.0,"Thicker material, better for the winter months."
4.0,"My only issue with the dress was the neckline. It was way too low and non-supportive. I had to sew in a couple stitches to keep it closed. Other than that I love this dress! The material is so soft and flowy. I received several complements on it! I am 5'4"" 180# 38D chest and ordered a large."
4.0,"This watch band works as advertised with the Fenix 6X. The material doesn't feel as nice as the one it came with, but ya get what you pay for... The quick attachment to the watch works, but takes a little finnicking to lock in place. For the price, I'm happy with it."
4.0,Comfortable and decent optical quality
4.0,"These get a little itchy, but are very cute! Only giving 4 stars because one ball is fixed to the bar, so I can't clean them as well as I'd like or change bars (the bars are a little long for me)."
4.0,Love these assorted pearl cages. My customers like having so many different cages to choose from.
4.0,like the way it fits.  no problems
4.0,Fits tight. would have liked it a little larger. Is cute for a little girl.
4.0,Great fit.  The material is thicker than I expected which is nice.
4.0,They work ok
4.0,I would give 4.5 if possible - my ONLY &#34;complaint&#34; is that the feet are way too long for me. My calf measures 20&#34; (I was always athletic) and ALL makers seem to assume that if one has a calf that measure that much that one must also have size 10 feet. Otherwise they are made well and comfortable - on the thicker side. I have washed them on the delicate cycle in a lingerie bag and line dried and they turned out great and kept their shap.
4.0,I am pretty happy with the sweatshirt for the most part. I wasn’t thrilled with the end of the sleeves. It’s a little too loose at the wrists and they hit a bit too short. I just fold them up once and it looks fine. Very soft though and I like the pockets!
4.0,FIts great in the arms but much longer/ baggier than I expected. I’m pregnant though so at least it will fit though my whole pregnancy and not be restricting and I like the material.
4.0,"Nice fit, good fabric. I ordered one in another color after receiving this one."
4.0,Fell off when hit with a hard wave. Great pattern though and plan on ordering another.
4.0,"Most importantly, these socks a SUPER comfortable, and I am looking forward to seeing how they perform for actual hiking---but I have no concerns. The bottoms of your feet will feet nice and cushy, as that is where these socks are thickest. They are thinner around the tops of your feet---particularly the ankle area. As these are 100% wool, I think that is probably by design so you're less likely to overheat your feet and it's lighter on the material for the most-flexed area.<br /><br />That said, because of the weave and the stretch there, I am a little concerned about how well they will hold up in these thinner areas. (You can see your skin a little between the stitching). It's obvious this is by design, as there are definitive lines to how different areas of the socks are stitched.<br /><br />So, basically, just be careful when putting them on to keep this area from getting stretched out. Don't do a lot of hard tugging at the top of the socks and you should be fine. It isn't a high-wear area, so it isn't likely to wear out so much as get pulled out.<br /><br />Overall, I find the socks to be well and thoughtfully made. Cozy and warm enough where it matters, but also nicely breathable and not stifling. Made for activity, not for just sitting around the house. Will definitely be part of my regular rotation."
4.0,Gift my son is happy with the hoodie
4.0,"Overall not a bad duffel bag, it deserves more of a 3.5 star, but generously I give it a 4 since it does its job. It’s spacious and has many of the features that a more expensive, brand name bag would have like the multiple zipped pockets, “vented” side pocket, and a shoe compartment. I say “vented” because the vents are just 2 holes which do the job but are aesthetically lame. The construction is laughable though. If you were using this bag for anything more than the occasional gym, or pretty much anything that’s more than just placing (i.e. no sliding, bumping etc.), it would rip. The material is very thin and feels overall cheap and $20 is pushing its value. If you’re looking for an under $30 bag, then this bag will do you just fine, but if you’re a person like me who uses a duffel bag daily for gym, carrying things on a motorcycle, etc. just spend an extra $15 - $20 and get a duffel with better material."
4.0,"Great shirt, fits loose"
4.0,"I bought this solely for the adapter to connect a linked watch band I had to my Apple Watch. Serves the purpose, but the pin came out once on its own."
4.0,"This is absolutely beautiful and fun but was too small on my 9 year old daughter, even the 12-14! Will have to return, but will just get larger size!"
4.0,"Cute but not much compresssion. Size down, fits a little baggy."
4.0,"A little tight, but nice."
4.0,"I'm 5ft 128lbs and ordered a small. Fits good, but the dress is a bit plain. Plan to add a wide belt to it."
4.0,I like the idea of the grommets on nato strap.  However the grommets might be too thick to pass thru the spring bar and watch.  I ended up taking the spring bars off to change straps.
4.0,"I love these bras.  They aren't super supportive in the sense of a max support sports bra, and are more like a shelf bra that's way cuter.  Super comfy, fit great, and I love if I have a low cut back on a shirt and you can see the straps crossing.  My only complaint is the padding has really nice satin-type lining on both sides.  First, the padding cups NEVER stay through the wash, and I have to constant put them back in or adjust them when doing laundry.  BUT, the liner came off the padding practically in the first wash for every single pair, and now it's just the foam.  Would be fine except the foam is VERY difficult to slide back into place.  I still manage it, but wish that was a bit more stable.  I figure I'm going to buy another set of these soon, and before I wear them/wash them, I'm going to put some quick stitches all the way around each padded cup to help the liner hold on.  Hoping that helps.  Otherwise, I love these bras and want them in every color imaginable."
4.0,"They were a gift, but i was told she loved them!"
4.0,Very sturdy bags. Big size and easy to carry
4.0,"Excelente, justo lo que necesitaba para un regalo.!!"
4.0,"The shirt is made of light, thin material and is cut a bit small.  It's best to go up a size if you are unsure.  The shirt is a dark denim color although the material is thinner than denim."
4.0,"I wore the outfit today for a workout and it stayed up the entire time, I didn’t have to adjust it much. The leggings themselves were a little tight though, the cuts on the leg parts left indents on my thighs and calves. Not too bad though"
4.0,"So cute...but am afraid to actually put him on my keys as I'm concerned he'll end up falling off his screw-in head-hook somewhere.  He does, however, look great hanging from my rear view mirror!"
4.0,"My build is 5'7&quot; @ 185# size 14-16 or XL. I wanted a comfortable for so I ordered 2XL.  It is loose, but not too big. The smocking feels good under corset, looks great without also. Shoulder elastic stays in place, for off-shoulder wear, without cutting-in. Fabric is soft, light weight, flowing, &amp; opaque. Love the rusty wine color."
4.0,I like the length and fitted style of this.
4.0,"Cheap and fine - bought for my MS walk, will wear again- nothing fancy. But who wants fancy $200 sunglasses when you lose them every 2 weeks?"
4.0,My son loves these and they fit as expected. The only downside to them so far is the little black gripper dots on the bottom started coming off with in just a few days of wearing them.
4.0,Very good quality charms. One didn't have a hole in the packs I opened so far.
4.0,Love it just a little bit big and heavy...other than that I love it
4.0,"arrived on time- love the color! Not sure how much paper money will fit in ,because it will need to be folded."
4.0,"I wear an 8M in almost every shoe, this 8M has a very comfortable fit."
4.0,Es bien bien me gusta
4.0,this was the second pair I got for my brother as a Christmas gift. He loves them.
4.0,So adorable! My son 15 months and wears a size 5/6 in shoes and they fit perfect! He can probably wear them for another two months or so but I’ll definitely be ordering some in a bigger size and definitely recommend. It does have that grip so he does walk really well on our hardwood floor and the length of the socks is tight enough that it doesn’t slip off
4.0,the boy likes it lot.
4.0,"My daughter loves these shoes. They are comfortable, easy to clean, and sturdy. The only downfall is that the charms that came with it don't stay in the holes well so she has already lost them. Doesn't affect the shoe itself though, so we can live with that."
4.0,Runs a few mm small.
4.0,"love this, the color is just great!!!"
4.0,"Very nice, comfortable for wearing, and good for use in meditation. Some of the beads had small pieces sticking off of them from where the hole was drilled through and it had a plastic-like smell, but it is a very good product."
4.0,"I adore the fabric of the skirt and also like that it’s cotton. Added a little structure to it. I could tell as soon as I unfolded it though that the top part was going to be way too wide for me. Which, is NOT a problem I usually have. I actually ordered a size up based on other reviews (because I’m real busty). I think part of the problem is that I’m short waisted- the straps are way way way too long for me. But... with a little sewing I think I can make it work for me."
4.0,"It was a little small, but it fits ok. I wear it as a all around weather jacket till it gets cold out.<br />Good for rain and when windy out it breaks the wind."
4.0,These are great except they pinch my head and ears.
4.0,"This is a beautiful mens watch. But is on the cheapy side, the bands is a little flimsy. Wish I was a different band the timepiece is just as the photos depicts. Happy anyways."
4.0,"EDIT: Definitely scratches easy, 4 months in and the writing is illegible.<br /><br />Seems to be of decent quality. Rotates well which is partly why I bought it. The color is nice, may scratch easily though."
4.0,Okay for work.  Ran a little large. Good price. Good quality
4.0,Great! Very nice! My husband loves bow ties!
4.0,Bought 4 pair for Christmas presents only received 3 as of my review. Other pair is to be delivered tomorrow. Look like they are good quality products.
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my niece and sent it directly to her.  She really liked it. I have not seen it.
4.0,Unique and chic dress!!
4.0,"The ""posts"" are a little thick, so it was difficult to put them on. They're a little heavier than I expected, but not too bad. They're very sophisticated looking, so it's nice to have the option of something a little different."
4.0,Dress is made from a very stretchy fabric but the bow thing was very poorly made.
4.0,Super cute and well made. Haven't tried it on yet.
4.0,"Bigger than expected, if I hadn't already purchased them one size bigger, I would have been okay with the bigger size but they were really big on my kids, they looked a bit ridiculous. But the quality is good and the boys feet will eventually grow into them."
4.0,It's on the tighter side and because of that the fabric is a little see through in the back.. but I'm planning on wearing white under it so it's not a big deal. I LOVE it. So cute!
4.0,Just received. To early to review but seems like a nice product
4.0,"Tighter fit than would have liked, size ran small.  Good quality."
4.0,i love love love the shirt but it’s hard to tell what’s the front or back of the shorts bc there is not a tag or anything
4.0,Bought as a gift. I got it large because everyone buys for a new born. I got it for cooler weather. Only reason I didn't go for 5 stars is I couldn't choose the color. Mommy to be liked the onesie.
4.0,great for going out dancing
4.0,I use it for wearing around the house.  It's a little tight
4.0,The ring came in suprisingly early. I am a massive fan of the Mortal Instruments and this ring is perfect for those of us who want to carry around a little piece from the series. The ring is sturdy and the chain is quite long. The only problem being the ring itself if a bit too big. It doesn't fit any of my fingers but that's okay :) It is Jace's ring. It was meant to fit him :)
4.0,Beautiful shoes!! I get so many compliments on these boots and it fits wonderfully ❤️😍💯 c'est tellement jolie et facile à marché 👌🏽
4.0,"I really like this dress! I'm 5 8 though so I wish it were longer but, it'll be great to wear with flats! I'm usually a medium and ordered a small and if fit perfectly. Definitely recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do. Great quality!"
4.0,great for the price. i really like the vintage look. i'm looking forward to wearing it out. it's nice and light.
4.0,I love these earrings and necklace. Very nice for the price.
4.0,"The dial face is quite nice to look at.  Not busy or full of complications.  Automatic wind is not noticeable by either sound or feel.  Bracelet is the only weak spot on this watch. Stamped securing latch has these nasty pins sticking out both ends which serve as hinges to flip the latch back. Once back, you can then open the dual clasps and remove the watch.  Note: when adjusting the band, those are small screws and not push-out pins... despite the free push-out pin removal tool in the box with the watch.  The threads are on the upper part of the screw right beneath the slot for your tiny screwdriver.<br />Cheers..."
4.0,Muy buen producto así como se ve en la foto a si mismo me llego me encanto
4.0,Works great but overpriced
4.0,Very cute. Nice fit for my grand daughter's first phone.
4.0,"I would have preferred a buckle to the snaps that this has, but that's my only complaint. Only 3 sizes, so if you have a bigger neck this won't fit. I wear it on the medium size, and I'm a pretty small person. Other than that, this is super cute and a decent price."
4.0,Worked great for what I needed it for. Good for the price. Fell apart within a couple months.
4.0,Love the purse but the strap is too short to wear over the shoulder.
4.0,The price of this item is what caught my eye. The number of pieces for price was Amazing! The luggage is lite weight and was perfect for my last minute trip.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, but runs very small.  I like the material and was sorry I could not wear it.  I sent it to my Niece in Pa."
4.0,"Looks good, very comfy"
4.0,The shirt is good material and design is awesome. I personally love it and will be using on our trip to Disney.
4.0,"Thicker thighs, was worried it would be too tight. Size wise, it does fit perfectly. Fabric wise, wish it wasn’t as stiff of a material. There is enough room for my legs but there is not much give when sitting/moving around and such."
4.0,Pleased with my purchase so far! Will update if I notice any flaws. Hopefully the scratches shown in other reviewer’s photos won’t show as bad on the black band.
4.0,"Lots of pockets. I only wish the zippers were more strong and sturdy. Be very gentle with the zippers. Still, also has pockets which open and close by way of a plastic clip. I saw no metal exposed, so low risk to scratch your car. Not just for camera pro's, I use mine for regular outings, as i like to have a man purse which is more masculine looking. Cannot say enough about having lots of pockets. Has a sloot to hold a pen on the outside, so I bought a camo pen marker, so as n ot to lkeak ink on it, I do not like pens which are push button cause they tend to leak. This bag is very cool, that means ""nice"". Regarding the water bottle pocket. As with all water bottle mesh net pockets, be gentle and never put keys in it, as it might tear. I think I can fit a tiny umbrella in the pocket, but I prefer to hide my tiny unbrella, bought separately, in an inside poocket. No regrets. P.S., nothing about it says or reads German or any other country for that matter. It is just a neat bag."
4.0,Great range of sizes.
4.0,"Very cute summer dress, very comfortable, the fabric is not flimsy or clingy.  However, I have a shorted neck and look better in a v-neck.  Thought I would try this to see but it made my neck look short so I sent it back.  Can't change the length of my neck but if they had a v-neck version of this dress I would buy it in a heartbeat."
4.0,Very comfortable for wearing under long dresses.
4.0,A little large in the legs but the waist fits and they are very comfy.  Love the hidden pocket (that's the main reason I ordered these).
4.0,"It is huge, but does what it's supposed to do."
4.0,"Such a fun, flowy dress! Pleasantly surprised...<br />It’s perfect to throw on over a bathing suit - it’s cute for a dress, too, but the deep V neckline is formed by criss crossing the 2 sides & tying on the side, so it flops open easily. The fabric is pretty thin, so pinning may pull & rip it.<br />I’m 5’8”, 140 lbs, 36B & the length hits the top of my foot. Anyone shorter will have it dragging. The description says black & white, but mine is dark blue & white."
4.0,Nice earrings although are very blingy.  If you like that type these will do the job. One is  shorter than the other which is very much in style these days. Attractive to say the least.
4.0,"This mask is NOT adjustable. It’s just an elastic band sewed on each side of the mask. I got it for my 10 year old and the mask is slightly big. For the price, I will just simply sew the elastic band to make it smaller. Overall the mask is good for a costume. I had to stuff it with a towel as it comes folded in half and the crease makes the mask fit strangely, so hopefully filling it with something for the next few weeks will take the crease out."
4.0,Purchased jacket for skiing. Keeping me warm in sub-zero temps and not tight for moving around.<br />Great value.
4.0,I  have a to add safety pins to hold some part of the tunic
4.0,"Fits really fine, found where the thread pulled a bit on the front, not very noticeable, but I still love it overall."
4.0,"This was Super cute.  I had to return it, because it was a little big for my 10 month old.  The refund was handled well, considering it was outside the US."
4.0,Box came a little crushed but did not damage the lense at all. Was a little hard putting it into the frame compared to the original Oakley lense but when it finally went it the fitment was great. Would but again.
4.0,Love the look of this purse but it was way to small for me
4.0,"Good, standard weight fabric appropriate for dance classes. No visible flaws and fits as shown."
4.0,order two sizes above what you usually wear . or lose weight in a hurry haha :)
4.0,This is a really nice bracelet and necklace set! It's exactly as pictured. Both the bracelet and necklace chain are very nice quality for it being stainless steel. I had gotten this as a present for my boyfriend and he loves it! It looks more expensive and pretty close to real silver. He wanted another chain cause he loves wearing chains but didn't want to loose his real silver one so this one is great for when he's at work. It has not turned his skin green at all or rusted or tarnished and he even wears it when he showers. Both chains are very sturdy. I really liked how the clasp is also in the shape of the links so it lays really nicely with the rest of the chain. This is a great set to buy for a gift or yourself.<br /><br />I did recieve this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own.
4.0,post was bent when opened
4.0,"Great material, it's not that thin paper like material and is soft. Runs a little larger."
4.0,Was nervous about the suit being too small but fit fine. Bought a medium 5'1&#34; 125. Pear shape. Suit was a little roomier in the chest but fit everywhere else comfortably.
4.0,"Super cute laces, they were slightly shorter than I expected and a little bit hard to tie, but they look amazing in my shoes for after my wedding ceremony."
4.0,"They are a lot thicker than I like, personally. Not heavy glasses, if fact, very light weight. Other than that, for the money, good."
4.0,I wish this fit because the color (purple) was really saturated and pretty. Fabric had a good stretch too it. Buttons were not sewed on well but for the price had it of fit I would have just resewn them myself. worth a try
4.0,Strap is a little flimsy<br /> Easy to twist when inserting foot.
4.0,"This is a well made and pretty lab created opal statement ring, I requested a size 6, and it is pretty accurate on size, I used my world sizing and it was 6/16.5 and fits my ring finger perfectly.  This does have 4 high prongs that might snag on sweaters and jeans when you dig into your pockets, so take that into consideration when buying this.  The opal is lab created and it is pretty, but you have to hit the light just right to get that fire to show.  The cz's seem to be well set and none are missing.  The ring itself does have the S925 clearly stamped in the inside rim.  There are no uncomfortable spots and the ring is well made.  This is very giftable, and comes with a gift box.  I love this brand and have several items from them.  They have good customer service and warranties on their jewelry.  For the price, you can't really go wrong, unless you order the wrong size.  If you are just glancing at this ring, you won't see much fire, unless you have really good eyesight, and it kinda reminds me of moonstone from a glance.  For that reason, dropping 1 star."
4.0,The fit is very comfortable. I love the edgy look of it. &#34;It's different&#34; I love it.
4.0,The colors are not exactly like the picture online but they fit my watch perfectly and I really like the way they close.
4.0,Fits snug -  but so great if you are cold or just need that extra layer with a T-shirt over too
4.0,Very cute and soft and perfect for cold weather
4.0,"This shoe only offered full sizes. A 10 1/2 would have been a better fit than 11. That said, I wear them comfortably every day."
4.0,The size is too big the color is washed out they are sitting in my bathroom in the corner not being used
4.0,"Great, cheap workout shirts"
4.0,"It's a really cute shirt, it gets very wrinklely so you'll have to do a quick iron, otherwise the wrinkles will show a LOT. Otherwise cute and comfortable."
4.0,Cheap material but it was an incredibly inexpensive dress so I wasn't expecting more. Will probably hand wash to get more mileage. I am 5'7 and about 150 and the medium fit perfectly. Great color (someone at work complimented the color) and I just feel pretty in it.
4.0,"A little shiny, but great quality and length for the price."
4.0,"I must say I was surprised by the quality of the lens in this loupe. For the price, it is a  great value. Unfortunately, it is not 30 power. I would guess somewhere between 10 and 20 power.<br />The one shortcoming, considering the type of loupe; the outer edge is not black. That would have made this loupe perfect.<br />It doesn't suffer color distortion and the magnification remains constant across the entire surface.<br />The best quick test for a loupe is to look at the squares on a sheet of black graph paper. The lines should appear completely straight and there should be no blue haze outline on a good quality lens."
4.0,so soft. Love the feel of the leggings but as far as &#34;plus&#34; size goes these are a tighter fit than some XL leggins I already own
4.0,"Sexy dress. Shorter than I thought. Ordered in purple, which was brighter than the picture. Very pretty but ended up returning it."
4.0,The skirt was better quality than I expected. I can't wait to wear it...
4.0,"Like the material, very breathable and fits perfectly"
4.0,"Nice hat, but the ribbons are not 100% accurate with regards to spacing.  Comfortable, and fits well."
4.0,"I was hoping to use this bag for work, but the corduroy fabric attracts fuzz, hair, and dust, so it doesn’t look very professional. It is also not as big as I thought it would be. I still enjoy using it, but for casually purposes."
4.0,"Fits as expected, feels like good quality and washed well."
4.0,"this was okay, would not buy again. i dont think i will wear it again (just a personal preference)"
4.0,"The actual lanyard is a lot thicker than what is shown in the pictures. However, the design is phenomenal and quite unique. I still use it daily but it is a lot bigger than what I had expected."
4.0,These are fine for the price but offer very little support (I am a C cup) and I wouldn’t wear it out of the house much less to work out. Works well for lounging around at home.
4.0,"Nice fabric, very comfy"
4.0,"Haven't had a chance to swim in it yet, but it fits well and looks very nice.  I was pleasantly surprised because I didn't think a suit this inexpensive would be this nice."
4.0,"This band is a good band.  I have two issues which is why I gave it 4 stars.  1st. The color is not brown.  It is more orange.  2nd the band is really stiff and made it hard for me to adjust to the first hole.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend it."
4.0,The fit is really really small so order a size up.  Once you get the fit right it looks really good.  Used it in a music video shoot over top of a long flowing dress.
4.0,"These are dandy! Just as advertised, arrived quickly, satisfied customer."
4.0,"They are made of fleece, they at very warm"
4.0,"5'0 100lbs.<br /><br />This is a really nice dress at a great price. The fit was great except the length was just below the knee. For those XS ladies looking for a nice dress, you can use the size above for reference. We're going to have it taken in just a little so it rests about an inch above the knees."
4.0,"I ordered this brand but I received a Zenana brand. I should be happy as the Zenana is more expensive. However, I am familiar with that brand and I know it fades easily and the buttonholes get really loose really quickly. Still satisfied. I ordered the medium as it was said that these run small, and the medium fit as I wanted my cardi to fit so I guess a small would have been too small."
4.0,"Very pretty & shiny. Smaller than expected, but works very nicely in my 2nd pierced hole without interfering with first hole.  No problem with sensitivity."
4.0,"So far, so good. They havent broken.  I have metal allergies  so these work well. The posts seem a tiny bit smaller than metal earrings.  I will purchase more plastic earrings in the future."
4.0,Obviously fake. But good quality for a while.
4.0,earring are beautiful BUT they are very heavy and put marks on your ears.
4.0,"It is a cute bracelet, but I thought it had 5 individual pieces to group as wanted. The piece is all attached as one unit so not as flexible as I anticipated."
4.0,"I ordered this item for myself and another more expensive hoodie for my husband for this Halloween to keep us warm while handing out candy.  I will say that while the material is clearly not super expensive and a bit thin, it is a good value for the money.  In the photo, you can see that the images are kind if an iron-on deal, but the photo shows that it is still in pretty good shape after being washed once on cold and going through the dryer on the low setting.  If you wanted a really thick sweatshirt material, then this isn't likely to be what you are looking for, but I am planning on layering it with something else, so it should be just fine for my purposes.  Funnily enough, the other sweatshirt I bought was just about as thin as this one and it cost nearly twice this much.  This was clearly the better deal and it even arrived first.  While it doesn't seem like super expensive and thick material, it seems well put together from what I can tell.  I now feel ready for Halloween."
4.0,"The dress material is good but although it says semi stitched, most of the stitching needs to be done. Attached is a picture. Top needs armhole and neck to be stitched. Bottom lining is just a material and needs to be stitched also."
4.0,"I love the look of this band; very simple yet elegant and brand name to boot!  However, I did find that it was a bit uncomfortable when I put it on because the leather was stiff.  I hope after some wear, it will be a lot more soft and and pliable.  The bands slip onto the watch face pretty easily and fits well.  The buckle part isn’t as sturdy as I hoped.  I did find that the piece that goes through the sizing holes is very loose and comes out as I’m putting the watch on.  It took a couple of tries to get it to stay so I can have it in the right hole for the size I want.  Overall, it’s an ok purchase but I don’t know if it’s worth the price."
4.0,A little big for me...but it is good though.
4.0,"These are amazing.  Look fantastic.  The only problem is THEY ARE NOT BLACK.  I have ordered a second pair and both were a deep midnight blue, but noticeably NOT BLACK when held up to my other black cufflinks or black dinner jacket.  I am keeping them however for my midnight blue dinner jacket, as they are very nice."
4.0,"For the price, it's not a bad hat.  It's definitely wearable. It did arrive folded into a plastic mailer bag, but it popped immediately into shape with no creases.  In fact, I wore it that evening. The tag says that it is wool, but I would have guessed a heavy felt.  The material is a bit shinier than I'd like, and the edge of the brim is just cut without being stitched, but you get what you pay for.  It is maybe slightly larger than the average floppy hat that I've bought at  stores like Target, but just a shade larger.  It doesn't have a noticeable effect, and it certainly didn't blow off my head or anything like that. It holds its shape well and the brim doesn't sag annoyingly like with some floppy hats. The minor downsides aren't dealbreakers.  I will wear the hat, for sure. It may only last a season, but if it does, it will still have been a good deal."
4.0,I couldn’t even get it on .. buy a size up<br />Top is small
4.0,Was a birthday gift love these pjs
4.0,"Four stars for quality construction at its price point. I love the fabric's stretch. Four stars because overall it fit really well in the bodice.  However , I am 5'2&#34; and it's too long and skirts that hit at the calf make me look even shorter, yes even in heels. The belt is loosey goosey and slip-slides around too. I would have had to hem it about two inches and take in the cap sleeves a bit because they look like bird wings.<br /><br />But golly it's an adorable dress and if you can pull it off like the lovely ladies in the photos, go for it. I am sad I have to return it. I just looked silly in it."
4.0,Came quickly cute bee motif resembles one of Gucci
4.0,"Really nice jacket. Looked like the image. I wear a size 8, ordered the XXL and the shoulders are too tight. It zipped and fit comfortably through the bodice. Hesitated keeping but will return"
4.0,"Pretty thin, see-through, and runs small. Yet despite all that, it is gorgeous and comfortable. It was a hit at Pride!"
4.0,Decent material. Good length. Stays below knee length.Bought medium I'm 5'4&#34;
4.0,I really liked the look of this dress. But it was too big even after sizing down one size from what I wear usually.  Returning to get a smaller size.
4.0,Its ok for cycling- the colours are a bit too bright
4.0,"Don’t know how they’ll hold up, due to the price. But they are super cute and comfortable and the major bonus is the aviator style without the nose pieces that get stuck in your hair!!"
4.0,I bought this for my mom and she looks adorable in it.  Know that the bottom does not have a slit so you cannot take big strides in this.  My mom is 5'6&#34; and 120 pounds.  The small was a great size for her.
4.0,These are great glasses for anyone who uses a computer. and well worth the price..
4.0,"Cute but shorter than it appears. It's almost like a crop top. It pairs well with a tank top underneath, but still not what is pictured."
4.0,Cute but larger and heavier than expected
4.0,"Ordered a size 8, but it was too large for a two year old with foot size 5.5inches. Should have ordered a 7."
4.0,Very nice durable ring people are shocked when I tell them how much it was because its so nice.  Prongs do get loose though.
4.0,"very cute, well worth it"
4.0,These  wedges are so cut on and fit so nice . they will look great with all my slacks and jeans. Nuteral color so will go with anything.
4.0,"I really liked this hoodie, the material is very nice and it was true to size regarding usual measurements, however, I'm 5.4"" and the length was way too long, well past my knees.  In addition, the draw string waist was at my hips.  Sadly, it will have to be returned."
4.0,The cap n gown were exactly what I expected but the tassel says 2018 instead of 2020...now I have to find something b4 friday
4.0,"My daughter thought this dress was absolutely amazing and beautiful, but decided it was just too fancy to wear to prom. It’s wonderfully fluffy with loads of rhinestones, and a train trailing behind it. The grey color was gorgeous! The bodice is completely see through on the parts not covered by beadwork or breast pads. It seemed well made, and really was pretty, so if you need a fancy princess dress, I’d say give it a try, but it was a bit much for a high school prom. My daughter normally wears a size 4, but based on the size chart, we ordered an 8, and it fit well. We ordered on Prime, and it came in two days with free returns, which I always appreciate."
4.0,Bought as a gift. Seemed to be nice quality.
4.0,"Years ago I bought a pair of leather gloves with thinsulate from a big-box variety store. I bought them in extra-large, and even so the fingers and the wrist length were a tad too short. But they were pretty warm, and lasted well. However now the store no longer has them, at least here in Tennessee, so I bought these.<br /><br />I ordered extra-large again, and to my surprise the fingers on these are actually long enough for my fingers. They also come up the wrist more, although still not as much as I would like. These do not use thinsulate, but are advertised as ""Multilayer Microfiber Insulation Lining."" This is shown on the label inside the glove as ""50% polyproylene (sic), 50% nylon."" (I believe that should be ""polypropylene."") It is actually warmer than the thinsulate in the old gloves, but I don't think it will last as long.<br /><br />The wrists have snaps to close them tighter, something my old gloves did not have. I found that I could close one snap with the gloves on, but not the other. Not a problem; I close the tougher one with an unfettered hand, then put on and snap the other. The snaps are plastic. They are attached to the leather with large retainer buttons, and so should not pull out of the material too easily.<br /><br />The nit: Inside the tips of two of the fingers is something (it feels like perhaps a protruding end of stiff plastic thread) that pokes my finger tips if I pull the gloves tight on my hands. Most of the time this is not really a problem, since, as I said, the fingers are plenty long enough.<br /><br />One caveat: the fingers on these gloves are pretty tight on my fingers, and I have fairly slim fingers (10-1/2 ring size)."
4.0,I like this suit but there are issues. The top is very stiff causing the cups to not lay flat when you move your body. I can deal with that though. The bottom is high enough to cover my stretch marks! The issue is the band at the very top gets loose with wear and I feel like I’m pulling it up often. If there was a little more spandex in that area it would be amazing.
4.0,Dislike the looseness across chest
4.0,Was uneven out of the package.  Ripped a stitch and got it adjusted correctly.  My wife looks fantastic in it.
4.0,This frame works well for intended purpose. The clasp feels a little flimsy but it hasn't fallen off my child's backpack yet.
4.0,It looks nice for the price.It was a gift for my nephew.
4.0,Bought this for my 2 year old nephew. Loved how breathable and stretchy the material is. Great quality and very soft. Perfect to wear during this hot weather. The character is clear. Only bad thing is the shirt seems to run small and I ordered a size 4T. Pants look like they will fit him maybe a bit big but the shirt looks to fit just right. Hoping it won't shrink once it's washed.
4.0,"Was skeptical with all the bad reviews but purchased anyways, I'm 120lbs, 26 in waist with a lot of butt and hips I normally still wear a small, but I ordered the medium and it fits well, might of been more comfortable in a large but a larger size was not available. The v in the front dips down into the pubic area, fine for me but not for someone that doesn't stay shaved there. I didn't have a camel toe problem like most other reviews, I think if you were to pull them up to cover the pubic area a camel toe would probably be a problem."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Belt doesn’t have belt loops though which is the only reason I gave 4 stars and it’s very LONg in front and back. I’m 5’5 weight: 115 slim build.. planning on wearing this to a wedding but might get it hemmed. The material is not see through at all, can wear any bra with it, dress up or down.. i just Really wish the belt was attached to the dress. I ordered The 4 i believe (Small) which was the smallest option but i could Def. been more pleased with XS but that’s also not an option on this seller. Overall though it’s nice material, happy with my purchase."
4.0,Sleeves are a little on the long side but overall I like it!
4.0,I like it for golf and tennis. fits as expected and is a good deal for the money
4.0,"I wear a 40C bra and ordered these to wear over my regular bra to hide ugly straps under sheer blouses and shirts.  I tried these on by themselves, without a bra just to see how they fit. The bra is extremely comfortable with soft fabric and non-irritating elastic. They are easy to slip over my head and the fit is just right even without my regular bra underneath. The only thing that I did not care for is that the foam pads inserted into the pocket are not the right size for my breasts and gave them a funny shape. This pad was more like a modesty covering to prevent high-beams and perhaps would work for someone with an A cup. I removed the pads and it looked much better. However, I recently purchased these  bra pad inserts [[ASIN:B07DXKCXD9 Bra Pad Inserts 4 Pairs,Sermicle Bra Pads Sewn Massaged for Sports Bra A/B or C/D Cup Beige or Black Optional (C/D Cup, Beige)]] to go into a bathing suit and I thought maybe they would work well in this bra.  The pocket holds these inserts perfectly and it is a much better look if I should decide to wear these alone. I have not washed these yet but I'll update my review if something happens when I do!  So 4 stars for the fit, fabric, construction and over all look.  I would have given it 5 stars if the design of the pad were a little more appropriate for the band sized ordered since women with larger busts will not want to buy another pad to insert into the bra if they are wearing it alone and want to prevent high-beams showing through their clothes."
4.0,It’s ok. A little baggy looking.
4.0,not very comfortable but maybe during longer wearing will be OK
4.0,It is cheap so it has poor workmanship. But it is still worth trying it and only use once
4.0,I love this garment
4.0,It's cute  and definetly holds my boobs down. The material isn't the greatest though I wouldn't wear it for more then a couple hours.
4.0,"A little tighter than I expected, but they will stretch out.  Great price for luxurious dress gloves."
4.0,I believe this product would work better for lesser weighted figures. I’m 230 lbs and was hoping to cut down the stomach fat showing. It works decently but when you sit down the little wire supports hurts my sides and ribs so it’s only useful for when I’m standing or it hurts.<br /><br />The fabric is super comfortable though!
4.0,"I had previously bought a similar hat that was one size fits all, but it was too small for my head and gave me a headache. I bought the large version of this one and it fits great.  It packs well and is very light weight.  I love that it has a place for a ponytail to stick out but that space is unnoticeable if you aren't using it that way.  Unfortunately I lost the strap (it can be taken off) so I have a hard time in windy conditions now.  I recommend."
4.0,"Loved these, but they did fog up. They came with anti-fog wipes, I used one and it didnt' help. I also may have not applied it properly.<br />Overall these are great, not expensive, creepy and fun !!"
4.0,"FORLIM Forced Air Boot Dryer, Portable Electric Shoe Dryer With Heat Blower, Boot Warmer, 180° Adjustable Dry Rack, Telescopic Bendable Dry Ports, Intelligent Timer, White i got this just in time for the rainy season but also got to enjoy the end of the summer with this item. I use water shoes for the lake, camping, pool, etc and this was very helpful with easily drying my shoes in between uses. I'm not a fan of corded electronics but its worth it as you don't use it all the time and no need to move it around.  4 out of 5 stars. I recommend this product."
4.0,"Perfect for the price , gonna get it in gold too."
4.0,It was bigger than I expected and has a lot of sections for stuff but overall it's  ok. And the graphics are really nice and detailed
4.0,Great gloves for a service plumber
4.0,Very unique and good fit
4.0,Bought this for my granddaughter last Christmas. So pretty but a little hard to open. Let's see how it holds up
4.0,Cute little bracelet. Bright colored stones and quality made. My daughter loved it. Adjusts and fits nicely.
4.0,Great value for decent product.
4.0,"Only the bigger two rings are really worth wearing. It's cute. Others I just threw out. They were like about midi-ring size but too bulky to actually be able to wear as a midi without killing your other fingers. Can't speak to quality yet as I have only worn the ring a few times, but I like them so far. I wear it with casual boho look. Good for the price, but you only get two rings out of the deal."
4.0,"This shirt is awesome, but the lines totally accentuate my nipples. It runs a tad small, although no clothing is the same size anymore. I'm about 5'4&#34; and weight around 150lbs and I got an extra large, and I felt that it wasn't baggy enough but after wearing it in it worked great. I got it because I'm a waitress at a mexican restaurant and I thought it'd be perfect. Everyone loved it. It's very comfy and light. (I don't know why the photos are sideways but I'm too tired to fix it right now.)"
4.0,"Super comfortable, but heads up, they run a bit large, and they're definitely black, not the greyish color in the photo."
4.0,Zipper keeps getting stuck.
4.0,Material is soft and the type that avoids pilling. Fits a little on the large side. Note this is not a thong bodysuit.
4.0,"Well I have not gifted these yet, so they have not been tried on, but they look nice."
4.0,"The flare dresses are BEAUTIFUL for a nice hot day with sandals. They are kinda sheer, but I really don’t care because I normally wear black spandex shorts under my dresses in the summer anyway. I’m 5’ 2” and over 225 lbs (quarantine weight gain…no judgement). I normally buy Amazon clothes in a size 2x, but I bought the 3x because I was hoping it would be a better length. Turns out, it was better as the skirt hit me just below my knees. Also, the dresses have a nice tapered A-line look with the top fitting close and flaring out at the waste. I wish I had bought these when summer started. No worries for me because I can wear them with opaque stocking, boots and a jacket or blazer. I will DEFINITELY be buying the entire collection of colors ASAP! BTW, I gave it 4 stars because the colors are slightly off from the depiction. The brown is actually taupe/beige ( I was hoping for the chocolate color depicted…I love brown/chocolate colors) and the burgundy is a washed out pale looking burgundy tone. (I love the pale look much more than the dark burgundy since I already have a few crush burgundy dresses)."
4.0,Color was not true to picture but keeping it anyway
4.0,"This is such a cute dress--the floral print is beautiful and it fits well. I am about 5'4, 115 lbs. and the size small fits comfortably. It fits snug, but comfortable and not suffocating. I love the feel of the fabric as well--it is soft and is kind of a stretchy material. The dress is more of a sleeveless design, not a cap-sleeve, and the length comes down to mid-calf. The skirt is definitely not as full as pictured, so if you want some fullness then you will need to wear a petticoat underneath. I have yet to try it with one but I suspect that this dress will look great with the fuller skirt. My only gripe is that the chest area/design doesn't fit so great. I am around a B cup, and it just looks a little funny in that area. I am thinking I'll just fold some of the fabric inward to bring the neckline down a bit, or have it tailored to fit better. I had my sister try the dress on as well thinking maybe she'd fit that area better but even with her D cup the design just didn't look quite right. Overall this dress is still pretty cute and a good deal despite the awkward chest design. I received this dress at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Product looks nice and more expensive than it is from afar. Up close it’s a little more obvious that it’s not real silver. Bought them for my bridesmaids and switched out the boxes they came in for a cuter box. Good product for the price.
4.0,Very comfortable.  Just the support my tired feet need.
4.0,"Really tight on my face and I don’t have a big head<br /><br />Update: the company has issued me a refund. Seeing as how customer service is half of the business, I’m giving them 4 stars. Thank you Eye Love."
4.0,It fits like a glove and they're unique in style
4.0,"The glasses are nice and appear to be good quality.  Prime shipping is of course, the best!  Please note the bamboo color depicted here is much much darker than what I received - which was a super blonde wood color.  Luckily my giftee still liked them!  If they were for me I would have returned for the Ebony pair.  I understand this was my fault and I didn't really read the description, I just based my choice off the color shown on screen."
4.0,Great fit! Stretchy material would recommend.
4.0,great as a cheap extra rain coat for the car.
4.0,"Very good, I LIKE THE GLASSES ARE TO MEASURE AND YOU ARE GOING VERY WELL, YOU CLASSIFY AS MEGUSTA COVERED IN MY EXPECTATIONS AND PROTECT, THE RECOMMEND ARE GOOD"
4.0,"Esta bello, pero la talla es más grande de lo que esperaba"
4.0,Sizes run small but the quality is good the pocket seems a little too high up
4.0,"Nice, heavy duty. good for a work ring if you do a lot with your hands."
4.0,"These are great gloves. I bought each of my kids a pair. They held up great against the Midwest snow, easy to get on, and they stay on. Biggest downside is that they don't come out of the dryer dry very well."
4.0,Arms are a little tight but super cute.
4.0,My two year old loves these shoes. Easy to get on. Nice to go from the beach to playground. Get ready for super stinky feet though. Lol. Easy to wash and dries fairly quick
4.0,Great quality leather but wish it had a belt keeper (loop).
4.0,Love this dress bought for my Nana's Celebration of life and it was a big hit! Got a medium and brought the sides in with a hip belt!
4.0,Bought this to hold my phone and wallet in immediate access while riding and it works. Was getting tired of having to open the Chrome Helix bag to get those items out. The outer water resistant coating squeaks when rubbing on my bike frame on warm days but that is to be expected. Would have two if I was doing longer rides.
4.0,Great fit and decent quality for the price. Shipped quickly!
4.0,now this watch I absolutely love. is very unique and eye-catching. once you learn how to read it is very easy to do and it makes perfect sense I like it!! recommend as a very good gift.<br /><br />BJ Dragon
4.0,So cute! But the strap starts to wear out quickly.
4.0,"A hood adds IMMENSELY to your warmth. This one is well made, packs TINY yet fluffs up to highly lofty, WARM coverage. I bought it for my down quilt, and plan on treating it with NikWax down proof for water resistance. It does restrict vision somewhat, even with the drawsting fully open,;and I know my LL Bean 850 parka hood is warm yet AMAZINGLY allows normal vision, so this CAN DE DONE. But, overall, it will be perfect for my down quilt hood, and as a back up hat to wear during freakishly cold days. Unpaid, unbiased review from a real purchaser/user."
4.0,"They keep your hands warm. Padding can use some help, but there is still relief. Used up to 50 miles in 48 degree weather."
4.0,had to have it taken in but still worth the price
4.0,Liked it used it as a gift
4.0,"I don't understand why there is no length on the product page for these jeans.  Vertical is important too!  The pair I got . 32 waist, was marked on the garment as 34 length.  The jeans are quite sturdy and seem well-made.  The fabric is heavy.  I like the light color.  Unlike some ""distressed"" jeans, these have patches, ones that look like the iron-on patches you can buy in fabric stores, under each distress hole in the jeans.  I imagine these will make the jeans last longer, and do keep skin from showing through, if that is the look you want, but they also feel a bit rough and heavy compared to the jeans where the patches aren't.  Still, a nice pair of jeans."
4.0,"Nice watch for the price. Wood is a little rough in some areas, but then you're not spending a fortune and it keeps good time."
4.0,Could be thinker but perfect in all other ways ! I am short so if you're tall you have no worries !
4.0,"These are super cute and comfy, but I had to order 2 sizes up. I’m 5’5” and 148 lbs and had to get the XL. But I get a lot of compliments on them!"
4.0,"Size small was way too large (too wide, too long) and the top was unflattering on me. I am 5'4&#34;, 105 lbs. Too bad because the pattern on it was pretty."
4.0,"I USE to wear size M... but after to read all the review, i decided for size s! and is still to big, at least for me... i 5ft, 115 lb, and 36b bra"
4.0,"a bit shiny, but you get what you pay for. worked great for my costume!"
4.0,Nice looks good
4.0,"Love this very different can not wait to wear it , I will have to fine right outfit.. Shipped on time and was as described"
4.0,Fit is good and comfy
4.0,"Nice hat, but I bit small for my 23"" circumference head. Gave it to my brother..."
4.0,They are too thin for me. But my granddaughter loves them. So they worked out great.
4.0,Pants forks as desired. Wash alone since its color leaks to other clothing.
4.0,"Perfect for my shoes - summer or winter weather! HOWEVER, the plastic part (where it's sewn into the fabric) irritated my skin at first, and these socks already have holes in them after several months of wear."
4.0,"Aside from the awkward smell and slightly larger size, I did actually like the dress."
4.0,"super lightweight but seems to hold what I wanted it to hold. If you are thinking this will be the same quality as a Sea to Sea Compression bag but maybe just a better deal, think again though. I am a little bit worried about it coming apart but only time will tell."
4.0,To small but I'm going to give as a Christmas gift instead.
4.0,"It's a good belt, seems durable, and it keeps my pants up.  What more can you ask of a belt?"
4.0,"halloween costume, fit great; for one time use"
4.0,"This product is a great idea. So much easier than carrying around my conventional fill-frame reading glasses. These clip-on reading glasses are well-constructed-- not flimsy and not cheap. I got the 2.0 strength, and it seems the actual magnification is indeed at a 2.0 level.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they don't work on my glasses. I have circular ""John Lennon"" glasses. These reading glasses clip onto your center bridge or heavy nose piece....and my glasses have neither. This is not a fault in the product, and few people have glasses like mine. Just look at your glasses and confirm that it has something that the vertical clips can grab."
4.0,I received the dress with a few beads that were dangling off the dressed and became unattached. But other than that the dress was gorgeous. I'm 5'5 so it was about 2 inches too long even with 2 inch heels. Great holiday/party dress for the price! Had the hotel press it and it looks amazing.
4.0,"This is a cute, fun top! I ordered the XXL and it fits as expected. The arms aren't tight, which is something that's often the case with online shopping. I love the leopard print. The shirt is tunic styled and a little longer than I would prefer. My main reason is that I wanted to wear it with jeans. I don't wear leggings, but if you do, the shirt would look darling with them, and the length wouldn't be an issue. The little knotted feature is cute and makes it look a little dressier. The fabric is soft and stretchy."
4.0,"Good glass. I have had about 4 pairs of these shads, They have changed there hinge style I like the old compound hinges better than the ones I received this time. The old hinges had springs and opened slightly passed 90 degrees the ones I received this time do not do that. So I will have to look for a new go to pair of shades :/"
4.0,Very spacey.....and affordable...took some time for delivery..but was worth the wait...have a cheesy scent but wont kill you..quality is real good.
4.0,"The glasses look exactly like the picture, which is always great to know that you're getting what you ordered. They have a great size, came in their little bag, which was a good plus. They don't look bad quality, they look really cute and good. They're pretty flat, so if you're expecting a slight curve, that won't be there. I'm not going to bend them, they actually fit pretty great as is, both on the nose and on the ears, the best part is that they're not extra tight on the face, so they won't leave a mark or give you a headache (which some glasses do...at least to me). Very happy with them. This product was given to me with a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"This is a nice looking watch.  Nice size and band is comfortable.  Materials are light weight which, in my experience is not the best.  Comes with tool to adjust band size that took a little effort to do but overall, a decent watch."
4.0,"The color is nice and they did not fade on the first wash. The print is only on one side and I don't mind that. I like the choice of colors, too. I put them on my head when I am cleaning house or working out. I need the larger bandana because the 21&#34; is just a little too small for my head. This is better but now there is so much materiel left over that I am having to fold the triangle several times across the top of my head. While this works and the bandanas are much better than my smaller ones, does anyone make one that is about 24 in&#34;?  If I cannot find anything smaller than I will purchase more of these."
4.0,I like these sandals but they don't keep their firmness long
4.0,Cute and pretty. Ran a little larger on me than I typically like but doesn’t look too large.
4.0,I thought It was a sweat shirt when I bought it but it’s just a long sleeve tshirt. Still cute and fit great just not what I expected.
4.0,"Be careful, they rip & tear easily."
4.0,Ring is comfortable. It came on time. I was disappointed over the blue strip. It was not as blue as the photo. Not even near that color. It almost blends into the black.  That's not the sellers fault though.
4.0,"Does its job as described. No problem with noise. It's been going on almost non-stop for the past month or so, and no problem so far. Took out a star because the spinning part on the left side is not attached properly, so had to push it back in towards its center at least once per day, otherwise it will come out more and more towards the window and eventually either the watch will be scratching the window or the movement will stop because the watch gets stuck against the window."
4.0,It's great.  Much larger than cbs draft boards.  There's a lot of wasted space and a few names had to be written in but it even includes a marker and blank stickers.  I will purchase again
4.0,Now the most comfortable pair I own. I wish the cup were a little bigger is my only complaint. Great butt lift from the back straps and a comfortable seam joint where the straps attach to the cup.
4.0,Wish it was a little bit bigger but it will do.
4.0,I use them as a compression socks for diabetes (water retention). They work great from mid foot up but the toe area up to mid foot needs to have more compression. So far a good reasonably priced compression socks. Works better than a lot of compression sox out there for diabetics.
4.0,There lightweight shorts comfortable material for hot summer days. But the elastic good be a little better or I would of gave 5 stars . Overall great shirts!
4.0,"It's nice, It doesn't look cheap. I've even gotten quite a lot of compliments. My only complaint is that the metal piece connecting to the strap is not very reliable. I work in a place where i have to grab a lot of stuff within deep shelves and if the watch brushes into anything too hard, the strap detaches instantly. It's not too much of a hassle to put it back together.<br /><br />Overall, very good for the price, just keep in mind that it doesn't suit all lifestyles. Buy if your watch hand doesn't hit much of anything."
4.0,I bought my size and feels a little uncomfortable and small but I wear it like that and don't even remember those feeling. I will purchase another one soon just a size bigger
4.0,It's super cute but make sure you order a size or two up because it runs really small!
4.0,"It is a nice, very roomy, jacket, and it came on time."
4.0,Hem stitching is weak.
4.0,Awesome dress. It's free flowing and so comfortable
4.0,Nicely gift boxed. Beautiful coloring and workmanship.
4.0,Beautiful. Large set will eventually fall out though.
4.0,I like this skirt.
4.0,Works as expected but it makes the watch look way to larger for me.
4.0,"My stepson owns a funky old shepherd's jacket. At one point it was probably a lovely coat, but with 30+ years of wear prior to him buying it, and then a teenager wearing it, it was looking a little grungy. The icing on the cake was when his mother's puppy peed on it. I called the local dry cleaners only to learn that we were looking at $50 or more to clean this thing he picked up at a thrift shop for a fiver. Anyway, I researched different cleaners and settled on this one. It works really well! He had to use it several times in some areas, but it even finally lifted an ink stain that looked like it was there to stay. Some areas of the coat even look brand new. I haven't used it on my Ugg clogs yet, but am looking forward to removing the salt stains from the road salt. I will update once I've done that."
4.0,Beautiful watch! Bought is as a gift.
4.0,The dress fits nicely BUT it is too short. I'll shorten it a couple inches so it looks short on purpose.<br />The fabric has static electricity issues.
4.0,"Just as pictured. I received 2 stones. Nice shiny metal. It hangs off of my rear mirror, so not sure as far as holding up for everyday use (shower, lotion, soaps etc)  but seems well made. I glued the screw shut just to be safe. Highly recommend."
4.0,much smaller than I'd hoped for
4.0,"I like the colours stainless band , easy for using and adjusting size , waterproof also."
4.0,"My only complaint about this top is it didn’t in place, the bottom would ride up and show my strapless bra as you can see in the picture.  But for the price it was a very cute top! The fabric very stretchy and comfortable! The pink was a little more neon that I thought the picture showed"
4.0,"El reloj se ve mejor que en las fotografias, se ve muy elegante"
4.0,"I am a 5'5 140 pound woman. I ordered this for my 13 year old nephew in a medium at first. He is a little taller than me and really lanky and usually wears a small or medium shirt. I tried it on once I received it to make sure that it should fit him since I would need to ship it to him. It fit me very snug so since I wanted it for a boy who may not like his clothes to fit so tightly (not that he likes to wear baggy clothes it just fit so tightt on me that it would've looked like he was wearing his younger siblings clothes)<br /><br />I ended up going with the XL, he was happy about that"
4.0,Very vibrant color and lightweight
4.0,These sunglasses are a good quality and fit well over my prescription glasses.
4.0,"This necklace is nice , but seems to fit kind a weird.  It's too wide and the closure broke."
4.0,"This product is amazing, the only issue I had was how long the lace was. I would tickle my eyes."
4.0,I love them however the blue one had a stone missing other then that they look very good
4.0,Love this dress!! Fits perfect.
4.0,This hat is pretty much what I expected. I have 2 issues with this hat. 1) The stitching on the brim doesn't go through the brim. 2) The clasp on the back seems to have been placed a bit higher than others. The hat doesn't feel cheap at all but looks like it was quickly assembled.
4.0,to flashy for everyday use
4.0,Pretty color combination
4.0,"I like the length of this, but it wasn't thick enough. I have to have a body pillow that raises my arm high enough that I don't lose feeling in my hand or arm. I wrapped a bath sheet around it and raised almost enough. That said, this is a pillow for my Bug-out Bag and I will be in a desperate situation to need to use it. I would love it if it were a couple inches thicker."
4.0,"Good fit, a little too large in the lens area. But considering every other style of sunglasses that I tried for small faces, these are fantastic!<br />Mrs. Riney"
4.0,"The pink and black one are really cute but the purple is more blueish and darker than it appears in the photo.  I thought it would be lavender.  The back of the heart piece is flat,  not round,  so the edge can rub against your skin if it's tight."
4.0,The only thing I would change about this bag is the fact that it doesn't have a handle on top.  It would be nice if you could pick the bag up by a handle instead of the strap.
4.0,"Loved how these can be worn dressy or semi casual. I. 5'2"" and they were a tad long, but nothing a quick hem can't fix. But honestly may just keep them as it!"
4.0,I like the material not cheap.<br />Runs big
4.0,"These are so cute and I've gotten so many compliments on them. The only issue that I have is that they came a little bit crooked and you can tell because it makes it look like one of my eyebrows is higher up than the other. For the price though, I really do like these. They're pretty dark as well."
4.0,Not made from the most durable materials. They fit great around eyes but really tight behind ears. The case is awesome
4.0,"These shorts are adorable and made with a nice soft cotton. They’re a little shorter than I would prefer, but I layer them over a longer pair of spandex shorts that I don’t like wearing alone. The combination is perfect."
4.0,Probably closer to a 3 month size but precious
4.0,"For reference, I am 5'7"" and wear a size 18-20; I ordered the XXL. I bought this to wear as a light rain jacket.<br /><br />Sizing/Fit: This jacket was just a tad bit tight in the shoulders, armhole and waist area; it fit great in the chest area, though. I can still fit it fine, but it would be a little snug, especially over thicker clothes. The description states that ""Size may be 2cm/1 inch inaccuracy due to manual measurement."" I agree; the measurement was about an inch off (smaller); so, take that into account when considering what size to order.<br /><br />Length: The length of the jacket hit me between the belly button and hip. The length of the sleeves was perfect.<br /><br />Color: This jacket arrived today, and the color looked exactly like the pictures.<br /><br />Other: The material felt good, and I saw no issues with the quality like loose stitches. I have not worn or washed it yet, but so far, so good.<br /><br />Overall: I would purchase this again while being even more aware of the sizing."
4.0,flattering fit
4.0,Comforable feels like norhing on.
4.0,Really cute my best friend loved it but the chain was rather small
4.0,like the length and fit was expecting it to be a heavier material.
4.0,Have not worn it yet but it looks nice.
4.0,"I love the different options, graphics, text, etc. that’s available. The charge seems to last a long time too!"
4.0,I don't look like this sexy guy with no head. I bet you he is a butter face (buthim face doesn't work). Comfy and formal. Black tie appropriate.
4.0,Good solid pants.
4.0,"I've spent the last couple of years looking for a duck boot in this style- I was very excited to find these! I wear a size 38 Dansko, and 8 running shoe. After reading reviews I went ahead and ordered an 8- I usually wear a smart wool sock with shoes. Unfortunately the 8 was simply too big. I don't have narrow feet but these definitely seem wide and while the length was fine the width of the boots made them slip around while walking. I would go ahead and order down unless you plan on wearing these with a VERY THICK sock.  The 7 came in the mail today and they fit much better. I took one star off because for the price I was thinking the rubber on the toe might be a little more substantial.... maybe I'm wrong and they last me a long time. I hope so. :)"
4.0,I do love it but the bottoms are a bit shorter then shown. I was wanting them longer then they came.
4.0,"Not bad at all! Colors aren't as vibrant in the pic but I still liked it when I received it. It fit me perfect and the length was great. I'm 5'2 and 160lbs, if your taller this will be a short on you. Delivery was pretty quick, about a week from the day I ordered it."
4.0,"I bought these socks for my brother who needs extra support when driving/sitting for long periods.  He has an average foot width, and wears a size 10 shoe.  By the size chart, these socks should have fit well.  But the socks run small, and the compression is not as described.  They are a beautiful, well made socks.  Well worth the price, but I wouldn't purchase them for any man over size 9."
4.0,"Soft and comfy. It seems like good quality, no complaints here."
4.0,"I ordered 2 dresses: 1 dress size 1-2 T and 1 dress 2-3T, for my grand daughters as a gift. The had different  lot numbers but were exactly the same size. The dresses are cute and  quality is acceptable for the  price. I gave feed back to the seller but have not received a response. It was suppose to be a gift so I am very disappointed."
4.0,Was expecting it to be a little biger but pleased exactly as pictured nothing fancy just a simple scarf.
4.0,"I was gifted this sweater- upon opening I was worried it wouldn't fit length-wise because it looked small.  Trying it on I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and fit, but it is not the 'oversized cozy sweater' that the product picture appears to be.  {5'10&#34; slim}"
4.0,"These beads are pretty and smell great. A few of the beads are not of the best quality but for the price you cant argue. Very happy with my purchase,"
4.0,Loved the color...perfect for the skirt I matched with it..Sleeves little tight but I can live with it.
4.0,"I love my new lanyard. The string it hangs on is a bit thin, but so far so good!"
4.0,Very cute & it came on time with all of the right sizes
4.0,"Good and thick. Would honestly sweat my ass off working out in them. But the high waist band is only an inch, which was the reason its not a 5 star, I thought it would be thicker like about 2 inches to compliment the waist like most but great sexy leggings. Will last awhile for the great price!"
4.0,I bought these for use at the gym. They’re just what I was looking for...very lightweight and no slip (both the foot bed and sole. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that there was a little material that needed trimming from the injection process.
4.0,"These are good non-slip toe socks. I teach Pilates, so I wear non-slip socks all the time at work, and I do like these. They seem to hold up reasonably well, and are also reasonably priced compared to other brands."
4.0,Everywhere I have worn these shoes I have gotten so many compliments I also have these in blue and black even my boyfriend even  complimented me today  on these shoes my only complaint is that the shoes run small and narrow definitely will need to break in these shoes  before wearing regularly but other than that I love these shoes
4.0,"I wear an unusual size, so bra shopping is perpetually difficult. I also do a lot of yoga, so I need something that will keep me contained but that I can also get back off again at the end when I'm sweaty and sticky. This bra has become one of my favorites! It's soft on my skin and offers enough coverage to wear with other things or alone. It stays in place and I never have to worry about wardrobe malfunctions. In an ideal world, it would be a smidge more snug (the next size down is too small) but overall it is amazing and I am extremely pleased. Next time I wear out a sports bra, I'll probably replace it with another one of these!"
4.0,"Nice item, will order again"
4.0,"Very soft, fit like a glove. These are not leggings you want to wear for squat day. I wear these only for yoga or low sweat gym days-they show sweat very easily"
4.0,"This is an amazing pack, and it is HUGE! There are 3 different compartments, so it keeps everything really organized for easy access. Stitching is great, sturdy. The shoulder straps are very comfortable, can be fitted to anyone for that extra support. The bottom doesn't give out when you're carrying it so it keeps its shape. The only problem I faced was the zippers, they are plastic and get a little stuck. If you over-pack the bag, you risk them snagging or separating."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, good quality.  However, the waist is not stretchy as the rest of the dress.  While it fits very well, too bad the waits is too tight when I sit down.  I was looking for comfortable wear-to-work clothes and I will not be comfortable sitting in this dress for 8 hours a day.  Other than that, I'd have no complain.  Too bad I will have to return even though I love the dress."
4.0,"I didn't expect this fabric honestly, but I really like it. It's not see through. The seams feel a little fragile so I wouldn't want to pull to hard on anything because they could probably rip, but for the price it's perfect"
4.0,"I like to make jokes of my messenger bags being my man purse. This bag really makes the joke become true.  It is smaller then what I normally get and it does not hold as much as my other bags can hold.<br /><br />Think of this as a light weight bag.  It will hold my 14X9 laptop and it's power cord.  It can hold some of my drawing supplies. It can hold a textbook and some papers.  Maybe two textbooks as long as they stay in the 200ish page range.<br /><br />It's built a little better then many &#34;cheap&#34; messenger bags.  One side of the strap is attached to the bag and the plastic connector on the other side seems to be better quality.  Weight wise?  I am not sure what it can carry.  The strap is not bad and is almost 2 inches in width.  They material of the bag seems better and will not fray as happened with my HOTD bag.<br /><br />The picture is nice.  I always did like this one. What is odd?  It's zip connected to the bag.  There might be others you can purchase and attach to the bag.<br /><br />Overall?  I like it.  I get it's not a big bag and it's good for carrying a couple things to a coffee shop.  Now, carrying things for work and or multiple classes?  I would not use this.<br /><br />I will keep this one."
4.0,"Very pretty and simple. The dividers are a bit flimsy and move too easily, but it's workable. Thicker jewelry and rings may not fit inside."
4.0,A little bit cheap but I wasn't expecting to go all out. It's very cute especially if you want a little sparkle going on ! I'll def wear it when I go out this summer :)
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is a nice versatile blazer.  It can be worn to work with a blouse and slacks, and it also goes well with a t-shirt and jeans.  The style/cut is classic.<br /><br />The blazer is fully lined and the pockets are real and functioning."
4.0,Love it.  The fit is not loose but comfortable.  I'm a size 18/20w
4.0,A Christmas gift for a friend. He loves it. Fits fine.
4.0,great set of earrings ... some of the studs were stuck and couldn't open but got it open after a while .. not bad at all
4.0,"Beautiful, fits like expected is lose, straps need to be tied and break easily which is I guess expected for the price paid.  Wore once and the same day the strap broke when I went to tie it tighter."
4.0,"Pros:<br />Nice mix of PASTEL colors; not as bright in the image.<br />Smooth, soft fabric<br />Nice fabric weight to keep the chill away<br />Hood is large enough to cover entire head.<br />Cons:<br />Sleeves could be a bit longer.<br />The size S fits but is too short, and the size M is too large in the middle.<br />For reference, I am 5'6-1/2"" and 130 lbs."
4.0,This is a cute little purse for your phone and a few other little items.  I do wish it was a tiny bit larger to get my big fingers inside to grab my phone easier.  I have a iPhone 7 plus and it fits perfectly but reaching in to grab it out gets a little tight and awkward.  Strap is a good length for over shoulder or cross body.
4.0,"nice, but returned, not what i wanted"
4.0,Fit just right. Would buy again
4.0,"Over all it is what I was expecting of the tank top.  Very light and somewhat see through! Only gave it 4 stars because I wish it was just a little bit longer.  I'm 5'6 and 120lb and 30B for the top, so the XS fits my upper body perfect, but the length is a bit off sits right at the waist and most tops go a bit lower.  Again over all is a great top, I got it in Black."
4.0,"So the bag and the double wrapping are great. The puff ball is amazingly soft and fluffy, but the tassels are a bit cheap feeling and looking. Maybe due to the coloring and pattern it causes this to look cheaper. If it was a solid color, maybe it wouldn't be as cheap looking? Not sure, just my honest opinion."
4.0,"Surprisingly very good quality, I have no concerns at the moment. Pleased with the products material."
4.0,"Really cute and came in perfect condition, exactly like the picture. I ordered a size up for slightly oversized look like the model. Lightweight & the sleeves are short like the picture, wrist length. Love it. It took a few weeks to arrive, two weeks shorter than expected delivery date however, since came from China."
4.0,"I really like these, wish they were a little bigger"
4.0,"Really happy with this product. It looks great, feels like a solid construction. My only gripe is that I hoped it came with a mid size adapter. It only comes with one short and one long adapter which works if you have three or seven keys. But I only have four and I had to use the short adapter and fiddle with the screw til it went on. Other than that I would happily recommend this to anyone who wants to stop the jingle!"
4.0,This is SO cute!!!! And fits well. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is cause when I washed it a bib got stuck on the green part and it frayed a bit. So keep velcro away lol<br />But other then that it cleans up nicely.
4.0,Wasn't expecting much for 21 bucks. Was i pleasently suprised. What difference with clarity an sun block.
4.0,"Good quality,  spins well. One star was very mildly mishap en, and occasionally discolors, but overall a good product."
4.0,The coat is very nice for the price but runs VERY small!
4.0,Great color and mayetial
4.0,This is a good quality pair of glasses.  My only complaint is that the bi-focal line is a little too low for me to wear at work.  I have to hold my head up high to look down through them.  They are fine for just reading but to work with my hands they aren't practical.
4.0,The dress was very nice but I had to return it for the next size and it didn’t arrive in time for my event so I can’t attest to how it held up
4.0,This is to cute and the material is good material. It is soft. I purchased it for my daughter. She was singing Miranda Lambert at an event. (Sorry for the sideways picture)<br /><br />Side Note: This is not my daughters normal attire. She wears sweats and t-shirts unless she is singing at an event for her performance school.  I also do not endorse or promote Miranda Lambert. :)
4.0,"Material isnt soft on the inside, but its very comfortable. Its pretty warm and good for layering but dont expect this to keep you super warm during the winter. The printing is high quality and i really like this jacket."
4.0,"Material of dress was a little rough, but nothing a good wash couldn't soften. Dress was a few inches to big on the waist, but that is an easy fix."
4.0,Love all the colors in it and the way it fits
4.0,"Great hat, looks exactly as I wanted. Only issue is the packaging, it was package with other items and came a little deformed. Took a little work getting the hat back into shape."
4.0,"First one came open and the entire hat fell apart!😂<br />The second hat is great. Soft, nice color-<br />I wish it didn’t come so far out over my face though.<br />When I’m driving I can’t see out of the side windows 🙄"
4.0,"It's everything I can think of. Sun protection, virus protection, and practically kid proof since it won't fall off their ears like a traditional mask. We are happy."
4.0,Cute and affordable. Fits well.
4.0,This is a great quality and I love the flip action. Could be a little larger but clipped on polarized lenses it’s a perfect combo!
4.0,The Black (Small) is perfect! The Light Brown (Small) is very short & impossible to tuck in unless you're wearing high-waisted bottom. Very strange how the same size but different color would differ. Would love to return the Light Brown but it's already been worn.
4.0,"This belt is really cute. It was a little to big so I had to add an extra hole to the belt, it isn’t made of leather so it was easy to make a hole. I was surprised to see that the belt said “Gucci” because I thought it was just a dupe not a replica. But it’s still a really nice belt."
4.0,"Although it is somewhat large for my petite frame, it's still cute on and I have received many compliments wearing it."
4.0,Held up its sparkle and shine for a two week run of shows!
4.0,I ordered them for post-op recovery. They arrived some time after my surgery so I didn't use them much. They are comfortable but the material is thinnish and after several washings will be headed to the donated pile.
4.0,Soooo soft and fluffy!  The material literally feels like a warm hug!<br /><br />The fit was a little off.  The top fits my 11 yr old perfectly but the pants were way too big.  I'm going to see if my mom can put some tighter elastic in the pants because they're just too good to pass up.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and well made, but I ordered a medium and it was a bit big on my sister. She is a large (size 10). Order a bit smaller and you'll be fine"
4.0,Great product. Clips don't always latch on to shirt too well but it gets the job done.
4.0,"The material is on the thinner side, so every bump & lump shows - maybe I need to get rid of the bumps!  Comfy top."
4.0,You get what you see in the pics. Quality metal. Its only 4 stars because I got a couple duplicates.
4.0,"I bought these for my super tall 6 year old to wear under her dresses. She loves the colors and design, I was hoping they’d be more of a cotton kind Of feel, but they feel more like an athletic material, which has actually worked well for her to use for gymnastics. She about 50lbs, I think 4.5 ft and on the slender side."
4.0,Good fit and value.
4.0,Love the shorts but the waistband curls on me all the time
4.0,"Beautiful earrings,picture doesn't do them justice. Nice length too!<br />The only negative is the posts are a little flimsy"
4.0,Got the medium. I'm 5.11 185lbs. Very comfortable. Sadly is slightly  small for me but they are a good product.
4.0,"Loved the dress! Got soo many compliments, curves to your body nicely. Only downside is that the dress does run small, I followed the size guidelines too. May be it would've fit nicer if I had ordered the next size up."
4.0,The dress is nice quality and comfortable however I would recommended sizing down. I’m normally a small and this was quite big on me especially in the chest. Maybe if you have a large chest you could stay true to size. Also I’m pretty tall at 5’8” and the dress was not too short on me which is so hard to find! It hit a few inches above my knee.
4.0,It’s comfortable and fit as expected it the only thing we didn’t expect was the hand washed only
4.0,I bought these slides to just really wear around the house but I get compliments on them and  I’ve been asked a lot where I got them from!
4.0,"I really like it, but I should have gotten a medium."
4.0,I love this shirt but it runs small. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I wear a medium to large in most shirts and I ordered a large but it was too small in the chest area. I gave it to a friend of mine because it did not fit.
4.0,"This is cute in my tragus piercing, big and chunky.  I have a very tiny tragus, this jewel takes up a lot of space, but I love it.  I give 4 starts because the threading on the back was really hard to get started, so trading out jewelry is not an every day option.  The fun, funky gem looks a little chintzy when wearing my nice &#34;real&#34; jewelry.  I've had this in for weeks now, it's in great shape and very well made."
4.0,Love it! Get lots of compliments.
4.0,The dress was lighter than the picture but the fit was nice.
4.0,"Very nice and beautiful, I had several compliments"
4.0,Wished you guys would carry newborn and preemie.
4.0,it should fit nicely for slim people
4.0,The style and fit are great. The price was excellent too.
4.0,Bright tags you can see from far
4.0,Great suede coat i need petite the sleeves too long. A petite large would be great. Great material not too stiff. Also would like other colors in petite.
4.0,Work great. Bought 2 just in case one broke we would have a backup. Both work and still do.
4.0,Great product  A must buy your jewelry will sparkle like the sun
4.0,Simple sunglasses that works miracles. Working night shift and coming home when the sun is starring right at you is asking for a migraine. These glasses really help with minimizing that. Simple design so I feel comfortable wearing it in the car.
4.0,"The top fits perfect and it's a nice, soft fabric which is comfortable to work out in, BUT the bottoms are just waaaaaaay to long for my legs. I am short so that could be a reason, but I think if you aren't 6ft the fabric will buckle a little bit at the ankles for you too (It buckled A LOT at the ankles for me). Also, the crotch area is too big and loose. It would be uncomfortable to work out in (I haven't tried). I wouldn't get a smaller size tho bc then the shirt would be too tight.<br /><br />Tl;dr: The bottoms suck ass if you aren't tall. Buy if you want nice top"
4.0,Received on time and in nice packaging.  Good quality product.  I would order again.
4.0,Wish the dagger was true to size in the picture. I feel like it is very small.
4.0,Looks and feels good exc for the price
4.0,It’s so cute! Very happy. Not sure about water resistance. But it’s the perfect size for a purse and very versatile.
4.0,"don't like the waist line !  I am glad I got one size larger ,I needed the room ! Lost the button and need a replacement !"
4.0,I love this but order a size down.
4.0,"Having said too small, due to previous reviews I ordered up so it did fit.  Darling top, pretty pattern  lace seems good and the length is flattering."
4.0,"I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 for these reasons:<br />1. What I ordered was advertised as the electric, heated socks.<br />2. They are thick, which will add warmth, but not what I'd consider to be ""thermal.""<br />3. These are a bit overpriced.<br />The socks are well-made and comfy. They are long and come just below the knee. They are just like the  ""tube socks"" worn in the 80's."
4.0,"Nice chain, anhk is ok but it's worth the money."
4.0,good sandals very light and comfortable
4.0,"Cute, looks better once I got it on"
4.0,Really liked this & was excited that it had pockets.  Didn’t really fit me as I thought and I ordered a 1X- gave to my daughter and she LOVES it!!
4.0,"I got these to wear to work this winter and I have to dress them up a bit. They over all, are pretty great! My only concern is that I can’t tell if they are completely opaque or if I was more active in them, you could see through. I think I would stick to just wearing them to work and not working out."
4.0,"What a handy item and a lifesaver if you ever work on watchbands. Sooner or later you will lose one of these watch spring bars and this kit has a broad range of sizes. However, the tape they sealed the plastic container with leaves a lot of glue residue that is REAL sticky. I had to use 'Goof Off' to remove it."
4.0,"Very nice and shiny, but a little big for a normal sized ankle. Tend to drop into my shoes."
4.0,"Super cute, totally mirrored! Lightweight material was comfortable on my face. They fell apart after about a month. Hopefully I'll purchase new screws and make them more durable."
4.0,"Loved the shoes, but could not get my foot all the way in the shoe"
4.0,Cute little shoes but every time my baby walks with them they come of!
4.0,"If you have big hands, you will love these gloves as they will fit.<br /><br />I found them a little large for my hands, so the company may want to make these in two sizes.<br /><br />Because they are large for me, I have to work harder to grab things.<br /><br />They don't make my hands sweat like rubber gloves sometimes do.<br /><br />You can feel little bumps on the inside, but that didn't bother me.<br /><br />They protect your hands from burns.<br /><br />I used them to clean the kitchen: sink, counters, doors of cabinets so dipped them in hot water with cleanser.  I was satisfied.<br /><br />My husband might like these more than I do as they will fit his hands better.  He has large hands.<br /><br />These will get a lot of use in our house."
4.0,Material is not that great but for the price its what I expected.
4.0,"Very nice dress. Not a knitted fabric/texture. I would not call it a sweater dress. If you're a medium, you should probably order a small, it does run large. The skirt part of the dress is longer than it appears in the picture."
4.0,"This is a fine wallet, the card slots are snug but I think they will loosen up a bit over time. I usually carry a very minimalist wallet and there are just sometimes I need space for more and this is loaded up so when I need everything I just move three cards over and go. The leather feels good and the stitching looks well . All in all not a bad wallet !"
4.0,Love this jacket even though I hate it has no pockets
4.0,Too long and and big than I expected how ere my daughter loves the kitties on it
4.0,"This is a nice large sized purse. I like my purse to have multiple zipper compartments, preferably two in front, one in back, and on the main part. It's actually not so easy to find a purse with the zippers I want, in a good quality material that won't fall apart in a month or two. I can't vouch for the quality of the material on this one yet, but it feels decently durable so far. And it has all the minimum pockets I need.<br />The front pockets can fit keys and other small objects. The back pocket fits a cell phone (probably not the overly long ones), or other items in that size range. The main pocket fits a small sized umbrella (about 10"" maybe) and most random but necessary paraphernalia that somehow ends up in our purses.<br />I wasn't specifically looking for the additional wristlet that came with this purse, but it's a nice addition.<br /><br />Tl;dr: nice large purse. Feels like good sturdy material. Nice amount of zippered compartments."
4.0,Very flattering and great price!
4.0,"I ordered the XL and that's the size I normally wear so I can say that the sizing is correct and at 5'6&#34;, the length is just right. While it 'fits' around me and in length, there's a strange bulge under the arms and the pockets come up a bit too high, so for me, this is more of a 'house-dress'. It works fine for that. I like to have something with pockets when cleaning the house and something comfortable when standing, stooping over, sitting, etc. and with the flowy feel of this dress, it is great.  It is very thin and it's sewn well with clean, finished seams."
4.0,Will not fit my 13inch laptop if it is in its small soft case and just barely without. Just a hair too small. Measurements were misleading IMO.
4.0,"I like this dress on myself (5'3, 135 lbs, 36C - ordered a medium) and I will be wearing the heck out of it this summer, but there are some things you should know before buying: the bust fits little tight, but not so much that it's uncomfortable to me. The material is pretty thin, so it may require a slip depending on where/who you're wearing it around. There are slits in the dress that are cut kind of high, so again, may require some more modest underwear. The length hits at my ankles, so I'm not sure how taller girls would feel about it. With all that said, I love the print, it's flattering on me, fits my needs for a dress, and the skirt is perfectly flowy."
4.0,"The length of the skirt part was great (I'm 5'10) but if you also have a longer torso the top part doesn't fall nicely on your hips, it pulls the skirt higher prove your waste.  I ended up cutting the top off and wear it as a nice skirt with my own black tank."
4.0,"The costume is one piece.  It closes at the back with with 3 velcro pieces.  In my opinion the lab coat is too long,  I took it up about 3 inches and it was perfect length. Also,  the tights are not included with the costume."
4.0,This is the cutest dress for Halloween. I wore leggings with it because I'm a 2 year old daycare teacher. It is slightly see through with a bigger bust but that's okay.
4.0,They seem to help some...
4.0,"I ordered the grey as a nice hat to wear at work. I work outside with students a lot and I like the sun protection. I should probably use a hat with at least a 3&#34; brim, but this seems to provide adequate protection and I've received lots of compliments on it. Looks good for work and for going out on a sunny summer day or even an evening."
4.0,Looked the same as photo.  Not a quality metal but about the worth of what they charge. They also are small. They won't dangle past your ears.
4.0,Only wish the front pockets were a little deeper for my iPhone 7..
4.0,At the battery is going out on a few of these but my little son thinks they are amazing! Totally fun to fill some time in the dark winter
4.0,Vibrant color; good material; well made. Bought it for my daughter to wear to school but he says it hurts her ears. Will keep it for myself.
4.0,Overall they were definitely worth the money.<br />I always order these a few sizes up so my toddler can get them on and off with ease.<br />Although within the first 2-3 weeks the inside lining started peeling off. But what do you want from a cheap pair of play boots. Overall they serve their purpose well and I would 100% buy again
4.0,"That it was of good quality,and made in America."
4.0,"Love the way this dress feels and fits. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it doesn't wash well.  I washed it on the gentle cycle in cold water, hung it to dry and it still came out faded and pilled."
4.0,"The pendant is beautiful; lovely polished gold. I was a little disappointed at how small it is even though the size was listed as height of 1inch. But it was a gift for my granddaughter, and she loves it. I’m happy to have found this pendant on Amazon."
4.0,The dress fit just as I had expected. I’m very happy with my purchase
4.0,Very comfortable and warm! Looking forward to wearing it watching my kids play sports in the cold and weather. Love the grey color!!
4.0,Awesome dress besides that it is too long even though they had us measure us all the way around! Really? But that's ok! Beautiful dress!!!
4.0,"Nice material, nice dress, nice color (pink), just a bit snug.  I wear a US size 22 and bought the 2x with my fingers crossed.  Sadly, it wasn't cut generously enough.<br /><br />But if you're smaller around than I, go for it! 😀"
4.0,tend to slid out a little due to how they hang on ear
4.0,Comfortable for summer. Decent inseam length. Fits perfectly.
4.0,"Nice quality, but not for anyone with large wrists."
4.0,Rings are very comfortable. Great for work. Do stretch out a bit and the black does seem to attract lint.
4.0,Color is more of a green tint to than yellow that was anticipating based on picture. Sweater is to be oversized.
4.0,"As a dancer who’s body doesn’t fit the cookie cutter idea of a “ballet body” I’m always on the hunt for leotards that are supportive up top and have inclusive sizing. This leotard is very well made and surprisingly supportive, and I wear it often. I just wish it came in larger sizes as it is a bit tight."
4.0,Muy buen accesorio....recomendable
4.0,"The description says these sunglasses are for men and women, and I think the style of the frames would be suitable for anyone. However, the fit could be snug for anyone with a larger head/face. Their best feature is how lightweight they are, and I like their comfortable fit.<br /><br />The presentation isn’t great if you want to send these to someone as a gift. There is a fairly nice zippered case that includes a cloth bag for the glasses, as well as a small cleaning cloth. However, the case is shipped in a plastic bag inserted into a padded shipping envelope with no box. The glasses arrived fine, though, and were in perfect shape, so even though a box would have looked better, the glasses were well-protected during shipment.<br /><br />I don’t wear them every day but they are handy to have when taking a walk or doing other outdoor activities, so I’m pleased with these sunglasses."
4.0,Alright didn't fit right on my legs.
4.0,My friend was able to used because was to big for me. She really like it.
4.0,"Nice & soft.  Warm, too."
4.0,I ordered my normal size (XL) but it was a half size or a size too small. It’s an awkward fit. But I think I can try to make it work.
4.0,Not for large wrists
4.0,Nice Christmas gift made well and look antique
4.0,ran smaller than expected - should have ordered size up
4.0,"Easy to wear, adjustable and keep you warm"
4.0,I love the dress but had to return the first time I ordered because it was too small.  I usually wear a small but when ordering this dress I would suggest one size up.  I reordered in a medium & it fit perfectly.  It’s very comfortable & flattering.  Can be worn for casual occasions or Sunday dress up.  With leggings & boots  or not.  I would order from this company again.
4.0,"Not quite as protective as I thought but otherwise excellent product.  Nice fabric, pretty color.  Holds credit cards securely in case.  I definitely recommend this product."
4.0,I like it.But It would be great if you were able to change the led color.
4.0,These capris are a super thin fabric so not much “hold”. I don’t think they would stay in place if you were to actually work out in them. They are great for just wearing around the house though.<br /><br />The long pair I purchased are a different material. Maybe a brushed poly. Great structure and hold!
4.0,Used these for skiing. Seller is really nice!
4.0,It's a beautiful bag
4.0,"Nice lightweight socks.  Unfortunately feels a little weird for my toes.  I guess my toes are longer.  I feel as if it doesn't go all the way down far enough.  The grippy part is nice and prevents slippage.  Overall comfortable but like I said, probably not as ideal for someone with longer toes.  Not the fault of the socks as they are designed for normal length toes.  I got this free in exchange for my unbiased review.  GOOD"
4.0,I bought these in extra large and I am usually a large. I could not even get them up over my butt I exchanged them for a 2X and they fit perfectly. Love the color
4.0,It a good hat... but i feel as though it could have use a facial adjustment or some sort of string..<br />Gets the job done ....
4.0,"Fits well, better than expected. Look good on amd very reasonable price"
4.0,My bf hates when I wear it but Idc lol it protects me perfectly from the sun!
4.0,These are great and they are very nice. That said they don't last for very many uses but the price was still right.
4.0,a little smaller than expected. Ordered a size up and still very tight.
4.0,It wasn't as nice in person but I wouldn't really expect it to for the price! I will still wear it though
4.0,Love this hat because it’s super warm and I’m glad the Pom comes off as I like to wear this under my ski helmet. The only reason it’s not. 5 is because the acrylic is silky along with my hair so I feel like I’m constantly pulling it down. But could be just me:)
4.0,"I love the color and fabric, and it fits well. I am tall, 5'9&#34; and it is the perfect length, just below my hip bone.<br />It is a little snug from underarm to top of straps, but that may be because of my height and being slightly broad shouldered.<br />I wear it with a sweater or business jacket, so bra straps aren't a concern, but it does have a higher neckline in the back that would conceal a Y-back bra. The straps are very thin though, so I would suggest invisible straps or a coordinating color if not wearing strapless."
4.0,Dramatically reduced the blue light coming from screens I use daily. Almost neutralizes the color to that of a hardcover book's pages not yellow enough to notice but warm enough of a color balance enough to feel comfortable staring through them.
4.0,"This sweatshirt is so soft and comfortable. It is pretty lightweight so don't count on it keeping you warm in a cold climate, but it is super cute."
4.0,The shirt's design is the selling point for me. Though the Thicker and less breathable material is more suited for colder weather. The pockets on the side are large enough for phones with screen size up to 6.5&#34;. Fits larger by a size so probably get a size smaller.  Still a great buy.
4.0,"Coobie 6 Pack Sports Bra 34B<br />very confortable to workout, recommended."
4.0,"The hidden pocket is a little useless since my phone is way too large to fit in it but that's my fault not the manufacturer's. They fit really well and are a nice stretchy material, but they start to ride down a little bit when I run. I am 5'6&#34; and 140lbs. I bought a medium and I think I should have gone for the small. However, they're greta leggings and I really enjoy them! They're my favorite pair second only to my lulu's."
4.0,"excaclty like the picture, and tru to size"
4.0,"Well, I ordered Gold, but received Rose Gold. Other than that, the earrings are exactly as pictured. Very pretty."
4.0,good production
4.0,The charm is pretty smaller than I thought. .. The chain way too small. . But overall pretty
4.0,"Pretty and teenage recipient loved it. Will be very useful for all her new earrings. However, the leaves and flowers do NOT bend easily and will break off if you try to rearrange it! So don't try to fan the parts out too much to make it more 3D. I did a little on the flowers but was afraid to do more after a leaf broke off in my hand. It arrived flat so I thought I was supposed to do that. Doh!"
4.0,"This is a comfortable shirt! It's very lightweight, and perfect for a summer day. Being a blend of 80% cotton / 20% flax linen, it doesn't wrinkle as badly as 100% linen, but still offers that natural, cool feel. I wore it all day and outdoors at night for a social-distanced family dinner, and it still looked great.<br /><br />The color is a very bright green - think 'green screen' - but it's a nice complement to jeans or earth tones."
4.0,"Cute!!  I bought this in white (size small) - I am 5'4&#34;, 115 pounds and it fits perfectly.  I love that it goes with everything.  May purchase in another color."
4.0,"Great to find a good belt for a plus size waist, seems to made well, hope it holds up over time."
4.0,Love these. Get lots of complements!
4.0,The instructions are not complete. Talks about setting the digital displays. Analog (watch hands) do not synchronize with the digital setting. I had to set it manually  for which there was no instruction or indication in the literature.
4.0,I am 5’5 and 160lbs. This item is a nice staple for an office intent on keeping the AC set on Santa’s workshop. It fit as expected. I wore tapered pants under it. Leggings would also work!
4.0,I’m giving this 4 stars because the pear-shaped jewel was not perfectly in place and the last square jewel on the very bottom had scratches on the back where the foil is painted on the gem so from the front it looks like there are black spots. I really like these earrings. The length is about 2.5” and the earring with the red gem weighs 10 grams while the earring with the tilted square weighs 15 grams.
4.0,"This beanie is warm, pretty, and comfortable. The lighting in my pictures makes the pink beanie appear to be a bit more peach, but it is a true pink as advertised in person. Unfortunately it arrived with a few flaws in it that looked like snags. They are small enough that they aren’t detracting too obviously from the look of the beanie, but I’m a little bit concerned that they may grow larger over time. For now, I’m happy with this basic beanie, but I’m going to keep an eye out and update my review if the flaws cause more serious unraveling. For now, I’m satisfied with the beanie and happy with the way it fits and looks."
4.0,"I love the material, print and rapid shipping. The skirt is very long. I’m 5’8” and must pulled it very high on my torso to keep it from dragging the floor."
4.0,Very pretty. My only complaint is that it gets tighter around the bottom which looks odd if you try to close the front. If you just let it hang open it looks very cute.
4.0,"I was surprised that these pants fit. For under $15, I was not expecting much. It didn’t take long, though, to figure out how they could be so cheap. I have no idea what material they are made of. No linen or cotton I ever felt. More like a fine sandpaper. I still wear them around the house as they are wide enough to not touch my skin. Just don’t sit or lie down."
4.0,"I got this keychain to go with a gift for a friend of mine. The keychain itself is absolutely adorable and I think it’s pretty perfect, my friend absolutely loved it. The only complaint I have here is that I wanted it before Sunday (I ordered it the day after Christmas, it said it’d be here on Friday) so he could open it at our Christmas get together, but the shipping got delayed twice and it arrived on Sunday a bit too late. Otherwise it’s a great little gift add on and all-in-all a good purchase. I would definitely recommend this."
4.0,Love all the pockets the best
4.0,"I have ordered these before and the size seems a bit tight, however I still love it. The print doesn’t come off no matter how often we wash it, so it’s really wonderful. I wish the pants would come up higher or the shirt go lower so that part of the back would get exposed to the sun too much."
4.0,Was worth the money
4.0,"Tried them on last night after twelve hour shift at the ER, feet hurting, they felt wonderful on my tired dogs. Soft and supple, did well out to the mailbox this morning. Will update....."
4.0,it's too warm for the summer but nice.
4.0,Bought this outfit for my daughters upcoming bday look perfect at the try on haul....I believe she will slay it
4.0,Over all skirt was good ....to small needed at least another size up....received many compliments
4.0,"Cute, as expected. Kind of spendy, but ah well."
4.0,Love this!  Delivery was fast!
4.0,It's a really nice wallet- really good quality so far
4.0,"Super small and dainty, very flexible material, and it was so simple to put in, I had to brownie at all. Bottom piercing"
4.0,"Love this purse!! Nice and spacious on the inside, but not to big for those quick runs when you just need your keys and a few essentials. I've had it for about 2 months, and it is doing pretty well; a couple of the threads are loose, but those are easy enough to snip off. A lot of the reviews talked about this 'horrible stench', but mine didn't really smell that bad when I got it, just a slight hint of 'eau de leather and warehouse.'  Wore off pretty quickly with a bit of airing out. One thing I don't like is the placement of the designer name. A lot of people think it is personalized, but nope. 'Course I knew it was going to be there because of the pics. So altogether, a very nice purse for the price you pay."
4.0,"They work fine for a few hours, after a while the bottom starts falling apart though, with the heel poking through. They were great for our wedding though! Make sure you get different sizes and that you have tons of them! These are the best option for a few people. the 4 pack is also a good deal: [[ASIN:B00FW1B7TK Heels Above High Heel Protector 4 Pack- includes 4 pairs in all 4 sizes - Clear]]"
4.0,A little large but gorgeous still!
4.0,Great product as described.  The only thing about this costume is that is it very hard to walk around when it’s inflated.
4.0,These scarf work well and it fits my God daughter perfectly
4.0,"I have other canvas shoulder bags similar to this one.  This bag is well designed and has many usefully placed pockets that make it very functional; also, the size is good for an everyday carry bag .  However, the fixed shoulder strap is narrower and thinner than my other bags.  This cheapens the overall bag and makes it feel less secure than I expected; hope it doesn't break over time."
4.0,"Don't be fooled by the chain shown, it is not gold (or even gold plated).<br />I don't know what it is but it's ugly. Will be replacing it. Can't complain for the price though."
4.0,"But this goes great worth my new vintage suits! Wasn't crushed or anything in transit, I adore this cute new hat!"
4.0,"It is very cute and vibrant. The skirt is very stiff and feels like plastic. I'm still going to use it, hoping it still fits her the day of her party."
4.0,"My daughter likes the style and unicorns a lot, but this suit is not really practical: it is see through on the bottom - each time she goes in the water she has to wear white underware underneath so nothing shows. Sparkles were washed off after first gentle wash.<br />I probably should have given it 2 or 3 stars but my daughter likes the design a lot, so extra stars for the cuteness.<br />It is true to size, my girl is almost 5, ordered size 110 and it fits her great."
4.0,Came fast and are really cute
4.0,Simple shirt that is great for the price.  Very happy.
4.0,Arrived on time and look great.
4.0,"I had been reviewing Dooney & Burke wallets on Amazon but found what my wife and I were looking for in this wallet from Itslife. I didn't realize that I bought a brand I did not know until later. We are very pleased with this wallet and happy, too, with Amazon's price. We had been unable to find what we wanted in Macy's or other local department stores."
4.0,"Soft fabric, a bit small in the tummy area, but will keep it due to the fact it has stretch in the material."
4.0,"Nice spring / fall jacket.Very comfortable material.  Must be made overseas, my regular size is snug across the chest and back - as with most foreign made men's clothes order up a size."
4.0,I found these work better when I simply wrap the plastic around the inside edge of my rings.  They last a whole lot longer and you don't have to try to keep the band under your ring.
4.0,"This is probably one of the best nato's I have ever owned. It is perfectly balanced between being thin and flexible without feeling flimsy or cheap, making it very comfortable to wear. It looks awesome and I also really like the finish on the buckle/rings. That being said, at $17, this is the most expensive nato i've ever purchased. However if you're willing to pay for it, you will be very happy with this product."
4.0,Product is exactly as described. Very convenient to have separate shoe compartment.  However the bag rolls over when my shoes are in it because it was made to collapse when empty.  I think the bag could be improved upon if the shoe compartment holds it's structure/shape so it doesn't fall over when I lay it down.
4.0,So far I am happy with it I just got it yesterday.
4.0,"I love everything about this bag EXCEPT it has a horrible smell that will not leave! I Have tried sprays, perfumes, dryer sheets... it’s still there. It’s not bad enough that it keeps me from using it but I still get a whiff every once and a while."
4.0,Awesome case glasses are gorgeous
4.0,"VERY nice! Nose rests are a bit uncomfortable, but overall, I love them"
4.0,Wish it was better package with a cleaning cost
4.0,"They seem superior quality than they actually costs, overall happy with it."
4.0,"So I am always on a hunt for liner socks that do not fall off my heel. These are CLOSE to perfect. The material is nice, the packaging was ADORABLE (It always pleases me when companies do cute things for shipping) and it stays up when I wear my Sperry's and booties."
4.0,Comfortable but a bit small
4.0,"These earrings are very cute, but they are very fragile which is why I had to detract a star. They can be very tricky to put on, and an ear broke off when I tried to put them on the first time."
4.0,Overall great pairs for the price.
4.0,"I actually love this dress with one exception: I'm normally a size 4/6 so I went with a medium. It fits, but barely. A large probably would have been better.<br />Other than that, it looks exactly like the photo and is super flattering, albeit a bit snug. Considering buying others in a larger size."
4.0,Material seems too “new”. May just need to wash a few times to break in
4.0,I haven’t had the time to answer these questions. We’re bought for gift!
4.0,Beard cape
4.0,These are great. Always wanted a pair of black hoop earrings.
4.0,"Well packaged,well made and it's beautiful"
4.0,Nice size. Looks good
4.0,"No me agradó la calidad de los impresos, son de algún plástico, que hace que se adhieran unos a otros."
4.0,Fits great and looks great. G-daughter says it gets a little hot
4.0,I've already reviewed this nothing else 2 say
4.0,I liked the bamboo case more than the american flag zipper one I received.  Glasses fit great and I love them!
4.0,"It works great, and came in a timely manner. It's slightly larger than I expected, but I haven't owned an actually watch in a long while. It displays the time and date effectively. Lastly, it's easy to setup. Just remember to read the instructions and don't assume how to do it. My honest rating is a 4.5, as I've only been using it for about a two weeks."
4.0,"I really like this dress, but when you are a size 44G in the chest area, you do not get an A-Line silhouette  with the 2x size dress. In fact the dress cinches right under my bust. The dress is still cute but if you are well endowed in the chest area, just know you might not get that A-Line fit."
4.0,"The belt feels very nice, and seems to be working great. I've only had it for a couple weeks. Some reviews mentioned durability concerns; we will see."
4.0,"I love these underwear, they arrived earlier as expected the only thing negative that I would say is they did come with a factory smell I’m assuming the smell will go away when I wash them but other than that I love them the underwear don’t rise up and they are very comfortable."
4.0,"Update:  Since I wrote the review below, I have purchased a different Reyn Spooner shirt, so I guess that says it all.<br />This shirt is incredibly comfortable, so much so that it could actually be used as sleepwear and work as well or better than a pyjama top.  The 55/45 Cotton/Polyester blend cloth, even new feels soft and buttery and yet robust.  When worn it drapes across one's shoulders and conforms to the body and yet feels loose on the body.  It's an excellent feeling.  The only thing that may become an issue is the tags which appear to be entirely polyester and may make a sensitive neck wish they were removed, but that is a personal preference that will only make itself apparent with wear.  The collar is an oxford style with button down collars, including a third button in back to keep the collar from rolling and getting bent out of shape and the buttons themselves are well-made and built to stand the test of time.<br />The pattern of this particular shirt is busy but not garish, consisting of alternating panels depicting hibiscus, the Hawaiian flag, a nene and sakura flowers.  While I'm not personally keen on the flag bit, the overall design is fine and the shirt, as stated, is unbelievably comfortable.<br />The construction of it is top notch.  Even though Made in China, the seams appear to be professionally executed with  high quality workmanship right down to a pocket that is so well-matched to the pattern of the shirt that it literally disappears.  Unfortunately, the pockets are what bring this shirt down from 5 stars to 4.  Yes, it causes the shirt to look bad when its pocket is filled to capacity by a phone, but the fact is that clothing these days need to be built to accommodate the ubiquitous cell phone.  The pocket on this shirt is alarmingly small, and while it does fit the model of phone I use (SE2020), it won't fit the mongo phones most people walk around with.  Also, there is only one pocket.  One pocket is one too few.  Every shirt that is not a pull over, that has a chest pocket needs two.<br />I really, really like this shirt and, if the company makes shirts with two pockets I am almost certainly a buyer of others.<br />This shirt is highly recommended with the caveat that it has only one pocket and needs two."
4.0,"Stay on well and, while I got these mostly for practicality, I have gotten a few compliments on them being cute."
4.0,"I typically wear 8-10 size which mostly equates to a medium.  I had to return the medium and the large because they were too tight in the chest.  I am a 34DD.  The rest of the fit was flattering.  I really like the detail of the jacket so I ordered again this time an X-Large.  This fits perfect.  It's not tight in the chest, it's fitted through the waist.  I would have given it a five star review but the sizing is deceptive."
4.0,Soft flannel material. Relatively warm. Has pockets! 32 inch inseam. True to size
4.0,These are pretty cool. They are bigger than I anticipated and kind of heavy to wear all day.
4.0,Super cute and she loves them!
4.0,"Love the shirt and after reading reviews , I went ahead and ordered one size larger than I normally wear, I should have ordered 2 sizes up. The shirt fits snug so I gave it to my daughter"
4.0,"These accessories look exactly like what the cartoon character wears.  Gloves and amulet are very nice.  A little concerned that the septor and crown might not hold up to a child though.  Not the sturdiest, but nonetheless very nice looking."
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, the armholes are low. fits larger bust."
4.0,"Another nice top from Neon Buddha (I own 4).  Great fabric in a great color.  I'd give it 5 stars, but it's styled a bit full."
4.0,"Cute headboppers for Chanukah. Quality seems fine, but I do dislike the fact that the $4.99 sticker was left on the product when I paid $9.90.....it leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
4.0,"Picked up a nice watchband on clearance at a local leather shop for $5. Purchased this watch to put on the band and I'm very pleased with how it looks. Will not be a daily wearer, I will only be wearing when on my motorcycle."
4.0,"DC Comics Suicide Squad Harley Quinn Sport Flight Junior's Handbag has an attractive look. The charms and &#34;metal&#34; detailing are adorable. It is a little pricey for what you are getting, there are no pockets on the inside for cellphone or change, and the purse is largely a empty-box shapped bag. It has a weird stabilizing flap at the bottom that can be flipped up- it seems to make little sense in being there. Overall, I like the purse and it's aesthetically pleasing and goes with most outfits. This is a daily use item for me, along with the matching wallet that comes separate."
4.0,"The fit was smaller than expected,  material was good, and comfortable overall I like it well enough"
4.0,"The leg holes are to small, had irritated my groin by end of day"
4.0,Giving it a 4 because I think it’s meant for work and I’d never wear it for that. The material is really stiff. I bought these for a Halloween costume and wouldn’t wear it outside of that. Was a big hit as apart of my costume though!
4.0,I love the print I wish it were a couple of inches bigger though! Great price!
4.0,very cute bracelet
4.0,We use these when we go out. The marker that comes with EASILY washes away- so take an extra permanent. They stayed on and the kids couldn’t get them off. My daughter wears one everyday as her “watch”
4.0,It's bigger than I thought it would be but cute.
4.0,Love case and design stylelish
4.0,"Fit fine, only dislike...bra pads aren't supportive!"
4.0,This is a great little dress. Very cute. It’s somewhat broad in the waist. But I do have a skinny mini daughter. So maybe that’s it.
4.0,Leather quality is good and clasp is sturdy. The 8&#34; length is a little too short to be comfortable. I should have measured more carefully and gotten the 8.5&#34; but that's on me.
4.0,Hubby likes to lounge around in these.  A little coarse until you wash them a few times.
4.0,What I expected. Good directions.
4.0,"Pretty much as expected, color good , fit good just a good pack able rain coat but nothing spectacular."
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for my grandma- in-law. I already washed it once for her and it held up nicely. The colors are just as bright as shown in the display picture and do not fade with washing.
4.0,I did not know what to expect when I ordered....so I took a chance and got this. I was looking for a crystal choker---after spending a lazy day watching the Kardashians (I hate to admit that). This was a total Kim K inspired purchase. This item is as pictured. I have worn it out on the town a few times now and people complimented every time. I figured it would look cheaply made and look totally fake but besides being blingy/sparkly it's not bad for the price!!!! It keeps it's round form and it adjustable with a lobster claw clasp. It has yet to pinch my skin or be uncomfortable.
4.0,"These are the best liners I've bought so far. They still tend to slide off the back of my heels, but not as much as others I've purchased. They provide more coverage across the top of the foot and are comfortable in my flats as well as my sneakers."
4.0,"Great product!!!<br />I can’t wait to wear them soon so, I can show them off. One thing though....I wish they would have the senior rated and master rated wings as well. The Novice wings are very nice but for some paratroopers that are Jumpmasters the other two would be better to own."
4.0,"Great price for the product. The only reason this didn't get 4 stars is because the remote control can be tricky to use.  Otherwise, when it works... it works great."
4.0,"big help, help to remove glair"
4.0,I liked their design and color. They were just too large per the fit chart and reading unreliable reviews.  I had to return but may try a size smaller to see how they fit.
4.0,"They are smaller than the pictures suggest. The quality of the sunglasses, case, and cleaner are very good though."
4.0,I have issues with sunlight. Sometimes it can make my vision horrible. These shades are dark enough for me.  The hooks/loop in the back makes sure they do not fall off your face. Great buy.
4.0,I give it four stars because it had some  details that were very know it's able on the neck edge and shoulder design!! Materials are light weight and comfortable!!
4.0,"I bought this dress in my normal size because of the reviews saying this dress is really stretchy. I'm actually surprised that a size small is able to accomodate my 7 month baby bump. If you want this dress to be tight (which I think it should be), then definitely get one size smaller. I just can't tell if I like it enough to keep it since it will be too big for me once I have my baby."
4.0,Good sunglasses.  The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to put a clip on review mirror on them because of the thickness of the temple arms.
4.0,I like it but i got the wrong size. my apple watch is 38mm and this item is for watch 42mm.
4.0,"Quality was good, but was somewhat small in size. I would have been happy if it was true to size. No problems with the refund!<br />I would order from them again."
4.0,Great color assortment<br />If you  are over a  “C Cup size” you May find their fit a bit  Tight
4.0,Don't use with water
4.0,I have a back injury from a bad vehicle accident plus I wanted to slim my waist down and shape it . This was perfect for supporting my back throughout the day as well as slimming down in the tummy .
4.0,It will kept the sun off my face.
4.0,"I love this dress and I can’t believe the price for what you get. I am 5’11”, 175lbs with a 40DDD chest and wear a size 10 in jeans, so with numbers like that I usually have to return clothes ordered on line but I really love this. It only goes just past my knees but I would expect that. The only issue is the zipper is a piece of crap. It gets stuck just zipping it down when I’m not in it. I was going to return it because if that (what good is it if the zipper won’t zip up) but I discovered that the dress has just enough stretch that I can slide it on over my head. Anyway I’m keeping it"
4.0,"I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.  I finally got to use this travel toiletry bag this past weekend and I was pretty impressed!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Tons of pockets<br />Easy to hang up<br />The side pockets are unique and handy<br />Compact size<br />Easy to pack<br />Easy to organize<br />Casual appearance<br />Nice canvas material<br />Appears to be easy to wash<br /><br />Cons:<br />The zipper on this is a bit clunky.  Its not too bad but it is mildly frustrating.  It would be nice if the zipper closed/opened easier.<br /><br />So, overall, I would say that the organization on this is great.  I was especially impressed with the side pockets and the organization within those pockets."
4.0,"I've taken this thing out on about a dozen walks in frigid temperatures. Today's walk was 18 degrees Fahrenheit, and even though I had a power bank plugged in, like I do every day, I've only had to start it a few times at the beginning, before I get warmed up because the vest itself is thick and really warm. It has this super soft material inside and  the whole thing is comfortable. It's a little stretchy, and the zipper feels a little cheap, but just the zipper, and it's yet to stick or have any issues. The cord needs to be either a little longer or have a little bigger pockets, as the power banks I use are large and I end out sticking them in the hoodie pockets of the hoodies I wear outside of the vests, but if you have smaller power banks, this would be perfect."
4.0,"It's a very classy color combo. Usually I do one color but wanted to mix it up. It goes with everything. The gold is great. I had to return the watch because it squeaks all the time. Now I fear that all resin watches will do this. I was hearing the wrist band a lot and it was irritating so had to return. I'm also a woman with small wrists, this would be a difficult band for a man I assume."
4.0,Quick delivery.<br />Quality material.<br />Great fit.<br />Wonderful!<br /><br />Added long petticoat beneath for full effect.<br />Love the pockets
4.0,"These are very soft and cozy. I have been looking for grey mittens and decided on these after a long search. I saw that they had ""light grey"" which I did not want, so I ordered ""grey"" and unfortunately they are light grey. So that is disappointing, and I took off one star for that. Otherwise I'm sure they will be great."
4.0,"I ordered the XL based on the measuring tape/table results.  It is a bit too big.  I was expecting a much heavier hat.  It is very light.  The cooling function definitely works and it provides plenty of shade for the ears and neck.  The hat keeps its shape very well.<br /><br />So I ordered the L and it is too small.  I must have an odd head.  However, I did see where you can tug down the rear band to make the XL a bit tighter for windy days.  That works for me."
4.0,Works perfectly! My son loves it. band broke within 6 months.
4.0,I were them inside out. I like the smooth for my skin.
4.0,"5’3” 160 little to lg, and long wish I went with a Med. Quality of fabric is good, texture soft."
4.0,"These arrived quickly. They come packaged in a nice hard case and include a lens cleaning cloth. The frames feel durable and better than cheap mall kiosk sunglasses. My complaint with them is they appear feminine, both with the thick sides and also general appearance. My friends immediately commented when I was wearing them. They are also short and the ear notch sits very forward of my ears, and I don't at all have a large face by any means. The lenses are also very see-thru, not at all mirrored. The polarization seems to work well, and when you point them at an LCD screen and turn them 45-degrees the screen goes black, which leads be to believe they are decently polarized. These are decent sunglasses, I just don't they they are unisex and rather should be marketed towards woman only."
4.0,Good quality.  Masks a bit uncomfortable
4.0,"Gorgeous hat, my daughter loves it."
4.0,Cute style. Probably could have gone a size smaller.
4.0,Nice product for crafts
4.0,"The fit is good, the purple is nice. I wish they were a bit darker."
4.0,Cute tulle tutu. My daughter wore it for her Candyland birthday party.
4.0,I like this watch...but be aware...this band is very small. I have tiny wrist and this band just barely fits.
4.0,"While I love this sweater, the material is wayyyy different! It’s not quite as pictured and it’s super long, I mean really, really long. Could be cute with a belt or maybe just scrunching it up."
4.0,"I really like this dress.  It's just like the picture, beautiful pattern and cut.  It is just a little too tight around my rib cage.  The top could be just a little larger for better comfort.  I wear a 40DD (I bought the XL and planned to wear it while nursing--it does work well for this) and it fits, but it could be roomier in the top.  Overall, it's not tight enough that I sent it back, and it is flattering, but would be more comfortable with about another inch of room."
4.0,these are great for bright road runnng but once you enter the trails it becomes hard to see every root and rock. but they stay put.
4.0,Very nice product ! Great for your handy man in your life
4.0,I love this masks I give 4 starts because in the nose part at least mines don’t stay tight in the skin like the others.
4.0,"This is my first pair of compression socks, they shrink up after you've washed and dried them a couple times. I really enjoy them they're very cute got compliments on them at work."
4.0,"Love the bag in metallic gold - goes with most everything. The only downside and it's not much of one is that the &#34;bucket&#34; bag is a little deep so sometimes I have to dig for my wallet. However, the wallet is in a secure zipped area so the positive outweighs the negative. Love BMak bags - great leather."
4.0,I thought it was going to be smaller and it was bigger than I thought.
4.0,"I love this brooch, the colors are so pretty.  I give it four stars because the clasp on the back is a little loose."
4.0,"I love it! It won't really fit comfortably on anyone over a size 14 though, and as I recall, it's a one size fits all? Also, the pockets are actually very small."
4.0,My only problem with this is the lining under it was really a-linie I should get some money back for this but I know my way around the sewing machine
4.0,"We got this dress for my daughter for homecoming. It was lovely and looked great on her. Only issue we had was the day we got it, the zipper got stuck. It took a few hours to get it undone. Once we got it unstuck it worked fine, but we were worried for a little while."
4.0,Only had them a couple of days but they appear to be a very good product. The bags will get a good test this summer as the heat rises here in Northern California.
4.0,It tear down after first use
4.0,"These are nice quality leggings, plenty warm and thick and opaque.  I'm 5'9&#34;, and they are a bit long-waisted even for me.  If I sit the waist of these leggings where I want them to rest on my body, the crotch is a bit low.  They are definitely long enough too.  If you're a short gal, I would skip these.  If you are a very tall lady, these would be great."
4.0,"I have been in the market for a quality timepiece for some time now.  After flip-flopping between this beauty and the Jules Audemars Tourbillon I finally settled for this remarkable specimen.  The bottom line is I didn't become a self-made billionaire by wasting money. You see, the Jules Audemars actually would have forced me to pay $14.99 for shipping! Can you believe it, $15 for transporting such a small little item?!"
4.0,"I got this sweater in the leopard print. I actually hate leopard print things normally but this one doesn't look like the typical ones so I don't mind it at all, it actually looks not bad. This sweater is a good length and fits well. I wish it had buttons and that it was a little softer. Otherwise it's a pretty decent fall sweater that looks nice."
4.0,"I really like it, however it could do with a better looking hem."
4.0,Exactly like I imagined. Size was a little big for a small. Soft material
4.0,"It sparkles! My granddaughter loves the look. One of the stones is missing, but it’s on the side, so I kept it."
4.0,Beautiful! I love it! Hard to put in had to have a piercer rebend it to get in 😢
4.0,"This track suit is as comfortable as it is  attractive. True to size it fits perfectly. It feels great on. It permits a whole range of motion, is warm and breathable. The set I received did not have the cap. The color blocking and side stripes lend a sporty look. Nice casual set."
4.0,Showed up on time and it looks great !
4.0,"Beautiful . But unlike the name plate , the chains a little too yellow."
4.0,comfortable and light weight medical alert bracelets...water proof
4.0,"Great looking belt. The sizing is a problem though. I read the reviews and ordered the 42 size for my DH who wears a 34 pants and he ca only wear it on the smallest hole and it barely keeps his pants up. I should have gone smaller, but didn't because the reviews say the sizing is small. I would return it for a smaller one, but I threw away the return info."
4.0,Nice and practical wallet. I really like it. My only complaint is that the inner liner came undone but it is still functional and it looks good.
4.0,"Very comfortable,  I bought one size bigger than I needed according to chart.  I liked it a little tighter.  Nice padding.  Stays in place."
4.0,"I loved this skirt! I had a futuristic themed holiday party and I needed a silhouette that was unconventional yet sexy. The high waisted corset skirt was a major hit. The slit on the leg was super high but really sexy. I paired it with a neon crop top, caged bra and shiny silver gloves. Everyone thought I looked out of this world...which was the goal. As for the fit, I have big hips and I'm 5'7&#34; 210 pounds. I got the extra large ...sometimes large is good enough for me but LUCKILY I got the XL. I dont have a huge tummy at all, but there's def a little something there. It literally just fit me...2 more pounds and it would have been a wrap! Thus if you have a tummy, def go a size or two up. Anyway loved the product and will figure out how to wear it again."
4.0,"Rides up a little, have to tug it down. Thinner material than expected but not see through. Wish the bust was thicker or lined more."
4.0,"I got these as a gift for my friend studying marine biology. I was expecting poor quality because of the price, but they seem like normal enamel pins! You can see the designs clearly and the finish is nice. They're a little smaller than I expected but I'm overall pleased. Note: I know that one fell off my friend's backpack about a week after she put it on, not sure if it got knocked off or if the backing came off."
4.0,"The size is too big. There was no option given for sizes so I feel it should be small, medium and large. That would be better"
4.0,It's not the best materials and stitching but for th price it works.
4.0,"Very light plastic but overall, great for the price"
4.0,"Looks good, but runs small"
4.0,Love the dress just a tad big in the breast
4.0,Nice quality shirt. it is sized smaller than states. I usually wear an xl and this xl is tight through the torso.
4.0,Just a little flimsy.
4.0,"Lovely, but I wish it was bigger."
4.0,"I think this is cute, it’s somewhere between retro and classic. I would love a few more inches on the hem and in the pocket. (What is up with pockets, seriously!!?) I do feel a little guilt grumbling about the pockets because, they do exist (!!!) on this dress and I can fit my large phone safely in there…but they are just a smidgen less roomy than is perfect.<br /><br />*An unexpected surprise: the back is tiered! Yeah, I sure was not expecting that but it’s actually charming and gives the dress a bit of added style. Which makes it look like I could have bought it at a boutique, that’s a bonus. This may not be your bag though (tiered), so I thought buyers should know.<br /><br />It’s a medium weight cotton blend. I was disappointed that there isn’t any spandex at all but that’s on me, I should have read the description more carefully.<br /><br />[Side note: I pair this with knee length leggings [ SOCIALA Womens High Waist Biker Shorts with Pockets 12"" Workout Running Short https://a.co/d/a3jNOIl ] because I tend to be a minimalist when it comes to daily wear. Yes, I’m a fan of simple dresses for daily wear. (: The leggings I use have great pockets for keys so this combination is a winner for me on nearly every day of the week. I’m looking forward to trying this with burgundy leggings. I loved it with my cotton burgundy cardigan. Oh yes! I nearly forgot to mention: it looks fabulous with silver necklaces!]<br /><br />The sleeves are just right. That was one of my big concerns when ordering because I don’t want my arms feeling trapped in jean. If you have that as a concern mine measures at 16 inches all around at the cuff (where it hits at it’s lowest). Maybe a tiny bit smaller or bigger but approximately 16 all around. The bottom buttons came open a few times on me, I find that frustrating so I will likely put a stitch in to keep them behaving.<br /><br />I like this dress overall. I wanted the color to be a just a little darker but it’s nearly what I expected. If I knew someone who liked jeans and dresses, yes, I would recommend this. (: Hope you’re having a pleasant day. ~~"
4.0,"This is a very nice necklace with a lovely stone. It looks as pictured and is a great accent item to wear. The reason I deducted a star is that the chain isn't the sturdiest and the clasp is a bit hard to use. But as far as the look, you can't beat it for the price."
4.0,Would like to see a multi pack of each size. My daughter had to buy three different sizes when she only wanted the medium one.
4.0,The only issue is i thought they were coming with a case. The glasses were for my son for baseball and he loves them.
4.0,Not as comfy as I hoped but it does a good job.
4.0,Very nice buy too small for me
4.0,Freedom of fingers
4.0,"I heeded the advice of other purchasers and bought low on size.  Wrong move.  Wife wears a size 7.  Thought this 6.5-7 would work, but she said the shoes pinched her feet the first time she wore them for a shift of work.  I felt quite bad about causing her pain, so purchased some size 7 crocs the next day, which fit much better and helped relieve the plantar fasciitis type foot pain she had been experiencing.<br /><br />If there had been a 7-7.5 category I would have stuck with this buyer, but since the next size up was 7.5-8, obviously too large, I had to go to another merchant."
4.0,Great shirt. Stretchy material.
4.0,Nice and thick material. These socks are dope :)
4.0,"This is an unusual but beautiful piece of jewelry. In person it's gorgeous and since I've had it I've already had people requesting to look at it closer and complimenting me.<br /><br />It has a velvet background which feels really nice against the skin. The magnetic  closure is strong and I was never afraid of it breaking open or coming off my arm.<br /><br />When I opened my package , the bracelet looked small in length but I measured it  and it's seven inches long and about 1.25 inches wide. It fits me perfectly.<br /><br />The bracelet itself is made up of blue crystal rhinestones with turquoise color chips.They're really affixed strongly to the velvet. Every time I move my wrist it sparkles. I love this bracelet.<br /><br />So if I love this bracelet so much, why am I giving it four stars not five?  The smell.  I'm not even particularly sensitive to smells but when this was delivered I opened the plastic encasing and was accosted by this horrid chemical smell. It has to be the glue that's keeping the beautiful stones on the velvet.  It's just a super strong smell.  It's slowly going away but I can still smell it.  I also wish this came in a box to give as a present.<br /><br />In conclusion, its a gorgeous, original yet stinky bracelet!<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Every fitbit I've owned has had the band crap out after 12-14 months.  Decided to buy this to see if it would work as a replacement and it did.  My only complaint is the poor directions for removing links in the band to get it to fit a smaller wrist size.  Once I set the instructions aside and just used common sense, everything went smoothly.  Hoping it doesn't crap out a year from now the way FitBit bands always do."
4.0,"It is a lot shorter than I anticipated, will definitely have to wear with some tights or leggings. Material us super comfortable and forgiving!"
4.0,"Very nice quality, but I ordered a medium, I'm 5'6&#34; 150lbs, and it hugged the belly too much, so I returned it. Planning on trying the large."
4.0,"Love this dress, you must wear a slip or tights under it bc it is shear. Very comfy though. Looks perfect with a jean jacket."
4.0,"I was given a 6 pack to try for review.  I am a power lifter and wear these shirts often. My chest is 42&#34; and I weigh 190 lbs for comparison.  I ordered extra large knowing that Oriental sizing is apt to run small.  First of all, I must say the quality of the fabric was of a very high order...certainly better quality than most of the common  tank top or t-shirts I have bought in the past.  I felt the X-large shirts were a bit snug when I first put them on, but my wife thought they fit perfectly.  I wore the shirts pretty regularly, then tried a &#34;washing test&#34;. There were no laundering instructions that came with them and I was concerned they might really shrink when washed.  First my wife laundered the black shirt in the washing machine on the &#34;gentle&#34; cycle, and dried it in the dryer on a cool cycle, common for use with cotton.  The out come is as shown in the photo:  perfect. For the next &#34;test&#34; I washed the white shirt by hand in luke warm water in the bathroom sink, which i sometimes do with my workout shirts.  I hung the shirt on a regular clothes hanger in the shower to dry. I let it dry thoroughly, then put it on for photos. The white shirt photograph attached is as it dried:  perfect.  So in sum, I'd say these fit me as an extra large, very closely.  I normally would expect to wear a LARGE in western sizing, so X-large is OK, but I would prefer my shirts to be just a bit larger.  I do not believe a 2X would fit as well as the X-large. Finally, the quality of the fabric is extra good and for the price, I recommend these shirts as an OUTSTANDING VALUE."
4.0,I should have ordered up a size!! VERY tight with zero give.
4.0,Nice fit would recommend
4.0,Good. .
4.0,"I ordered 5 pairs for some friends when I had them over for a pool party. The goggles provided a wide range of vision, stayed snug on our faces, and didn't fog up in the least bit. There's no doubt the band's elasticity will hold up for a couple of years--the price and reliability of this product is perfect."
4.0,These shorts are exactly what I was looking for. The only reason they got a 4 rating instead of a 5 is that they are a couple of inches too long.
4.0,Very comfortable fit.  I would purchase again.
4.0,"I love these boots - have a pair in another color.  They are a little snug, but I am keeping them"
4.0,"So adorable and have gotten so many compliments. Just a little flimsy, I piece broke shortly into wearing for the first time. However, it wasn’t major and for the price, I’m very impressed."
4.0,Cute for lounging around and quick errands.
4.0,Runs a bit larger than expected but overall a great shirt! Kept my son from getting burned!
4.0,Great sunglasses. Blocks off the sun well. Has a more plastic feel but that’s probably due to such a low price. Nose buds fell right off after first wear even after multiple coats of glue to keep it in tact.
4.0,"I really loved this dress, I was going to wear it to a wedding but it fit a tad too big, ordered 2XL. The material is stretchy and the belt is rather cute, not removable. The sleeves are very soft and stretchy too which was my concern since I have huge arms. All in all I really did like it and I am sad that I had to return."
4.0,"Bought  as a gift,  not sure how comfy it is, had a weird smell when it arived  but other then that the quality  seems good."
4.0,They seem to be of good quality and I purchase the medium as I am a size 4 but these are very small. Almost kid size or for someone with a lot less butty than me. I normally wear small on everything and was surprised that it was so tight. They are very cute dough. They came in individual zipped bags and had a strong plastic smell that disappeared once washed. It may have been the bags or the print screen ink. I am not sure. I recommend but get a much bigger size.<br /><br />P.S. &#62;&#62; Hubs likes them.  ;)
4.0,"I like these panties, I really do. They are sexy and comfortable at the same time. But something threw me completely off. I don't believe I have a short torso but these panties pass my navel go all the way to under my boobs it's weird. It feels like a combo of panties and bra 🤣 it feels weird but it's just my opinion tho."
4.0,"This mask is GORGEOUS! The iridescent stones really make this mask captivating!<br />So Gorgeous in fact that mine came in with a few stones missing but I just HAD to send it in for a replacement (which is on the way and is the reason why this item received only 4 stars. )<br />If you’re looking for THE mask, you can stop looking here and just order this beauty."
4.0,"I returned the item, no longer needed it."
4.0,"Son hermosos,ligeros,solo que son muy claros para el sol,no cubre mucho,pero igual me encantaron."
4.0,I am using these in a raised garden bed and they have been wonderful. Can dig weeds easier & more directly. Helped with seedling replanting. Not meant for just digging holes in your yard but a wonderful addition to my gardening needs
4.0,Got them for my ex for father's day.  They must be durable because they did not melt on contact with him.
4.0,Me encanto.. Mas que se adapta al clima de invierno... Es calientita...
4.0,"Material was a little thinner than I expected, but overall, I liked the dress."
4.0,CUTE AND FUN FOR TEEN BIRTHDAY PARTY PROP
4.0,"a little cheap, comfortable, & versatile."
4.0,"I do love the bows on the back. For a Large, the sleeves are more of a Med. The body of the shirt fits as expected. I would probably go one size larger if I purchased again."
4.0,"The size runs small. I usually wear a 16-18, so I ordered an XXL, which is supposed to be a 18-20 and it's tight.  And I was expecting a standard spandex swimsuit and it feels more like the old paper suits from the nineties."
4.0,"I used to wear this ALL the time, but I’m currently in a different style phase, but I love this a lot and I think others would love it as well"
4.0,"I'm a size 16, ordered the XL, they fit well, the gray printed ones are SO COMFORTABLE and look really good on. They feel so good, I need to get more colors."
4.0,"Arrived in a timely fashion. I really want to give it an 3.5 though, it had some glue that was visible and I had to wipe off, But for 7-8$, I am not mad.  Nice necklace with a clearly visible design."
4.0,Cute ! Heavy
4.0,Nice shirt.  Quality is very good for the price.  A little bit shorter than I expected based upon the pictures.  Maybe more of a hang out shirt as it doesn’t stay in place very well during Pilates/barre/walking.  Finding myself adjusting it a lot.
4.0,"very nice, fits great!"
4.0,"Not a bad product. Everything was great. Good material, and it seems like it will last. But it was too small for me. Tight around the ears. It will hurt after a while."
4.0,"I loved the pants, they fit perfectly! Shirt was just a tad bit too small for me. I have a big chest-J cup, the top fit, but didn't come down over my bra all the way."
4.0,A bit too small. Better for kids.
4.0,"fits really good on the bottom, top is a little large. i'm 5 foot, 120 pounds. bottoms fit better because i have a big butt, but i'm a 32C on top and it was a little loose"
4.0,"The zippers needed to be waxed because they were tight, but otherwise I am liking this bag very much."
4.0,"Was so used to having an UP band around my wrist for years that, when I stopped its use, it felt like something was missing.  Tried this and it relieved the &#34;naked&#34; feeling of an UP-less wrist and looked decent as well.  The blue ought to be more of a navy, but the brown and black are perfect.  Didn't expect it, but women have noticed and liked them.  The magnetic clasp is very easy to use."
4.0,Was perfect for my daughters half birthday! Looks so cute in her pictures.
4.0,Perfect for cleaning jewelry.
4.0,"The boots are so cute, and it is soft inside and feels comfortable to touch. Only reason for 4 stars is that it doesn't look new for long, my kid wore it to park and already there r signs for wear on the tip. I am still ok with it but I dint expect the wear to come within 2-3 times of being worn. It comes to mid way between knees and ankle so I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,She loved it<br />So beautiful
4.0,"I like the product, but the Puzzle Piece Ribbon keeps separating from the key-chain. I used some solder to seal it up to keep it together and now I love it.<br /><br />&#34;Normal is a setting on a washing machine&#34;"
4.0,I wear a 38G and these were still just a bit bigger than I would have liked.  I ordered an XL and they were perfect.
4.0,Very soft. Zipper a little off.
4.0,It's very cute.  A little big for my 9mo but she's got a small head
4.0,"Love it, only thing I disliked about them was that they hurt if you messed with it too much. It stopped happening after a month of messing with it too much."
4.0,Vibrant colors and decent quality. Hope it protects my brand new luggage.
4.0,I love the necklace but it was broke when it arrived.
4.0,"I love it a lot.  It's very cute and looks like a real peanut.  The only thing I dont like, reason for four stats, is it took me awhile to untangle the delicate chain.  I got so annoyed, I tried to break the chain so I could get the pendant off to put it on a silver chain I already have.  Couldn't break the chain, so that means it's sturdy. :)  More care in packaging the chain would be ideal, but it may not be possible."
4.0,"I've only used it for a few days now, so can't comment on durability, but certainly a cute, well made product. The price was right too. No complaints so far - would recommend."
4.0,Very nice necklace set.  I bought two sets from Moochi and two sets from Ever Faith.  Trying to decide which necklace set to wear as Mother-of-the-Bride in 3 weeks.  This set is nice and well-made.  I gave it 4 stars because it is less elegant and wouldn't pass as real although it is still very attractive.
4.0,These broke within a week of me receiving them.<br /><br />Update: Seller responded to me quickly and sent a replacement pair that work well.
4.0,I love this hat!  But I love everything star wars the next one is gonna be more colorful.
4.0,Bigger than what I thought. Have bought in this size before (80) and had no problem.. Just gotta wait a few more months for my daughter to be able to wear it. No big deal.
4.0,"Just as pictured, pretty colors!"
4.0,I used this as a secondary wedding outfit to walk the Vegas strip in. It fit perfectly it was a bit thin/see thru. I purchased it for that reason as Vegas in July is HOT. I wore nude undergarments and you couldn’t see them.
4.0,"The material is a little thicker like sweater-y, not completely &#34;athletic&#34; but the compression is very good and they are doing the job.  Customer service is great and very helpful.  I would definitely recommend."
4.0,The pattern and quality and length is nice. It is for summer
4.0,Love the colors fit is a little smaller than some mediums and seems to feel great on my triplet 11-year-old boys
4.0,"I bought this to wear with my glasses. All other masks I have fog up by glasses. This is not perfect for fogging, but much better.<br />Fits well, and is nice and light, but still offers enough protection. At least I think..."
4.0,"If I can just have another clip (not the black connectors, but the silver clip that holds the pieces together, I would be totally satisfied."
4.0,Very pretty shoe.  Velcro closure... High narrow wedge heel!
4.0,Good product nice price
4.0,"I bought this bra with the intention of wearing it under scrubs for hospital shifts and for medium intensity exercise at the gym.<br /><br />PROS: I loved the fabric and the compression it gave. The pads weren’t annoying at all! And it seems to be very good quality.<br /><br />CONS: The straps were just too long and I think the bad was just a smidge too big. For reference, I ordered the XL. I’m 5’4, 155 lbs, and my bra size is a 34J in US sizes (using the abrathatfits calculator). The was enough room in the bra for my breast tissue, however, the band was just a bit too big. If I sized down to the L to get shorter straps and a tighter band, there most likely wouldn’t be enough room in the cups. I considered keeping it even though it wasn’t a perfect fit because it was alright and I need new sports bras, but I figured that for $38 I’d rather just put that chunk of change towards getting another shefit bra (expensive but at least I know they’ll fit perfectly).<br /><br />I’d recommend this bra because it was great quality and comfy, however, I’d say only purchase it if you’re able to return it. Every body is different so you never know!"
4.0,This is a go to on a bad hair day.  I will make good use of it during the winter months.
4.0,Es de buena calidad y bonito pero me quedo chico
4.0,Great addition to Halloween costume.
4.0,"Love Qalo rings for their durability and love that it's a wide enough band to not twist while putting it on. Perfect for any workout with weights or just to replace a fancy ring. The width keeps some sweat on my finger for long periods of time and I'll have a small reaction on my hand if I wear for multiple days without taking off, only downside for myself."
4.0,it is wondful
4.0,"This dress is adorable! The top/straps are wide enough that I can wear it to work. I'm 5'5"" and the skirt hits me at the knees. The only suggestion I have is to make the material on the top a bit thicker because it is somewhat see through so I had to wear a tank under it."
4.0,"Really cute, worth what I payed. Love the L shape, they never fall out! I wish the designs on the studs were a little bigger, but still definitely worth it"
4.0,Really cute. Bigger then expected but adjusts very easily.
4.0,My sister first purchased a Dexbaby bib when my nephew was born 14 years ago. My mom still has that bib at her house and uses it for my kiddos years later. I have purchased quite a few Dexbaby bibs throughout the years of having babies and I continue to purchase them as babygifts for new parents. I even got some for the kiddos at the babysitter's house and she has switched to only using this brand becaude of durability and ease of cleaning.
4.0,These are great socks but were too small for my 3 year old. I bought the 1-3 year old size. He wears a size 6 shoe. Going to try the larger size as I really do love these socks otherwise!
4.0,Very pretty I like them a lot they have a settle sparkle to them and match one of my necklaces perfectly
4.0,The clasp is difficult to open all the way. The charm is stamp like rather than solid charm. It is still beautiful and perfect for what I was looking for.
4.0,"Nice quality, just glad I ordered a large instead of my normal medium because they run small."
4.0,"Luckily I read the reviews first. This looks great, its comfy, and definitely plus ultra!<br />However, usually I'm an XL and as advised by the reviews I went up to a 3XL<br />The 3XL fits perfect in the chest/arms./shoulders but the waist/around the hips is a bit snug<br />Make sure you go up 2 sizes from where you think you should be,<br />I would also not recommend putting this garment in the dryer"
4.0,My uke strap worked as expected. I would have liked the strap to be just a bit longer; but it works and was inexpensive.
4.0,I should have known better than ordering when the size range is so broad.  fit is more like a 1-2.  Not a 13-4.
4.0,I really like them...I got them because I like the look but I'm too scared to get the real thing...I only gave it 4 stars cause they are a little big...I can get it to where they fit the way I like but I wish they would just fit without me having to do the extra work to get it to fit because even still it falls down and looks big
4.0,Material is pretty but a little thin. It leaves lint everywhere. But it’s good for the price.
4.0,took off a star because I can imagine it would be really hard to fit on some body types. Tight around my thighs and baggy in the back. The fabric is really soft though and the color is on 10.
4.0,Yah there good but within a week of use the arms start to wiggle around and the hinges ware out fast but hey for the price there what they promised they float there polarized soo there a good fishing pair. Would recommend
4.0,"This dress fit me perfectly and hugs my curves in the right places without being too revealing. The fabric is very soft and surprisingly durable for the price and weight. I plan to buy several more in different colors, because the style is so versatile and comfortable."
4.0,"It was slightly big but I can work with it, othee than that it's lovely"
4.0,Very cute. Runs short so be aware.
4.0,I only wish the clasp was offset so the necklace would hang like in the picture. The clasp has to be off center in the back to get the look like in the picture.
4.0,Great look. Metallic color Fades quickly though. Good for about two or three wears. Not bad for the price though. Would purchase again. Got many compliments
4.0,Comes way better looking than the picture. Really like this.
4.0,"The photo shows a ribbon at bust level, but there isn't one.  Even so, this makes a nice slip for a short dress. The 1x-2x is a bit large if your xl or 1x sized."
4.0,"VERY NICE, SOFT"
4.0,"I love love love this scarf! It's not as long as the one in the picture, but still so cute!"
4.0,"Not super heavy duty fabric, but fun for light wear. The design is cute and the color was true to the pic."
4.0,"The watch fs2906 doesnt have the dial as advertised in the picture. The actual color is shown on the Fossil website [...]. The actual color is not bad either, however the one shown wrongly on amazon.com is more impressive. Amazon should represent the real color and not a wrong one.<br /><br />I had to spend $[...] to get the links of the band removed as the watch was too big for my wrist. Overall, the looks of the watch are good and is a nice buy. The watch shines real good in light and the chain is made of stainless steel. The small inner hours are carefully designed and the watch is heavier than most of the watches.<br /><br />My rating is 4/5"
4.0,Nice shirt. Fits well
4.0,Neck is larger than expected
4.0,"too basic, and somehow slow to display"
4.0,Very comfortable and good fit. Great travel slippers.
4.0,"Quick delivery - thank you! They looked more ivory in the picture, but in fact are stark white...which works fine, but was just expecting a more natural pearl (ivory/off white) color."
4.0,I like how thin these are. I have small hands so the thick bands are a little too big. I don't stack them though I just wear one at a time. The only negative is that the black one kind of looks like a gasket.
4.0,I was worried that these wouldn’t fit in normal pierced ears that are not gauged but they do. I’m only giving them a 4 because I’m not convinced that they would stay latched so I put a drip of glue. Other than that they are perfect.
4.0,gorgeous!!!!
4.0,"Loved the blouse, and size I ordered was okay except around the belly area it fit a bit tight. Service was good."
4.0,The pants are a really good fit but tend to loose their color and seem to wear out very quickly for what you are paying.
4.0,"They are really soft and furry.  Def warm.  A bit bulky, but does the job!  It was worth the buy for 2 of them."
4.0,I really like these but one of the rubber holders came broke and one broke after being on my glasses for 2 weeks.
4.0,"I must say, I love the way this quarter zip looks and fits! It is an awesome design that will look great on a casual night out or at the golf course for a sporty look on colder days. One downside is that the inside material is slightly rougher than I expected. I would definitely recommend wearing an undershirt as it can feel on the itchier side. But if your skin is not sensitive to materials at all, this is a fantastic quarter zip!"
4.0,"Soft material, pretty comfy.  somewhat on the short side for the legs. Overall good buy"
4.0,Really nice piece for the price.  I told my friends about it....
4.0,"This cardigan is very soft and feels a bit like I am wearing a baby blanket. It comes in a shrink-wrapped bag compacted very small. When it comes out of the bag, it is somewhat wrinkled. The texture is exactly like the product description photo.<br /><br />I am only 5’ tall and the size small fits perfectly, except that the sleeves are too long for me and it appears a lot more “boxy” on me than it does on the model in the product description. The product description photo looks very elongated to me, making the cardigan (on the model) appear “slimming”—but it is not.<br /><br />The pale pink color is attractive. The sweater is bulkier than a blazer or regular cardigan but less bulky than most coats.  It will be great for a cool autumn or spring day but not heavy enough for winter. I am looking forward to wearing this in cooler weather.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking “helpful”. Thanks!"
4.0,It is very long... much too long for 5'7&#34; me.<br />The edge stitching leaves much to be desired and likely as in other reviews with washing will fray.
4.0,"I love the vibrant color of these sweaters. They are soft and well made.  I brought two, one for my 8 year old (60lbs) and one for my 3 year old (36lbs). My 8 year old’s sweater just fit. I thought for sure it’d be too small when I took it out the package but it had great stretch. This will, however, be the only Christmas he will be able to wear it. My 3 year old’s sweater was a little big but I didn’t mind. It was still super cute and he should still be able to get in it next year. I’d definitely buy these again. They’re a great quality sweater with an inexpensive cost."
4.0,Great shirt.  Got it sooner than expected.
4.0,Cute design and easy to wear. The adjustment loops are veryhelpful.
4.0,Two of the three colors fit exactly as expected. The blue seems to be a bit smaller and rides up.
4.0,ajustado de pierna
4.0,Some zippers stick a little so it's annoying but otherwise nice with pockets. I take a diaper wipes and snack. So doubles as a mini diaper bag for me!
4.0,"Beautiful, to small. Don't represent the size requested."
4.0,The dress itself was great but the tutu came torn
4.0,"I really like the length of the chain and the style. The packaging was great. I have received a number of compliments.  Tiny suggestion, include graphic of how to open to insert the Flex2."
4.0,"I ordered these PJs as part of a birthday present for a little girl who LOVES Minnie Mouse, and they were a hit. I wasn't overly impressed with the quality, and really wish the material was softer, but overall a fun gift."
4.0,Its a pretty color .
4.0,Very good quality just was a bit snug
4.0,Soy de cabeza grande me quedo muy bien
4.0,"I bought it for the wife and she loves it.  For myself, I would have liked for it to have been at least half-again as big.  But, it is fine as is."
4.0,"It's a pretty bracelet, It's a bit large, I will have to adjust."
4.0,I have never had any glasses like this before so I have no idea if they actually work. I couldnt tell a difference when looking at a computer screen.
4.0,Very nice looking earrings.  Nice sterling silver too. They came with a certificate.  Wife loves.
4.0,The tip is a little flimsy but seems to work just fine. They may not hold up as well as the more sturdy ones over time but for the price I think they are great!
4.0,"Nice fabric, but a bit too hard to breath in and hot to wear. I wish they were only 2 layers."
4.0,I am normally a XL US size. I ordered a 2XL thinking it was going to need to be bigger. It was huge! I am 5’9” 200 lbs. I had to go with a large. The length was still above the thigh which I like. I don’t like dresses really short.
4.0,"the fabric is nice and smooth. there is 2 layers, with an inner lining which i like.<br />however, the size is not true.<br />the XXL fits like an XL. it fits, but the bodice is tight, the neckline is high and the waist is more at ""empire"" level than waist level.<br />if you order this, you should size up. if you normally wear xxl, give this one a pass.<br />the model in the photo must be really petite, because it looks big on her. . ."
4.0,"I was a little disappointed in the size of the frame. One review said they wished they were a tad more narrow, so I thought they would be wide. The frame covers my eyes, but do not go totally across my face. The lenses is very dark. I haven’t worn them driving yet, but I am sure they will help me see a little better while driving"
4.0,Very comfortable. Was a little longer than expected but looked great!
4.0,"This is a wonderful summer frock. I tried it on and was surprised. ...it fit !!!!!  I am about a size 16 or 18 .  The only reason that I didnt give this dress 5 stars is that it's not really high end fabric, but for the price, well I'm very happy. It is not see-through."
4.0,"simple, looks good and holds glasses well.  What more could you want?"
4.0,"I like that it’s super warm but it’s super big, I wish the came in different sizes."
4.0,A little slim fitting. But good quality. Used for a Revenge of the Nerds Costume. Worked great!
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture and is everything described. Shipping was quick.
4.0,bigger than I expected. More like a book bag.  I will definitely get use out of it but It was not what I was going for. So if you looking for something more purse like I dont think this is what youd expect. The quality is great and I received it quick.
4.0,"Bought this in blue and pink for my wife. She is tiny, 5'4 and 94 lbs, it fit her well. Good buy!"
4.0,"Ordered for my wife and she was glad she said to order up a size.  It is very fitted but comfortable, light weight and has a silky feel to it."
4.0,"These are great, but they’re more of a gray color than black."
4.0,On me of the best Bandana. I was thinking this will get damage after couple washes because most of the other bandanas are damaged. I am wearing this continously everyday from about 3 weeks and I love it. I don't know why it says that it's men because I enjoy wearing it. It is breatherable and doesn't slip down my face.
4.0,These barbells were good quality metal. But they turned colors fairly quickly. Definitely not for daily use but a couple of days at a time they will be fine
4.0,"I wear large for my size but for this pant i took xl but still so small on me, like a tight pants for XL. I think i have to go for XXL for this pants. Sizes are not good"
4.0,"I like the style, it was a bit larger than I anticipated but a nice design and cute.  The material is very very think and see through... I figured waffle-weave would be a bit heavier but thinner than a t-shirt.  Another one that will need a tank or camisole underneath.  Again it'll look nice with leggings."
4.0,GOOD DEAL
4.0,value product
4.0,So cute and well made. The little girl I gave it to loves it.  The chain coul be a little sturdier.
4.0,"Finely detailed, substantial, looks like solid gold.  The contrast of the gold with silver charms on my Pandora bracelet is stunning.  I have only worn the charm once, so I don't know how the finish will hold up, hence the four star rating.  But it looks amazing right alongside authentic pandora charms.  I will purchase from Everbling again.  Timely, delivery well packaged item, great quality and good pricing."
4.0,"it looked great and I wish it had fit, I did not bother returning the product because I opened it."
4.0,Good quality jewelry  better than I expected
4.0,"so far working well, fits quit a few cars and no current issues with the clasp"
4.0,I like Russell products and am satisfied with the sweat shirt.
4.0,It's the correct size and looks nice and is comfortable to wear. One of the stones fell out though. Luckily it fell off right in ny hand and I managed to fix it by using clear nail polish as glue.
4.0,Obsessed with the color. The fit was okay. Gotta wear the right undies or you’ll get the toe
4.0,I buy it's for my family funny and nice me and my mom order M for man is L big order down one size plz
4.0,I love love love the blue floral print! Wish other diaper bag brands carried more aesthetic prints. I knew I might not like the lack of water bottle pockets on the outside...it does contribute to a sleeker look...though it’s nice to have two designated places to put our bottles inside - a 24oz Starbucks bottle and a toddler Contigo. It was surprisingly still spacious with our bottles inside. I ended up returning and going for the JuJuBe Be Right Back because I have a baby on the way and will still need more space. I also like have a mommy pocket/more pockets overall. This would be great for the toddler stage in my opinion when you feel like you’re carrying less around for your kiddos.
4.0,It was very thin I couldn't use it on what I needed but I'll find another price of jewelry to use it.
4.0,feels cheap but i still get compliments
4.0,"I first ordered the blue one and the size fits just right. I am 5'1 and 99 lbs and I ordered size 4. Then I ordered the black one with the same size. There's inconsistency with the sizing. The black one feels tighter around the arms and the body. When I compared them side by side, it's obvious that the black one is smaller than the blue one even though they're both a size 4. The lace on both is beautiful and very classy. It's soft and it has lining that isn't necessarily see through unlike the other asian clothes they sell here. It looks great in an A line skirt."
4.0,"I LOVE this long, &#34;waterfall&#34; cardigan!! It's soft, smooth and has high quality construction. I also love that it's not too thick, so I can wear it all year long. The only disappointment is how long I had to wait for its arrival. HINT: buy early!"
4.0,Nice and warm.  I have a rather small head but it fit rather well.  Kept me warm during recent subzero weather.
4.0,Going out with a couple friends
4.0,It is a nice outfit but you would not want to wear it for a while
4.0,So far so good. Only problem is winding - the small knob is difficult to grip and it hurts my fingers to wind. Otherwise it seems to keep good time and is very good looking.
4.0,"I really like this choker, it was snug when i first got it but its real leather with some kinda of velvet lining inside but I lightly stretched with my hands and fits nicely now."
4.0,Shipping was late but bands work good
4.0,I like that the belts have holes/slots all around so you can change the fit of the belt to match you are wearing whether pants or skirts.  I don't know how long they will hold up due to being a little flimsy/cheaply made.
4.0,Good product. Zippers are a good feature allows me to loosen without taking them off.
4.0,Love this pants!!!
4.0,"I needed a really big wallet, and this fit the bill. I like to carry extra keys with me so I don't get locked out, and the closing pocket is perfect. I also like the zipper pocket on the outside to keep important papers and and things. The only problem I had was the man latch that closes the wallet broke and no longer works. Other than that, its a well made wallet"
4.0,Needed this due to constantly out with a mask on and would have to keep taking my glasses off and wiping them... this works really well... just have to make sure not to completely wipe it out after spraying which i noticed keeps the effectiveness longer.  Always keep it in my baseball bag =)
4.0,"I was actually really surprised by this dress. For $9.99 I was expecting it to be cheap and irregular or who knows! But it’s actually super cute and fits true to size. The material isn’t anything super high quality but for the price! It’s flattering and light. Perfect for summer! I got a size small, the yellow with little white flowers and the colors look just like the amazon pictures."
4.0,Still a little on the long side for my 5’3”
4.0,I wore this for Halloween and it held up fabulously. It's very comfortable and not itchy. I did have to pin the bangs back and cut some of the length. The bottom 6 inches or so felt to be annoyingly long for me. The color is beautiful and I would recommend this wig to others.
4.0,"Pretty costume jewelry.  Gem is plastic, but that is what I expected for the price.  The choker fits, but just barely.  I would have liked the chain to be longer."
4.0,"Excellent product for the money. High grade stainless with solid end links fits my SKX007 perfectly. The bracelet really feels similar to the Rolex oyster but I can feel the difference in the finish, most notably the clasp. The clasp works great and is very secure. It does have edges that seem a bit sharp but overall a great band for the money."
4.0,"First, these boots are absolutely beautiful. I thought the buckle would give off too much of an equestrian vibe but it really just adds a timeless, stylish look. These are very sleek and seem to be pretty durable. My complaints here are that they are on the narrow side - not horrible but enough to be a bit uncomfortable for the first couple wears. Second, the glue from the sole to the upper body is visible all the way around the shoe. You likely wouldn’t notice from a distance, but it’s noticeable up close. Just something to keep in mind if that will bother you. Overall, I love these. Like any chelsea boot, it’s not fun getting them on and off at first and takes some breaking in. Be patient with them and they’ll fit once you make it past that barrier so long as width isn’t an issue."
4.0,Very well made. Just beware run very small. Bought a 12/14 for my 11 year old son for extra room. Maybe a 8 year old they would fit.
4.0,"I missed the part of manually assembling the party hats.  Not a big deal, but a bit cumbersome."
4.0,"When I bought these, I was hoping for those vintage track pants that I couldnt seem to find anywhere. Lets just say that these pants dont meet those requirements, but they do meet the ones as advertised. If you want a more oversized look as I was going for, Id recommend sizing up (esp since these are boys pants). The material is pretty warm and soft which was nice but not what I personally was wanting (I wanted more nylon material).<br />Although these werent the exact style I was hoping, you can still style them to a pretty cool streetwear fit and still looks good:)"
4.0,I bought this as a present for my granddaughter. She picked it out. Haven't given it to her yet. I can't speak to the quality as of now
4.0,"I returned it. It’s pretty but it was a little thin so being tight in the chest was an issue for me because it got a little see-through when stretched. It was also a bit too long for me, but I’m 5’1” so that won’t likely be an issue for most people."
4.0,Cute.Nice quality necklace for a good price.
4.0,kinda cheap so was price works well though.
4.0,Cute necklace for the price. Very lightweight as the stones are plastic.  Great colors for fall with casual outfits. Fast shipping although there is not sufficient packing and another necklace enclosed arrived broken.
4.0,"Fit my daughter just right, but we thought it was covered in the back like the picture and it wasn't. She had to use a jacket for her school dance."
4.0,Pretty dress but was a little large
4.0,My daughter loves the color!! would buy again!!
4.0,I really like the compact design and the ability to hold six cards.  Looks great
4.0,"This bracelet is very nice and of good quality.  The pearls are good size and really look nice  My only gripe is the clasp is hard to manage (when hooking on).  It's a lobster claw clasp, but for some reason it seems stiff so it's hard to open and close.  Other than that I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"Very nice shirt. My husband loved it, but after the first wash the crystal at the top fell off."
4.0,"The dress is gorgeous!  Perfect for NYE.  It did come wrinkled as some other reviewers mentioned, but they description says to get it pressed, so I did.  It is very tight, but that was kind of the goal.  Get seamless shapewear if you're concerned about rolls (anything with boning will likely show  through).  It was a little smaller in the bust area than planned, so you may want to consider going up a size if you have a larger chest.  The dress is a knee length with a slit in the back, nothing trashy.  Overall, the dress was a success, but I could have possibly gone up a size."
4.0,"Purchased this to look good on a Friday night concert. While this over the knee heel made be look bomb. Sometimes the over the knee part slides down. Though not all the way down past to my knees, but this is due to movement and all. I picked the grey ones with the pink glass just cuz-those look cute. They grey is a light grey not a dark grey.<br /><br />If you like to move a lot make sure to get some tape so it won't cause friction against your thighs."
4.0,"It looks good and size is appropriate but the inner layer when breathing in, gets stuck to the nostrils making it hard to breath."
4.0,"I like the glasses,but not too bright,but you can still see them,good price."
4.0,"I bough these bc I thought they were super random and different. They are really small and light weight, which is really nice. They are an inexpensive, unique piece of jewelry that I’m glad I have in my collection!"
4.0,A little small but still super cute!!
4.0,These frames are great!
4.0,Bonitas gafas polarizadas. Sientan muy bien.
4.0,"I had to exchange for a smaller size, however the company was very responsive/easy to work with. The suit is seriously NEON pink - like surveyors paint. The fabric is good quality, the underwires are sturdy."
4.0,"Beautiful deep navy blue, soft knitted shawl/scarf with sleeves.  Just need to figure out who many ways I can wear it!  I’m getting at least one more."
4.0,I like the one that I got
4.0,"Material is so soft . It does fit a little tight, but still comfortable."
4.0,"This is a gorgeous and very elegant dress that I've received many compliments on. The material is a little thick but the advantage is that it doesn't show every possible flaw. The only other strange thing with the fit is how the arm bands don't fit well and slip down along with the bodice for the dress. Have had to have the arm bands and bodice tightened. Still working on finding the right bra to wear underneath. If it weren't for this flaw, I would give it 5 stars. Gorgeous and elegant dress."
4.0,"Good, easy to put on and off, no to cold when wet , breathing material. Overall good product."
4.0,The jeggings definitely run small so I bought a large (I am about 8-10 in Women's jeans). They will be perfect for my Halloween costume and after!
4.0,"The bib part of the necklace is great!  The only complaint I have is that the chain has some black discoloration in spots where the links connect. It's not tarnished but looks like the silver coating may have chipped off.  I'm sure there are better affordable metals to use for the chain that will not have that problem. I'm keeping it because I really love it otherwise. If the chain issue gets to be more noticeable over time, I may head to a craft store to find replacements for them."
4.0,"Nicely made shoes, but the size 10 is a bit small, hopefully it will stretch!"
4.0,"Fits well, I got the pink very pretty"
4.0,"Bought this shirt and hoped for the best. Was very surprised when it arrived. The fabric is nice and soft, thicker and better quality than I expected."
4.0,Hat is on the small frame side... ended up giving to my wife because it looked tiny on my head.
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable, though I was concerned about the size upon arrival because there was no description. I hope it stands up the ware and tear better than my last belts!"
4.0,"This is an interesting product. It works as advertised. It creates a constant flow of air, making it easy to breathe through the mask. It comes with two replaceable filters. I would say that it works well for protecting the user from foreign particles. I can't speak to its effectiveness with respect to bacteria or viruses. It has a one-way valve for exhalation. That feature, while keeping the breathing cool, makes it unsuitable as a mask for COVID-19 purposes. The primary purpose for the mask mandate is to protect others and this mask doesn't do that. Also, I have a large face and the fit is a bit awkward but it does work."
4.0,"Not as good as my Florsheim belt but it's also 80% cheaper! The leather is ever so slightly on the thin side, the lining is slick, and the leather is less pliable/not as soft as other belts I have."
4.0,Love that they are seamless my toes are so sensitive that even a seam hurts them!
4.0,"Pros:<br />It is a nice looking metal band.<br />Matches perfectly to the color on the 20mm PTR<br />The clip for the band latches/unlatches easily<br />Doesn't snag on arm hair too much (but it snags more than the Pebble Steel band)<br />The band is compatible with the quick release springs<br /><br />Cons:<br />It doesn't feel as solid as I expected it to (this was the deciding factor for the 4 star rather than 5)<br />The links are a challenge to remove (I suppose this is also a good thing as it would be bad if the links just fell off during regular use)<br />Doesn't come with quick release springs<br /><br />Overall, I feel like this band was worth $15 or so dollars that I spent on it. I've only had it for a day now so I can't comment on whether it's durability is any good."
4.0,"Despite it being larger than I expected, this dress was fab! I got compliments ALLLLLLL day and night on Halloween! The material was a bit spandex-y, but I still liked it. I would def buy again!"
4.0,I don’t think the darkest one looks like pic but it’s still a nice color. They seem to fit differently depending on the color. They’re lightweight for weird spring weather.
4.0,"I really sweat in the summer and these work great.  Put one on and s it becomes soaked, just put another one on.  Very absorbent."
4.0,"I tried on several poodle skirts for a 50s party but they made me look huge and frumpy. This fun outfit is perfect! I'm a size 16 so the skirt is pretty short, but I added a petticoat underneath and it looks cute. I will be very comfortable in this outfit for our party next weekend."
4.0,"I wanted to try this dress because of the interesting rounded hem. It's actually nice. It kind of creates a breeze as you're walking. The fabric has a hint of stretch. The dress is unlined, but it's not sheer. There are pockets to add to the overall wearability. The fit is true to size. The smocked top makes this dress flattering on most shapes and sizes.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier."
4.0,"Love this jumper, it is so cute!! It does run really small though. My daughter is 1 year old and 25 lbs, I bought the 4-5T and it fit her just right with some room to spare. Other than that it was a good buy."
4.0,The dress looks like the picture and fits great.  It's very nice.
4.0,"Pants are cute, but they don’t look good on me, however they are made well. For the right person, they would be vert attractive.<br />Always fast shipping and excellent customer service."
4.0,"I like it is very comfortable, if you want to spend the day and even sleep it's perfect, but sometimes you can not wear it with any type of clothing."
4.0,The shirt is very good quality and looks very nice.  However it is very tight and fits small.
4.0,"For the price, can't complain."
4.0,"Totally cute. Lightweight. Would have liked the posts to be a little more sturdy, but so far so good!"
4.0,The piece fit and renewed an led watch.
4.0,It was absolutely loved as a gift however it comes with the necklace and a small purple light but no instructions. We have no idea what the light is used for nor how to get it to glow in the dark. However it still was an absolute hit with the intended recipient.
4.0,Needs more zipper pouches inside or outside.
4.0,We bought this outfit for Christmas pictures and it fit true to size. Outfit is absolutely adorable and pairs nicely with either red or black tights. Skirt was a little wrinkled but I hung it up in a steamy bathroom and most wrinkles went away. Our daughter absolutely loved the hair piece which wraps and ties not a typical headband (good thing)
4.0,For the price they're perfect! Just what I needed. Wouldn't pay more though as others are asking. This seller is spot on with the cost.
4.0,Beautiful and unique I love it!!! It’s a bit tight in chest if large breasted but I’ll keep because it’s good quality and I love it. The fabric is awesome
4.0,"I like the material of this product, I should have ordered a size larger as it is not loose on me.  I ordered 2x, and  I am 5'1"" and 200 lbs."
4.0,"It is so soft, when i ordered it said xs, but when it arrived the packaging said small. I am 5'4, and 130 pounds, it fits nicely, but not as slouchy as the picture shown, but similar. Its perfect for days when you want to look cute but not wear something so fitted but still feel attractive at the same time."
4.0,"Super thin, but not see through. Fit perfect"
4.0,they fit fine and seem true to size. Don’t smash anything down and are comfortable. Wish I had noticed that the grey bra one of the cups was sewn on the side not on the actual boob. Was and still unable to wear the grey sports bra. The other one is seen fine and hold everything in place.
4.0,"Unlike some reviewers, I paid for my sunglasses!  My evaluation is only based upon a few uses so I can't address their long term durability, etc.  However, these sunglasses are exceptionally light and comfortable.  I have a relatively large head but they are not too tight above the ears and they don't slide on my slippery nose, which is rare.  In my opinion they leave too large a gap between the lower lens edge and my cheeks but they look nice and still do the job.  They also come with a nifty little cleaning cloth and soft pouch for protection from dust, etc.  The lenses are polarized as advertised and they do an excellent job of reducing glare as well as attenuating the bright sunlight.  The reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 was because I did detect slight image distortion when viewing through the periphery of the lenses but only a few millimeters from the edges."
4.0,"These are incredible.  By far the quickest, easiest way to make a bun that I have ever seen.  We use it for out daughters who are gymnasts and figure skaters."
4.0,I like this bracelet and I think it will make a nice Christmas gift for my friend. The leather and hemp are a very nice color but very stiff. I'm sure with some wear it'll soften and become more comfortable. I'm happy with this item.
4.0,This is a beautiful blouse. The collar is a little too tall so I had to fold it that's the only issue I have with it. Nice fabric nice colors.
4.0,"As expected, I will have to change it up, as the heart rate can’t work with cord in way. Mii fits great in holder and That was mainly what I got it for to make another bracelet."
4.0,Nice but not as big as the one the model wears in the photo.
4.0,"I’m usually a size small but I ordered a medium. I have a tiny waist and bigger thighs/bum, the waist is a little big on me but it’s okay! The first time i wore them they were a little resistant and felt like I was wearing spanx instead of leggings.  Second time they were more flexible and stretchy! I’ve gotten many compliments!"
4.0,"it was for a babyshower, everyone loved it"
4.0,"I got one size larger that I usually wear but I should have gone up 2 sizes for a looser more boho fit... just as a reference. Very, very cute. It had one skip seam on the shoulder but it wasn't enough to stop my loving the dress. Also the inside liner is very, very short... it went about half way down my rear end... but I also got bike shorts for underneath. Still pleased with my gift."
4.0,So far so good! Velcro seems to be secure; fabric is comfortable.
4.0,"The skirt seems to be great quality, but it runs a bit smaller than the sizing chart indicates.  I wear sz 18 pants, but the XXL skirt was still too small."
4.0,KOOL
4.0,Size runs large
4.0,"I like the waist length, I don't like the noise of the loose buttons, it's still cute with my outfits."
4.0,"The product is exactly what the picture shows. I think it is really cute. It is not too big. It has lots of pockets which I love. I am able to keep cards, cash, change, receipts, coupons, etc all in separate areas. The color is really cute and the gold really accents this wallet. The leather is as good as your paying for. I have not had any trouble with it so far but I could see it cracking and peeling in the future. The snap and zipper work great and seem like they will hold up for the life of the wallet. I would recommend this wallet its super cute and I get a lot of compliments."
4.0,Received quickly and looks just like the photo. Nice.
4.0,Perfect for what needed
4.0,"My daughter is tiny for her age. I used the size chart and ordered per the recommendation. It fit perfectly except it was not long enough to wear as a dress. I had to put leggings on her to cover her bottom. I still like it, just cannot be worn as shown as a dress"
4.0,Arrived quickly. Fit is a little bigger but thats better than too small. Room to grow. First wash went well.
4.0,do not be deceived by the silver in the picture mine were completely pink even the crystals were pink. but they fit good not too tight. *i like to use an item that was the same size as the body parts i put them on to show if its too tight or loose*
4.0,"Love the articulated skeleton. Pretty cheaply made, but love it all the same."
4.0,Amazon sent me the wrong dress and didn't do anything to get it fixed. So I reached out to Grace and Lucille and they over nighted me the right dress!  Only reason I'm moving it up to a 4 star review.
4.0,Really like this sweater but it runs very small so I have to return it.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:738e1aae2d3c9c92214196eed11a35b0]] Good overall but it runs small and the color matchingd weird
4.0,"Latches are super hard to open and close. Other than that, they are super cute and sturdy"
4.0,Size is good<br />Don’t like how big the wrist holes<br />Keeps me dry
4.0,"It looks beautiful, just alil big but manageable."
4.0,Wife tells me that you have to try a bra before buying… ha… who knew.
4.0,over I like this coat. just a little too thin for Ohio winter. it needs another layer. description should read fall coat not winter coat
4.0,"BUSTY LADIES BEWARE.<br />I love this dress. It is beautiful and comfy. But, and I say but STRONGLY. For those of us whit curves. Curves indicating large breast (G cup) and hips. The dress will not fit the chest well and the liner will be tight in the hips. So this is a great dress to wear a corset under for the curvy girls."
4.0,"I am 5' 6&#34;  145 lb, was a little big, but I was more disappointed that it wasn't as sheer as it shows.  I wanted to get a two piece suit that would show through, as I am not confident enough at age 54 to wear a two piece without a cover up, but you really can't see the suit through it."
4.0,I have been wearing this shirt constantly!  It is on the thin side and not the high quality fabric (it isn't super soft).  The sleeves are pretty large but I roll them and it looks fine
4.0,"not as delicate looking - more globby than it looks, but actually it is wearing well, and looks nice when on"
4.0,For the price I'm pretty happy. Not sure how it will hold up though.
4.0,"the dress is very pretty,its just very big i will keep it and use as a night gown.I am 5 7 and 188 and I needed a medium,my chest is a 38d and in the large I have alot of room"
4.0,Great piece that I find to be easy to match.
4.0,"Hard to take off, and a bit pokey when you get a snug fit (as designed). Works nicely, but makes the pants a bit uncomfortable."
4.0,"These gloves arrived with inserts so that they weren't creased, which was nice. They go up just above the elbow on me, and are jet black, not sheer whatsoever. They will be perfect for my Halloween costume. They could definitely survive a few hardcore parties."
4.0,Super cute shoes! I bought these shoes for play shoes for my 4 year old twins in a toddler size 10 which runs a little big but nit an issue.... They love the colors however they are VERY slippery and have absolutely NO grip on the bottom soles. I had to take a knife to the bottom of the shoes to try and give them some traction.
4.0,Muy bueno me encanto
4.0,"These leggings are very warm, but I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 126 # and wear a size 4 pants and these leggings were almost too small.  The only thing that bothers me is the way the crotch is sewn together with there being an extra panel in the middle, like long underwear.  The seams cut into the upper legs, if they fall down just a little bit."
4.0,Material was thicker than i was expecting. Not so cheaply made. The bottom part is stretchy and long enough you won’t show all your bits to to the world. Too part of totally see through. Definitely need an undershirt of some sort under there.
4.0,I dislike because this earing comes out of your ear easy.
4.0,Love it....more for a basketball head than a football head...but for the money a good helmet...this is my quick on.... gentle ride helmet....I have other helmets for more intense or involved riding.
4.0,This mask is so cute. I added black material to the backside so you couldn’t see through. I also added adhesive foam to the inside of the nose to make it more comfortable. However this is by far the most uncomfortable mask I’ve ever had. It would be perfect for some thing like a photo shoot where you don’t have to wear it for long.
4.0,"Such a low price, we expected something a bit cheap-looking. But the workmanship and appearance is very good! I knew my wife liked it when she put it on immediately after opening the package! One picky comment: when pulling the chain to adjust the length, my wife noticed a bit of a drag. So handle it gently."
4.0,"Nice, but Returned way too big."
4.0,"These shorts are great - they stay in place, are super lightweight and the legs don't ride up. When I opened the packaging I was a bit skeptical because it looks like it's a bit shoddily put together but it's held up in the washing machine and through a half Ironman so I guess this is a looks-are-deceiving situation. Really comfortable, no chafing, and they aren't see-thru. My only issue is that they are really expensive."
4.0,"Love this bathing suit! Definitely for short persons with short torsos. At 5'3 (36-28-38) a size large fit perfect! I normally wear a med in other suits due this my short torso, but this one fits to a tee!"
4.0,This bag is very cute but very small. It's unusual looking compared to most other bags though.
4.0,"I was a bit worried that the color would not be right upon arrival, but it was perfect.  Looks nice, was pleased."
4.0,looks good on my keychain
4.0,"Very comfortable, pants don't ride up but if you a big busted order a size larger, also wish the shirt was longer."
4.0,"Great for the price! The material is silky and has stretch too it, so I could have gone down a size. I love that it was a longer fit!"
4.0,"It is an okay shirt for the price, but it is a bit smaller and shorter than expected."
4.0,"Great quality, wish it had a couple internal sections, but other than that, nice bag."
4.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, has pockets and looks much more expensive than it actually cost."
4.0,It so cute good quality.
4.0,Super comfortable and easy to wear. Great quality for the money
4.0,I weigh 145 have DD and large was tight on the bottoms the top was not a bad fit.  I was just surprised the bottoms were as small as they were.
4.0,I love how u can adjust it. 🤗
4.0,Nit as sift as it looks but I like it
4.0,"I don’t love this dress, but I do like it. I bought a medium. I am 5’3, 137 lbs, 34dd, I typically wear a medium but sometimes large tops, 4/6 in women’s or 7 in juniors. I’m built top heavy with a decent size bust and chunky arms. My arms are my least favorite body part, so it makes tops/dresses a challenge. I want something that fits without squeezing my top half too tight, yet isn’t too large in the bottom that it just looks frumpy. The dress is the perfect length for me, stopping just at my ankles so I could wear wedged shoes (pictured) or flats. The material is comfortable and pockets are always a bonus! I gave it 4 stars because the dress itself is pretty nice but just a little snug on my top and I wish the top part came down a little bit but it hugs right under my bust. I probably should have ordered a large but I feared ordering a large would result in a frumpy bottom and I’m not sure if it would have extended the top length any."
4.0,"My grand daughter loves it.  So does her friends,  Shipping time was right on schedule.  👍"
4.0,nice and look good.
4.0,"Very light, maybe a little on the cheaper side, more for style than weather. I'm 6'1"" 175lb so I'm on the slimmer side and the jacket fits just right."
4.0,A little too bouncy!
4.0,just a cut little tighter than I am used too
4.0,I thought the flask was going to be bigger. It's really only big enough for a shot or two.
4.0,Please with purchase but Fits a tad to big.
4.0,"A little more wind noise than I would like, but it is a cheap helmet comparing to the good ones in the market. It is a good starting helmet and comfortable."
4.0,"These are nice gloves. I just wish I would have ordered the small and not the medium, as they're too loose to function on a day-to-day basis. However, I can say they are warm, they allow you to use touch screens, and stylish."
4.0,this was a gift but worked great.
4.0,"Needed a fast, cheap alb for a really big guy.  It is a bit thin, but it did the trick."
4.0,Small but beautiful .As pictured.
4.0,"Simple, elegant styling. The leather is supple and fine grained. The lining is soft and warm without being bulky, and the touchscreen feature works as it should. Well priced.<br />Altogether I am very happy with them."
4.0,"Since I now have to wear glasses all the time, I decided to pick up a few different pairs of glasses so that I could accessorize my outfits with them.  Now that I have three pairs, I've had their original cases lying all about the house, and kept thinking that it would be nice to have a storage box to keep them in.  I looked online and ended up ordering this one, and so far I'm very pleased with it!<br /><br />I've only had it for a week, but it does have a pretty strong odor that will hopefully dissipate as I've had it longer.  The wells for each pair of glasses are nice and deep, so they can easily hold oversized sunglasses or mens' larger frames.<br /><br />The box is made of leather and is assembled in China, and it comes with a small key so you can lock it.  The leather is of nice quality, and it doesn't look cheap or chintzy all.<br /><br />I've been keeping this on my bedroom dresser, where I can easily access the glasses I want to wear that day.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I found this! It was the most reasonably-priced one I could find, and it's of nice quality and looks nice sitting out in my bedroom."
4.0,"works good, little bigger than I though though."
4.0,"Large for my neck even at the smallest diameter. I don't recommend this product for very slender people with small necks, but i am otherwise satisfied with my order."
4.0,It's what is listed but some duplicates and not all the ones that are pictured. Otherwise good.
4.0,"Pretty, but I don't like the little braided piece with the beaded strings hanging off. Difficult to adjust size."
4.0,"So comfortable! I will say I’m not in love with the fit. It’s not terrible; it’s not great. There’s extra material on the knees so it looks a little baggy there. But the comfort and material is worth it. During a pandemic, when I’m not physically going in to work anyway, it works just fine. I will probably order another one because that’s how comfortable it is."
4.0,Got to me in a good time. Looks nice and a nice size. Didn't care for the fabric lining inside at all.
4.0,Very cute and light weight. It looks just like the picture.
4.0,Got this for my girlfriend that always needs something to do with her hands and absolutely loves rings! She loved it cute design definitely worth the purchase!
4.0,Super soft and cute.  Runs very small.  I read the reviews first I went from a small to a large.  The torso area fits prefect but I do have longeerr arms to begin with so that's a little small.  I'm happy.
4.0,"Love this! If feels so comfy and looks great, other than the fact that the crotch is really big. I feel like a grandma trying to make the fit correctly."
4.0,"Cozy and roomy but not too big or long on my 5 foot frame.  Didn’t shrink much after washing.  Not as feminine as I wanted, just like a big long shirt, but that’s just my taste.  Quality seems good"
4.0,"Very comfortable. However, 2 out of the 3 are tighter than the 3rd one. Odd."
4.0,"Excellent ad photography, not so great actual product."
4.0,"The slipper is fine. I am hard to please. I live in SoCal and the goal of a slipper is to keep the foot warm, but not hot. This is the best I've had, but still gets a bit hot at times. For cooler climates this may be perfect."
4.0,"I like it. Form fitting and should work great. I'm 5'7&#34;, 165#, and have wide shoulders. Fits perfect. Gets only 4 stars because they either sent me a &#34;second&#34; or their QC isn't 100%. There is a very easy to see snag on the front. But who cares it's for rolling on the mat, right?"
4.0,"Loved the robes, thought the sizing was confusing.  All were good except one so i assumed it was one size fits. But the size small i ordered would maybe fit a toddler. Guess I’m stuck with that cause I don’t have packaging.  We took them for a wedding in Jamaica and did’nt realize it till we were there.  Unfortunately, bc of that I didn’t get one...but the other gals did for wedding!<br />The quality is great though! Very pretty."
4.0,"I have a LARGE head and most stocking caps don't fit.  Granted, this doesn't fit as intended exactly (not nearly as slouchy) but it does fit me very comfortably and the colors are nice."
4.0,"I am typically a 2x - and it fit pretty well.  if you have a large tummy, be wary of the black at the bottom - that does not stretch. Fits me well"
4.0,"I purchased this hat for my 10 year old son as part of his Halloween Steampunk costume.  It was surprisingly nicer than expected for costume-quality, and fit him fairly well (it was only slightly large for him).  We dressed it up with a pair of Umbrella Factory Victorian Steampunk welding goggles; he looked terrific and was very pleased!<br /><br />Given that it was almost perfectly sized for my son (who wears a size 7 1/8ths hat), it may run small for some adults."
4.0,I will be using this cactus outfit with hat for pajamas. It is really soft but the 12-18 month size def runs big. The hat is comically large. This will put its wear in the middle of summer so I will keep it for pajamas or when were inside with the ac cranked down. Used my hand for size reference because its what I had easy access to. Closer to 24 mo 2t.
4.0,Cute key cover.  Had to get a new key ring because I couldn't get it on my old one.  It was too thick. Worth it.
4.0,"These leggings are very sleek and shiny. There’s some stretch but not a ton, should’ve ordered a size up. There’s a drawstring around the top inside the fabric, which is great since they’re not really “high waist” as described. These seem to be squat proof as well."
4.0,Still early to tell; but so far they comfortable and provide good support.  I'm waiting to see how long the support lasts. That has been the issue with most slippers I purchase.
4.0,"I ordered this dress to wear for an outdoor wedding in FL in November. Most of my dresses are black or serious colors, so I decided to try something cheerful.<br /><br />I was happy to see that the color was as expected, very bright and cheerful -- but not gaudy. It didn't look cheap, but I would definitely categorize it as a maxi dress more than a 'formal gown'.<br /><br />It fit fine, but I didn't like the way the skirt portion sat on my hips. I felt like the dress emphasized them in an unflattering way, which I didn't like. Ultimately, I returned the dress and went with something else."
4.0,"I love this shirt, it was just too tight. If you want a fit like the model, order a size up."
4.0,These leggings are good if you don’t want any compression. They were comfortable to work out in. Decent quality for the price.
4.0,Runs a little small. But it's a cool design.
4.0,Beautiful and elegant. Excellent price so I feel like it’s practical enough for everyday wear.
4.0,"I usually wear a 9W and got 9.5 WW, since it was the only size available. They fit well. They are warm and quite attractive. What I don't like about them is that instead of making the whole sole wider, they just make the leather upper larger, which make them look too big and bulky on top."
4.0,Tools are very safe for our grandson; the belt is very stiff.
4.0,Fit great. Use them all the time for excersize.
4.0,"Beautiful! Feels like silk, good weight. Took 1 star off because I felt hot in it. But then again I’m 38 weeks pregnant and it’s summer in NYC. It’s worth buying."
4.0,Super warm and cozy
4.0,"Pretty dress. I’m 5’8” and 160 lbs. I got a large and it’s a little big in the midsection but if I got a size smaller I doubt I’d be able to move my arms comfortably. It’s a little short for me, but that’s typical with me being a bit tall. It worked great for me playing Elaine in a production of Arsenic and Old Lace."
4.0,"These masks are a good value as you get a lot for a few dollars. I purchased them for my 8 year old son. My son is rather slim and has a slimmer, smaller face. These masks fit him well, but he doesn’t like them very much. Although they seem lightweight, he prefers to wear the fabric masks I purchased on here because he can breathe easier with those. In addition, these come in a variety of colors (blue, yellow, green, and pink) but my son does not like the pink ones so it seems like a waste of $ if you are not using all of the masks."
4.0,Runs about true to size. Very nice quality.
4.0,I love these shoes. One small issue on the right foot at the large toe I feel some pressure feels different. The shoes are not small just in this one area. Not sure what to do about it.
4.0,Is beautiful but it is too long for me I have to cut  need a shorter
4.0,I really love Allegra K clothing. I think this is my fourth shirt purchased from them? The material is always nice and I usually wear a medium and their medium shirts fit me. Allerga K has helped me improve my wardrobe for work when I really don't make much to shop for clothing so thank you. The shoulders to this shirt are a little more puffy than it looks in the image but it's okay. Kind of like the look of shoulder pads but with no pads.)
4.0,"very pretty. kind of long in the front, but looks very nice. very thin, but that's an easy fix"
4.0,"With the tie loose and the hat open as wide loose as it will go, this hat is actually a little large for my large-sized head, so I'm glad to be able to adjust it for a snug fit. I love that it fits all the way down on my head (which women's hats almost never do).<br /><br />It's light, soft (inside and out), and the rim is wide enough to actually block harsh sunlight. Would be nice if the front brim were moldable, but has a nice shape as-is, so I can live without that one feature. Front brim is not floppy, but is malleable. Love that the hat lays flat or can be rolled up for packing.<br /><br />Really want another in white, but they were out.<br /><br />FYI: For those w/smaller heads, the back tie would allow for a snug fit, but there will likely be some empty space and gathers in the bucket of the hat."
4.0,"These boots are well made, soft and very cozy inside.  Unfortunately, they are also very narrow.  I had to return them"
4.0,Good quality workmanship. I wear a 16 at walmart. This 16 is more like a 14
4.0,"This is a stylish bag, reminds me of MZ Wallace without the price tag.  I like satchel type bags with a cross body strap, since I live in NYC with no car, I need both options.  The main handle drops are too short to wear on your shoulder with a coat but if you like to wear on your arm or carry in your hands, you're set.  The removable cross body strap is long enough although it looks a bit thin.<br /><br />The bag itself is lightweight and has a lot of organization, you won't be rummaging in your bag to find things.  I do wish the outside side pockets were a little higher to accomodate a water bottle but you can fit it inside easily.  It also has a rectangular bottom so the bag doesn't fall over when set down.<br /><br />At the sale price of $35, I would recommend picking this one up!"
4.0,"This is a perfectly nice jersey. The material is smooth and comfortable. The full zipper makes it much easier to wear and adjust. I got this for my husband who is 6'4"", so it is a bit short on him. most clothes are, though. Other than that, it does a good job of letting air and sweat through and keeping him cool."
4.0,This shade of pink is way off from the picture. It’s more like Neon OSHA grade pink. But the garment is nice.
4.0,"I like this, the only issue I have with it , for my face the ones that have a bit curvy glass are better so they cover sides. This one is straight.<br />Other than that, it's stylish and I liked the picture came with it to test polarization."
4.0,"I was looking for an alternative to the band that came with my Amazfit5. The band fits well. The velcro is alittle thin, but stays secure, unlike the band that came with the it."
4.0,SO CUTEEEE!!!! This was surprisingly good quality! The v neck wasn’t as v shaped as I’d like but regardless it’s great. I’m 5’8 and 215 and this fit wonderful but I would have liked an extra inch or two in lenth. The material is a bit shiny and each color block is sewn together.
4.0,Classic watch that keeps going and going.
4.0,"It seems good so far so it gets 4 stars from me. I took a shot in the dark buying this as there wasn’t many reviews. So far it looks like it’ll do the job, but if I could give an opinion,,, it’s put together like a 4 year old made it, and the plastic is very lumpy and uneven. I will update more when we take it to the beach!"
4.0,Cute but runs about 1 size big
4.0,"I wore these exactly one time, and the metal piece that connects to the glass dangle came unglued.  They are very pretty, but poor quality.<br />Edited to add:  the company sent me out an immediate replacement, and they are awesome!  Definitely will order other colors and styles.  Thank you!"
4.0,"Cute, but they fall down and the lace frayed after first wash."
4.0,"Very cute, glad I found these! Fit my 2 year old great."
4.0,So they weren’t exactly what I excepted. The fabric is really cheap it’s not great material. They don’t look like the picture at all but I made them work with the right outfit.
4.0,"These slippers are meant for traveling. They’re disposable, fabric is thin, but gets the job done. They are not meant to be worn long-term or be of high-quality. They’re meant to be utilized as typical disposable spa slippers"
4.0,It is about a half size small if you use a ring size tool. But I love it and will probably try to enlarge it ever do slightly to fit.
4.0,"Great price, cheap buttons"
4.0,"Great vibrant color band, but not as sturdy as my apple bands."
4.0,"This dress looks cheap when in the packaging. I steamed it and put it on and felt it looked really good. It is lined, but with a very cheap fabric. But I guess that's better then having it be see through. But over all I like this dress. Perfect for brunch with the ladies."
4.0,"Two bands, both as pictured, a black and a black/white combo, well worth the money and very satisfied."
4.0,These are cute little socks but I realized after I bought them that I had really overpaid. Would have been great at half the price.
4.0,It's so cute but I wish the lace was ruffled all the way around. It's straight in the middle
4.0,"You haven't traveled, until you've traveled with a Tortuga. Great design and quality construction."
4.0,This is a very nice double sided garden flag.  Bright colors and good price.  I can't wait until winter!
4.0,"I ordered a Medium based on the reviews that said the dress material is stretchy, which it is. Fit was too tight after all, so I plan to get a Large instead. (I'm a size 8 generally, @ 140 lbs but larger in the chest, average in waist). The color (red) is just as shown in the pic. Zipper seems poor quality but perhaps it'll last. Overall, a nice dress for the price even though the material is not a great quality."
4.0,the posts were bent on arrival
4.0,This was really comfy once I got the right size. I suggest if you have a big booty and thicc thighs to size up.
4.0,Quick to receive. Just clip it to my backpack and go.
4.0,"I know this is &#34;artificial&#34; but it is quite lovely.  I added a white gold chain in place of the chain it comes with and it looks great, it has also lasted much longer.  The pendant is made well and if you take some care with it, it will last a good while.  You can also substitute a Sterling silver chain in place of what arrives."
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter and she is a size 0-2, sometimes a size 3 (XS-S) in US measurements and she is 4'11. We ordered a size Medium, which is a size 4 just to be on the safe side. We got it and it is a bit big on her (loose) but not too much. It didn't fit as expected but She loves it! It makes her look like a young lady in her 20's and she's only16. Very classy blouse! She will use it with a skirt and will tuck it in so, she's not worried about it being a bit big on her. the size for this blouse is between &#34;fit as expected to somewhat large.&#34; It does not run small."
4.0,These masks are pretty.  They are soft.  But they are also polyester.  And if I had read better I would know that.  The polyester made my chin break out.  So these masks were awesome for me in theory.  Not so good in practice.
4.0,My granddaughter just loves it
4.0,I received this toy free of charge. I am very happy with the quality of this sweet monkey. The price point is very good for the toy.He is soft and cuddly and well made with his yarn bow and hat. I really recommend this toy for any age.
4.0,"It does the job, but is somewhat flimsy. I've used it twice."
4.0,"Super cute, fits like a glove. True to size. Not really great material, will probably start getting holes after a few washes. Handle with care? Lol"
4.0,"Here's the deal...The product arrived on time and in good condition.  We're having a costume party at the lake with a Woodstock theme...This wig fit the bill and should be a hit.  Decent quality material at this price point and it fit better than expected.  I can't speak to long term comfort or durability, but it will suffice for my limited purposes.  There you have it...enjoy."
4.0,"I like it but would like it one star better if the external pockets on the front and back were deeper.  They are only 4 1/2 inches deep (even the one that is all alone on its side.  The result is that my address book doesn't fit anywhere.  The three pockets on the front are 4 1/2 inches deep.  The top two are 9 inches wide.  The one pocket on the back is 5 inches deep and 7 inches wide.  The pockets on the side are 4 1/2 inches deep and 5 1/2 inches wide.  The only zippered pocket on the inside is 5 inches deep and 6 inches wide.<br /><br />I care about pocket size because, in order to facilitate changing purses, I put the items that often run loose in a purse in multiple small zippered bags like the ones you get with some cosmetics.  My small bags don't fit in the 4 1/2 inch pockets.  Yes, there are bigger problems in life."
4.0,"For the price, this is a nice coverup. The material is decent but not a very high quality. It works well as a bathing suit coverup and even as a nightgown. The material used is similar to that used for a nightgown."
4.0,My wife loves it and thinks I stroke goal with it !! LOL 😂!!
4.0,Love the feel and the warmth.  I ordered a medium and they are a bit too large.  I want another one but will order in small.
4.0,"I like it very much. It's dainty enough for a woman, not terribly wide, just enough. As far as the benefits from the magnets, it's too early to judge. I do feel that the pain in my wrist has lessened. The link remover that came with the bracelet worked perfectly. I had to remove 2 links for the perfect fit."
4.0,It fits a little larger than the other ones I have. The fabric is different compared to the black and white polka dots or the animal print.
4.0,"I like the look & tint, but I had to return them because they did not fit properly on the bridge of my nose."
4.0,Fit great pattern are identical but colors slightly different. Feel wonderful on. A little thick. I just had triple by pass heart and it is everything I can do to put these on. Now I am 68 and still weak - today I think I m may have actually hurt my chest with all the pulling.
4.0,Cute but the bottom really puffs out  lol
4.0,I have VERY sensitive skin.  All shoulder pads tend to irritate and rub under bra strap.  It would be great to have a cotton &#34;buffer&#34; so no edges are rubbing on skin.  Just a suggestion.
4.0,"It's a little squeaky but overall it's a great buy. If you've got larger wrists, I'd recommend getting something with a larger face though. Maybe one of Casio's calculator watches, they're like $6 dollars more."
4.0,not best quality
4.0,Fabric was a bit thin but overall very cute dress!
4.0,Fit my kid really well & he loves it
4.0,"Perfect weekend traveler bag! More than enough space for all of my makeup, clothes, shoes and more!"
4.0,Tight fit in the chest area but otherwise very nice
4.0,"The cap is nice, like the design, quality of fabric and the fit. Even though the hat was shipped in a big box, somehow it still got bent and now i cant get rid of the bent lines, which certainly doesnt look nice. The tag at the bag was not in the right place, it was stitched in a very misaligned position, i ended up simply ripping it away. The good place for it is inside the hat, not outside. Other than that great hat."
4.0,This is a nice jogging set.  I got them for my son. He's 14 years old.  They fit him well and are true to size.  I generally buy him a size medium in men's and that's what I got here.  The seams and all that appear to be good. This is a light weight jogging set. The third picture I provided shows part of the inside.  There are pockets on both the zipped up hoodie and pants.
4.0,Looks good and I haven't had any problems with it at all.  I would recommend.
4.0,"I just moved to NY after living all my my life in a warm tropical island so I am new to cold weather and of course,  winter hat fashion which is not my thing. I avoid &#34;hat hair&#34; at all costs so I wanted to try the baggy look. I must say I was dissapointed by how they look on me, but that is just a &#34;me&#34; issue with hats. They're just not my thing. The darker color did look better on me than the light which seemed beige in the photos but was actually light grey. That said, they're exactly as pictured and described and just roomy enough for the slouchy look. Some say they're not thick enough and maybe just good for fall but I realized they may be describing another style. They're actually thicker than I expected and think they will be warm enough though I'm hardly a winter expert. I'm rating 4 because of delivery issues with USPS. They put a &#34;delivered, left near front door or porch&#34; status on Amazon's estimated delivery day, but when I got home they were nowhere to be found so I thought they were lost or  stolen. Then the next day I received with my mail the pink slip to pick up at the post office with the previous day date, couldn't schedule a redelivery because the tracking appeared as delivered so I had to wait until next bussiness day to pick it up."
4.0,"That said, it is made of very high-quality material and makes me look and feel classy. Can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion and is light enough to wear to the beach yet thick enough to not look out of place at an upscale dinner."
4.0,Love the loose fit. Very comfy!
4.0,"Made my 12 year old happy. Chain broke the first day, but was fixable. She loves it."
4.0,"Nice dress, can be formal or party; DO NOT WORRY ABOUT SIZING UP!!! I am 5'3&#34;, weigh 200 lbs., very curvy in hips and buttocks, ordered a size 3X, too loose! Thankfully, I know how to alter, so I will keep it and alter the dress."
4.0,The were bigger then i thought all in all a great look for me......They have alot of sparlke
4.0,"A little short, but I bought a women's shoe as my feet are extremely narrow and I don't know how to convert women's shoe sizes to men's."
4.0,My wife seems to like the shirts but the material is pretty cheap and rough feeling but she likes it. That was the only reason why I didn't give it a five-star
4.0,"These look great but don’t drop them on a hard surface! Even though they are small and light, mine have pieces that have shattered off the back and now they don’t stay in."
4.0,"I absolutely love this cute top!  Unfortunately I had to return it,  it fits really small.  I wear a large and ordered an XL and the XL fit like a small.  I love it so much that I re-ordered it in a XXL and fingers crossed it will fit.  It's longer in the back.  Material is really soft, not see thru."
4.0,I received the dress on time and was very excited how quickly it came.  I have experience one problem like others have expressed....the zipper was very hard to pull down and pull up.  I'm thinking about getting a ne zipper put in but I don't want to spend a lot for a one time event.  The dress is very pretty and I like the material overall it is a winner.  I would have given 5 stars but the zipper is a problem for such a great dress.
4.0,"The black coloring on the outer sole stripped off on the first use, but aside from that the shoes have held up over the last 3 months (climbing once a week). Far better than the rentals, my only other complaint is that the velcro straps are a bit long if I tighten them - I can feel them rubbing the wall sometimes."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful.  However, unless you have perfect figure, don't try it."
4.0,"Have had these almost 3 months now and wear them about 3-4 times a week. They are very comfortable and the platform helps to keep my feet from hurting while walking. The insole isn't very cushy, but the crepe sole gives a bit of cushion and doesn't slip. Love the distressed look and are perfect with jeans."
4.0,I like the look of this watch.  It would look more elegant except the plastic looks like plastic.  The colour is true to the picture.
4.0,It feels and looks cheap. The image is not as well defined as I would have liked. Very pretty if you don't look too close.
4.0,They look like real emeralds even though they aren't and they are comfortable when you wear them so they are good.
4.0,"These are a bit stronger than the ones I had previously. I think they will last longer.  I tend to drop my sunglasses a lot and sit on them or lose them.  I like to drive with them, as they calm my eyes.  It's hard to say &#34;I love&#34; a pair of sunglasses, but I do like them."
4.0,love the dress but need to wear a size down
4.0,I purchased for a 7 yr old was too small. But makes a great gift for a toddler
4.0,"This cooler is not completely leakproof. If it stays upright it does not leak, but if tips to the side at all, it leaks around the zipper. Otherwise, it worked great."
4.0,The item was as expected. I had to get used to the material of the band but once i did it was good. It looks really great on my hand and i get compliments whenever i wear it. It looks really kool and given the price i luv it lol. one draw back is tht it doesnt glow @ nite suh its kinda weird to read in the dark lol but thats not the big of a deal anyway. i fully reccommend to som1 tryn to get a super-kool lookn watch for a really great price :)
4.0,I love the higher smocked waist to flatten my stomach area. I weigh 160 pounds and I’m 5 foot three and these are a good length on me.  Elastic ankles that you can pull up or keep down.  Pockets are on the side of the hips so they do add a little bulk.  I do not think these are one-size-fits-all and think they probably accommodate up to a size 12.  I am worried about washing and drying them. If they shrink any they are going to be too small for me.  The description says 88% polyester and 12% spandex but the actual tag says 100% polymide?
4.0,It doesn't cover the whole head.  It just wraps around.  I like the color.  You have to bend the wire brim to shape it.
4.0,NICE AND BIG!
4.0,"I really liked these earings, they fit well and stay in place nicely, I do think they are a bit over priced and honestly because of that I won't buy them again, but they were worth the one time purchase and worked well with the outfit I paired them with."
4.0,"Love this outfit! Made better than i thought it would be. I was nervous about sizing due to it being asian standard. I ordered XXL, but I am 5'5"" ams 155lbs. It fits perfectly. The only reason I am giving 4 i stead of five is the stitching isnt very sturdy.only wore 2 ti.e and a place is coming loose. These were marked down so I only paid 20 dollars for the pair...i can live with that!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:905c8bfd905fe93ccf2eceeb1fbf638d]] It's kinda loose ngl and I was worried it would be too small but I got a medium and I'm 5'5 and weigh 154lbs. Uhhh 34dd breast and I could definitely live with the chest part to be a bit more snug but over all it's a nice piece and I'll definitely wear it a lot
4.0,"Just received my dress and i like it, a little long, definatly not like the picture. But super cute and i love the material, bch dress for sure. Great summer item snd arrived two weeks early, happy girl"
4.0,"When you close the robe, wrapping one side over the other and tying, one pocket is now under the front panel (and thus inaccessible), and the front pocket is now directly in the middle, on your stomach, making for awkward use and an odd look. Would have preferred side pockets sewn in the side seam."
4.0,"Fits as expected but after one wash, you get those tiny balls on the shirt--not so fun!"
4.0,My grandson likes so well I ordered more
4.0,Satisfecha en 90%
4.0,"Didn't get the 5th Star because of the pants. Everything else was perfect though! Just my mistake for making an assumption I shouldn't have. I ordered the XXL size set as I'm 6ft tall and have a pretty large build. I'm have a waist size of 37in. so I figured the 90-92cm (which converts to 35-36in) would be a little tight but manageable as I see this happen with other clothes sometimes. But that definitely wasn't the case. Can barely zipper the pants up halfway and when I do, every step feels like I'm on the verge of ripping them. So don't make any assumptions. Make sure your measurements are well in the range of the size chart. My chest and everything else fit the other XXL stuff and the XXXL would've been way too big.<br /><br />They even sent me an Akatsuki ring as an extra gift which is awesome! The kunai obviously is plastic but looks super nice. I wouldn't want to carry around a real kunai while cosplaying anyway. Love the Sage coat and jacket. The frog coin purse is cool. Basically everything is really good for a $90 price. Other cosplay shops would charge upwards of $90 just for the Naruto track suit so this was great and shipping was quick.<br /><br />My takeaway from the pants is that it's time to start my ninja training so I can lose a couple of inches off my waist and become the Hokage! Dattebayo!"
4.0,I love the watch and the ability to change worldwide time zones as needed for work.  The only drawback was no instructions at all on the bezel functions to figure the times.  It took some figuring.
4.0,It fits as expected but the off the shoulder part kept on unfolding which  was annoying
4.0,"I would give this a five, but it is way, way, way too small."
4.0,It came out nice. Just afraid it is going to break easy.
4.0,"I love this bathing suit. I am bigger cheated than I have in the back, if you get what I mean. I was worried about the top and bottom being the same size. The top fit good, I ordered a size up. The bottoms are a little too big but they work for the boat.."
4.0,"I am quite petite, bought the Extra small, still kind of loose on the waist and too long on the length, wish  you make petite size available for tiny people like me. But it is so stylish, super comfy, receive so many compliments and looking backs. worth of buying, only thing is that needs press after washing...but this does not lower the value. I already bought two of the creamy color which i like the most..."
4.0,"Love the style, there cute and unique. Anything different I'm all for."
4.0,Loved these pants! They're comfortable and fit really well! They are a bit big and I'm petite so they're a tad longer for this 5'3 girl.  But overall I love them!
4.0,"Works great, but sometimes comes undone with slight pressure. Cute but beads are obviously not expensive."
4.0,Needs stretched to slouch but other then that it is good
4.0,"Perfect size for a day bag... not intended for backpacking.  Waist Belt is way too short!  It is too tight for my 37 inch waist.  I probably won't use the waist belt, but it's a shame they didn't make it longer or include an extension... that would have earned 5 stars."
4.0,Fits ok. A little loose around chin area but would purchase again
4.0,This is small but uniquely scary! Put a green spotlight on this thing and it looks really cool
4.0,Order a size or two bigger. Nice pants for the money.
4.0,Fabric was scratchy
4.0,Ordered a large (I wear size 10-12). Was not flattering on me but looked amazing on my slimmer sister.
4.0,"The dress is very nice and light fabric but not see through. I’m in between sizes and I got a large, I would have fit better in a medium. Either way I still felt cute in it.<br />I am…<br />Pant size 12<br />Top size usually Medium<br />Weight 173 lbs"
4.0,Thay were a little tight i gave them to my son<br />If iwere to buy some more i have to order a<br />9andhalf but i did like them
4.0,"This was used for a play at school, very tiny so leggings were worn under it."
4.0,These are super cute boots they don’t feel super cheap but they are for very narrow feet. Other than that I love them
4.0,Super cute and great quality for the price.
4.0,Very colorful and lovely.
4.0,"I am 5’ 2”, 165 lbs and got a size Medium. Perhaps I could’ve gone with the Large but was afraid it would fit too loose. It was stretchy material however because it was a little well fitting on my body the back lining, under the zipper, ended up ripping after 4 hours of wear.  I was bending over picking up my toddler while wearing the costume; however it ripped sooner than I expected. For anyone with my body size the size Large will probably be a better option to avoid ripping! For $20 the quality is great, it was not see through on my butt like some leggings are."
4.0,"The jacket is warm and comfortable, I only wish the pockets were deeper so I can keep my hands in the pocket to stay warm."
4.0,"I love this, and it fits me perfectly around the torso and the chest. At a size 14 dress, I got a medium after reading some of the reviews. My only complaint and the reason I'm returning it, is that it's extremely long. I am very short (5' 1&#34;) and it comes down way past my butt, making the front flair awkwardly. If you're of an average height though, this would be a super cute and perfectly fitting shirt. I'm very sad to be returning it."
4.0,"The pendant looked good, but the cord was tied so tight and was so short. Very disappointing."
4.0,This bracelet hasn't reached its destination yet but it is pretty and just bold enough.  What I was looking for.  No Idea yet about the quality as it hasn't been worn.
4.0,"I ordered these in red in a size 10. Normally I wear a 9, but I've had slippers in size 10 before and a little big is ok. When I got them, I could not believe they are a size 10, because they looked so much smaller. They were snug and felt more like an 8, my toes touch the end of the slipper. I'm sure they will stretch and fit more like a 9 should. But seriously these looked like a kid's slipper. Definitely NOT a size 10. Otherwise, they are plushy in the footbed and feel nice."
4.0,Ordered these for my Significant Other and she loves them.  She wears them regularly for me.
4.0,I purchased this sweater in size XL coffee my size is 192 5”8 the sweater is perfect only thing I don’t like about it is the pocket is a little hi up on the sweater and no bottoms that was the reason for the 4 star other than that I would recommend the color is very pretty
4.0,"I can't believe this suit worked - I've never bought a bathing suit online that I liked but this one was great.  Not high quality and probably won't last many seasons (fabric feels cheap, underwire for bra top already poking a bit) BUT for $23.00 and free shipping, I couldn't be happier!"
4.0,I'm only 105 pounds and 5'7. I'm very tiny and ordered a small. I'm sending it back for a medium. Hopefully the medium isn't as tight!
4.0,"If you have an Asian nose bridge, this is awesome! Works well for me with 52/16/135 measurements (52 lens size, 16 bridge, 135 length). One point down because I wish the plastic around the lens are little thinner. It looks a bit too nerdy for my taste with thick rim. Love it otherwise. Look real nice."
4.0,4☆☆☆☆<br />Not Bad !!! Good Quilty !!! Fits Well...
4.0,"The ""LARACE Long Cardigan for Women Lapel Coats with Pockets Chunky Oversized Sweaters Long Sleeve Tops Belted Winter Clothes"", is such a soft sweater. It feels very well made and is pretty flattering for a bigger person such as myself.<br /><br />The only real problem with this cardigan/sweater is there is no ""top belted"" to the piece. There are no loops and a belt is not sewed on either. It's not a belted cardigan/sweater, I don't hate it and am still going to wear it all the time but I think it needs to be renamed/listed on the product page. Overall, yes it's missing the belt part but it's super soft and flattering, and would recommend it to bigger people like myself."
4.0,Cull surface
4.0,This sweatshirt is nice. However the picture shows the neck is loose and it is not.  The strings are very long but I just cut them to my liking.  All in all is a very nice sweatshirt.
4.0,I really like this sports bra but it is a bit small around my rib area.
4.0,This is such a unique piece! Love it. Bought one for my Mother for Christmas and she loves it!
4.0,"Very cute, soft and nicely made but the pants were a bit short - almost Capri length."
4.0,Barely fit no extra give
4.0,"OK I didn't buy these sunglasses here but from another website because I could buy 2 for a lower price. So I bought 2 (both are black frame black lenses) and put one in the car and one in my purse. I'm neither a motorcycle rider nor an old lady nor someone with eye surgery, however I do like the convenience of being able to just put on the sunglasses (without changing to a different pair) when needed. I bought a pair of tortoise brown lenses fit over sunglasses long time ago because I thought they look more feminine. Yes they are but the problem of lighter lenses is that you can see your subscription eyeglasses too easily and that looks ugly (IMO). So I just use them in the car obviously and for outside the car I have photochromic eye glasses. I still love the photochromic glasses I own but too bad they don't work in the car at all and don't work well under bright California sun either. So I decided to get a pair with darker lenses to see how it works.<br /><br />These are great! I like the logo on the side and the medium size. While I do like the smaller size too I think they may not fit me well because of my somewhat big head/ face :P . And the greatest is that I couldn't see my eyeglasses easily even when I looked up close into the mirror when I was in the car! And what a GREAT price for polarized lenses! The only downside (why 4 stars) is that they do need a bit of adjustment when I put them on so they don't tend to slide down my face. I guess it's the design of the nose bridge area. The other fit overs sunglasses I have just &#34;click&#34; right in but these don't. But once I made the right adjustment, it fits well. And... they actually look pretty good, just like regular bigger size sunglasses :) I wish they would come up with a tortoise + grey/ black lenses too!<br /><br />So this is the review from a woman's perspective. :)"
4.0,"The ring is very heavy and larger than I would have thought, a good deal for the $$ and shipping, however it's way too big.  Not sure if it ran large or I just didn't have the right size.  I won't send it back as it was so cheap, I'm sure I'll find someone to give it to you."
4.0,"Felt sturdy enough for a leave-it-in-the-car type of umbrella, but in my opinion didn’t feel or look like it would survive a daily commute. Arrived with the plastic “button-like” cover (outside-top-center of umbrella, the little cap) cracked into two pieces, so it was returned."
4.0,"This set of bracelet is very colorful and fun to wear. It has some stretch and you can wear it easily. The girth could be more on the smaller side so it fits kids very well. The bracelets are just like those friendship bracelet so it has the cozy style and feeling. The strings are rather sturdy, looks like it can last long with proper wearing."
4.0,"Love this! I got it in a size L. For reference, I am 5'10 and weigh between 155-160 lbs. At first I was worried that the top would not fit since I have smaller breasts/bust, but it's perfect. The musty yellow really compliments my darker skin complexion"
4.0,Got it to wear to a football came and expected it to be see threw and crappy but wasnt at all! definitely worth the buy.
4.0,Very pretty 😍
4.0,"Only adjusts down, so will work great for smaller heads."
4.0,Beautiful Earrings!
4.0,This was a great find.  Lots of complements and its very comfortable.
4.0,"I got five compliments in one day. These are hot hot hot. Though, I have narrow feet, and still got blisters on the sides of the balls of my feet."
4.0,These are really cute and the stones are sparklier than I imagined.
4.0,"This bra was 1. Affordable and 2. Cute. Those are 2 words you never really associate with a G cup. I applaud Freya for making attractive options for bustier Girls, and I hope they keep it up. Unfortunately,  they did not hit it out of the park with this bra. While the cups fit properly, they present an odd breast shape, and the 34&#34; band fit loosely, more like a 36/38. I will likely still wear this bra, because it is cute, but it is not an option for daily wear."
4.0,"These chains are okay.  They're nice enough, but a bit flashier bright silver than other sterling silver chains I order... which made me unsure of their genuine quality.  To top it off, these are NOT stamped .925.  I know it states in the ad that they are, but they are not labeled as such on the actual chain.  Because of this uncertainty, I've been hesitant to sell them with my jewelry business.  So, I am testing one out with my personal use to see how they wear over time before selling.  Will update..."
4.0,"Love this dress, lots of stretch but runs small. Wish I had purchased a larger size, no time to return it, had to wear it.  Nice dress for a casual spring or summer outing."
4.0,"I asked my husband to try out this Men's Quartz Watch. He tested it over the course of a few days and said it was quite a good watch with a well-working chronograph stop watch feature, but that there were a few issues with the watch bracelet. First off, he was impressed with the way the watch looked right out of the box. The dial seemed well balanced and not cluttered even though it includes 3 sub dials and a date window. He noticed that the center sweeping second hand did not hit the second markers precisely, but my husband said that you rarely get that with quartz watches at this price point. The watch itself has a good solid weight. When he tested the chronograph stop watch feature, he found that the side pushers worked fine and the 3 chronograph sub dials functioned well. He set the watch according to his radio-controlled clock and the watch has not lost any time over the course of the last week. The watch also came with 2 extra batteries and a small tool. Overall, the watch looks good and works very well.<br /><br />The only negative issues have to do with the bracelet. First, you will definitely need to use a watch bracelet tool to resize the bracelet, or bring it in to a watch/jewelry store to have it done. The included watch tool really can't do the job on its own. Second, there are no micro-adjustments on this watch bracelet, so you have to measure the bracelet against your wrist correctly or it will be too tight or too loose and you'll have to resize the bracelet again. Still, my husband said that these issues occur with most watches with bracelets like this. The real issue is that the butterfly deployant clasp on this watch bracelet doesn't seem to close the way it's supposed to. You undo the butterfly deployant clasp by depressing the buttons on each side allowing the ""wings"" of the clasp to fall open, but you're supposed to be able to re-close the clasp just by snapping the wings back in. On the watch we received, my husband found that he had to depress the clasp buttons again to allow the wings to snap close again. This may be a design or manufacturing defect because none of my husband's other watches with deployant clasps seem to have this issue. I also did some online research regarding deployant clasps and confirmed that they are supposed to close the way my husband described. So all in all, good watch, but not so good bracelet."
4.0,Very flattering to your figure. I would definitely recommend this dress.
4.0,"We're doing the Camino de Santiago and wanted to get the Altus poncho.  We were concerned about waiting until our arrival in Spain and found these and decided to try them, especially since these ponchos are lighter than the Altus ones.<br /><br />So far, we're impressed with the details.  You can adjust the hood from the back so that the bill fits correctly for your face.  There's a loop and toggle button so that you can connect the poncho between your legs stopping the poncho from becoming a sail on a windy day.  One reviewer mentioned that the sleeves were too short, but they fit us fine.<br /><br />I'll update the review once we return but so far so good."
4.0,Small in the bust area.
4.0,"This isn't quite what I expected, but it's okay. It fits a little weird and the material is bulkier than I thought it would be. The sleeves are a little sloppy and it doesn't have a super flattering fit. Not a bad cardigan but not my favorite."
4.0,"I usually bye an X-Large which is sometimes a little loose. However, I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered the small/medium. I was really hesitant to do this, but it turned out to fit me very well."
4.0,"I was looking for a pair of gloves that were fairly thin, so I can carry out tasks, such as using my smart phone and tablet.  This works well for that.  Also, I use it when I'm driving,  it's gives me some warmth in the colder weather and it's comfortable enough to still turn the wheel"
4.0,Pretty good visor except the brim of the one I purchased got bent into a funny shape and it can be difficult to get it back to the shape you might want
4.0,It is really short because even tho it fit everywhere else my butt was completely out
4.0,"They're tights, they're stretchy, they're the colors they said they would be. They seem a little on the small side. Only had them a week so we'll see how they hold up over the summer dance lessons."
4.0,"Needed a skirt for an interview. This was perfect because it has a great shape/ structure/ length. Looked good.  Belt ring looks a little cheesy. I liked that it is not clingy like many pencil skirts are these days.  Material is thick, but it does pill easily. I do not think it will last long, but it worked for my interview and has a few more good wears. Trying to avoid washing because I don’t think it will make it through many bouts of laundering."
4.0,"Excellent band and it looks amazing, BUT - be not deceived, changing the links out on this bad bear will make you question everything you know about yourself, your religion, your family structure, the vote you cast in the last election.  It's mind-numbing and takes a surgeon's hand.  And just when you think you got it right, no, you either took out too many links or not enough, and you get to do it again.<br /><br />Once that's done, and you wipe the blood from your eyes, great band - looks great!"
4.0,"Beautiful rich color but the length is very long.  I'm only 5'4"" and they needed to be hemmed.  Would fit a tall woman perfectly right out the box."
4.0,"Super cute. Looks as pictured. I ordered a size up because I have broad shoulders, but I easily could have ordered a second size up because it's a little snug. But can't wait to wear it!"
4.0,Nicely made bracelet.  It’s a great gift idea!
4.0,"I am 5'7"" 145 lbs. I bought a medium and it was too big on me so I returned it. But this dress is adorable. I might order again in a size small."
4.0,"Good size, unique ring, great price, fits true to size."
4.0,"haven't worn it yet, may be a little heavier than I thought but I do love the way it looks!"
4.0,it was a little small but its rlly cute and i love the strawberries. Also has glitter embroidered into it which is okay but makes it a little uncomfortable.
4.0,I really liked these yoga socks! They come in fun colors and they fit great. The &#34;non slip&#34; part could have been better but still worked nicely and didn't fall apart.
4.0,"I love this shirt but I wished I had ordered a size larger. It fits, but I like a little bit more room."
4.0,"the material is noticeably cheap, so if you're looking to look good for a high net worth event..this is not the bag. I like it, but definitely not for work events"
4.0,I like this. They served the purpose I needed them for they weren't too big or too small.
4.0,Easy quick install but I liked the feel of Hirsh's more performance oriented straps like the Robby. The adjustment between holes was not as comfortable as the Robby strap by Hirsh.
4.0,"Beautiful but a little stiff, seems to run a little tight but will still wear."
4.0,Doesn't clip on or off u have to put it around ur head to get it on otherwise it works I like wearing it for work
4.0,I got the size 4T for my  27 month old daughter. It fit her perfectly. She loved it a didn't want to take it off the next morning! It sure looked comfortable and super cute! We live in a very warm part of the world and this is breathable enough to be worn on those warm summer nights.
4.0,"I love it.  When I saw the blouse, I was concerned that it was too small, but it fit perfectly."
4.0,This is a really cute face mask. The downside was there was a strong petroleum smell to it. I had to wash it at least 4 or 5 times before I felt safe enough to use it.
4.0,"I was Bob Ross for Halloween and this combo was perfect. I'm female; 5&#34;2, 125lb and it fit great. Everyone thought it looked very authentic. Comes with fro, beard, and mustache. You will need to buy face glue for the stache. I can see how the beard can be snug on some people, especially large males or females with larger faces. The afro can be picked out to make it more round and pouffy."
4.0,"I've had several of these over the years.  The watches last quite well, it's usually the strap that breaks first, and it's easier to buy a new watch than replace the strap."
4.0,My 15yo tennis player wears it every day. The ball is cheap plastic and fell off but honestly I like it better without it. She is more a sporty girl than a girlie girl and she really likes it. Quality otherwise is good.
4.0,"Fun color changing, good for any fortnite fan but letters do start to peel off rather quickly. Just fabric glie or super glue, back on at first notice; but would be nice if they didn't peel off quite so fast."
4.0,I have gotten so many compliments from this. And I wear it with anyting.
4.0,"I really like the way this dress looks on me, but beware that if you are large chested, the opening hangs open WIDE. I will need to put a pin or something to bring it closer together as it does not look flattering there, but otherwise it's really pretty fabric."
4.0,I ordered a large and the fit was snug to my body
4.0,"Good construction with lots of pockets for all my stuff. I love the style, the only drawback is the strap is too short and I will have to extend the strap myself to fit my 5'8"" height. Overall I like the price, color, style, and construction."
4.0,Pretty knit sweater. Very thin and a bit boxy. Definitely a hand wash only item. True white in color. Perfect to toss on over summer items as we transition into fall.
4.0,The bracelet is cute. I'm giving this as a Christmas gift to my mother from her grandchildren. It hasn't been worn yet but I hope the bracelet stays shiny and the diamonds want fall out.
4.0,"This product is really cool. It's been keeping my purses off of the floor and my closet uncluttered. The hangers are a little bigger than the width of my door, so we had to add some cardboard to keep it from moving. Once we got it secured, it's been a wonderful addition to my closet!"
4.0,Nice sweatshirt! The material is light weight and fuzzy on the inside. It is a mix of cotton and polyester so it shouldn't shrink too much. I ordered up a size and was glad that I did because it is a little form fitting.
4.0,Love these shirts to wear underneath another shirt but they are not very long
4.0,Very cute! I like the pearls.
4.0,"I was happy with my purchase, I should have went a size up just to safe. But it fit my 19 year old perfect. Great color.and hasn't faded. Since I bought it I have lost a lil weight and the shirt fits good, a large and I'm 5'3 about 145-150. It has good length and just enough stretch but does not get baggy while wearing it."
4.0,Love the length which is usually an issue for my shortness. Fits perfectly but the chest area is tight I am a 36c and ordered a small.
4.0,"I was looking for more of a Baroque shape. These are very oval-shaped. Pretty, and the color is very nice, but I wanted more of what the picture looked like."
4.0,"Nice looking work shoes, but they are little bit too stiff and fit bigger than expected. Reasonable price. I will give a try for couple weeks"
4.0,"The cut of this top is good and will flatter most.  It hangs nicely and can be tied closed or left open.  It is hip length so it goes best over a dress or with a tank and jeans or shorts.<br /><br />I have the red color way of this kimono which is printed to look like different swatches of different fabrics.  I really like most things about this top except for one of the patterns used in this version.  I've included a close up picture.  While the colors are nice, its a picture of the Eiffel tower and a cart with the word &#34;sale&#34;.  I feel like the addition of the novelty print with the other florals makes this less stylish than it would be otherwise. There's also a part of the pattern with hearts.  If you like these parts of the print, then this will be winner."
4.0,Cute and fits well. Good quality
4.0,"Super cute and comfy but the back is so low and the dress so loose and flowy that anyone as tall as your shoulders can potentially see down the back..still great for a cover up, over leggings or to lounge around the house. If you wear with any sort of bottoms, the open back isnt an issue"
4.0,This is fine for what it was bought for.  Be sure you measure your wrist or arm size. Mine is just a little too big and wants to slide down my arm.
4.0,Very pretty and looks really god on but sizing is a little small... Im a 9 and all my rings i have are 9 but the 9 i ordered was about 1 size too small
4.0,The color is a little more drab than the color shown.  The construction is fine.
4.0,"When I ordered this item it was to put the fear into those around my cosplay, and it didn't disappoint. As I entered the con the first thing I had to do was check it in at a weapons check station, the people there feared it's size, bit after explaining my expertise they let it go.<br />I received many comments on it's size, bit none were disappointed. If you are in the need of a large cleaver, think of purchasing this one since you or those that you are with will not be disappointed."
4.0,"It fit ok on me since I’m jumping around Small and Medium, just wish it would have been tighter a little bit since the material has already quite sketchy. Great product with simple and classic look tho!"
4.0,"really cute outfit, gets a lot of compliments. The shorts with the tassels are especially cute. The only down side is itsna set. You can't buy them individually if you need different sizes for shirt and shorts."
4.0,"The top isn't as long as it looked in the pictures, more of a crop top. Material is soft and warm."
4.0,"It's nice for the price.  The fabric is little strange, but has a nice feel.  I got the white and it is a bright white.  Good size and sheer... Nice for summer."
4.0,"This shirt fit a little looser than I expected, but no so much so that I wanted to return it for a smaller size. For reference I am 5'0&#34; weigh around 145 and have a size 36C chest. I ordered the shirt in a medium, but probably could've got away with a small. It is a very flowy style, so if you want something a little more fitted, I suggest going down a size.<br />It doesn't really come down far in the front or back, it only drapes low on the sides, so... not really something to be worn with leggings. It does look great paired with tight pants/jeans and a shrug though, and perhaps throw on a scarf for a nice Fall outfit.<br />The shirt itself is very comfortable, and feels good on. I washed in cold water and hung to dry."
4.0,"These earrings are tiny. I personally love tiny earrings. I have lots of ear piercings in both ears though, so I don’t want an earring that will overwhelm the other diamonds in my ears. These are perfect. For the price, I expected the emeralds to have more inclusions and not be as deep a green. These are very classy and elegant. But again, they’re small. So don’t expect a large, dangly earring."
4.0,"I love this dress! It has just the perfect amount of stretch and the color is just as pictured. Only downfall, both pockets had holes in them that I had to stitch up."
4.0,The pajamas fit as expected and the colors were bright. My grandson was very excited about these pjs.
4.0,"Beautiful scarf, nice ruched detailing. It was exactly what I wanted, and what a price! I highly recommend this scarf!"
4.0,The color is great and material is soft.<br />Small fitted well for a  petite me (5.1’ ;100lbs).
4.0,"be sure to wear skin-tone underwear; they're definitely sheer when you put them up to a light, but not so bad when you're wearing them."
4.0,"I sized up and it's a big big on me, we shall see after I wash and dry.  Love the colors and it's really cute on."
4.0,"I really like the look of the case. It is very hard to open.  The hinge is very tight so need to pry it open and then it snaps shut hard.  The liner of the case isn't glued in very well, so had to fix that.  Overall, I like it."
4.0,This is really cute. It's pretty large on my wrist but my wrist are pretty small. The groove is shallow so it is hard to get the hair tie on there with one hand but once it's on there it stays. I haven't worn it a long time but the time I have worn it it's comfortable. Will update if changes.<br /><br />I received this product for free or a discount in return for my honest review.
4.0,"Brought to wear at a concert , but unfortunately the concert was postponed because two members of the band came down with Covid, I’m sure the masks will come in handy eventually when the concert finally happens"
4.0,"Same color as the picture, cute and medium in size."
4.0,Nice lightweight athletic shorts. There is no drawstring and ergo no way to adjust them. :( They keep sliding down my sons waist. Not for skinny kids!!!
4.0,Very comfy. Love how it looks on
4.0,"I have the bag just two weeks.  So far, I am totally thrilled with it.<br />Looks nice and fits all that I need to go in it.  Also has a few small pockets."
4.0,"I like this ... I really need a smaller size that can fit in most of my pocketbooks.  Also, it is only one-sided.  I wish the grids (bands) were on both sides."
4.0,I liked the earrings a lot when they came and they look nice. The only problem is that a stud is glued out of place but that's okay because that stud is towards the back and you can't really see it.
4.0,"This is a very nice bathing suit, fits a little large but is pretty good quality."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress! It makes your shoulders look great and comes in at your waste just enough. However, I only washed it ONCE (delicate cycle, air dry) and the fabric looks really worn already. Very disappointing because I really liked the dress."
4.0,my 4 year old niece loves it.
4.0,Good quality .durable and comfortable .
4.0,"Was Narcissa for Halloween, perfect dress for the costume!"
4.0,They're just adorable!
4.0,"Good quality, fairly comfortable, would recommend for a cheap pair of gym/shower soles."
4.0,"The pattern on the fabric was very pretty, but the cut was not flattering on my size 2 daughter. The leg holes were cut quite high. We gave it to a friend who is a size 0, and it looked better on her."
4.0,The shoe is a bit bulky.  The skate is hard to use.  We had to Youtube it and still have not got it yet.
4.0,Nice bracelet.  Arrived quickly and as expected.
4.0,Purchased for daughter braids she love a it switches up all the time beautiful and fun
4.0,These are great glasses for a women’s face. They are thin and fit snug.
4.0,Great grocery bags.
4.0,"True to size, great product"
4.0,Rust after a while
4.0,Loose but it Okay.
4.0,"Loved it so much, I ordered it twice!"
4.0,It was nice dress.
4.0,This keychain set is really cute! They seem to be well made. It is pretty easy getting the keyring off the photo keychain so a photo can go in. The picture shows how the keychains arrived.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Good product. My only one concern is the stripes is too short for my 4 years old son. I bought 4 months ago and they are already too tight.
4.0,"Worked for a night, but not for anyone with lengthy nails- they rip right through."
4.0,"These are so comfortable. I was worried, when reading other reviews, but they never fell down, and I received  lots of compliments on them. I wore black boot shoes, and these cover the tops perfectly. I will be wearing these around the house, too, when the weather gets cold."
4.0,"It fit as expected for me, BUT my boobs are a bit too big for how low the shirt was cut. When I move my arms just a little too much, my bra is exposed. I am a 38C."
4.0,"I got the watch yesterday. It keeps time, it looks nice but I have several points that disturb me:<br />1- I found the very same watch cheaper at Aliexpress, and one gets an extra watch band.<br />2- In fact all pagani watches are cheaper at Aliexpress. Amazon should not accept this.<br />3- The bracelet is rough around the edges, it keeps catching hair and pinching. A better finish is needed...badly<br />4- luminescence is very weak, one can hardly see anything in the dark.<br />Apart from these, everything is good<br /><br />Jack"
4.0,"Very pretty, although I expected it to be much larger."
4.0,Very pretty.  I do like it a lot.  The top clasp is a bit tight for me and may take a bit of getting used to.
4.0,Arrived as expected and on time. They were gifts for grandchildren.
4.0,Very pretty and received me complaints when wearing
4.0,"This product looked absolutely adorable on me for Halloween, I just wish I had ordered a size up though since it does run a little small. Ordered and got a Large when I should have gotten an XL. But other than that, it worked and was very comfortable!"
4.0,Was a gift; the picture looks good.
4.0,Nice fit bit sleeves are REALLY small! I bought a L and I wear a M but the sleeves are still too tight...could be my chunky arms though lol
4.0,Good product. I just expected it to be smaller and it feels a bit heavy. Still the product does look like the picture and didn't give me any issues.
4.0,"It was a long time before I got it. I have it today, and it is a warm and nice leather jacket. It is real lambskin. If the shipping was better, this would be the perfect jacket."
4.0,Buy one size up!
4.0,"These shoes were a perfect addition to my spring and summer wardrobe. They are comfortable and lightweight for casual outings, but I wouldn't wear them for long walks or to an amusement park. The material does feel a bit plasticky, but it doesn't bother me. They were affordable and fit my foot well. I do tend to have wider feet, and I was pleasantly surprised that the strap over my toes worked well! If you have narrower feet, this might not be the shoe for you because the strap might be too large."
4.0,"I bought these gloves for my full-time job.  I work in an office.  I am the only female, and they have the thermostat set for the heater to go on when it is 68, and the a/c to come on when it gets to 72.  Since I am in front of the door (the whole front wall is nothing but windows)(floor to ceiling windows), my area can barely get to 70, before the a/c comes on.  When the a/c comes on, my area falls to 64 (that's with a heater under my desk, and a heater behind me).  These gloves help to keep my fingers from being frozen so I can type.  From the picture I was worried about them being too tight on my hands, but they aren't.  They are actually quite comfortable. In fact I have even ended up wearing these at my 2nd part-time job where temperatures are reasonable, just because I have gotten used to them.<br /><br />About a week after receiving the gloves from here on Amazon, I went to the actual gloves online site, and ordered a dozen.  Since these only come in white, they get dirty very easily.  My husband dyed some for me, so that helps a little bit.  I would recommend these gloves.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the price.  With shipping, the first pair cost almost $11."
4.0,"Love the color and shape, but the size was bigger than I expected. Ended up feeling too large for my face so I gave them to my brother, but he loves them. They’ve lasted 5 months now with no obvious signs of wear. Cheap and simple sunglasses!"
4.0,This is a cute top however it's too small and too short.  I ordered an XL which is 1 size to big and it still did not fit.  In the picture the shirt looks like it is longer than what it really is as well. Bummer deal I really wanted to wear it.
4.0,"I ordered a medium but 100% could fit a small. I have a smaller chest and don’t fill out the chest area at all, so it is a little bit baggy there, but you really can’t tell. The hot pink color is so bright and I got a lot of compliments on it! It is comfortable."
4.0,Dress fit well on my body although it was much shorter than expected. Is a bit shorter than represented in the picture.
4.0,These beads made a good birthday  present . They are well-made and colorful.
4.0,"i like the design. slips off from my hair, though, when i use it as a head band (but i think it just my type of hair 🤔... straight asian ☺️).<br /><br />worked as the other ways to use it, though."
4.0,Just when I needed them.
4.0,Used as liners for additional warmth under mittens.
4.0,"Bought this to go with my outfit at pride with the idea in my head that I'd be able to fit my phone inside.... I was wrong, the phone couldn't fit but I still wore it for small trinkets like lip glass and my compact."
4.0,Color is much lighter then picture. It is actually a baby blue but still my son loves that they light up. Mine did not come with charger like it says either.
4.0,Mom Loves it. Dress does not naturally hang off of shoulder. You might have to stretch it
4.0,slim. and holds enough. only 'drawback' is if you have credit cards in it (and who wont) it leaves an imprint on opposite side
4.0,First impression:  Lovely printed patterns. Nice quality.
4.0,"The stone was quite nice, with small red flecks. Unfortunately, they were so small that you couldn't see them unless you were holding it in the light and squinting at it, though. The stone was also a very odd shape, not round and filling the metal cage like the image shown, but still nice looking.<br /><br />The cord is adjustable (so you can wear it really short if you wish) which I wasn't expecting and really liked. It also came with a paper explaining how to cleanse and energize the stone, which was neat.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a nice necklace; I just wish the stone filled the cage better or had a more interesting coloration (bloodstones vary a lot) to compensate."
4.0,I received a lot of compliments wearing this dress. It is very light material and very comfortable. I also love the fact that this dress has pockets so it allows me to put like things such as my phone or keys we should ask for convenience.
4.0,This a very pretty set. Excellent customer service as well.
4.0,Well constructed and useful as a jacket liner.  Legit North Face $149  retail tag attached. Very thin and not &#34;puffy&#34; if that's what you are looking for.  Just a guess but maybe good for adding about 10° F of warmth ... I found an odd color priced at $45 so it was a very good buy.  Wait for more than a half-price drop and grab it. I'm 6 feet 170 lbs and a large fits right. Very happy with purchase.
4.0,"Nice watch! Easy to read and looks sharp.  However, it is REALLY big!  Ideal for bigger men or men with larger arms."
4.0,Really a Pretty dress. I am a petite size so will have to hem about 3 inches. The zipper was stuck to material when I received the dress. I'm hoping I don't have this issue when I wear the dress. I'm sure to have positive raves at the venue.
4.0,Good quality. Good for.
4.0,"Incredible ring, strong and unwavering. However, the paint is poor quality and will rub off of the runes on the side."
4.0,"It works but for winter wear it may not be as warm as I may like.  Having said this, it looks good on."
4.0,"This is great quality but seems really large!  I hope this fits my husband properly,  he's not a small guy either.  It just seems really long for a beanie.  We will see after he opens it on Christmas! Will update my review."
4.0,Very large for a boy. The directions are a bit hit or miss. Would prefer a date option rather than the time twice on the face. But well made overall.
4.0,"Very light and comfortable but spandex like Material. Its kind of shiny, if they dulled it down a bit and made it looked more like cotton it would be perfect."
4.0,Very cute. Bigger than I thought it would be.
4.0,"Somewhat cheap fabric, but still nice.  You know when you cut a cotton shirt and because the ends aren't seen they start kind of curling up - I feel like that's what happens with this shirt.  It's still cute and comfortable though."
4.0,Item just as advertised.  Buckle is very massive and the belt is thick.  There is a lot of material here.  Deeply embossed.  Seems well built.  Did not give five stars as I just received it and do not know how durable it is.
4.0,Hubiese preferido q el zipper llegará hasta hasta el final del cuello de la camisa.
4.0,"Have you ever purchased a shoe/boot and the fit was perfect from day one? This is probably the most comfortable first time wearing boot I have ever purchased. I used the sizing chart and ordered the recommended size, which is actual larger than what I normally wear.<br />I prefer leather because I’m pretty hard on shoes. The leather is extremely soft and the lining keeps my feet warm. The only drawback is that I stumbled and now the toe portion of the sole is slightly detached."
4.0,"Normalmente soy talla S, pero en este modelo no había talla S así que pedí una M. No me quedó se la dí a mi mamá.  Pero es un modelo muy bonito, a ella le gustó"
4.0,"Cute shirt, sleeves were a little looser at wrists than I expected but overall I'm happy with it."
4.0,"Color and style of the dress are very nice. Can be worn in formal settings.<br />The tie around the neck is MUCH too large (and I don't have a tiny neck) so it looks stretched out and worn. Material seems good quality and washes easily. It also fits great (aside from the neck) and is very comfortable! Honestly if it weren't for the neck looking so stretched out, I would probably rate it 5 stars. It was that way even before washing and I didn't notice a difference afterward, I think they just got the sizing of it a bit off."
4.0,"I have small feet so find it hard to get shoes that fit well.  With just an insole, the boots fit OK.  I really do love them and have gotten lots of compliments."
4.0,To wear on light days.  Not too cold.
4.0,Not the quality I was expecting
4.0,"Yes, like the way it fits"
4.0,They fit good. They are cute looking. Better in person then in the picture
4.0,It looks nice but I've noticed that the zippers come apart easily when zipped.
4.0,"The quality was not great, but the price was very inexpensive. I wish they would have had a few in bigger sizes.  The rings were pretty small sizes."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but very convenient and portable.
4.0,"Beautiful print and very comfortable fabric, but ran super big. Kept it to use as a maternity shirt but never grew big enough to fit it. Order a size or 2 down."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet !
4.0,"They are good but in this new world where you need smartphone all the time, it is annoying as you need to remove them often"
4.0,"Great shoe. Soft inside, does have a zipper on the side to make it easy to put on and off. However this is more a girls shoe cause there is glitter on the top. But not enough to make it real noticeable from a distance."
4.0,"Cute and soft, good for growing out bangs, definitely more yellow/green than tan if tan was what you were looking for."
4.0,it was given as a gift
4.0,"Its a nice pice of jewelry, but the pearls are smaller than what they appear to be on the picture."
4.0,"I have a 5 year old and twin 3 year old girls who are all in love with their new earrings.  The only issue we had was telling the difference between the clear pair and the lavender.  I contacted the seller, thinking that we had gotten two clear by accident.  They told me that they believe that the lavender is so light that it may look clear.  Despite that, they were so nice to offer to send out another pair!  Great customer service!  Even though they believe they sent the right order, they sent a new pair because I thought there was a mix up.  We are happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I purchased these suspenders thinking I would be dressing up as Misti from Pokemon for a half marathon, but plans change. Still good quality (for costuming or for play), and I'll use the bow tie for Mary Poppins or something. Wouldn't recommend for a fancy event because slightly lower quality is apparent. You get what you pay for."
4.0,A little wide but still work.
4.0,on the small side
4.0,"Probably could have sized down from L to M (I'm 5'6"", 195lb). This style felt like a maternity dress to me"
4.0,Giving these to my daughter maybe?
4.0,I love this jacket although it does run large. I normally wear medium but small fits just right.
4.0,"Obviously, this is really knock-off and cheap, but I think it was worth it for 8USD.  I couldn't find any Mario jibbitz for cheaper."
4.0,The material is very see through!
4.0,Fits but a little smaller cup size than expected.
4.0,"These bunny ears came very fast and in great condition.  They look much better than the ones I used to get at Walmart.  They are as described and as shown in the picture.  My son and his grandma like them, too."
4.0,"The costume is well made but the top is not for busty women. It does not run true to size. You will need to go at least one size up. If you're an 18, forget it."
4.0,I really like this top. Fits nice and the colors are great.
4.0,The fit of the tux is fine and as expected. However the fabric is of low quality and it's a nightmare to get wrinkles out. I eventually gave up on that part after an hour and just hoped nobody noticed.
4.0,I think it would look good on anyone. Will probably get another color too
4.0,"Husband loves them! When we received them, the decorative edge on one of the socks was fraying slightly. It wasn't too noticeable, my husband wore them away."
4.0,Awesome for the price !
4.0,It is a great looking wallet. I am glad I purchased it.
4.0,It's ok. I bought for my neice who loves to play dress up and now loves the movie Raya. It look a little cheap but I'm sure she will like it.
4.0,The color on these is great. I got a 5/6 for my 5 year old (who is on the tall and skinny side) and they fit well with plenty of room for her to get taller. The fabric is thin but very soft. I wouldn't suggest them for outdoor play since it seems like they'd get holes pretty easily but they'd be fine for wearing around the house or just around on errands. I haven't tried washing them yet but will always wash on delicate with cold water and dry on low as similar fabrics I've had are quite sensitive to heat.
4.0,"I originally ordered a 2XL as per the sizing, but they were too large. I usually wear a large and have a 42"" chest so everything said go up two sizes and the sizing chart suggested 2XL. when I got the shirts they were baggie so I replaced them with the XL. I'm 6'3"" 210lb 42"" chest and 34"" waist and the XL is pretty good. They are a little warmer than I expected, but overall they are pretty comfortable."
4.0,The masks are awesome they come quick and fit you as long as you are not some overweight bam bam bigelow looking dude. awesome company this other reviewer needs to hook up to a treadmill asap.
4.0,"This hat is lighter than a baseball cap and fits comfortably on my 7 1/4"" bald head (although a strong gust of wind may carry it away). I took one star away because it arrived wrinkled even though it was packed with a plastic insert/shaper, in a ziploc type bag, and Amazon box with ample space. After putting it in the dishwasher and air drying it (forum said Lids recommended this) the wrinkles were still there. I ended up steam ironing on medium to smooth out the wrinkles. Despite the extra work, I like the look of this hat and recommend it for summer wear."
4.0,My daugher liked it...was short though..Nice..but what is that 2&#34; zipper for under the arm of shirt?
4.0,I'm a big guy and it fit perfectly.<br />Also the print is dooooooope
4.0,"Great fit, very flattering.  I am 5'4 and the 30' inseam is a bit too short for heels but only just a bit."
4.0,"Very nice.  Long enough,  but not over long."
4.0,I got this for my mom and she  loved it. now all the ladies at the hair shop want one.
4.0,"Online the color of the shirt I selected is called blue, but it looks purple. The shirt I received is definitely blue - like a heather blue. It fits me like a size large ... except I ordered XXL as I like to wear my shirts loose! The dark stitching reminds me of my pjs. The v-neck is nice, the sleeve length is fine, and the material feels good. I'm on the fence with this one - I'll wear it, but I doubt I'd buy the same shirt again. Overall it's still a nice shirt, just size up a few sizes when ordering."
4.0,Wonderful color and clairity.  True to size.
4.0,"Shorts fit well and feel great. Material is thin and light, good for hot days."
4.0,"Comfy, fitted, flexible yoga pants. Decent quality and soft. Mild compression."
4.0,Chose these mostly for the color. Lenses are not dark enough for me to wear in the sun. Frame seems sturdy.
4.0,Smallish for 6 years old boy
4.0,I have purchased this type of wallet for many years and was thrilled that this one had the RFID protection.  My last one was this exact model except no RFID.  The leather was not as soft this time though and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
4.0,"Works great over my high necked swim suit. It has pockets! The pockets are handy, but I wouldn't trust my phone to not fall out."
4.0,"Did not expect it to be so short. Next time I will pay attention to size. It’s short. Other than that, quality is good."
4.0,This set is pretty but much smaller then expected for the price.
4.0,not as smooth as it looks in the picture. The edges are a little rough.
4.0,It actually looks a little TOO big when I'm wearing it.  The bill is a little oversized.  But it looks and fits much better than those so-called &#34;one-size-fits-all&#34; hats. They look ridiculous on me and they are uncomfortable to wear.  This hat fits my large head comfortably.
4.0,"This hat is of great quality, and has a size adjustment inside. I originally bought it for my 3 year old's Halloween costume, and he continues to wear it for dress up, and when we watch ""Fantasia"". The hat holds it's shape pretty well, though the ears are a little floppier than I'd like. It seems to be comfortable to wear (it doesn't fit my head, so I'm judging by my kids reaction). Would recommend to others."
4.0,"Got this for a Halloween boat party... I ordered a medium it fit perfect I'm 5'4 and 153 lbs. Item was as pictured the only problem was the arm straps were loose and leg strap velcro would not stick,  ended up having to tie a knot at the party but overall great costume"
4.0,Adorable and comfy. They are a bit cuter in person. Fur is nice and plush. Made me smile. Fair quality.
4.0,Nice band I just wish they were a little wider.
4.0,"I LOVE my leggings! I ordered 4X the first time and they were too big! So I returned and went down to the 2X and they’re snug, but since I’m working out I wanted them that way because I want to have them for a while. I have wide hips (53”)and getting them over my hips is a bit of resistance but other than that, they fit perfectly everywhere else. I ordered 4 pair of black but ended up with 3 black and 1 grey, which annoyed me but it’s all good. However, I did notice that the grey has no give, so I can’t wear them yet, so I would say those run smaller than the black. But I’m going to keep them since I am on a weight loss journey. I hope this helps!"
4.0,"Sized a little big, but great quality! Has held up wash after wash."
4.0,"the pants are comfortable and easy to wear.  I like them.  I would advise people to buy a size up though.  I did so just to be able to wear some leggings under and it is snug across the hip area.  So make sure you see the ""inches"" that the sizing gives you.  I am enjoying them."
4.0,"This outfit is sized accurately and the headband is matched to the pants, but it is just fabric sewn in a strip with no elastic.  I doubt it will stay on a baby's head."
4.0,Adorable polyester top.  Pretty print and just the right amount of flare at the bottom (not tent-like).
4.0,"Yes, I love them!"
4.0,A very nice quality belt.  It is exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,i liked how light they were and the colors of lenses were nice
4.0,"I actually bought these to wear at work when I’m cold and don’t feel like wearing a jacket. Rather than use them for cooling, I’m using them to keep my arms a bit warmer. They work to that end in warming me up a bit, although they’d never be the same as having a jacket. They are very fitted and tight when I get them over my elbows. I couldn’t get them too far above my elbows and after having them on all day my upper arm was sore from the tight fit. They are a nice spandex material without looking too casual so they are ok for work. Overall, I’m fairly happy with what I got for the price."
4.0,These are not dark blue... unless I got the wrong pair.  Impressive packaging.Comes with cleaner spray and cloth. And holding sack of other lenses.. Ikpn should list the reflective % of their lenses.
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but still cute❤
4.0,Definitely smaller than I thought but I think that is a good thing! Fits in my husbands pocket great and hold everything his last wallet did only more compact. Easy to use and my money doesn't fall out. I feel like it keeps everything safe and secure.
4.0,"Great, other than a little bit expensive for a poster and some stickers"
4.0,"Can't argue with Da Bears, but I didn't realize how &#34;wordy&#34; it was. Guess I should look more closely. This was a gift for my son in law, a Bears fan."
4.0,Slightly disappointed with the durability on the lenses. They were great until they had a slight fall and ended up with an awful thick scratch.
4.0,"really like the pattern but they fit more like a Med/L than an L/XL listed.  I can still wear them but just barely, luckily they are well stitched so I can pull them on easily.  It is kind of weird to wear a sleeve that makes your skin feel cooler than when it was bare."
4.0,"Item is very pretty, however the clip at the back got bend a little and thus it is not clamping properly at the front."
4.0,"If I didn't have this I could never get my favorite bracelet on by myself, but it is still somewhat clumsy to use. and takes about 3 tries before I am successful."
4.0,First watch that started my husbands watch obsession. He loves it!
4.0,"Great colors and material. Love the way it fits. Do not get unless you have small boobs. I'm a 34C, ordered a Medium, and the material made to cover the boobs just wasn't strong enough to keep my boobs from popping out the bottom of the suit."
4.0,"I love these, but I had a problem. My ear lobes are at a 4g and as such I ordered a pair in 4g. When the earrings arrived, one earring was 4g, but the other was 6g. They were visibly different sizes. So hence the minus 1 star. I’m disappointed since I had to return them, but the quality was very nice and they are very easy to put in."
4.0,"A little tight in the boob area, I wear a 36D, but other than that its a pretty comfy dress."
4.0,"A very nice little piece. Not as polished and perfectly fitted together as you might find at a Paris jewelry store, but really pleasant to hold and regard. Proportions are perfect, and although it is cute as the dickens, the solid weight makes it feel very substantial. I should note that when I received it, the promised bracelet was not included. Amazon ended up giving me a 20% refund for the missing item."
4.0,It is what you pay for but is a nice alternative then a custom made for recognition of years
4.0,These are great for my son to protect his neck from the sun because he works outside. They are also a snap to hand wash and line dry!! Love the colorful assortment as well!!
4.0,It is great though 3mm still long for me.. not returning i might cut an inch then punch a 2 more holes..
4.0,Nothing I disliked about it. Everything I liked about it.
4.0,Great conversation starter! My son wore this to an appointment and older boy started talking to him about Jelly. Who happens to me my son’s idol!!!! This made my son proud. I wish it was just a little bigger. Washed well.<br /><br />Looks like image.
4.0,"They were a nice fit,  I have a small waist and big butt.  I wish they were thicker fabric though, too revealing.5"
4.0,"I purchased this necklace for a birthday gift. It is well made, very pretty, and came with a nice gift box. Perfect item for any sloth lover."
4.0,Wish it was a little bigger but still was a very cute and sturdy piece!♡
4.0,"Arrived with 2 stones lose but nothing glue gun couldn't fix. Otherwise it's a big, beautiful, statement necklace. Added that extra bling to my great gatsby dress. Just be aware unless your neck is super skinny, it doesn't fit around your neck as pictured."
4.0,Price is right. Nice colors. Just wish they were a little longer.
4.0,I like it very nice just like the picture
4.0,"Nice dress made with quality material.<br /><br />The fit was pretty good, I wish it was a little shorter. But those looking for a knee length dress, this is perfect for you!"
4.0,I should have ordered a bigger size bit they work
4.0,Only went on a few hikes with this but it has held up very well. only down side I thought I could get it to compact a little more for when I am just going on a simple hike but I would Rather have it ready for the larger ones I did not get to test the rain proof part as thankfully it did not rain on our hikes. My husband likes it better that his and is thinking of getting one for himself
4.0,I ordered the size up since I read the reviews that said it comes small. It fit me as a medium would (ordered large).
4.0,This is a pretty little watch.  I have average sized wrists and it'll sometimes catch my skin since it's a stretch style band.  I'm just sayin'.  I still wear it happily.
4.0,these are a bit thicker than others that I have ordered on Amazon so they seem as if they will hold up longer
4.0,Fit is still to big.
4.0,A little long. Pulls up to where my breast were removed and hugs me.
4.0,Not exactly what I was looking for. Heavier than I thought.
4.0,I adore the pattern and it's really comfortable to wear. It isn't too tight and the fabric is really soft. Though it may be too loose to wear all night which is why I got it. I guess we'll see.
4.0,Great product and great company to work with.
4.0,This is a nice quality dress but a little thin. It's just jersey tee shirt material and wasn't flattering on me so I returned it.
4.0,likethem
4.0,"Nice size purse, will hold a lot of products necessary for us to carry. It did have a slight odor to it but I think that was from the storage bag, it does go away after a few days.<br />Color was exact. It wears very well."
4.0,The only negative is that the bottoms seem to be 2 sizes larger than the top.  I'd like them a bit smaller - I could fit two of me in the bottoms and they were about 4 inches too long and needed hemming but they're still really comfortable.  No shrinkage after a hot water wash and dry but I'd buy them again.
4.0,"I didn't get the matching daughter dress, but I do love the adult one that I ordered. My only reason for not making it 5 star is that there seem to be separation of the stitching after just one use (location is where the white belt meets the blue material under the breasts). I temporarily fixed it with double sided fashion tape, but I doubt that will hold up once washed. Either way, this dress was comfy and VERY cute!"
4.0,"Brothers head measured around like 23&#34;, so I got the large/ex large hat and it was a little big, but med wouldn't work.  So he is wearing it loose."
4.0,"Warm with good pockets!  Only down side is they don’t hide cellulite well..so if you have much, be aware!"
4.0,Fit as expected for this type of tank. Was fitted but not super small. They are a lighter weight material perfect for layering. I'm happy with this tank and will be ordering more.
4.0,"It is just fine, though this review is being asked before I have laundered it. I will know how I like it after I have laundered it and hopefully it will still wear the same."
4.0,"Great price for bridesmaid gift. The chain isn’t the best quality, but it is affordable and cute jewelry overall."
4.0,The band fits the Timex weekender well and it makes it blend with your clothes if the factory band is to loud in color for you.
4.0,Great once you get them installed. Gets finger prints on viewing lenses when installing. Still like them. Spring loaded ones on sides would be better.
4.0,"I have a few of these now in multiple colors and love it. I am a 38DDD, and have plenty of support while feeling very sexy."
4.0,"Im going to do a  Thorough review for all those looking to buy this and want to know before hand if it will be worth the purchase, either for you or as a gift to a significant other! I’ll be honest about how I feel wearing it and give you my thoughts on what you should expect!<br /><br />I am a 36c-36D with a slim hourglass figure but my hips and rib cage and kind of wide for my 5’ 4” height and 140lb weight. I got the medium based on the size chart givens<br /><br />I should have bought the small because the material stretches comfortably. With the medium there is enough stretch where I have to use the tightest hooks to have it snug on me but I think I would have preferred it tighter without using the furthest hooks, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I think I would have also been happier if the vertical fabric supports on the bra had bone or a wire in them (since they wrinkle up a lot while wearing it) but for the quality of what it is, having it all made out of fabric makes it easier to maintain and wash.<br /><br />I mostly like set because of the style and look. The fact that the sheer fabric stretches is also a plus while not being stiff that I can’t bend over or move around in it.<br /><br />The panties are honestly not as functional as the bra is, in the set (the bottoms are all mesh (perhaps if you have sensitive skin in the bikini area it could prove irritating) but I expected that already). IF you want to be that kind of girl for your... “appointments...” and match, you’re going to look super Hot and flirty.<br /><br />Over all, I like it. It’s functional to a point but I’m not going to be wearing it all day since it’s mostly for show and not comfort."
4.0,Very nice liked it a lot !
4.0,Product was great! Thanks!
4.0,Thinner than i expected for the proce
4.0,"This is a good basic to have, fits a little weird around my chest but still works"
4.0,somewhat small but I like it<br />looks good
4.0,Liked the price but the quality could be better.
4.0,"Nice material and nicely made. Just no way it is made for up to a size 10. I am 5'8&#34; and typically wear a small to medium in Victoria Secret tshirt/tanks. it was too tight to be able to pull over shoulders as pictured and sleeves were 3/4 length on me. So if you are tiny it would be so cute. I'm hoping it fits my 8yr old step daughter, I bet it would be cute over a tank top on her."
4.0,"Fits well, but it moves very easily while being used. Using on a 2001 Dodge Ram. Looks really nice, and it went on really easily.  Seems like it’ll last awhile"
4.0,It's a little small for my tummy area but fits alright to do what it needs to do.
4.0,"I only like them because of the lights, but I've only owned them a week and haven't had the chance to see them &#34;not work&#34; like the other reviewers say. Vegas next week!"
4.0,"While this is a very cute dress, it is EXTREMELY short.  We had a theme day at work and this dress worked perfectly. I'm just super self-conscious about everything and found the dress to be super short, especially for work. However, that aside, the fabric was extremely comfortable, light-weight and just all out good. The only reason that I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was length, only because I was not aware. Either way, it's perfect for a night out!"
4.0,The excess chain hanging is a little too long and can get caught in things.
4.0,Cute suit and it fit pretty well. Bottoms are tighter on me then the top. Top is snug and digs a little but still so cute. Is pretty good material but you get what you pay for. Were some loose twine ends that I had to trim off to make it have a clean finish but other than that it is a good suit. If it lasts me one summer I will be happy.
4.0,one of my favorite tops. Cute and comfortable
4.0,I do really like this costume it stretches Wich I need cuz I'm small up top an big in the hips. The only problem I had was the back had to be taken in.
4.0,"It isn't perfect, for instance the neck hole is kind of small and was hard to pull it over my head and my ""girls"" but once I got it on, it fit great!  It is not impeccable seamstress work, but it's an inexpensive, cute dress."
4.0,The pants were comfortable until u sat down. Then u got a wedgie.
4.0,Super comfortable! Fits as expected but the only thing I would change is that the inside lining is white which makes the dress look a little bit cheap.
4.0,Pretty wooden watch. It’s perfect for a small gift that different
4.0,I always buy myself a Christmas gift and this was my choice. The watch is perfect but the bracelet was not included so I am taking away a star! I love it still though and can’t wait to wear!
4.0,"I wear size 9. A little smaller at first than expected, but more anyway, and they were fine. Cute!"
4.0,Comfortable material and good length. Very cute and simple
4.0,"The shirts cute. It's a little long for me 5""1 ."
4.0,"Love the print and quality but the fit is all over the place with this brand. I went with the size recommended but it was way too big. I'm usually a ten in pants and a DD cup, bought a xxl and it's huge. I may try another size."
4.0,Nice pants but they run just a tad small.
4.0,I really like this product and it was delivered on time and as described
4.0,Love.....love...love this dress fits great. Very comfortable. Love the color.
4.0,Little bit cheaply made but that's okay for the price
4.0,"I am 5'0, 160lbs and ordered this in a medium. It fit perfectly though I am still a little unsure how to tie the top part just right so my chest isn't hanging out of the sides. It's a super cute (and sexy) dress for $13 bucks. Can't beat it!"
4.0,"I gave 4 stars for the quality and dazzling sparkling design. I didn't know about the ""bling"" thing. It will become a gift to someone I know likes that style. Otherwise it is a nice outfit."
4.0,"Cute, comfy. I’m 6’2” so it’s definitely a shirt rather than a dress but that’s what I expected"
4.0,"The quality is pretty good.  I think this would work for most people, however, my arm is pretty hairy and the metal joints kept pulling the hair. Yeowch! If you're not a ""robin Williams level of hairy"" this is probably a good product for you."
4.0,"just wish they were the stretchy satin, otherwise they are great."
4.0,"Quality Material, A little longer then what I needed or expected but still looked great Had it hemmed up a couple inches."
4.0,Longer in length for its size.
4.0,These are green earrings are lovely. Worth whatever I paid for it.
4.0,"Loved the bag, three ways to carry, two sets of handles and a cross body strap.  Nice and roomy. Ideal bag, my only issue was the main zipper, it was probably just defective but I returned the bag and ordered something different.  Do not let that dissuade you from getting this bag. It is well constructed and convenient to carry."
4.0,So glad this dress was exactly as advertised!  Love it!
4.0,"My daughter loved it, just wish it was warmer"
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture and it's really soft. Warning: this shirt is form fitting with no loose flow.
4.0,"Overall a good mask.  Sublimation/printing is slightly ghosted. The print looks ok from a distance, but up close the print has hazy edges. It’s good enough for me, but would have been more excited if it was fresh and crisp edges. Nice pouch if you want to add an additional filter.  Stitching is good."
4.0,"I love this suit. I don't say that very often about a swimsuit. I am usually a small top, medium bottoms in bathing suits, but a small fits great! The only problem I had was it's made for larger-chested women. I'm a small B, and the cups were HUGE on me. Also, I didn't know it was going to have underwire in it. The foam cups would be very supportive if you were heavier on top than I am. So, to remedy this problem, I cut a (mostly) straight line across the bottom of the cup and  removed the underwire to remove some of the unoccupied space 😜. I attached a picture of what I did in case any other women had this problem with cup size. Now, it fits PERFECTLY and looks great!"
4.0,There is not a major problem in fitting as such but I ordered medium size and received large size. Somehow it isn’t looking bad on me. I liked the color and quality so far.<br />Thanx!
4.0,This is beautiful albeit a bit large and rather heavy for the tiny little chain it came with. Had to change that problem so I wouldn’t lose it.
4.0,Very comfortable but a bit small fitting. I wear size 9 shoe & these are XL (up to size 10) and my feet almost are over the ends.
4.0,"Soft, Bulky. Good to wear as slippers. Not for wearing with shoes! Too bulky."
4.0,"This works exactly as stated. If I had to do over I would get the one for single watches. This was is huge. I probably didn’t look. My dumb Rolex continues to lose time, but can’t blame it on lack of movement any more. I leave it in the machine in 3 and take it out only now and then. The black is very nice. Clean lines."
4.0,This fell of of my head a lot and it always slides
4.0,very pretty dress but was not for my figure
4.0,I actually really like this bathing suit! I'm 5'4&#34; and 150lbs and got the med. it fit perfectly. I'm a bit large chested so the top was a litttight but it covers everything
4.0,"OK, for underwear...bought them on a whim. Now I need to find someone who likes to see me in Sheer underwear."
4.0,4stars because the velcro started coming off the shoes.  They are so pretty.  They matched my daughters Christmas dress perfectly and people were commenting on them constantly.  She said they were comfy.
4.0,"I thought it was a beautifully patterned dress. I only returned it because I didn't feel like getting it altered. Standing still, it looked great, but when I moved (or walked) it looked a little too much Iike a moomoo for my taste. I also think it could be my body type. I have larger bust, so most dresses or baggy outfits look a bit unflattering."
4.0,Really impressed with the speed of the shipping. I paid for expedited shipping and my order arrived in one day. Amazing. The earrings were nice too but I already knew that because I wear them and I had lost one and needed a replacement. I like the little notch in the stem of the earring that keeps it from sliding off easily.
4.0,its shorter than I expected/ like a shirt...<br />But adorable. I ended up wearing it as night wear when I wanna be sexy but conservative..
4.0,"I love this hat most of the time. It is easy to put on, looks more stylish than my standard sun visor, and gives great shade coverage. On the other hand it seems to block my view a bit where I have to tilt my head way back to see out from under it, but any large sun hat would do so. I never bother to roll it up as it is a bit time consuming, but I have on occasion and it rolls up fine. Elastic so far has held ( a few months), though I suspect it may the first to go."
4.0,"Great necklace so far, but the opening is very small and hard to get the cremains in even using the funnel."
4.0,"It was very nice, and beautiful. However, the chain isn't very flexible, and can be annoying, possibly. My girlfriend loves it!"
4.0,Fit great and feels grwat
4.0,I work in a warehouse 12hr a day theses glove are great for handling boxes lots of grip the only down side i have with them they dont let your hands breathe
4.0,Love Grace Karin clothes!!  This is a great little dress that you can dress up or down.  Love that you can cinch the waist in from the back for a slimmer look.
4.0,"It is a little longer than I anticipated.  I hoped to wear it with leggings, but is a bit too long (and I am almost 6 ft, tall).<br />The over all silhouette is as pictured.  But the finish work the bell sleeves is gust gathered and not gusseted.  But, for the price it is excellent."
4.0,My grandson is a little skinny on the bottom so drawstring pants would be easier
4.0,"Bought these for 2 long international flights. They worked great! 4 out of 5 stars for the length - they were about 1.5 inches too short, I'd like them to come up to just below my knees/cover my calves completely (I'm 5'9&#34; for reference) the compression however, was perfect! (And of course, you've got to love the butterflies) Looking forward to wearing them for a run!"
4.0,Got a large (wanted a loose fit) next time get a medium
4.0,Super cute but the threading is starting to come out after a couple weeks. It seemed kind really good quality so maybe I just got a dud.
4.0,"These pants are a good buy for summer. However, I am not a fan of the pockets."
4.0,"Loved it. Felt amazing on, just wasn't my style so I passed it on"
4.0,Runs small. Order up to the next size
4.0,Definitely not the same dress pictured. It's more like a printed replica...not shiny at all...<br />I gave it 4 stars because I still thought it was cute and it's a good deal for the price.
4.0,"What can I say, these are very cute shoes.  Not much of an insole and no support...they are flats...certainly not sneakers as advertised but one can see that just by looking at them.  The strap seems a bit tight but my daughter doesn't seem to mind.  I bought the silver for my two-year old and I do like them.  The only reason I gave four instead of five stars was that I felt they were pricey.  I would not have bought them if I did not have a $25 Amazon gift certificate but then again, I feel paying over $20 for kids shoes is a lot."
4.0,"It is cute, a bit thick and my neice loves it."
4.0,A bit short waisted but will work because of the drape.
4.0,I order this to wear to a 40th birthday party at the end of the month.  This dress looks so sexy and nice I will be rocking it great fit and the colors are the same as in the picture.
4.0,i haven't worn it yet (for Halloween) but i tried it on and it's kinda big.  my fault for not getting a smaller size.  But very cute!!!
4.0,"cute, but cheap, and no clasp can be annoying"
4.0,Good quality and was delivered fast.
4.0,They are exactly like pictured. The only way they could be better is if one of them faced the other direction.
4.0,Excellent PRoduct
4.0,First time wearing these and they did not fail me in yoga. Next test with circuit training.
4.0,"They look great, great quality and the color is not too yellow, it’s perfect golden, they are a bit too high for me (the heel), so I don’t wear them as much, but they look very stylish"
4.0,"Very cute. Material and construction is a bit cheap and thin, as can be expected for the price. A bit difficult to figure out how it is supposed to go on but worth it in the end. Boobs seem like they may fall out; will most likely safety pin it together."
4.0,Run a little small/tight but I like that it is cloth. Cooler to wear in the heat.
4.0,intimate apparel sized too large - recommend order 1 size down
4.0,"Good tote, exactly what I need, use daily!"
4.0,"Necklace and bracelet are both very nice, but my hair keeps getting tangled around the necklace."
4.0,Dress is soft and has a little stretch to it. It is a nice vibrant red. Nice stitching and quality.
4.0,"Calidad buena, pero quizás la goma no es la mejor. Fácil de cerrar y se adapta bien."
4.0,"I am 5'2 135 pounds 32DD. Measurements 36-28-36. I ordered a large. The bottoms fit perfectly. They show a little bit of cheek but not too bad! The top is too large for me. It has a clip in the back, but that makes it way too wide around. I am planning to just tie the back and it will work, since you can't mix sizes of top and bottoms. The other thing that's not great about this suit is that the inner lining isn't the same color as the outside. You can see in the picture that although the suit is blue the lining is white and it shows a little on the outside. Otherwise it is good quality, has good padding, and I love the color/pattern."
4.0,This was really cute and looks exactly like the picture. I returned it bec I didn't feel like it was super flattering on me. But I'd still recommend the suit. I'm 150lbs and I got an XL which fit perfectly snug which was in line with the size chart.
4.0,"Cute, comfortable dress - mine is longer than the one in the photo.  I am 5'9&#34; and the hem of the skirt hits just at my knees.  Also, the defined waist is too short for my height but I think (hope) I can make it work.<br /><br />There aren't any belt loops for the sash but the seam that connects the skirt to the bodice is very pronounced so maybe it won't look right to have the sash a few inches below the &#34;waist&#34; of the dress.<br /><br />It is a pretty, dark stormy color and flattering for my blue eyes and red/blonde hair.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily and the wrinkles don't come out very easily either.  I washed the dress and let it air dry and steamed it after the fact but it still has creases from the shipping process.  I may have to take it to the cleaners to let them press it to make it presentable."
4.0,Bought for my daughter she said it's a great swimsuit.
4.0,Very very short chain
4.0,"I thought these were undershirts when I ordered them plus I ordered them in the wrong size as well. However when I tried them on,I was surprised how well they fit! They fit better than the regular shirts Because of that they are keepers."
4.0,"I received these pants through the Amazon Vine Voice program. They fit true to size. And, the waist band is a little constricting since it is not adjustable so keep in mind that you want correct sizing here, but I ordered my usual size and it fits fine. These truly are ""running"" and/or ""cycling"" pants. I can wear these with a very thin base-layer for winter or without a very thin base-layer for summer. They are comfortable and appear of good quality. I also like the back zipper pocket. Overall, I think these are good."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:23011d06a31472408ea94a26fa99d1fa]] Top is cute, color is as is. I like my stuff to be tight. If u feel like u need more room one size up works! Plus if u wash it it’ll shrink a little!"
4.0,"These are very pretty and simple. Elegant addition to any outfit, and for the price, it cant be beat! Great customer service - would highly recommend!"
4.0,"Overall very well made dress for the price! Nice print and bodice is a nice stretchy material that if placed right accents the chest nicely! (I like V necks!) flattering fit even with a mom tummy and some weight to lose.<br />Just wish it was a little shorter, I’m 5’9 and it still goes past my knees"
4.0,While they are the correct size and color one of the three pairs was broken. Still the price was good so I did not send the broken pair back
4.0,Size up 1-2 sizes.
4.0,great quality shirt.  Gave 4 stars because just wish 2 or 3 inches longer.
4.0,"Adorable. A llttle tight in the sleeve, but i'll suffer for beauty. This blouse is just so cute."
4.0,"Looks great, everything works, and it even keeps time reasonably well... My only complaint is that the band that came with the watch is extremely low-quality chromed garbage. Swapped it out with a $13 solid-link stainless steel band (also from Amazon, I believe the brand name was RUHE) and now it is a great option for dressy events. CAUTION: NOT WATER RESISTANT."
4.0,Capri fabric very comfortable. I returned since they were too high waisted for me.
4.0,"Very red. Fit is more for a slender arm , short waisted c"
4.0,It doesn't comply with the AZ law. So my friend will use it on the front of her car.
4.0,You know those 90s matte bathing suits kids used to wear that would bead up immediately? This is what sort of fabric we’re dealing with here. It’s not a terrible dress for the price. Decently cute but not a staple item
4.0,"Although it is not a sweatshirt, I do love the design and fit of the product."
4.0,These fit well and seem to have good compression quality. I wear a size 10 ladies shoe so ordered L/XL.
4.0,"Little short so I sized up,fabric a little sheer"
4.0,Super soft but not true to size.
4.0,Definitely size up if you want an oversized fit. I ordered a medium but usually wearing a small/medium and it’s a little more fitted than I prefer. Still very cute and cozy. Arm holes are not gapping or big either!
4.0,Should either be adjustable or offered in different lengths
4.0,I like it but it is extremely stretchy.  I wear a 34&#34; and this belt is 6 inches too long.  I bought another small (31&#34;) and it is okay.
4.0,they are amazingly made. the hook and loops on the extension pieces are the best thing ever. it fully replaces the need for a tie up the side for panties with a garter belt on.
4.0,"Really like this jumper. I wear size 8 so I got the medium.  It fits but is snug to get the top on. Once it's on, fits great. The legs were an inch shorter than I had hoped right above my ankle. I'm only 5'2&#34;.  But overall I like it so I'm keeping it."
4.0,this shirt was part of my hippie  days so I love it. some people think I'm crazy but I don't care. all that matters is I love it.<br />just wish your bell bottoms pants were cheaper they would go great with the Dashiki shirt  but $45/$50  you think I'm made of money.
4.0,"I like the fit but the material not a fan. If you have 'the body', even just a little bit, this is perfect for you"
4.0,Not the sturdiest but they are lightweight and great for the money !
4.0,The flair was on the big side so it's a little hard to get in but they are very cute and lightweight
4.0,"Not extra dark like I'd hoped.  In the 80s you could get them so dark that you absolutely had to remove them when you went inside because you could not see, period.  You also could not use them to drive or read, etc.  Why would I want this?  For the beach/pool.  You can sunbathe and feel like you are wearing sleeping pads on your eyes as you face the sun directly.  Your eyes can completely relax much more than with normal tint sunglasses, which is all this pair is, unfortunately.  I came back and bumped this up a star because it has spring hinges and I love those.  I didn't know that when I ordered them."
4.0,I wish there was more give to the elastic straps but it work.
4.0,Got them for my wife and she likes them (me too!!).  Works well with garter belts. She says they don't snag as much and no runs so far after multiple wears.  Not premium quality with minor blemishes but hardly noticeable.  Good value for the money.  Probably will buy again.
4.0,The shoulder strap on this bag broke almost immediately without any stress on it. I used a carabiner as the new clasp to keep the strap on the bag now. Otherwise the bag holds up fine to light use.
4.0,i ordered 2 sizes larger and it JUST fits....but very cute!
4.0,"Super cute, but the chain is very cheap."
4.0,Nice 😷
4.0,Purchased for my son. He really liked it. It fit exactly the way young men like their clothes now; not too loose.
4.0,"Some of the socks are too small, while others fit me fine.  Would have been a five star if ALL of them had fit me right.  Overall, the ones that DO fit - which was most of them - are comfortable to wear and PERFECT for hot weather."
4.0,"Very soft & comfortable. I weigh about 115, but ordered a large so that there is good overlap when sitting & lounging. It does not look too big on my frame.  Like the 3/4 sleeves. Don't have to roll the sleeves up if I wash dishes or do chores before changing into street clothes. Nice color of blue."
4.0,"A little cheap in construction but given the price that's expected. If you need a 5x and these don't fit, you don't need a 5x. Stop living in denial and go up a size."
4.0,I like it just fine but wish it had a larger outside pocket for my cell phone
4.0,"I like this shirt a lot- cute design, quirky.  The previous comment about the arm opening being tight is right, the opening is smaller than normal; works for me, but should be considered by each individual.  I'm going to roll the sleeve a few times - it's as pictures, loose and stylish."
4.0,"I like this product because it covers my bum, ordered a medium will size up next time, because it think it runs small"
4.0,"Looser than expected. Usually would wear a large, but I need a medium"
4.0,Larger than I expected so can't use it for what I intended but will be a good gift for my friend's mom. Item is good quality and if you need a large wallet I'd recommend for you just look at the dimensions to be certain.
4.0,"I received these compression tanks in size small and they weren't tight enough for me.  I would say the size chart is true to size and you would have to get a size smaller for any sort of compression.  Another note is the material is pretty thin, so if you had to go down multiple sizes, I'd think about going elsewhere.  I think the price matches the quality, and if you were really looking for a compression garment, this isn't it.  I'm using these to wear as undershirts as I like to wear clothing that is very tailored, and cotton tanks are too bulky.  I am 6' ft tall & thin."
4.0,Great product only downside & it's not the products fault is that after a few hours your eyes are used to the darkness & you have to take off your sunglasses to let some sun light in.
4.0,It’s secured and not falling off anytime soon! It’s not as red as in the picture but it’s more of a dark peach still nice color though
4.0,"I love this bag.  I have one similar in pewter and used it almost every day within the past year.  The color is not as dark as shown in the picture.  I was hoping to get a true navy bag, but for the second time, I received a royal blue."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable socks. Not as thick as I would have hoped, but still pretty good. Only time will tell how well they last."
4.0,Arms were large and a little too thin.
4.0,"They are a little stiff, but they're still new.  I like Diadoras because they always seem to fit my feet just right, and these are no exception."
4.0,"Super soft.... Noticed it as soon as i touched it. But what I noticed FIRST was the awful smell! It made me gag! I washed it twice and there's still a smell to it but only if you stick your nose RIGHT into it. I don't know how to describe it but it hit me before I even opened the package it was in. It fits abit large. I'm 5'4, 170lbs but I'm super muscular thus heavy.  Normally wear small to medium tshirts (small for a fitted look, medium for a baggy one.) I would buy it again."
4.0,Cute ear pins with beads. Unfortunately the wires were thick and uncomfortable. The item would easily bend. They went back.
4.0,"Both of the dresses that I ordered were the same, except for the color. I tit well, but a little snug and revealing around the breasts. I had to strategically place a safety pin so that there was no overflow, if you know what I mean. Other than that, it is a flattering fit and color."
4.0,I'm 5'2&#34; and with the skirt zipped right above my waist the skirt comes down to almost my ankles. I wish there was a petite version because outside of that the skirt itself is pretty fantastic. The color is gorgeous. One thing I will say is that it's not the really lightweight sheer with a slip underneath the fabric is pretty heavy duty which is good and bad. I don't think it looks as lady like and fancy BUT you can't see your panties through it.
4.0,They work great but the cable does wear out and fray after a few months.
4.0,Well they’re awesome. I ordered the 7.5 for women/ 6.5 for men. I expected for them to fit but they’re more like a 8.5 for women. I would of had sent them back for a size down but a relative loved them and wanted them. So this review would of had been a five star but they’re too big.<br />Hope that helps!
4.0,Boots are beautiful but I couldn't get my feet in through the &#34;neck&#34; part.
4.0,"These pants are very warm and fit pretty well. I typically wear a size 3x in pants so I decided to size up and get a 4x to get a more loose fit. My only wish is that the fabric around the ankles was a bit tighter. These pants are so versatile because you could wear them lounging or working, but they might be a little hot for working out in."
4.0,"3 pairs for that price is great. They are decent quality and I like them. I will say you have to do some adjusting to the hoops because the clamp area is too cramped. Other than that, I’ve had them for a few weeks and they are what I was needing."
4.0,The Deadmau5 hat fits perfect
4.0,"Somewhat snug. The sizing is a bit off, but I can deal with it. I'm hoping to wear it this coming summer!"
4.0,Like the size
4.0,FIT GOOD ORDER A LARGE
4.0,"as far as arch support, Im not running a marathon in these bad boys- im chiling in my house so i dont need a ton- they are comfortable to wear all day (i forget im wearing them) and i run up and down 4 flight of stairs with my kids daily so no complaints really on my end as far as support"
4.0,"I like this tunic top well enough to keep it in my closet... even though I have never actually worn it outside of the house. I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 115. I usually wear a medium and I wear a size 6P in jeggings. This tunic top fits a little awkward on me, which is why I haven't worn it yet. It is tight in some areas and very loose and baggy in other areas. I feel like I am constantly tugging on the really wide neck collar and pulling down on the bottom edge to keep it covering my backside. I bought the tunic top to wear with leggings and my tall black boots. I thought it would make a great  outfit but it feels more like the me I used to know circa 2000. My Honey thinks it looks really sexy but I am not down with my bra strap showing all of the time. Also, it fits a bit tight around my arms and I have really skinny, wimpy arms. lol It looks nice with thick leggings on the bottom, but I would never trust it to be worn with sheer pantyhose just because I am always trying to keep my naughty parts covered. Anyway, I would not buy this item again just because of the super wide neck and skinny arms. If you have a short torso, very skinny arms, very broad shoulders and not too wide of hips, this would be a perfect purchase. I do not have that body type."
4.0,I like the look and style of these glasses. The plastic frame feels a bit on the fragile side though. It's been only a week so time will tell.
4.0,By far my favorite pair of sunglasses. The only downfall is that the frame is really wide and loose so it doesn’t easily rest on your head.
4.0,"I bought this watch for my husband, and overall, it was a great purchase. It looks nice, and for the price, the quality is excellent. The jewels on the front are pink. It was kind of hard to tell what color they were from the pictures, but in person, they are definitely pink. That would not deter me from purchasing again, but it is something to acknowledge. I liked the fact that it came with the tool to adjust the band, and the box the watch came in was high quality."
4.0,nice but little too short ill give to grandson
4.0,"I ordered this for my tall 9 year old who is not fat, but can wear anywhere from a kid's 14/16 to a junior's xs or small. It is cut very full, but for what we need it for....a trip to Alaska next summer, we won't have a problem layering a coat or a fleece jacket under it. The material is weird just like another commenter said. I wasn't expecting this type of material, but someone recommended Frogg Toggs for its value and they said it is definitely waterproof. The material is stiff for fabric and it is the material of some of the reusable bags I've gotten from business seminars...weird! I guess I'm just not used to &#34;wearing&#34; a re-usable bag. :-) The lime green jacket is a beautiful bright green. My daughter seemed to like the color (or should I say she didn't dislike it -- coming from a tween). The pants look quite full and long enough. I did like the fact that there is elastic at the bottom of the legs to help keep water off her pants underneath. I just want to make sure they survive our 2 week trip and don't rip on her before the trip is over. After that, oh well, I can't complain for the little amount that I paid for it."
4.0,This is the third pair of pressure stockings I've bought in one week. The only one which did not rip off after the first day and didn't cause itching. Plan to order more.
4.0,Lighter than expected but it does look nice
4.0,I like this skirt but it’s like a wrap with a string that slides through & then needs tied. I’m not sure if I’m even doing it correctly. I’d like it better if it was just an elastic skirt.
4.0,"I have my measurements so I thought it'd be perfect but it was too long and big but I placed a hook and eye on the back and that worked fine. The hoop skirt was way too small and uncomfortable. Even so, I loved it and can't wait to order from Cosplay again."
4.0,My grandbaby loved them. They ran a little small but still fit
4.0,The dress is true to size. They have done well make all the information regarding the dress true. Really love the color of this dress! Toss in the dryer to get rid of wrinkles from the packaging.
4.0,"Great item boots look very cool with these on, a must buy for bikers when riding if wearing boots<br />Also great customer service .."
4.0,"I would have given it 5 stars, but the crown doesn’t screw down, so I don’t know how this watch is supposed to be water resistant to 200 meters."
4.0,"Lovely, put earrings wit it."
4.0,"Looks good, feels good, appears to be sturdy quality...."
4.0,Good Quality pant. The color is nice and fits according to my size.
4.0,Cute basic shirt. Comfortable and nice thickness
4.0,I loveee this fit it came super fast and it fits perfectly. The only thing I don’t like about this is the top is literally a piece of fabric and it was confusing to get on
4.0,Tight but a cute outfit.
4.0,"Very cute dress I just thought that it would have a little bit more poof underneath the dress so it can sit just like the picture, but it does not it sits flat. But very cute dress very comfortable."
4.0,"Very baggy on my son, he's pretty thin though. Wouldn't recommend for smaller legs. Otherwise the colors are nice and fabric is thick enough."
4.0,Ok for the price. Doubt that it’s 14k gold and the hoops needed to be bent to fit on the ear without moving.
4.0,"Very nice! Pretty beads, and a higher quality than I was expecting for the price. They're lightweight, feel good in my hands, and something about the color seems very comforting. I've had these for a couple of months now. I keep them next to my bed. So far, they've held up very well."
4.0,"Mask was a little big and smushed from delivery, so it wouldn’t stay in place but overall for the price I got what I expected. Quality was actually pretty decent and it worked great for our family GOT costumes!"
4.0,"Excellent price and decent quality. I did snag it on the front area the first day I wore it, however. I recommend not putting into dryer since It is fitted and looks like it would shrink, I like that the length is not too long so it could be worn with good quality yoga pants and still look nice."
4.0,"The reason for the .5 knock on the rating: it comes out of the wash a little wrinkly.<br />Other than that: spot on and sturdy and comfortable and attractive. It's a near match for heavier denim-esque shirts I  got from work & I can wear it when the weather is warmer in place of them. A little more money thank I would usually spend on a shirt, but it is a good purchase. Recommended."
4.0,"It's what you would expect. My wrists are really tiny and it fit me really well, so if you have big wrists you might not want to get it."
4.0,Perfect size/ fit. Super stylish and flattering. Only problem is that the metal on the top has turned copper/discolored.
4.0,A bit scratchy but sturdy.
4.0,I am obsessed with pink and love this band. I purchased another band for my mother which did not fit the watch at all. This band is awesome and sturdy! I highly recommend this band!
4.0,Good looking belt but not as durable as I had hoped. Certainly worth the price. Seller was great.
4.0,Not as loose as it shows on the picture but its nice.
4.0,Nice top!!<br />It’s a little bigger than anticipated and the strap fell down until i pinned it. Recommend going a size smaller. Does not shrink in dryer. Great look though and super soft!!
4.0,Fits as expected. Nice quality shorts
4.0,"Really cute dress, looks good on, but my stomach was bloated and being that it's not fitted around the waist, I didn't like how it looked.  Fabric was sturdy and not easy to see through like cheaper fabric.  If you have fluffy mid section might want to get a cute belt."
4.0,"I was tired of wearing baseball hats and dressing down so I got some nicer clothes and wanted a hat to go ti with them. This is a great looking hat and I don't wear hats very well at all. they all seemed to look just dumb on me, no matter what the style but not this hat, and it's comfortable too. I love it. It was a tad too large but that is easily taken care of with some inserts"
4.0,"good fit, price, design"
4.0,Well everything kept saying it ran small. So I got an XL for my daughter because she is tiny yet super curvy (think pinup model) yeah way to big. Lucky for her I can sew. So if you normally by a medium get a medium. I'd say it fits pretty true to size. However it is a lovely costume.
4.0,Easy to use. I like the ratchet adjustment.
4.0,"Got this for my wife a while ago. She really liked the design and the fit was perfect. I think she was hesitant at first because the material felt a bit weird to her and was pretty wrinkly. She felt like it was almost cheap feeling. She hasn't washed it yet, and she's hoping that after a wash it will feel less polyesterie (is that a word?). But other than that it was comfy and she liked he color, style, fit, etc.<br /><br />We're going to wash it and let her have another try since she likes/wants to like it. :)"
4.0,"This is a nice robe, good for many purposes.  It's not luxurious, but it's practical.  Great price."
4.0,"Some of the charms a lot bigger than the others, for example, the lollipop. I think the most distinguishable item from the movie is Dorothy's heels and they are not on this bracelet, I would've liked that. Overall nice product."
4.0,"works great, this is my 2nd time purchasing."
4.0,"The large hoodie, is not a dress, but will be long enough for yoga pants. It is thin, but a spring or early fall ""thin"". The material is like any cheap sweat shirt, except no fuzzy. The color is nice, I got the blue tie dye one. It does run a size or two on the small size. The length cannot be worn as a dress, it will fall just below my butt. I am 5'6.5. Overall it is worth about 10 or 15 dollars, imo. I would recommend this to a friend. The shirt did arrive fast, a couple days or so. Does not have a bad odor, nor does it appear used. There are no store tags, as to be expected."
4.0,"A little too big for my kids face, but pretty good quality."
4.0,"So... I was looking for a slightly longer short-short and the photo suggested this would fit the bill. They arrive. I pull them on. They completely feel like they fit and they are COMFY!! Huzzah! Then... I strutted my thickness over to a mirror. Immediately decided I will never leave the house in these. Just because they come in my size and fit comfortably, does not mean they looked anything like that. They pretty much looked like fancy denim underwear and while I aspire to not give a d**n, I still do. They are short... but they fit. It might be the thighs of mine preventing them from having the length as they do in the photo. So, they are comfy! They do fit and are true to size! Only go for it if you aren’t at all shy."
4.0,"This is a great basic watch. Has all the functions you need. Small and lightweight. However, the watch band is too small and thin. Too small for a man’s wrist. Taking the original one off to replace it with a new one is virtually impossible without damaging the watch. I would not recommend it unless you have a very small wrist."
4.0,"The brown straps were a little thin for what I was looking for, but my son grew out of them before he could destroy them, so it was fine."
4.0,Very dainty. Well made
4.0,Slight raised spot in material but good for the price
4.0,"Nice casual spring/summer dress. I am 5' 7 1/2 and 155 lbs, I ordered a large and the fit is perfect! Very comfy and of course I love that it has pockets! Looks just like the pic."
4.0,"Nice support for running, tennis, any high impact exercise."
4.0,Kind of see through
4.0,Cute but the bust area really bad pretty small. I ordered a M and I am a 34D.  It was pretty small in the bust but fit everywhere else.  I’m 5’4 134 lbs
4.0,I get lots of compliments on they dress is super cute. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is bc it's not made out of the best materials and you should probably wash it with delicates to help prevent snags.
4.0,"Great shape, fits my face just right, cool color, good weight, stays put on top of my head when I'm not wearing them!"
4.0,Beautiful dress ! Nice quality just A bit too long but true to size .
4.0,"So far,  so good. Had them a week in garrison. I'm an 11.5 or 12 depending on the shoe (usually a 12) but these run a little large.i have a wide foot too but they are roomy enough being  that they run a bit large. I'd order an 11.5 next time to prevent blisters. The laces are a little too polyester for my normal boot tastes. For the price point you are getting a solid enough boot to  walk around garrison."
4.0,It fits my sister perfectly.
4.0,"It's a bit tight, and misshaped.  Sold grey is a nice clean look, works for when selling in the sun.<br />Will try a pool/beach trip.. maybe the water will help stretch and reform it. Hopefully doesn't rust like my other one."
4.0,"Nice product, is almost too tight when pulling up around my head. My normal issues with normal sizes ect, tend to run a little big for myself."
4.0,"Fitted very nice , cute, elegant . It will fit perfect if you are tall , I ordered a large because I'm chubby but Im 5'1 so the length was LARGE lol but other than that PERFECT and came on time."
4.0,Cool colors. Fits well on my 9 yr old. Seems comfortable enough to sleep with.
4.0,"These are really cute. I got them for a 1950s costume. I'm not sure I'll wear them all the time because they do make quite a statement, but I do like them and they have nice detailing."
4.0,"These boots are tanks, good tanks! The fit well, look swell and the larger size allows for the use of great thick socks."
4.0,The clasps seem really easy to open. Worried that it is going to come open. Hasn't yet.
4.0,"Bought it for my daughter, it looks beautiful on her."
4.0,I like these glasses. The Led lights are super cool especially at night. Got tons of compliments. Everyone was asking where did I get them from. Lol. They fit all size faces too. My face is a bit fat but they fit me just right. Several different colors to choose from!! Awesome!! Gets lots of attention!!
4.0,"I am an adult, but I bought this for my best friend.  It was a huge hit, she really loved it and we had fun breaking it in half.  It made us feel like little kids again.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the bottom of the charm is really sharp once it's broken.  I wouldn't recommend it for very small children but for adults or older kids it's definitely a great buy."
4.0,Does it have matching earrings?
4.0,I had to order another in one size up but it ran just a tad small I was still able to use it on my 3 year old.
4.0,These are better than socks and warm and have a non-slip sole but are soft and pack smaller than anything with a sole.  Good for a trip.
4.0,"This is a great product. Took a long time, but worth it. The only thing is that I got them a little over a month ago but it says that they’re coming this Friday. I’m not sure if they are going to come again, but it’s fine if they don’t because I already got them."
4.0,"Nice hat, but you have to tuck in the lining."
4.0,It is tighter on the top part than I would normally wear.
4.0,"This is good looking Cardigan. Very well made and high quality. However, unfortunately it didn't fit me as expected. The seller was kind enough to let me donate it to charity, and get a full refund, instead of shipping the item back. I greatly appreciate this. One of the best sellers I've dealt with."
4.0,The individual packaging makes it's initial presentation looks cheap...but once out of pkg...the jewelry is good quality for the price that I paid.
4.0,This works for me.  I use it during the week - carry it in my work bag so I dont need a purse. Room for eveuthing including phone.  I wish it came in a (faux) leather style.
4.0,I ordered this jacket for my vampire costume. It worked very well--more substantial fabric than I originally thought.
4.0,Love this. They are big and wonderful and very light
4.0,"I'm 5'3, 145lb, 36D and I bought a large. It fits around the bust but is a little too small for my boobs. HOWEVER, it's very cute if worn under a lower cut shirt or I like to wear it with a v-neck spaghetti strap dress. I wouldn't wear it as a bikini top though."
4.0,Look cool. A bit small.
4.0,"The band is cute and it was easy to adjust the size. My only is issue is, it unsnaps easily."
4.0,MAKE SURE YOU BODY IS RIGHT FOR THIS DRESS...IT'S CUTE AND COMFORTABLE
4.0,"I was reluctant to buy these because of some reviews stating the zipper isn’t long enough to allow room to fit over shoes.<br />I decided to try them anyways for my almost 7 year old son. He is right at 50 lbs and the S/XS fit perfectly. I wish the zippers came up a little higher (I really don’t understand why they don’t), BUT he can get them on and off his high top basketball shoes (size 13.5) with little to no problem.<br />He really loves the pants and kept saying so. I would buy again. I do hope they decide to lengthen the zippers, though. Then I would buy one in every color. 😊<br />I gave 4 stars bc of the zipper length being slightly inconvenient, however, if I could I would give 4.5 Stars."
4.0,"Great leather. Gray build quality. I really wish the loops you slip the excess band through were tighter, then this elitist be an easy 5 star review. Nonetheless, good leather quality and build."
4.0,"I bought 4 pairs of these for all the family and we presently use them for ice skating protection.  My wife and I have taken some good spills so far, me on my hip - avoiding an out-of-control child - and my wife falling on her back.  These shorts provide fair protection to the sides of the thigh and hips and have a lumbar pad as well.  Have to say when falling on my side, not so bad.  My wife did take a pretty good spill on her coccyx (the tailbone) and these shorts provided no apparent protection (she remained pretty hobbled for a week).  Easy solution, though.  Bought a $10 dollar sleeping bag pad and cut 4 coccyx pads as shown in the photo below.  The extra pad isn't noticeable and it does give us a sense of more protection from the kind of fall my wife experience.  These shorts are comfortable to wear and can go under loose jeans, cargo pants, or sweats.  My wife and daughter wear them over leggings with long shirts . These shorts were a great price and seem well built.  The price of other items with more padding seemed much more cost prohibitive.  Not perfect, but an extra $10 for a sleeping bag pad was worth it"
4.0,I was looking for work pants. I wanted something dressy and comfortable. I found these and ordered one pair in red. Now so want more. The good thing is they have a ton of colors to choose from!
4.0,"Exactly what we wanted, but these run a little small.  They appear to be the exact ones we saw in the tourist shops."
4.0,Ordered the xl & Lg. Both fit. Chose to keep the LG because the proportions were better.<br />Stats:<br />SHORT!  5’2” bust 42” hip 44” size 10-12<br />The fabric has great stretch. Not a tee shirt cotton feel yet a great cotton feel to it.<br />Not the FLOWY fit I was expecting ~ b/c this fabric is a bit clingy.<br />Happy that I ordered this ;-)
4.0,"It is a one-size-fits all top and I am a plus size women, so I guess I should have expected it to be a bit more snug than it appears on the model, but I was hoping it would flow loosely, if just a tad.  Good news is that it fits and is not tight and the top is as pretty as it looks online.  Just wish they would say one-size-fits all for Misses sizes and that it didn't come up on a search results list for plus size tops."
4.0,"Great quality, super soft... just a little wide, but baby should grow into them."
4.0,"Ordered the large. 5'3"" 130 lbs. fit a little loose, but looks great. The only thing I was concerned about was putting it on. It was awkward as it was very tight to get my arms through. if my top body was bigger, this may have not worked. But overall, I would recommend. The bottom also fits nice around the ankles, making it fit good for a shorter person as it doesn't drag. comes with pockets too. The string is not a drawstring, but thats ok, still fit nice.  And it didnt make my butt look big ladies - lol"
4.0,"very good quality. A little small but, I love it"
4.0,Very cute item.
4.0,"This a cute dress but not as full as pictured, it will definately need a petticoat. Also it is flimsy and not made as well as I thought. However it will only be worn a few time and it is very cute."
4.0,Fit fine and comfortable. This bottom worked for a top I had and it was a nice attention.
4.0,i love the color of this watch. It just looks cute overall.
4.0,I liked this for dressier than tshirt occasions
4.0,Cure but had to pin the cleavage bc my bra showed
4.0,It is very pretty and my wife loved it.  But frankly I found it rather small.  The photo of it seems to be a bit exaggerated.  But I do like it.
4.0,This is the perfect July 4th dress!! It is made of a very cool material and it displays my patriotic side!!!! It is long and flowing and I plan to wear it with some cute flip flops for my outside festivities.
4.0,I love MK. Bought as bday gift to myself 🎁<br />Just was a bit smaller and shorter strapped than I like normally. But overall I’m happy! Great bargain!
4.0,Perfect size for my face and quality looks good. I am happy with my purchase.
4.0,"This is gorgeous!!! However, we received it with a black bead missing. If possible, maybe Vivian's can send us a bead to sew on the collar."
4.0,These gloves are very soft and attactive for the price. The only negaative was they run a little small. Got a medium and will have to exchange for a large.
4.0,Really nice cuff links. Sturdy and looks elegant.
4.0,"Really like the thickness and style, but it does run small!"
4.0,"I like this item, HOWEVER, it is not the same as the pictured product. It definitely is a somewhat warmer cream color, and the neck on it is odd - only barely wider than an average shirt, very high up on the neck, and certainly not boatneck. The material is not usual sweater material either. Despite this, it is a soft, comfortable and stretchy sweater that is nice otherwise. Just not what I anticipated, and it took more than a full month to arrive."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:def4010cd1a15f7f538e84dad2559a2b]] This is a beautiful sweater specially the color is very pretty. It fits as expected, I am size 14 and I ordered XL size and it fits exactly the way I wanted. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family."
4.0,"Bought a medium because it's for children and my child is 9 years old. He wears a size 5 US shoe and is 4'6&#34;. They go all the way upto the crease behind his knee, That's annoying when running right? So we actually fold them about 3 inches down and back up.  Order a size smaller is my suggestion. With them folded, and without shin guards they fell down twice. WIth shin guards they did not fall down at all. They match the shoes we bought almost exactly: [[ASIN:B00VUWCFPK adidas Performance Ace 15.3 FG AG J Soccer Shoe (Little Kid/Big Kid),Solar Orange/White/Black,5 M US Big Kid]]"
4.0,"Very cute, but heavier than expected so I returned"
4.0,They fit very well my only small complaint is that when you bend down they do get just a little see through. But not to the point I can’t wear them.
4.0,It's a great cosplay for its price but I recommend using a second adhesive for the head piece and butterfly.
4.0,Beautiful pajamas- Just like the pictures except for the bottoms are a little tight in the waist. I don't like things tight on my waist when I am trying to sleep but it is probably way too expensive to send them back so I kept them
4.0,"I ordered a small. I usually wear a small top and size 8 pants at 5'4"". The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the entire dress is super long. I was stepping on the bottom and the chest seam was lower than expected. However it is nice material and still look cute."
4.0,"I love this dress, I ordered a medium, im 5' 9"" and 140 lbs and it fits perfectly. The material is a little thin but other than that its really cute."
4.0,"This product is a hoot!!  It is so funny-looking that my grand-kids pretend they don't know me when I wear it fishing.  It is fairly cheaply made, but I think it will be okay if I don't treat it too roughly.  And on top of all that, it does the job!  I use it mostly for shade, and haven't tried it in the rain.  I love that I ""take the shade with me"" when I am wearing it.  Sometimes I wear it while working in the yard.  Great idea!"
4.0,"Wow surprised when it arrived. Material exceeded expectations. The only thing I would discount is the hat, it is made for a very small head, m ore child like not adult. I will do without."
4.0,"During this very busy year of 2020, many of us decided to shop online for gifts.  I purchased this watch for a friend who was very pleased to have a watch of excellent quality.  Not only is it beautiful, but the price is reasonable.  It is comfortable to wear and very flattering."
4.0,"I bought this for my teenage son and the adult men's small was a perfect fit for him.  He likes polo shirts for when he wants to dress up a pair of jeans a bit.  We were both pleasantly surprised by the good quality of this shirt.  First, and for him a major plus, the shirt is tagless so no uncomfortable tag to irritate the skin on his neck.  The seams are well done and soft and also are very comfortable when wearing the shirt.  The shirt itself is nice and soft but seems to still be breathable which adds to his comfort.  It did take some time to receive, longer than normal for most items I order.  Also, since it didn't have any tags, it also didn't come with any care instructions so we basically went with mild wash and mild dry to make sure there wasn't any shrinkage and this seemed to work fine.<br /><br />I received a discount for this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

4.0,Looked gorgeous but did not last long. You can only wear this band occasionally.  Within a week the rhinestone fell out and a link broke. It did look beautiful tho
4.0,Very cute and well made! Love that it came with a polishing cloth!
4.0,"First impressions are good!  We will use them for a choir rehearsal later this week.  The size selection is screwed up.  I was trying to order a medium and a large, but I ended up seeing that I had ordered 2 mediums.  We got actually 2 large!  We are happy with them, and I would guess large would work for most adults."
4.0,"Comfy pants, they look good. The only complaint i have is that the side pocket zippers both broke when i tried them on for the first time. because of stretching. Otherwise im very pleased."
4.0,"They are nice socks, just too short for my legs.<br />My wife is on her feet all day,  so she is going to use them."
4.0,"Great quality, really cute, just ran very small."
4.0,"5'8, 162lbs, ~31&#34; waist These tights fit fine and have so far held up to a variety of fitness activities (weightlifting, yoga, light cardio)"
4.0,"This swimsuit arrived fairly quickly for being shipped from outside the US and looks just like the picture. The swimsuit seems to be of really good quality as well but I'd say order a size or 2 up with this swimsuit as it does run a bit on the smaller side. I normally wear a 16/18 and ordered the XXXL which is suppose to be a 22/24 by the sizing chart but it definitely is a bit small still. The top fits but is a bit snugger than I would have liked and the bottoms fit but the crotch area is somewhat thin in width so I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing the bottoms in public but the top would be cute with some black swim shorts which is probably what I'll get to wear with it.Overall for the price its a decent swimsuit and the material does seem quite thick and durable.<br /><br />****Disclaimer****<br />- I received this product (very kindly) at a discount or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product, based upon my own personal experience.<br />- I have not been coached or asked to provide positive feedback, nor have I received any compensation or incentive from the company for this review.<br />- I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR part 255 &#34;guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising&#34;.<br />- I am not affiliated with this company or any of their products, in any way.<br />- The views expressed here are my own, based on my personal use and experience with the product, and are unbiased and honest reviews.

4.0,"its nice and unique, I like &#34;Dior&#34; logo on the side, but it made of plastic and look cheap for whom doesn't know about brand names,"
4.0,They're good little cheap but look good both on men & women
4.0,"I like them, but I'm just too old for heels"
4.0,"I loved these heels, but  they were too small.  They didn't have any give to them.  I really wanted to keep them, but I also love comfortable shoes."
4.0,Unique gift! I bought two.
4.0,Fits good. A little thinner than i expected.
4.0,This was a birthday present for my husband. He liked the leather of it and so far (1 week in) it’s holding up pretty well.
4.0,"I accidentally ordered a size that is too small for my foot, but other than that they are great socks."
4.0,Seem to be very good quality for the price. I like that it came with a soft case and a semi-hard case. I also like the included cleaning rag. The lens clarity is good and the frames seem like they will hold up well. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the nose piece was a little too small for my nose and it doesn't appear to be easily adjusted.
4.0,Beautiful earrings! Comparable to Kendra Scott!
4.0,"I bought these hands to help make a creature to decorate my front yard!! They are very creepy looking hands!  I was disappointed that the palm was not enclosed, but they should still work well for my creature!  I can see why they are not enclosed.  If you were wearing them as part of your costume, they would be much more comfortable with the open palm.  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition!"
4.0,"A little small, but can wear it opened.  I didn’t want to return it because it took soooo long to receive it. Good quality, would order up 1 size next time"
4.0,"Wore these to my brother's wedding. I made the mistake of not breaking them in first, and had to take them off towards the end of the night. My toes were extremely cramped when I stood up and hurt terribly. The shoes are adorable, though.<br /><br />I should have ordered a half size bigger maybe. Ordered a 9 which is what I normally wear, they were a tad small."
4.0,"Great breathable,weather resistant coat at a great price."
4.0,"Texture seems a little coarse for the money...but it looks good and fits well enough.  More of a ""Sweater look"" than a ""sweater feel."""
4.0,"Lateral buttons does press properly and need forced push to make it work. Otherwise, is resistant in terms of it material and looks fancy and sophisticated."
4.0,These fit somewhat big.  I ended up giving them to my teenage son and he loves them!
4.0,"Very cute shoes, good quality for the price."
4.0,"Great condition upon arrival. I ordered an 8, (i am normally a US size small- medium)  i am a little chesty but the dress slid right on! i would for sure order again. I wore it to a Christmas party and received tons of complements!"
4.0,Cute but get 1 to 2 size larger
4.0,Stiff but pretty
4.0,"It really does give perfect mouse response. It has some thickness, giving cushion as well."
4.0,I wish it were more absorbent.
4.0,"Cute dress, but the bottom layer is much longer than I expected. I’m pretty short with short legs, though. Still looking forward to wearing it!"
4.0,Got a lot of compliments love it
4.0,I love this skirt but it does not have any stretch to it and wished it came in a little bigger size!  Super cute!
4.0,Goes well with my car color
4.0,"The material is really nice, and I wanted to love these so badly.  The waist and length was great, but unfortunately the thigh flare looked ridiculous on me.  I am 5'5&#34;, 140, size 6, 29&#34; waist- with pretty thin thighs, and a smaller bottom.  These would look so good on a big bottomed girl with Beyoncé thighs! That girl would SLAY"
4.0,Welcome!!! Loved it and awesome!!
4.0,"I ordered the dark jade cardigan and I like it although it seems small for the size. I have a similar one from Macys in a size &#34;large&#34;, and it fits pretty much like this one that I ordered in 2x. I don't know if I can bring myself to buy a 3x, but I might try it since the material and construction seems pretty good, especially for the price."
4.0,These joggers have a soft almost silky feel to them. They keep me very warm and are not too thin or too thick. They did arrive with a hole in the pocket but it was on the seam so I was able to mend it myself. I do recommend these.
4.0,"This costume is well made and beautiful. I deducted one star because some of the appliqué on the bodice was not properly attached and required some hand stitching to tack it down. I also think the sizing is a little off. My 7 year old is short for her age but otherwise average sized, and the length of the leotard was shorter than I imagined. It fits but I think we will get less wear out of it."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. I ordered two sizes and one is too big by a decent amount and the other is a little tight but manageable. They are the same dress but have different underlining materials. One had a Matt material and the other had a silkier material. All I will say is that the tan underneath is definitely tan and doesn't make the dress look white like I wanted. However the make of this dress is very well. Lace is beautiful and I did not have any issues with either one I ordered. I'll attach pics. Highly recommend over all (the size in the pic is a medium, I'm 5'6&quot; and the length is perfect. Does have an under shirt that doesn't reach the end of the dress so u can see your feet and ankles through the bottom lace. I just wore an extra skirt under it."
4.0,"I liked this top, but it didn't like me. Description says off-shoulder. Didn't fit me that way, which I was glad for. However, someone who really wants an off-shoulder look would probably be disappointed.  Neckline is a little larger than a crew neck.<br /><br />Perhaps it might fall off-shoulder on a much, MUCH smaller woman. I'm 5""3, weighing 145. Judging from the way the Medium I bought fit, the Large would have been too large because I'm smallish up top. At least 140 of my 145 lbs is in my hips.<br /><br />I returned it because (1) it hung lower on my body than I like; (2) See above:  It established a SEVERELY close relationship with my behind. Big booties might be in, but mine takes it to an almost-scary extreme.<br /><br />I ordered the Brown, which isn't really true brown, but more of a light brown with gold tones. It's quite pretty. I liked the weight and feel of the fabric. Hated to part with it, but as is so often the case, my booty dictates what I can and cannot (or should not) wear."
4.0,"Ordered an XXL and it was snug. Also material is thinner than I had anticipated. However, this garment does not show cat hair."
4.0,Fine lightweight sarong for around the pool.
4.0,"It’s great now in the warm weather and will still be suitable for the cooler months with a sweater, and so cute on"
4.0,Its cool. Took very long to arrive
4.0,It’s a nice belt but it doesn’t last. The faux leather went bad within a few months of use however for the price it’s not bad.
4.0,"Omg this tank is loooooong be forewarned. With that said, I am tall so that's perfect!  Shorter gals may not like this. Also, the reason I removed one star is cause the straps are &#34;backwards&#34; if that makes sense. The doubled-up part of the adjustment is in front instead of the back. Otherwise, it was just what I was looking for!"
4.0,Pretty but runs small on bust area
4.0,The product is great mask has good quality and everything it’s just very big.
4.0,My wife like it and i like to see her wearing it.
4.0,"Definitely works when you use it right before you go outside. However you need to wash your glasses and reapply every time you go outside, otherwise I’ve found it doesn’t work."
4.0,I ordered several different colors. Shirts are nice but material is a little thin. They are casual and go great with dress pants for work or with jeans. Overall these shirts are a great value.
4.0,Lovin' this bag
4.0,"I like it and I use it when it's very cold out.  I don't think there's a way to make this style of balaclava comfortable- it pulls down on the ears similar to how a tight masks does.  Better for keeping the neck warm than running- if running, just get a well fit mask that dries well.<br />The pocket for 2.5m filter is an excellent feature, but that becomes 5 layers with the mask itself, and the air escapes around the sides more than going through the filter.  With rigorous exercise the material in front of the mouth becomes wet, and stops passing air through, so you really can't keep it on for distance running."
4.0,Great addition to a costume.
4.0,Great compression sack for the price. 4/5 stars because of 3 compression straps as apposed to SeatoSummit and others that have 4.
4.0,"For the price, it's a nice bracelet."
4.0,"I thought I’d need to order up a size because at 214lbs I don’t need any more pants that cut into me, but the size I ordered was actually too big, I can wear them still, and they are comfortable, but if I tried to chase my kids in these with my phone in the pocket, the pants would be constantly creeping down too low. I probably should have ordered the XL instead."
4.0,Perfect “professional” shorts. Just a tad larger than expected.  I’ve quality and has some stretch so I could have sized down
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:4996fccb55f0c05c31a5a49b09b2dd28]] This is a very colorful set of socks.  As you can see in my short video, you get many different colors to match just about anything in your wardrobe.<br /><br />Although these are said to be for men, I tried them on and they fit me perfectly.  I am a female and wear an 8.5 shoe and although there is some stretch to these, I’m not sure they would fit a man with a large shoe size.<br /><br />I can tell you that these are extremely comfortable to wear.  They are nice and soft and the toe seam does not rub against my foot at all like some of my socks have in the past.  The elastic is just tight enough for them to stay put but not tight enough for them to cut off my circulation or be uncomfortable in any way.<br /><br />Overall, I love the variety and high quality and I think these could be worn by some men, women and larger children alike!  I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Versatile. Perfect for lounging around house or easy to dress up with fun jewelry.
4.0,"You're going to need some patience and strength to punch holes in these belts, but the quality of them is wonderful as is the color of each."
4.0,"beautiful dress, wanted to love it - but not enough room for my shoulders."
4.0,"This sweatshirt is really cute. It's definitely thinner than I thought it would be but that's okay. I am 5'3"" / 120 lbs. and I usually wear a size small but I ordered a size medium because I prefer a looser fit. I honestly wish I got a size large because I'm worried if I accidentally dry it, it won't fit right. I would definitely recommend sizing up! but super cute!"
4.0,Gift for grandson.  Variety is the colored watch band of life.
4.0,love the boot had to return it to loose around my leg
4.0,"I love the color and the fabric of this dress; I am 5'7"", 190 pounds, and the band at the waist seemed to make me look thicker.  I ordered an XXL and it was too big but I think the extra large would have been too small. I don't think this is a good pick for curvy girls with a muffin top!"
4.0,Very nice outfit and it’s soft my granddaughter loves it
4.0,Very cute. Fits as I had imagined it would. I like it!
4.0,Looks good on.  Leather is soft and comfortable on.
4.0,"First off.. this exceeded my expectations. It is very soft and the length is great, it untangles easily and fits very nicely. However the only thing that I am not pleased with is the very front of the wig, the small hair under the bangs is very tangled and It was very hard to get the side bangs in place while covering the &#34;ratty&#34; hairs underneath. I might trim them the next time I wear it, but for now i just tucked them under the cap. I would purchase this item again with out a doubt. There is a removable tag on it with washing instructions, however I am very wary to wash this item."
4.0,"Relatively plain, but does the trick for a comfy work shirt"
4.0,"Fit the watch, no problems, everything as expected."
4.0,"I am a leggings Guru/ connoisseur... i have leggings from Cute Booty Lounge, CLS, NVGTN, Gym Shark, and lots other brands. & i can say these leggins are GREAT, they are extremely soft, good compression, but not too much to where your chub(if any) squeezes out, not see through, very flexible-<br />I ordered the grey contour pair, size LARGE. I am 5'7 158# on a bad day."
4.0,"My girlfriend loves it, it was worth the smile on her face. 🙂"
4.0,I bought a pair before and loved them! Just rec'd the 3 pack for 20$! They front panel helps pull in your belly!<br />Lots of stretch! Love ❤️ the pockets!<br />They aren't perfect. Works for me!<br />Size
4.0,Lovely dress. Longer than expected. I'm 5'10 and it still hit below my knees. Very fitting dress. Only issue is it's more of an of black. Not dark like the picture. Hubby loved me in it
4.0,Fit in the sweater is wonderful. I had a nice light weight to it which is perfect for this time of year. The sleeves are a little weird on me. The ruffle comes like 6 inches under my shoulder. I think it is supposed to sit on the shoulder.
4.0,"This shirt, like the longer sleeve version was also well made and solves the major problem of getting dressed post surgery.  We wish that the snaps could be a little easier to put together but at least they don't open while being worn."
4.0,"Very beautiful skirt, great fabric, got a little loose. But i loved it"
4.0,It's a bit smaller than I expected but it's really pretty and comfortable.
4.0,Love the product! My daughter says it's the first jewelry she'll wear because it &#34;means something&#34; to her; she's 39.<br />Felt like it took awhile to arrive. Worth the wait for the sentimental value.
4.0,"String that comes with it is already starting to unravel at the ends, too slick to reliably and securely tie to the neck of the guitar. Mine had a Fender logo on it, wasn't expecting that. I don't play a Fender, but I'm not going to knock it for that."
4.0,It is beautiful although the size M is very wide
4.0,"wish the lining went all through the hat. I haven't worn it yet, but seems to be good"
4.0,There really cute but one of the chains broke other than that it was fine
4.0,Good quality but not amazing. Still a good deal for the price.
4.0,Super cute. I figured it would run small. So I sized up one size and was fine.
4.0,"It's a decent quality product and looks exactly same as the pictures but I'm just saying that it's a pair of pants rather than leggings since it doesnt stretch that much. I'm 5'3 and 123 lbs regular woman (not athletic! = I dont have toned body) and it fits little small but still wearable. So I'm suggesting that if you are smaller than me, go crazy with these leggings, you will love them. If you are bigger than me, I'm sorry to say this but these wouldn't fit for you. If you are toned and smaller than 5'3, yea you will love these leggings!<br />They completely protects winter winds and it's super thick so they are perfect for the winter."
4.0,Great size cade
4.0,"Nice dress, but it was too big. If you normally wear a large, than you should order the medium."
4.0,"For lightweight early season, they are plenty warm.  85F afternoon and they are hot.  Could use a lighter version.  Good for 50F to 70F weather."
4.0,Bought it for my boyfriend because he loves Ice Bear. It fits him pretty well and the material is very soft on the inside and outside. I'm not sure how warm it is because its not cold out here yet but it looks thick. My biggest issue with the costume is that the back is held together with Velcro and it doesn't stick that well which may cause an issue once Halloween comes.
4.0,I use XL but this short with label XL was much smaller. I say you need to order 2 sizes up. But they have only XL as biggest. Quality looks good
4.0,"I like it.  It's a bit more delicate than I imagined, so I did not try to reshape it for fear of it coming out of round.  It is a great addition for my &#34;silver days&#34; and it is very comfortable.  Very very shiny, which I like, and no unfinished edges, which I do not like."
4.0,I really like them. Good looking and comfortable shoes.
4.0,It is not as long as I thought is was going to be but still get tons of compliments on it. Great price
4.0,Product is fairly tight. Great quality.. Was hoping it will stretch out some.
4.0,Really good funny joke to mess with
4.0,I love it. Hasnt tarnished yet. Jewel hasnt fallen out yet. Only reason why I cant give it a 5 star is the bar is way to long and it bends my skin and has caused it to become get irritated. I wore it upside down for a few days while I oredered other belly rings. Deffintely not a every day piece of jewelry so I would recommend just on days you wanna look extra cute 😘
4.0,I bought these to wear within my apartment. Nice and cozy.
4.0,Not as vibrant as i was hoping
4.0,Fits great looks great.  I miss the days of the exact fit Z hats WITH A CURVED BILL.  Not everyone wants a flat bill.
4.0,"Nice weight to the keychain and the carabiner works well. The knife that's hidden in the keychain is less a knife and more a sharp edge that has more in common with a letter opener than knife, but it does work really well to open things. I do wonder how long the hidden knife will last since it's rather tiny and thinly attached, but we'll see."
4.0,"These are very stylish and wonderfully lightweight. But they provide almost no darkening - I still squint on the sun when wearing them. I’m a little afraid about how durable they are because the frames are so thin. Also, I have this problem with a lot of sunglasses that are flat (do not curve around your face) - there is a little glare/reflection is the bottom corners. But for looks and for weight, these are great."
4.0,"Nice enough for incredibly low price. Thought it was shipping from China, but came from Turkey. Maybe not quite as vibrant as picture and map looks a little less detailed but all together nice looking unique necklace."
4.0,Very pretty but the earrings were not in the shipment.
4.0,Very good bag that carries my daughter's school items as she transitions between classes since they are not allowed to take a full backpack.  Versatile and lightweight but sturdy enough for her needs.  Although the inside handle is a bit annoying but fine for carrying it around.
4.0,Pretty but on the small size...good it was for my daughter she is slender.
4.0,"The brown stones have tiny golden sparkles in them that really show well in the light. The black stones do not have sparkles, but have a smooth, brilliant look in the light. The two colors combine for a lovely, quality look."
4.0,Es linda pero se caen las letras facil
4.0,"Todo ok, la tela muy bien"
4.0,"I really like the Eagle Eye lens, but these tend to leave a smudge or scratch on my lens, so I  now use a different set up."
4.0,"Was a little disappointed, it doesn't stretch much and runs a bit small."
4.0,I like the dress. It was just too big.
4.0,Used for swimming
4.0,"We bought it for an adult male, too small to fit head. Kids like it."
4.0,Disappointed that the zipper doesn’t go all the way to the bottom. It is fine for me but for an older person stepping in and out it could be a fall risk.
4.0,"Really nice, simple, minimalist watch from Void. The bands are interchangeable so you can basically buy different colors of bands for this watch and create your own piece. I loved it in all black and will keep it that color. It's very easy to set up and is easy to read. The watch is very comfortable and goes with just about anything."
4.0,"It's kinda big but feels great, if I can return it and get a small that will be great but I don't know how"
4.0,It's nice. I just thought it'd be a lot more smaller and slimmer. It doesn't fit in my skinny purse. But it's nice gives you an option to take a section out and use just for like my ID and cc and I use that in my skinny purse.
4.0,Totally cite just wish it was slightly bigger
4.0,i reccomend it
4.0,Lovely card for our special boy.
4.0,My wife liked the Seahorse.......as did I. But again.......NO CHAIN!  What's up with this no chain business? I had to buy a chain for it.
4.0,"• I absolutely 🖤💛Looovvveeee my shirt!!<br />• I received tons of lovely comments.<br />• The lettering is firm, secure and not coming off.<br />• I also ordered one for my niece and she loves it!<br />• I celebrated BHM with a 5K and it was great!<br />• just make sure you ORDER A SIZE DOWN."
4.0,I love this jumpsuit! The material is very sleek and comfortable. It is not TTS. I recommend sizing up. I’m returning my medium and getting a large.
4.0,These earrings are absolutely beautiful. They are more than worth the money. They look modern and expensive. The only problem I've had with the earrings is that they hurt my ears. They are thick... Its like putting a stud back on your ear. I love them so much I keep wearing them anyway even though my ears are sore when I take them out.
4.0,Love them! Very comfortable to wear even when I’m not working out!
4.0,Soft and comfy. Sewing is a bit off and one leg is a tad longer than the other but not enough to be noticed other than when folding. My boys love them.
4.0,Nice Cubbies hat!  Simple cool design.
4.0,"It is as pictured, it ran a little smaller than I expected, but it works for me"
4.0,"Good patterns, comfortable and good value (not very thick) but does pill easily so I started washing in laundry bags and hang dry only.  Have not used them long enough to say if they are durable."
4.0,Super cute but i got it wayyy too small
4.0,good quality and good price. will buy more. 8.5-9.5 size fits my 9.5 shoe nicely.
4.0,Not a bad everyday watch. Simple and to the point. I'm satisfied.
4.0,Soft and warm but tight!  I never thought I had big hands or anything.
4.0,So far I like them a lot. I would like to know how fast they wear out and whether they stretch out too much in a while. That is why only four stars.
4.0,Nice Halloween gift for young kids
4.0,"Overall, liked the product.  However:<br />1) Have a very small wrist so I need to ensure it is tight.  Sometimes the magnetic clasp trips me up and I can't close just right.<br />2)  Magnetic band is a little hard to manage while charging the watch."
4.0,Very soft!  It’s longer then what’s pictured but dealable. Also sizing is a little big.
4.0,Got the next size up and it fit great. Return and replacement without any difficulties. Thanks
4.0,Use almost every meal and wife thinks its great.  Fewer soiled shirts.
4.0,"I really like it, but had hoped it would look exactly like the picture. Oddly what sold me on this keychain was the white cat’s face in the original product image. Was a little disappointed it wasn’t there when it arrived, but it is still cute."
4.0,Comfortable and fashionable. Love it
4.0,I love this brand. They are super comfortable. I only give 4 stars because I have a wide foot and the middle strap is a bit tight across my foot. I do still wear them in hopes of stretching them a bit. Otherwise perfect!!
4.0,"Very thin material. These fit like US Junior sizing, not womens sizing, so, unless your body doesn’t have curves, these fit awkwardly."
4.0,"Kinda disappointed the colors aren't exactly how it looks in the advertising display image, but nice regardless. The material is definitely not true flannel. It is a thin synthetic fiber that doesn't exactly feel cotton soft. More like a soft plastic fabric feel. The size is good, not too tight or too loose. It has real pockets on the chest & the stitching looks well done. The faux wood buttons add a nice contrast to the bright colors to see them well when buttoning. Only down side is the stitching to hold them looks like it could come out in 1 wash. There is no tag on the inside of the collar or inseam near the bottom to tell you what kind of material or how to wash without ruining. Best advice is to wash on cold, gentle cycle then to dry either on low, air dry cycle or hang up to air dry. Feels nice enough to wear during the summer & stay cool, but not for winter."
4.0,"Not a loose fitting top, a bit small compared to other sleeveless tops in medium.  Material isn't very soft."
4.0,"This was a gift.  The person I sent it to thought it was lovely, but I have not seen the item."
4.0,"When I got this dress, I thought it was awful. The material is cheap, the back is a different color black than the front, the design looks cheap...but then I put it on. It's actually quite cute once on and hangs in a flattering way. I'm planning to wear this to an outdoor concert. The material is light and airy, the dress looks good on, and paired with some sandals will be adorable. The fabric is still cheap, thin, and two different colors but for the price it's good enough."
4.0,"I think it's cute! Fits as expected, and it's nice for a holiday party when the temps aren't freezing."
4.0,This is a beautiful pin and I really like it.  Gorgeous filigree work with the silver and the blue stone is quite pretty.  Only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that it is quite a bit smaller than I thought!
4.0,Love skater dresses this one is so beautiful. I buy for suggestion of my friend and I was surprised for the great quality.
4.0,"Four stars because I had to make alterations to the dress for it to foot nicely. I ordered a small (smallest size available) I'm 90 lbs 32DD vs bra 4'11 ft... I think it's true to size , i just think that there should have been more size options. :/ The dress held up all night and it looked beautiful under the lights. It's worth the price. 😛"
4.0,"This belt is really thick. I imagine that this will last a long time because of the quality leather that was used for this item. The advertisement states it has all season use, which I would agree. It holds bottoms up very well. The only things I don't like about is that the gold buckle looks like a brass color and the belt looks blue, not black. Other than that, I would recommend this item... it is very high quality leather."
4.0,nice a lot looser and more see through then i was expecting<br /> but is nice<br /><br />probably should sell for less than 17.50<br /><br />you have to wear some thing under it
4.0,The bad about it is that the end of it magnatized and it sticks to stuff.
4.0,"Super cute, not too well made. My daughter necklace broke the next day or so. Yes dad had the keychain so I don't know how it's holding up."
4.0,I love these but size up
4.0,Pretty decent costume. Downside is part of the lace got detached so I have to sow that part back. Other than that it's pretty cute.
4.0,It was definitely smaller than expected but very nice to the touch. It fit my purse well. The gold accent is beautiful. One issue I had is the tassels keep bushing out..
4.0,"Its good for casual day at work.  I wish it had pockets, and I wish it had a two way zipper like the cardigans.  It's maybe a bit long on me, but not comically so."
4.0,"It's a very pretty bracelet, but I had to ask how to open the clasp.  I have never seen a clasp like this before.  I have to get my husband to fasten it for me."
4.0,"Order a small, 5’2 118lbs. Very long. Fits well but is just wayyyy too long. Shrinks though."
4.0,Love the material and waste band...  Only problem is they are pretty long for shorts.  I solved this by rolling up the waste band twice.  Very comfortable shorts
4.0,I liked this dress but for some reason the neck seems a little wide so it doesn't lay flat. I'm 5'8&#34; & weigh 190 & the dress was the perfect length.
4.0,"The only reason I’m not giving 5 stars is because I’ve only just received it, and I don’t know how it’s going to hold up after being worn and washed. But the material feels thick and ought to hold up really well. I sized up two sizes larger than I normally wear because other reviews (and sizing chart) said it ran small, and that it had very little stretch in the arms. I have fatter arms so I’m happy I sized up as I did, because the size I got fits me just right with a little snugness.  Over all I’m very happy with this purchase and am excited to wear it!"
4.0,"I had ordered a similar one from this company.but sent it back because I prefer a dainty watch. This one also has a much larger face than I would prefer (like a man's watch), but I kept it because it is easy to read and attractive."
4.0,"It's very very slim, it looks thick and cool but it's very tiny. Still a lovely fit, just slimmer than I would have liked."
4.0,"I ordered three shirts in three different colors. I got three different styles of shirts!  While they are OK, they were not really what I wanted to purchase.  The one I looked at initially has a vent panel on the back which really helps when you are out in the hot sun!"
4.0,"Not bad to install, how low frequency<br />Have to be close for it to activate"
4.0,Daughter loves it. She keeps all her wallet photos in it. Plenty of room and so far holding up to her destructive ways
4.0,"The bag is great, just the right size and number of pockets.  The problem with it is that the metal is very cheap and the minute I pulled on the long shoulder strap, the metal snapped and it became unusable. I still carry it by the smaller handles, but it lost a lot of its value when it lost the shoulder strap.[[ASIN:B00JW0EXUW BMC Dark Tan Denim Multi Zipper Pocket Oversized Lined Fashion Handbag Satchel Shopper Tote]]"
4.0,"Vertical stripes can be TOUGH to pull off and I just wasn't crazy about how this looked on me. It's pretty true to the picture and does have padding as well, which makes it a bit more flattering. It was a comfortable one piece and cut pretty conservatively, in my opinion. Pretty good knock off of the &#34;solid and striped&#34; brand version but just wasn't doing it for me. Also could be cute worn as a body suit with high waisted shorts or pants."
4.0,I ordered a size bigger than what I wear because I wear sweaters over other clothes..I wear a large and ordered an extra large as usual..was a little bit big as needed..Perfect size..True to fit..
4.0,Material is a little see through but not terrible. Arms were a little tight. Other than that I love it
4.0,"Loved the suit so much that I bought it in blue, and then again in pink.  The blue suit ran on the large side, but I kept it anyway.  When I ordered the pink one in a size smaller, it was way too small.  Not sure what the difference was, but I do love the suit.  Great coverage.  Like the way the straps stay on my shoulders."
4.0,"The fancy design is one reason I selected this and it really is. The clip part is almost hidden behind the glasses. Unfortunately, the convexity (curve) may not fit to some glasses including mine. If the frame of your glass is rather curved, I think this will be perfect."
4.0,Nice was hoping it was longer
4.0,It's I little big for me but i like the dress
4.0,"Looks good.<br />Feels good, real good."
4.0,I am a size 16 bottom and in between a XL and XXL top with a small bust. The bottoms SUCKED! Extra fabric made me look like I had diaper butt and the front was barely enough to cover my lady bits. If I didn’t have it positioned perfectly one side of my area would show. HOWEVER the top was amazing!! Covered up my tummy and held up my little ladies perfectly! In conclusion if you don’t mind buying different bottoms and you are built with small breasts unlike most larger women this is the top for your Murica celebrations!
4.0,Good value for the price. My 4 year old granddaughter will love wearing the Disney Frozen t-shirts.
4.0,Just fine for the price...color was as expected.a little too wide for my taste. I should have paid more attention to the description.
4.0,"Since I received the boots the weather has been warmer, so I don't have a good feel for how well they will keep my feet warm.<br />They appear to be well made and I hope they will last for a long time."
4.0,very cool but runs small
4.0,The boots fit well and are cute.
4.0,"Great gloves, long, warm and comfy.  One star off because the SmarTouch really does't work very well with my normal iphone 5s.  Takes several efforts to swipe, and then it's just mash and hope you get lucky.  You'll see in the image that the finger isn't the whole tip, just a little piece, and everything must be in perfect alignment to work.<br /><br />I have a pair of $10 nhl team thin gloves that have the same technology, and they work 10x better than these.<br /><br />Still, good gloves that keep me warm and grip the steering wheel nicely."
4.0,"It was pretty much what I expected, and keeps me from losing my keys on a daily basis. I thought that the clip would have a more distressed look, rather than being super shiny, but that's not really a big deal. It will get distressed all on it's own in time."
4.0,A little too long....
4.0,"The dress is really cute and comfortable, but the top is see through. That is my only reason for taking 1 star away. Definitely will need to get a camisole to go underneath."
4.0,"Nice windbreaker however can't get the wrinkles out. Instructions say no detergent, no hot water, no dryer,no iron. Have worn it twice in heavy rain kept me dry but still very wrinkled"
4.0,I thought this would be more like a sweatshirt but I'd say its like a medium weight sweater in thickness. Still really cute and good quality.
4.0,"Quite pretty. Seems to be quite wrinkle resistent too. However, be aware if you are tall, or long waisted, it's a bit short waisted. It was on me. Might not fit on your natural waist."
4.0,"Decent tank tops that fit right are getting hard to find. For the price these were great. The colors are right on and the quality is much better than I expected. However, follow the advice and get at least a size or two up if you don't want too tight of a fit. I bought mediums and they fit like a small. I intend to get another set in large but the mediums will still work. A worthwhile purchase that I recommend. Since writing the review above I ordered another set in XL. I normally wear a medium. The Xl fit great however if you have a longer torso they may be a bit short. In any event they are a good product for the price but defiantly go up at least 2 sizes."
4.0,"I was curious to see how useful an all black watch could be. Unfortunately, not very good. The time is very difficult to read without indiglo illumination, even in bright light. It is a beautiful, light, and we'll made watch, but you just can't see the time without indiglo. The strap is a shiny black leather, like the stuff that ladies purses are made of. I will return it for the strap alone. Sticker said that the strap was made in China and the Movement is from Philippines. The good part about this watch is that it looks upscale and rather luxurious. You can't see the Timex band name anywhere without the indiglo."
4.0,Super cute true to size
4.0,"great coordinating color package for new infants at a great cost, and considering they wear the clothes for a couple months if that, good price point and quality."
4.0,For the price it will be very nice when wearing the same color.  Doesn't quite look like it is worth more than $20.
4.0,Great quality but large than expected
4.0,The only reason I gave this s a four is because it is so long. After reading the reviews I thought  this shirt sounded perfect. I guess  because I am only 5' 2&#34; on me this shirt looks like a dress. I am keeping it because it is very soft and roomy and I can shorten it  and it will be perfect. I'm also going to remove the buttons because on me they don't rest in a good place.This really is a nice top and for once true to size and Not 3x 2 small!
4.0,"This gives me everything I could have wanted from it, except that the material is a bit thin, but for the price it is worth it."
4.0,"Very comfortable, but runs somewhat large.  Nicely Made"
4.0,"I don't require much when it comes to wearing gloves, just that they are warm and fit well. That being said, I find that I can slip my hand inside when the gloves are buttoned with no issue, and the fingertips seem a little too long, but I fear a smaller size may be just too small to fit, because they are otherwise snug.<br /><br />Touchscreen controls are a nice feature, but I haven't had much occasion to try them out. Features that require fine control don't work, but I feel I could receive a call without problem, which is probably the only time someone should be using their phone out in the cold, anyway."
4.0,Absolutely love it. I received many compliments. I ordered the beige color.
4.0,I love the colors that came in the 3 pack. Nice material.  The size runs differently in each color. That was a disappointment.  The olive runs larger than the grey and black. Still like them but does stop me from ordering  more.
4.0,Item fits really well for petite woman. Pleasantly surprised my only complaint is the nose piece could have a slightly better seal but im picky with that. Nose piece rating would be a 4 out of 5
4.0,"Love these socks, they wear better than my smartwool. The heavy Smallwood have better cushion but for  normal hiking these work great."
4.0,It was a little big and way poofier than expected but still a great skirt
4.0,"Top was good fit for PJ loose. Im 5'6"" about 165. Not crop toppy. Nice material. Shorts... argh I wish I could order in a bigger size. I read the reviews and ordered a size larger in the whole outfit, but I have big thighs and a big butt. When I walk around they kind of scrunch up in the crotch... you know what I mean... but I love the top! When im not with a new date I'd wear the shorts at home."
4.0,Very nice. Fit well. A. Good color
4.0,Great little light weight top for summer.
4.0,It has been difficult to find the full cut men's briefs in anything other than white so I was happy to be able to get these. They fit like the one's I'm used to wearing.
4.0,Beautifully matched a turquoise necklace my wife already had from Sleeping Beauty mine.
4.0,"This is an excellent product, and both quality and value. The reason why didn't give it five stars was because it is small. I am a 6 foot 200 pound man and the watchband your smaller overall compared to the rubber or synthetic bands. It needs to be an inch longer."
4.0,"Great product for the price. Nothing fancy, but do adorable."
4.0,Very good beanie. The gray part underneath kind of comes out when you put it on but all in all it does what it's supposed to do and keeps your head warm. Fit is a little tight but good nonetheless.
4.0,"Super comfy, a little thinner than I would like but overall it’s good!"
4.0,Was a great gift for another friend. She loved it.
4.0,"very comfortable and warm, only possible negative is it's hard to tell left from right without turning them over. overall pleased with purchase"
4.0,It's more convenient than putting on and taking off reading glasses.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Not as long as we expected (just below the knee) but she still loves it. My daughter is a tall almost 8 yr old and we bought the size 10. Loved the price too.
4.0,"Like I said this is a great watch. It looks great, fits great, turns heads and has never given me any issues (have had the battery changed twice, o-ring replaced once and lubed at no cost from the Fossil store by my house). The first con I have is that is has no luminescent at all and is useless in the dark. The second con is that the hour and minute hands are a little difficult to read in certain light as their is little contrast between the color of the arms and the face of the watch. This is one of 7 Fossil watches in my collection and is one of my favorites despite the minor caveats."
4.0,"Bought these for my wife... She used them for a couple 30 rides then the 2011 Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic. She says they are good... Biggest complaint she had is the lack of the tacky strip around the leg cuffs, they tend to want to climb the leg a bit."
4.0,"I found the nose bridge wire too short and flimsy to contour over the bridge of my big nose for a good seal. It's an easy fix, snip the mask on the inside top near the ear-band and remove the flimsy short wire and replace it with one about an inch longer and more rigid. I used a heavy-gauge steel sculpting wire, like artists use for creating armatures. (Make sure you file off any sharp edges.)  Then I just bent it in the middle to cover the bridge of my nose and another gentle bend on each side to mold it to my cheeks. I don't think the filter is all that useful, air tends to go around it, but the activated charcoal in the filter helps keep it smelling fresh.. I have to wear a mask at work all night long, and I'm a smoker, so I don't want to have to wear a smelly mask. I also have a beard, so I'm never going to get a really good seal, but I feel a lot safer wearing it than not. It is quite comfortable, but I also snip the sharp corners off the filter inserts, as they can poke you if you don't. It's a decent mask, especially if you have a bit of a beard, but it does need to be modified a bit for comfort and safety."
4.0,This belt is a staple in my wardrobe... so cute. Will have to buy another so this one doesn’t wear out
4.0,"I see most of the reviews are for Style 1(the very oversized style). This is for style 2. I followed the Mordnemiss measurements, I ordered Large. I am about a 14-16, 35 inch waist, 45 inch hips. These fit like a dream. Loose enough, plenty of thigh room, cute, comfy, casual. The elastic waist seems comfy enough, I'd say it could easily stretch a few more inches. I may order a couple more pairs, in the black and grey. Only two caveats: 1. if you, like me, have thighs that touch/rub, you may need to wear some skimmies with these.. the harem/dropped crotch style leaves the tops of your thighs touching enough to cause the dreaded chub rub! ;)  2. I wish the pockets were higher. I would have to bend over to truly use these pockets."
4.0,Super fast shipping! Not the best version of tortoise pattern..but for the money they look great. Thanks!
4.0,These jeans were a lot nicer than I expected. The material is a very good feature. They have just the right amount of stretch
4.0,"Nice material, seems to run a tad small."
4.0,Comfy material but not the best fit for me
4.0,"A bit tighter than I would prefer for my particular build, but the quality appears to be good. The material is great, and the length is actually where I need it to be. I’m going to take this to my local seamstress to see it they can let it out just a bit so it better fits my middle. I carry most of my weight in my abdomen, and as is, it accentuates everything I’d like to hide. 😔"
4.0,WARM and super cute.  Love love love
4.0,"Oddsox fit my big feet a lot better.  Giving them to a friend, they're hilariously small on my size 15 feet.  Oddsox fit fine, stretch out a lot more."
4.0,Love it! Super sexy!
4.0,Great quality material just too short
4.0,I like it for it's comfortness and lightweight for the warmer weather.
4.0,"The right side of the lenses swings freely, very loose, not much to complain about but it is the only reason why it is 4 instead of 5. I have a big head and it fits perfectly. When these break I will purchase again."
4.0,"they are nice blended fabric athletic tee’s. very light weight, but that’s what i was looking for going into the summer season. they have that polyesther feel to them. the shirt’s run large to there sizes, near a full size in my opinion. i am 5’10” 187 lbs. and the large is loose. all in all, i would say i was happy with this purchase."
4.0,Love the color and different designs. They will get softer with ware and washing.
4.0,"When I ordered this, I thought it would be larger than it is. I wanted it to use as a zipper pull on my purse, but was disappointed when I received it. It is too small for my arthritic hands to use. I had to order a larger zipper pull. However, this is a pretty zipper pull that would be beautiful charm for a charm bracelet, or it could be used as a zipper pull on a child's purse."
4.0,I love it. I would give five star if the cross was a little bigger that way it have some weight to it. Overall If you buy this item you will love it for yourself or a gift.
4.0,These are very comfortable. Plenty support if just a little too sheer. I ordered large instead of my normal medium and the fit is nearly perfect.
4.0,A little large and slide off easily.
4.0,"This cardigan runs BIG! If i wasn’t swimming in this cardigan, I would have kept it. It’s such a SOFT and COMFORTABLE material. Everything I wanted. I ordered a medium for length ( my true size) but it fit like an XL. Keep that in mind when ordering. But such a beautiful cardigan."
4.0,liked the dress looked funky on me so it went back.
4.0,I really like the corduroy material and the button detail but the skirt was pretty big. We ordered a size 7 and it fit more like a womens XS in both length and the waist. It might fit in a couple years so we'll set it aside. It is a nice looking skirt and the blue color is a nice dark teal.
4.0,These trendy earrings are fun and cute! The gold looks a bit fake but for the price it can't be beat!
4.0,What you see is what you get very pretty.
4.0,"Great Product. Came With Supreme Tag. Only dissatisfied with shipping, took a long time."
4.0,I am 5 10 and these fit perfectly. Service was fast and the quality is good. 4 for $21? These are a steal; get them
4.0,These are adorable. I’m 5’4” at 112 lbs and got an XS. Fit it great. Comfortable. Look very cute with a tall boot with a heel.
4.0,"came a bit smaller than I expected, but that could possibly be my fault for expecting that it would be bigger.. Other than that the clip is great!"
4.0,I love the sweater but I bought the rusting mauve colored one but when it came it was definitely not the same color..it was an orange like melon color.
4.0,"Love the look and feel.  The holder for the licence, the seam did tear when removing it but still holds it snugly."
4.0,Wear it for bed but I like it a little looser but it was fine.  If you’re thin it would be loose.  But it was fine even with a belly.
4.0,Fits like the original but seems to have more rubber where the old one failed.
4.0,this needs to be put in the dryer to get all the fuzz off of it first  but it is very cute.  I also have the white one.
4.0,This is a beautiful well made piece.  Stretches perfectly to fit your wrist without breaking. I would definitely recommend anyone to buy this piece. It was well packaged came with a nice black pouch for carrying your piece.
4.0,"Leather seems really thin,  but they're warm! I ordered size 7 and they fit perfectly fine.  I hope they last."
4.0,It’s a cute band .
4.0,"It is a very cute jumpsuit. But didn't fit the way I wanted it to, I ordered a Large. I'm 160' 5'7 and this was a little too snug. I wanted it to be a little baggy in the front.. and it wasn't.  But it was cute. I literally had on a cat cute. I wanted to look more casual, leisure cute. Maybe I'll try a XL"
4.0,"Very thin material, but comfortable and flattering!"
4.0,Super cute dress. Extremely see through and is pretty short.. hoping I can find something to wear under the top half.
4.0,These sandals are very cute and comfortable! I have several in different colors and love them all.
4.0,"Print is pretty, dress is VERY sheer & lightweight. Very comfortable, but had to wear underslip. Lots of compliments, might look for a different way to wear it next time. Great in hot summer weather though!"
4.0,"Thin but tough material, good length. Not really designed for excessive moisture absorption, but wicks sweat very well."
4.0,"Really liked this watch, looks cute and very appropriate size for everyday use. The quality is great too. Would totally recommend it"
4.0,It would have been perfect but I pulled it too hard while it was on one boob. Then it snapped it half. So I take full responsibility for putting it on wrong you're supposed to put them on with the clasp not intact instead I was stretching it with the clasp closed and that made it rip off from pulling it too hard. I've had one of these before and they work great so this product is recommended just know how to put it on properly and don't try putting it on any other way LOL
4.0,The bag is very durable and able to hold all of the things I can think to carry in it.
4.0,"It’s ok. Afraid to wear it much, seems like it’s going to stretch out."
4.0,"The page for this item shows a shirt and shorts combo. I ordered this and expected to get both but instead it was just the shirt. The description says T-SHIRT, however. So my complaint is the pictures or page should be more clear that you're ONLY getting the shirt. It doesn't look as great without the matching shorts to go with it.<br /><br />However the shirt is great otherwise and if you get the shorts that match it's a great combo. The material feels soft and it fits as expected."
4.0,It's ok. Not bad. Nor great. Decent add on piece
4.0,"This dress runs very big. I usually wear size Large, based on the reviews I went with a Med but I feel like I should have gone with a small. It is however almost lovely and comfortable dress. Ideal for just throwing on if you need to make a quick run and the color is absolutely gorgeous"
4.0,"My youngest daughter doesn’t have her ears pierced but loves the earrings that big sisters and mama wears. I have tried the magnetic earrings for her but we have had a couple issues with those. One they can be way too tight and hurt her ears with the magnets and two they seem to fall off easily by brushing the hair or accidentally rubbing the ear. So I decided to try a more traditional clip on option.<br /><br />These earrings all come in separate little clear bags and then they are all in a large black drawstring bag. Each individual bag has two earrings and two rubber backs for the earrings. It’s not the most convenient thing to have to assemble all the earrings but the alternative is not using the rubber backs.<br /><br />The earrings are satisfactory quality. They are adequate for my little and her dress up. The earrings have a nice variety of animals, objects and shapes. However my set is not the same as the picture shown in the ad. So it appears they are sent at random. No pair or earrings were the same though. They are all gold hardware with the various enamel print. They aren’t extremely colorful like the ones pictures but they bring something for interest.<br /><br />Comfort wise, they are definitely more manageable than the magnetic. They have just enough grasp to hang on but not too much that they hurt the ear lobe. Even after wearing them for longer periods of time they don’t irritate the ear lobes. I wore multiple pairs myself before even trying on her. She is little so she will wear them until her mood changes and she decided she doesn’t have earrings anymore. That’s another nice part about the earrings. They can ‘slide’ off and they are in one piece. If she would attempt to take off her magnetic ones we would usually lose a back or front almost immediately. With a one piece construction there is no risk of that. Also, she can take them off herself so she feels like a big girl. She doesn’t need my help and is learning how to put them on too. A mirror definitely helps but she will become more familiar with it over time."
4.0,Neck part was itchy. Otherwise comfy
4.0,I bought this dress thinking I could wear it for a wedding but its too sexy for that... This dress would be really cute for a much younger girl. (I'm 29)
4.0,I just wish they were a bit larger the ball is small but noticable
4.0,"These are nice, high quality swim googles.  Clasps can be tightened/loosened from either side and the eye pieces of soft rubber to form a seal<br />against your eyes.  I can't say I've ever owned high quality swim goggles such as these, so it's difficult to compare these against your typical, somewhat cheaply made googles, The clasps to loosen/tighten the google's on one's head are somewhat difficult to work with, but probably of more importance here is that once you've tightened these googles to a certain level, the clasps hold well, and they certainly seem to do that.  I received a discount for providing this review."
4.0,"For the price, these are great.  Love the look.  Just wish they were a tiny bit smaller.  (After I purchased I noticed there was also an 8mm option).  They hurt a bit initially but after having them in my ears for about a week or so I don't feel a thing."
4.0,I got this for pregnancy but I'm not sure it's long enough to grow with me as my belly expands. Just put this in at 20 weeks and I'm skeptical. It's cute and comfy and seemingly sturdy for now.
4.0,"Shipping fast! Material of swim suit is great, just the bottom is a bit larger than it should be. I ordered size small. The top fits great! Love the color, I bought blue and black!"
4.0,"These are 100% cotton A shirts. They are not a blend which means there is no stretch to them, and they will shrink in dryer if overly dryed. They also run about 2 sizes to small. Now considering all the cons associated with these shirt you might be wondering why I gave them a good rating? Well the reasons is that they are slightly thicker than a hanes shirt, they dont have that large opening under the underarms, they are considerably softer than hanes, and last but cetainly not least, they cost about a 3rd of what hanes does. So, when ordering keep in mind that they work well as a summer t shirt, not so well as a summer undershirt. You will get hot! But, makes an excellent winter undershirt. The cotton will hold in your warmth. Remember to order 2 sizes over your normal size, and at 2 bucks per shirt dont forget to pocket the savings!"
4.0,"This was exactly as advertised as far as I can tell so far.  I will change this review if I find out more as I go.  My citrine is a deep golden colour, like medium honey or medium amber whiskey or a NOT-dark-amber colour.  It’s pretty.  It’s the right shape, colour & clarity.  I appreciate the metal is not some amalgam or crappy alloy or base metal.  It hasn’t turned my finger any shade of green.  It’s set a little higher than I hoped, but not too high.  It rocks a little on my finger & occasionally catches on things.  I don’t like the stark setting as much as I thought I would, but it’s a very nice quality.  The ring sizes run a little small.  I use a ring sizer to measure my fingers, not some crazy chart.  My ring is a little tight by comparison, which makes it a little uncomfortable sometimes.  I don’t like that & it kept it from getting the last star.  The box & other packaging were nice.  The box was nice enough to keep, might be nice enough for a misc gift, is not nice enough for an engagement present or an important gift (Birthday/Christmas).  Overall - I like it, I kept it.  I didn’t try to replace it for the size issue, but I thought about it… briefly.  It’s a darker golden colour than I thought it might be & I am happier with that.  I wanted a gold colour.  I got it.  In the future I would be careful about sizes from this company.  Their videos have been helpful & fairly close to the products actual reality.  I like the videos.  They should always do them on a hand, with an elevation/side view of the setting & a scale of the model’s hand - maybe a credit card or something… .  Long story short, I’m happy for now with this product."
4.0,"A wee-bit wider than I would prefer, but overall looks cool."
4.0,Remember to get a size larger than normal in the US!
4.0,"I shop on amazon for cool finds like this. It came in a bag with bubble wrap around it. When I opened it, it was exactly what i ordered. They are shiny and nice and connect well. I got one for my boyfriend and I because we love Greys Anatomy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they are very thin and so is the connecter piece so I wouldn't put it on something that could get caught because they are fraile but it was totally worth it!"
4.0,I bought this as a gift. It looks great works great and he absolutlety loves it.
4.0,light weigh and convenient.
4.0,Colors on this shirt are fantastic! I love the classic t shirt feel to it. Was maybe a bit smaller than I would like.
4.0,Beautiful dress. You may want to order a size up if you are curvy like myself 5ft 7in 200lbs.
4.0,It is a comfortable summer dress
4.0,"Love this dress will buy a few more, would give five stars but had to cut hem off because it looked way to<br />Long, which they had left it with out extra length"
4.0,Did not like the shape.
4.0,"I like the feel of the fabric. Thinner than I expected, but comfortable. I ordered a large hoping for a “roomier” fit, but it was more like a medium fit. Over all good"
4.0,Perfect size. Soft material. Chic and stylish. I am very happy with my new purse.
4.0,They are not twist on backs as described but they are cute.
4.0,"Very fitted. Thin material. Cannot wear without a bra, but because the entire back is crochet it makes wearing a bra impractical.(interferes with the design in my opinion).  It's really cute though, so I'll figure something out. Perhaps I'll be buying a lacy army green bra next."
4.0,Everyone postednto get a size bigger and so I didn't but it is too big. My correct size of small would have been perfect. Go by your measurements
4.0,Very comfortable but a bit long compared to other brands of the same size and are a bit baggy. They seem to be well made.
4.0,Larger than I thought but so cute
4.0,"Love it.  Would be nice to have the center divider turned into a zippered pocket.  Otherwise, I really like it."
4.0,"I like this hoodie.<br />I got it during Cyber Monday discount season. So, you may not get it as discounted.<br />But it's a good hoodie for discounted price.<br />One small thing is that it's texture of fabric is rough. I mean really rough. Wish it was softer"
4.0,I like the pants but I ordered a size up because they're skinny and I like room but a 34 was still tight.  I'm gonna return and try a 36.
4.0,I love this tunic. It looks cute with different color/printed leggings underneath. It's made from a midweight tee shirt material and is super comfortable. I got the 2x and it 'fits' not as loose as the photo shows but I still love it.
4.0,"I ordered the Large capri in navy, grey, and black. Fit was just right, I am 5'5"", 160 and wear a size 10 pant.<br />Pros:<br />Side pockets - why are they so hard to find in capri style pants?? Hold my Galaxy S10 easily and securely.<br />Cost<br />Great for running<br />Don't attract cat hair<br />Cons:<br />I prefer when the elastic for the waistband is thicker so it has more of a smoothing effect. I like the fit of the waist on the 90 degree brand better."
4.0,Very nice dress for the price!! The material feels good!
4.0,"Nice tie, shipping is slow."
4.0,"i don't see the connection between the box brand and the mark on watch<br />but anyway looks nice , , works good until now , ,  heavy metal"
4.0,Yeah the vest is beautiful but yeah can barely go to my under bust. I think they could make it a tad bit longer and also leave a slight gap between the neck and collar because it feels like a choker.
4.0,"This hat fits as expected, however, I didn't realize there was a bit of a hole in the crown; not good if you want full sun protection.  It was because of this that I rated four stars.  Color vibrant as in the photo."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:2292756acbf497ccc3225b50748f1e7c]]
4.0,"I bought this because it looked very cool. And it IS! It's perfect because I love to wear hoodies, but I live in Hawaii, so hoodies aren't ideal. this is light and breathable fabric. It's great until I actually get cold. It doesn't hold too much warmth but it does what I want it to...and that is make me look and feel FIERCE"
4.0,these run large--your foot slides around in side making walking a little difficult but they are otherwise comfortable and warm.
4.0,Overall I like this set. The waist band on the shorts is a little think but other than that I really like it.
4.0,"My husband is a chauffeur.  These pants are Awesome & still look professional enough to do his work. With the winter coming & the rain,  snow , and wind.. these keep him warm & dry. Folks they are not waterproof.. water repellent,  which is great & good enough for him. He adores them."
4.0,They fit nicely around the face and under your mask. I wish my masks had a way to hold the plastic piece better.
4.0,"don't know how it will hoid up ,just got it,so ill keep you posted."
4.0,nice just like in the picture.
4.0,it was a cute suit but the bottom was too large and didn't fit it was almost droopy if that makes sense
4.0,Love these glasses. Just got a new pair for my Go bag. Great for the brightest of sunny days.
4.0,I use the over glasses lying in bed to watch television. You can keep your head flat and look at the ceiling and see the TV. They work well but they are a little heavy on the nose.  Good for people confined to bed.  Saves any neck strain.
4.0,The socks are cute and priced right. I've only worn one pair so can't say how durable they are.
4.0,As in the title the charm was a bit smaller than I thought it would be but the recipient loved it.
4.0,"A little on the puffier side. I was hoping it was a little more body skimming, but it definitely a great quality jacket for the price."
4.0,"Very pretty,good fit.All good for the price."
4.0,"Really cute. Description in ad is VERY WRONG.<br />It says, &#34;lobster clasp&#34;. I looked at the picture, I don't make jewelry so what do I know? I know that jewelry on a clasp is on wire that opens up to one long piece. Although cute, this is on elastic string with the knot and ends hanging out. I love it and still would have gotten it for maybe $5, but not what I paid. I called Amazon, who always comes to the rescue. Thanks, Lola!"
4.0,"I am 5ft 5"" weighs 145. Got the medium. It's very fitted. Fabric is cool and nice. If you don't like your clothes fitted, order one size up"
4.0,I love it looks great by itself.<br />I thought it would be thinner for layering.  It smells brassy but I didn't have a skin allergy like I normally do to costume jewelry.  Came with a nice case to prevent tarnishing.  I hope it stays shiny in my rotation.
4.0,Easy to see out of. Not too dark.  Very lightweight.  Use them for driving.
4.0,The flip flops are perfect except they are not true to size. I wish I would have sized down.  I normally wear a 10 in most name brand shoes but not these. The strap doesn’t fit snug and my toes do not reach the correct position. The heel cup is amazing for my plantar fasciitis so I’ve decided to just wear them around my house.
4.0,This keeps time by movement from your body
4.0,My daughter loves the jacket.  It's a thin type of jacket so if you are looking for a heavier jacket this one will not do.  Very light and comfortable.
4.0,A little small(if you are larger breasted like some of us) but otherwise works well under my cute suspender dress.
4.0,"These leggings are very thin material.  They would be best suited for warmer days.  The graphic on these is huge on the size 5.  It's not clear in the stock photo, but the graphic is on both legs at different heights.  The waist band on these was very big, but the length is perfect.  These are not an ideal choice for a child of a slender build."
4.0,"I don't own an iron nor do I want to. I washed this dress and wrinkles didn't come out. Ugh. Besides that, fits well, nice soft & airy feel. Color is off but I'll wear it as soon as I find a way to dewrinkle!!"
4.0,"Not exactly what I was expecting. I got these as replacement lenses for my Batwolfs since Oakley wants an arm, 2 legs, and rights to my first born son for new lenses (throw in another arm and you'll get new glasses) since my old lenses are kinda scratched. These lenses are noticeably thinner than the original lenses, and getting them into the frames was a pretty tight fit (at least I know they won't fall out). Also, I can tell you as an absolute, these are polarized for sure (the joys of having friends who do research in a physics lab). I really only have two problems. First, they don't seem to be as dark as the original lenses. The second is the color of the lenses doesn't really match the picture. I mean, if you catch the lenses in just the right light you can see the purple reflection, but nowhere near as brilliant as the picture shows. Taking 1/2 star for each of these issues. Otherwise, good solid lenses that are far cheaper than OEM replacement lenses."
4.0,It fits well everywhere except for the upper arms :( Very tight in the arms but the bust and waist measurements are true to the sizing chart.
4.0,"It does stay in place, I found it pinches me.<br />Great color and exactly as expected.<br />Just not my kind of band."
4.0,"Price is decent, looks good, could be a little longer and wider."
4.0,It's smaller than size.
4.0,"Haven’t worn it yet, however the opening may be a bit narrow for my thick hair.  It works great for my daughter though."
4.0,"These earrings are very tiny, but very pretty. Good buy for a small person or someone who wears multiple earrings at same time."
4.0,"I like this dress. Even though I had to get a 3x and I usually wear 1x..the stripes are pretty and the fit is flattering. I like the material, too."
4.0,Over all its a cute dress the material is great its not super thin. It fits well and looks good. I found it a little plain i bought a belt to go around the waste made it look perfect.
4.0,"Nice heavy material which allows the dress to drape nicely. I was slightly worried with it being rayon yet, the spandex counters it nicely. The torso of the dress is a little longer than I’d like with my recent weight being more than usual in my stomach since my pregnancy, yet I don’t mind it so much as I just pull it up in the shoulders so the belt can lay where I’d rather have it."
4.0,Definitely good material
4.0,Very cute dress. Only complaint was the bow. It broke before she even had the chance to wear it.
4.0,I just received mine yesterday and i love it. It looks to be a nice quality considering what I paid for it. I have yet to try it on but it does look a little big. I am 5'3 and weigh 115 pounds. When I get a chance to try it on I will do a product update. So far I am very happy with my purchase!
4.0,"Love this dress - fits perfectly; I'm 5'7 and it is the perfect length. The style is really cute; very flexible for use, you can dress it up or wear it casually with flats! Buy one - you won't be able to resist getting more colors!"
4.0,A little big but it’s pretty
4.0,Helped a lot to shine the item
4.0,"I bought these to protect my arms and keep me cool in the African sun. They definitely do their job, but they are a bit small, and I'm a small woman. I had to pull them up frequently, but they covered me well enough for the most part. I'd probably try a different brand next time."
4.0,"Socks are a bit tight, but I'm hoping they will stretch over time.  Received 6 different color combinations, so that's a plus.  Nice, warm, heavy socks."
4.0,It's a cute sweater. I like the style and the weight is good. But I normally wear a medium. Based on reviews I ordered a large. Still too small! I need an extra-large. Am returning.
4.0,"Nice watch, love it"
4.0,a little small in the arm
4.0,"very nice jacket all my friends and family have complimented it i'm 5,9 140 pounds and medium fits perfect"
4.0,came on time and as expected. Nice wallet - see how it holds up before making a final call
4.0,Very comfortable.  Like it.
4.0,"It delivers what is promises. The wide width easily accommodates all my lose ends, including keys, iPhone, passport, etc. The material is thin as a single layer. When double up, it gives a thicker appearance."
4.0,I didn't like the yellow on the black.
4.0,Material is soft and camo print is nice .<br />It was too large for being small .
4.0,This is very pretty but ultimately returned as I did not feel the top had enough coverage for my comfort as I wanted to wear this with jeans for a concert. It is beautiful and well made.
4.0,"I really like the dress. The colors (I got the navy blue and turquoise ) are vibrant. The fabric is medium weight. It isn’t super thick and it’s not super thin. You can easily wear it for winter or summer.<br />The only thing, was that I was not expecting it to be so long. I am 5’4 175 38dd. And it goes past my knees. It’s a perfect work dress, for business casual."
4.0,"The design of this bag is minimalistic and modern. I like that kind of bags, I don't like bags that scream the brand, a la MK. The size is very good, not too big, not too small. The smell was very strong for me but that may be gone quickly. ZENTEII's customer service is excellent. They ship quickly and make sure the customer is happy with their purchase."
4.0,"Good fit, looked good, and kept him warm.  A jacket he will wear frequently."
4.0,Looks good.  Fits nice. I haven't worn it yet to know if it will be warm for the winter. Will order some to give as gifts.
4.0,I really liked the robe.  Inside was soft
4.0,This is a little snug around the bust for me. I’m a 36DDD so this is expected. I will wear this with the buttons open so I’m ok with it. The knit looks high quality and it made the wash without losing the color or shedding fuzz. When it got delivered there was an awful mildew smell and the sweater was damp. It was fine after the wash so I would check to be sure. For the price this is a decent deal. It’ll be my new black staple for winter.
4.0,These are super cute and work well.  They were thicker than a normal stud earring and a little difficult for my daughter to get through her ears without stretching.
4.0,"Love the nightgown, thinking of ordering another."
4.0,Should of sized down but they are so cute!
4.0,"Absolutely love the fabric, very soft and casually comfortable. Ordered the green and the color is great. Love the length too - I' m 5'9 and it falls graciously below my hips. The other reviewers are correct regarding fit. I ordered a 2XL, my normal size, but I think I could have gotten away with the 1X this time. It's a roomy enough fit through the body, but it was constantly falling off my shoulders. I do sew and I think it will be a simple fix for me to pintuck it at the shoulders. All in all, very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"They're great and functional now... However I was a little nervous at first because the hinge was bent. Seemed like it was going to break when I bent it back, but so far so good. And they look great."
4.0,"Perfect for either pants or shirt, no bulkiness, for a fair price."
4.0,"Ordered a small, which I normally am and it fits pretty well. I have a pretty short torso so I was a little afraid of it not sitting right on me but it looks great. It's super sexy and and flirty. My husband loves it 😜 The only downside is the padding is a little weird and you can kinda see the outline of the pads but I'm just switch them out with another suit I have."
4.0,Sexy and loving the color! I'm 5'9&#34; around 180lbs I purchased the medium and it was perfect. The material is a bit thin and unforgiving so it shows everything. Would recommend wearing a slip or spanx underneath.
4.0,"Keep accurate time, better than some of the fashion watch out on the market."
4.0,They work well enough.
4.0,"Super cute. held up fairly well. Have had it for several months now, and its just starting to break. By no means a sturdy wallet, but functions great to hold an ID, and some cash or cards."
4.0,Good for the price. I dressed up for my friend’s daughter’s birthday and the kids loved it. The tail could be better though. It would’ve been perfect if it was stiff. I went to the dollar store and bought foam sticks to stuff the tail with it so that it stayed up even when it got wet. Looked good after that.
4.0,Fine glasses
4.0,"Major pro, this dress is long enough to be office appropriate for a taller person!<br />I'm about 6'1&#34; and 170lbs.<br />Purchased size large after reading reviews and looking at size chart. Large is one size up from what I typically wear, women's medium. For reference, every target dress I own is women's  medium, junior's xl.<br /><br />It fits nicely through the shoulders and chest. No pulling across shoulder blades and the shoulder seams lay correctly. My upper arms are porportionally larger so I knew the sleeves would be fitted.<br />But...I was swimming in the rest of the dress, I'll let the photos do the explaining there. I ended up loosely pinning it, which looked decent from the front but still unflattering loose from the side.<br />I'm keeping the dress because the length works for my height but I will be sewing in multiple gathers down the back of the dress."
4.0,"El material muy impermeable pero los broches deberian ser de acero inoxidable, es nuevo y ya se ve algo oxidado por el agua"
4.0,"Frame is good though, they dont do the prescription glass"
4.0,Works well. I like this very much. However I do not like how it makes my boobs look. lol.
4.0,Really nice quality but runs large.  I ordered a small (I’m 5’1” and 115lbs) and it’s very loose and long. But I’ll tie it and make it work. Super cute
4.0,Good suit if you get it for theRight price
4.0,It looks great but the bottom is not tight enough.
4.0,"Pretty nice hat, although for $30 the quality isn't really all that great."
4.0,"Too small for my 10 year old, just fits my 8.5 year old"
4.0,Inseam was a little short and I’m only 5’2”. Otherwise fit was good.
4.0,"Looked nice, it was a great stocking stuffer for an office party."
4.0,"Decent quality plugs. I'm not too sure how accurate the sizing is however. I feel as though they may be a bit smaller than they should be. They're smaller than other 00G plugs and tunnels I've bought elsewhere, and I've already lost a few of them because they like to fall out and as they're not that heavy, I usually don't notice until it's too late and I've no idea where or when they fell out."
4.0,It’s great for the price. Just wrap and go. The only thing that might bother people is that it’s kind of visible if you plan on wearing it all day. It’s invisible if you wear a loose shirt though. Just don’t wear a tight shirt over it lol
4.0,"For the price, they were perfect for what I needed. I had to wear them 2 nights in a row for Mardi Gras balls. One of the gloves ripped at the seam the first night. I fixed t and they were good as new for the next night. The fit was perfect other than the fingertips were a little long."
4.0,"Bought it for my husband for a masquerade party, we were both happy with it."
4.0,These pants are not stretchy if that's what you're looking for. There is a drawstring at the waist that's hidden inside. I have very narrow hips and they sit just at slightly above. They're great color. I have a very narrow hips. They might not fit as well if you're really curvy.
4.0,Quality seems good. Cool style.
4.0,"A bit pricey for the quality, but does the job."
4.0,Great leg warmers for pole class. Material is not very soft. Washes well.
4.0,"This comes in a nice, neatly folded, small package. I used it while i was power-spraying some pretty dirty stuff and it kept me clean and dry. It fits loosely, which allows you a nice range of motion.<br /><br />After use however, my attempts to fold it neatly back up ended in much frustration so I wound up cramming it in the attached bag. Now it looks more like a fat, tiny pillow. It's not that big of a deal, but it takes up more room."
4.0,The colors and detail are vivid. And the material feels great. It is a little big but comfortable.
4.0,Great idea having the slots for the glasses. The cap felt a little too big for my head and maybe a little itchy But i like the shape that goes over the ears
4.0,"Butterfly's could be a little more pronounced, but otherwise great gifts."
4.0,"doesn't hold up to water so much but this hat is awesome, been crushing it all summer"
4.0,Very difficult to get off the shoe after worn for an evening.
4.0,It's slippery for my kiddo on barefloors. Other than that it's true to description.
4.0,"I have only tried this on at this point, but it fit nicely.  The elastic doesn't come all the way down the sleeve, which is a little odd, but it's not bad.  It ties directly under the bust, and yet despite my tummy it doesn't make me look pregnant, which is always a plus.  As another review said, the top and bottom are different materials with the top being more like a jersey knit which is super soft and comfortable, with a fair bit of stretch to it, while the bottom is closer to a taffeta or something like that that has no give at all, but still feels nice and hangs well.  It is all black/white gradient, there is no purple like it looks in some of the pictures, so be aware of that when you buy it.<br /><br />Do make sure you go by the size chart though as it is not standard US sizes, I had to size up a good bit from my usual clothes.<br /><br />I think it's really cute.  If it holds up well to being worn, I think I will get the other color as well.<br /><br />Also, this is Rob's wife, not Rob, just to be fair :)"
4.0,"great quality !, nice charms , very stylish ,nice colors"
4.0,"As with other purses I've bought off amazon, the stitching on lining inside the purse has fallen apart after only about a year of ownership. Other than that, it still looks great. It's very spacious and comes with an attachable shoulder strap."
4.0,Fit great and was comfortable. Wore it for Halloween on top of a bodysuit.
4.0,"I have just about all the material in English on the London.  What I have found is that each book has lapses and oversights.  And each has strong points.  The author has written a pretty good book but I have found at least one point I disagree with him on.  He says that in the line 1.d4 d5, 2. Bf4 Bf5, 3. e3 e6, 4. c4 when Bxb1 followed by Bb4+ forces the king to move losing the right to castle is just dandy for white.  I disagree.  Instead of 3. e3 white should play 3. c4 immediately allowing the Bishop to return if needed preserving the right to castle.<br />Still, one of the best books on the London and well worth buying.<br />I want to add some further thoughts about this book.  This book takes the point of view that the London is best played against the move order 1. d4 d5.  And that the London is a poor choice versus the Kings Indian Defense.  I happen to agree, so this book is a nice fit for my repertoire.  It also means the author is able to focus on a much narrower cluster of variations, which he then proceeds to break down and analyse in detail, beyond anything I have in any other book.  If you play the London, I consider this book a must have."
4.0,Can't beat the price. Worked out in them and they allow my body to breathe. I'm 6' and 210lbs. Should have probably purchased an XL. They shrink a tad after the first wash and dry. All of my other gym shirts are large as though so I figured large was the way to go. It's a little snug now but still fits fine.
4.0,The earrings are much bigger than I realized they would be. Not my style but they would be fun for others!
4.0,"It is a very nice top, but it runs a little small. The quality is good, but I would suggest to buy it 2 sizes bigger."
4.0,They're good sunglasses for the money for sure. I'd give them 5 stars but mine came with a scratch on the lens so -1 star for that.
4.0,"I really love the look of this shoe for my son, they are clearly sturdy, color is exactly as expected and Velcro is a definitely an added plus. But my son cannot wear them because one of them hurt the back of his heels. 😫😫"
4.0,Very nice.. was just a pit small for me
4.0,Color and fit was as expected.
4.0,"I'm 5'2, 125, size 4/6 in jeans so I ordered a 4/6 in these pants. Everything fit great except the elastic around the waist was too tight, so it was unflattering. I returned them bc I didn't have time to fix myself but I suppose if the elastic was replaced with a ribbon or string they would fit better. Otherwise, they look just as pictured!"
4.0,I would order a size bigger.
4.0,Decent boot for the price. Wish it was a little more durable in the front toe. Daughter tripped and scuffed the toe and ripped top layer off.
4.0,"Pros:<br />This is a nice jacket for the price.  The leather part is nice and thick and soft.  Fabric is soft too. It’s warm and seems fairly well made (aside from the seams, see cons).  Don’t be fooled, this isn’t truly 2 jackets in one.  The inner “hoodie” zips out, but it’s just faux panels to make it look like 2 jackets.  The wrist extending fabric doesn’t come out at all, so really it’s just the hood that is removable.  The torso is big enough for my “busty” figure (DD).<br /><br />Cons:<br />I agree with the other reviews, it runs a little small.  I normally wear a large in shirts, I ordered an XL at the advice of previous revirws.  It’s a comfortable, fitted jacket on me.  If you like a looser, more baggy fit, go 2 sizes up.  I really wish the sleeves were longer.  I’m 5’9” and usually buy “long” length for my jeans, so I’m no stranger to slightly short items.  The faux leather part of the sleeves needs to be at least 2 inches longer.  If it weren’t for the fabric sleeve extensions I would not be able to wear this jacket.  The stitching, especially around the wrists of the jacket, is kinda puckered and poorly done.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a nice jacket and I’d purchase it again."
4.0,The Elite mens cycling short were the right size fit and color I needed for my team.
4.0,I like how these gloves are lightweight and easy to grip things with. The touchscreen feature was an essential. The fit is excellent.
4.0,"I got the green and it's exactly like pictured. The material isn't soft or stretchy at all, it's rather scratchy, but it's a beautiful top for a business office."
4.0,"a little larger than my last wallet, but works good for me.  good quality and would recommend this case."
4.0,I bought this dress for my daughter. It looked beautiful on her and fit well. The white is a bit see-through so we just used a camisole and undershorts and you couldn't tell at all. Very pretty the way it drapes!
4.0,"I was a little wary about purchasing these- but they're a great bike short (For a beginner such as myself, anyways). I got a small expecting it to be too tight (I generally size up in workout clothes, but didn't this time). Aside from the natural awkwardness that comes with wearing bike shorts, they aren't too tight or short, don't ride up my leg when I'm using them, and definitely is better than just winging it in regular workout shorts."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised. Made in China, but a good quality and the price. Strap was much better than expected, keeps good time ad the dial is easy to read."
4.0,Very cute bag! Strap was alittle short but still works great!
4.0,It's not the same color pink as is shown. But looks to be good quality.
4.0,Semi scratched
4.0,"really nice bikini for the price, looks really good on... the bottom is very flattering"
4.0,I liked this because it was a little more modest than other toga costumes. It looks pretty on and I got lots of compliments.
4.0,Just wish it was more luster than sparkles
4.0,I really like this dress. The material is very flattering and not clingy. I just wish it didn't have a seam down the middle of the front! Why would someone design a garment this way?? Otherwise it's great and I wear it a lot.
4.0,It for tall ladies
4.0,"Hard to get on by yourself, but very nice. Get lots of compliments."
4.0,Gives a little extra shine and it's easier to clean the wheels after application.  Lasts about a month. Applying it is not fun.
4.0,"great addition for summer, a little smaller than expected-but still great."
4.0,Good accent piece for travel.  Will go with everything.  Priced right so I'll get another if I lose it.
4.0,"I really liked thos dress but my boyfriend did not. The dress does come up high on the neck, but I liked the look. My arms are bigger than normal, so I ordered a large to accommodate and it was slightly tight near the armpit. I'm 5'3 and 170. I did like the length and quality of dress!"
4.0,I double mask it at work and these are big enough and loose enough to sit comfortably over a blue face mask all day long. Plus it hangs around my neck so I can always find it.
4.0,Well made product. It's just like the picture or better. Great finish and quality. My watch loves it and Im looking forward to use it all the time.
4.0,Very tight fit. Excessive I think but otherwise well made.
4.0,"I really like this dress, but where it stretches it becomes a little weird.  The material appears to be some sort of weird elastic blend at the top.  This shows depending on which bra I wear.  I like it, but it's not my favorite casual dress."
4.0,"It’s a great concept, but unfortunately they were to big for my glasses."
4.0,"Love the mask.  Unfortunately, the image appears to be stamped on the mask and not as well done as could be.  Wish they had mad the collar white.  But fun!"
4.0,Came clean and neatly packed in case. Had to get it resized but I love how it fits.
4.0,I bought these for my daughter's birthday. They look great. My only complaint is the backs are somewhat loose. They've fallen out twice. I plan on using the backs you can buy at the craft store as replacements.
4.0,"I like the earring, but my ears barely not the right size for it."
4.0,"I love this sweater it looks exactly like the picture just not as long , is a little tighter than I expected but still super cute and great quality !"
4.0,Well made.  Highly recommend
4.0,"Not a bad shirt. It’s pretty long which I like. It’s a nice color and has a nice feel to the fabric. The arms are a little tight, but I’m relatively fit and have big arms so I’m not surprised. It’s on the looser side as far as fit, but not so baggy that it’s not cute. I really like this shirt."
4.0,Love it! However it was a bit larger for my head.
4.0,"comfortable, It is east to put on and looks good."
4.0,I really like it! Bought it as a gift. Only problem is that it's a little snug but other than that it's nice. The sound is really good too.
4.0,These do not fit as pictured or as they claim to be skinny jeans. They are also on the average to short length. I ordered true to size and got the XL. In the picture I was a 16 to 16/18 and I’m a little over 5’10. So I roll the bottoms up and wear them as more of the boyfriend style jeans. Works for me!
4.0,"Very cute and vibrant, a little larger than I expected a small to be."
4.0,Pretty and practical but a little large.
4.0,"Very small and compact.  Helps to get a closeup view of different things.  Used for viewing quality of coins, jewelery,etc."
4.0,Elastic waist shorts. Shirt is very comfortable and can even be worn as a top during the day. Great for every day wear. Great quality and softness. Design is really cute too. Does not shrink when washed. Would highly recommend this.
4.0,Myself to wear and its huge hoping it shrinks in dryer.
4.0,Confortable to wear. Good fit.
4.0,"It looks great.  The fabric is a little thin but it's so comfortable, I don't care. Fit is good but it's a little long for me and I'm 5' 7"" tall."
4.0,Love the color and feel of sweater but my head barely fits.  Almost ripped out earrings trying to take it off but will order a size or 2 up .
4.0,This is a great looking and very stylish watch. I have bought watches for much more that don't look this good. So far after a month it is keeping good time and seems to be durable. Time will tell if it shows its true cost. But so far so good.
4.0,They run a little big but are very light weight and comfy.
4.0,"This Meanor Women's Sexy Cut Out Off Shoulder is a nice &#34;go to shirt&#34;. It's my saying for a shirt you can wear either casual or dress up. <br />~~~<br />I ordered mines in Burgundy/Red. The Size is true to fit. <br />The Fabric is Light & Comfortable.<br />It fits loose around the tummy area; a nice flowing look.<br />I have worn it with my black leggings for a casual dinner with friends. Then again with my long beige skirt for a dress up look to a reception.<br />I have received many compliments. Definitely purchasing in other colors.<br />~~~<br />Overall, I'll recommend. If you prefer a flowing look, I would order a size up.<br />~~~<br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED review."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:26cb3621f44258eac7d4999c62faa9d8]] Get it lol
4.0,Shirt was a gift for my brother who just got out of hospital.  He loved it and did the trick of cheering him up.  John Prine has a way of doing that!!  So happy I found this shirt.
4.0,"The only issue I have with this jacket is that the hood comes unbuttoned very easily, but it is an easy fix with some thread and a needle."
4.0,Great dress but the pockets stick out a bit.
4.0,This is constructed well and is quite full. It was just a bit longer than expected.
4.0,"I love this coat! It's very warm and comfortable. It is does not stretch at all.  I wanted a longer coat to help keep my legs warms, but I forgot about the having to climb into the car and my legs are pinned together thing.  That's the only hinderance."
4.0,Love this watch. It’s beautiful but it keeps slowing down by about 15 minuets. I have to keep resetting it.
4.0,Very cute! Lots of compliments.
4.0,"I guess that i was expecting a tighter weave but, it is fine. I will be ordering more in different colors"
4.0,Beautiful Necklace looks very much like the picture. When mine arrived it was a bit tangled but no damage untangling it. Mounting on cardboard backer would help with this. Arrived a day early very happy purchase!
4.0,Good quality material that gives a great fit and at an affordable price. Can't  wait to wear my Monokini to the pool.
4.0,This ZKHOECR tunic is made of 94 % Polyester and 6 % Spandex. It can be washed in cold water and hung to dry. The stitching is fairly good with some loose threads and places where hems lines zig-zag  instead of staying in a straight  line around the entire hemline. The dark navy hid these imperfections. The arms are nice and long and the length is about 28 inches so it covers your bottom - good for wearing with tights or slacks. There is a tiny bit of tightness in the bust area - but all and all a  comfortable top.
4.0,"These are your standard, high waisted, opaque tights, which on the one hand nip in your belly just a little bit, but on the other hand, tend to roll down to the smallest part of your waist and feel kind of annoying. There is a small color difference where it transitions from your upper thigh to where you might find the leg opening of “granny style” briefs, which means you’re not going to see that transition for most garments, but at the same time, you can’t wear them with short shorts or a leotard, for example. They look and feel as you would expect for this type of pantyhose. The mostly opaque fabric has a matte quality, as opposed to some shinier ones, which means that some garments might cling to it a little bit."
4.0,Love this dress but it is see through!
4.0,"I love the way this sweater feels - warm and fuzzy. The shape is a bit of an odd version of a dolman sweater (which you can easily see in the description pics.) The thing I didn't like is there is a seam in the sleeve that falls about halfway between your elbow and your shoulder.  On me that's the thickest part of my arm, so I didn't love the way that felt. But overall, for the cost, this is a decent buy and I will wear it this winter."
4.0,Very pretty print and style. Fabric is a little thinner than expected but overall a cute dress.
4.0,Alterations needed
4.0,Good Shoe Horn
4.0,The only thing I disliked was when you wash and dry them they shrink a little
4.0,Pretty decent socks for the price
4.0,Great purse for traveling and for everyday use. There’s plenty of pockets or sections to carry lots of things.<br />I gave it a four because I wish that the card section would be switched to the back for more security because when you open or unzip it to open to pay something it may spill out as your paying(if your like me; stuffing change into my purse) but other than that love the purse.
4.0,My daughter got this and loved it but it takes special batteries that aren't included. It would have been nice to know so I could have ordered the batteries at the same time
4.0,"Love them! Look more expensive than they actually were! Great coverage, not too big on my face, just as described, oversized. One complaint, they seem to be a little wide, not very snug around the ears/head. Hopefully they will not stretch out anymore than they are, &amp; they should work just fine!<br />If you are looking for an oversized pair of glasses with a bit of flair to make them stand out from just your average oversized glasses, these are for you. They look very sophisticated, with a bit of flair which makes them youthful &amp; fun! I ordered black. They're gorgeous! I'd order again! Came in expected time frame. I highly recommend these!"
4.0,They are so cute. For some reason the right heel started to squeak every time I step which is super annoying but I'll say my last pair held up very well until I wore the heel out of them... I wear them a lot!!! I would buy again.. unfortunately this pair wasn't the best
4.0,"These are good for mild cold in the mid-20s. But my little ones fingers get cold when it’s below 20. Some of the sticking has come undone since I purchased 2 months ago and they are definitely not waterproof but are water resistant. They stay on pretty well but my 15 month old can pull them off. We are very active family outside in the winter taking care of the animals on the farm. My biggest complaint is that the larger metal “stonz” tag on the sinch cords sometimes snaps back at me and it really hurts. Overall, they are decent."
4.0,they are just ok do not lay flat so does not give a clean look
4.0,"I bought a bunch of dresses to try for a wedding.  I did not choose this one as it seemed a bit too professional looking, but I kept it anyway because it fit and looks great.  I'm 5'8"". 155lbs."
4.0,Short in front when you sit.
4.0,Like the transition to sun glasses and that it's a bifocal reader.  Only reason I rated a 4 vs. 5 is that I'd like the sunglasses to get darker.
4.0,Holding up great so far! No image distortion that I've noticed. Really light weight!
4.0,"Cute top but I didn't notice the band at the bottom, was sent back"
4.0,"Haydory Men Demon Slayer Kamado Tanjirou Cape Cloak Cosplay Women Costume Halloween Party Outfit for Unisex<br /><br />In my picture I'm wearing a Men's Medium - it's definitely large (I'm a womens XS), but it's actually not too bad because he wears it kinda as an overcoat anyway, it's not really a yukata or kimono. The fabric is thick, it feel surprisingly sturdy. There is a belt, but there are no pockets, that would've been nice. The earrings are surprisingly nice, more like an acrylic than a cheap plastic - they are screwbacks, so I'm not sure the staying power and the earring part seems cheaper than the earring design itself. Overall, for the price it's pretty nice, much better than say, a Party City costume."
4.0,"I bought the black lace on black. I got a lot of compliments on this dress. It's so nice and classy. I give it 4 stars because when you first open it, it has this smell that kinda hits you as well as some stray threads I had to pull and cut but apart from that, really nice and comfortable!"
4.0,"Glasses are small and you have to wear them low on your nose.  They pinch a bit. Noble's other line that includes 2 eyeglasses with cases for $20 is the better choice. But, these work in a pinch. Especially for the price."
4.0,"They look nice with the others in various tones of brown, chestnut, pearl & taupe crystal offset with the silver beads.  I'll enjoy wearing that bracelet out."
4.0,"The quality is only so-so and the fit is a bit on the small size, however my daughter LOVES this nightgown which is why I gave it four stars, otherwise it would be three stars."
4.0,I ordered this for my boyfriend to match our son’s shirt for family photos. This is a slim fit shirt so we expected it to be cut closer to the body. According to him it was a little on the tighter end for his liking but overall he wasn’t unhappy with it. I feel that ordering a size up may have been too big for him because it is pretty true to size.
4.0,Hold on your arms. Ask for a period of adaptation before being comfortable
4.0,Thicker than I thought they'd be but I love the convenience of velcro and that I don't get a hair crease in the back when I take it off!
4.0,Ok hat. Wish it was lighter fabric for the summer because that is what I was searching for.
4.0,"I really like this dress & how it lays. The material is great. I just wish the underlaying slip that's attched to it was longer. It barely reaches under my bottom. I'll have to be very careful of my movements in it, as to not show too much. :) It was delivered sooner than expected as well. I'm a M-L depending on the brand & I purchased a M."
4.0,Not really an underwire kind gal but this bra is really comfortable. Even after wearing it all day. No scratchy feeling at all and stayed where I put it all day. 4 Stars because although I don't mind the logo straps I would prefer black straps with white writing. Very happy and would recommend.
4.0,GREAT COLOR...A LITTLE TOOO STIFF
4.0,"Sort of a poor-ish quality garment, had some pulls and loose threads - but for the price it's a decent undergarment. I'm guessing it won't last more than 10 washes unless done by hand."
4.0,I like it but very flimsy to hold the mi fit. Was afraid I would lose it. But I have the 3 ..
4.0,These were purchased for my husband and he loves them.  Our only complaint is the frames are top light.  They seem cheap for something that cost $350.
4.0,Husband wore it everyday and said it was comfortable. It did get dirty easily and stains
4.0,I'm a size 8 in woman and this kids 6 fits perfect!
4.0,Review from wife: Some of the best workout pants I've had including very pricey ones. These dont roll down in the tummy area and are squat proof. The dislikes are a little loose around ankles. I just roll a couple times and they fit and look nice.
4.0,Overall it's a nice sweater I recommend
4.0,"Love the pattern, looks exactly like the picture vibrant colors and all. Fits as expected (I used my measurements). The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that it's dry clean only, but I'll deal because this is a great dress especially for the price."
4.0,The bra fit as I expected to. I wear a 34 DDD and I got a large. It fit well probably medium intensity
4.0,Socks are just like any other Nike sock but are a little thinner and tore while I was playing basketball
4.0,I like it! Got lots of compliments!
4.0,"Looks and feels fine, good price too."
4.0,"Love the way these look. They’re nice and small which I like. Only reason they get 4 stars is because the backings aren’t reliable, I’ve had them come out a couple times. Recommend getting better backings but overall love the design!"
4.0,Easy to change and comfortable. Only complaint is the plastic part closest to face is a little sharp. All and all great band for the price.
4.0,"Latch is not as good as the other belt's of this design, but it is a exact copy?<br />Love the belt"
4.0,"After cataract surgery, and experimenting with various OTC readers for reading in bed, I was looking forward to receiving these.  I had the magnification right and had searched for lightweight TR90 frames that wouldn't hurt.my ears when I slept with them on.  They arrived looking as I expected and comfortably fit my face, but the bumpy ear covers grabbed and tore the hair out of my head going on and off.<br />It took a month of these sitting in the drawer until I thought to pull off the ear covers.  Yup, they can be removed, which finally made them wearable by me. Yea!"
4.0,"I was a bit disappointed after receiving this band in the mail. I was expecting a working product, however I had received a band that didn't clasp all the way. I am unsure if this just was my misfortune or if this is a common issue. The product itself had a nice design and was great quality if I was actually able to clasp the watch band. Although I was disappointed with the product, the seller gave me no hassle in returning the product. I will still give this product a 4 star rating because of the excellent customer service and I will just assume this was my misfortune.<br /><br />***I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Please give a helpful &#34;like&#34; if you have found this review helpful in anyways. Thank you."
4.0,Its width is perfect but shoe fits loosely
4.0,"Cute, looks just like the pictures. Material is a little thin, but not too clingy or see-through. I debated between getting a XS or S and I’m glad I got the XS because I think the sleeves would’ve been too long otherwise. It is a little short but I’ll wear it with tights so no biggie. If you’re between sizes and short I suggest sizing down."
4.0,"Pretty nice dress, thin material, though."
4.0,It says US XXS~S... it is as tight as Asian XS~S. Comfy material but causes statics a lot
4.0,Very nice little purse/cell phone case
4.0,My 7yr old daughter who is lean for her age found 6-8 too tight and uncomfortable.
4.0,"Not verified purchase because I bought these at Paragon Sports in NYC.  The leather is very soft and construction seems very sturdy and it is a fairly low profile glove for a ski glove.  The glove is lined with lamb's wool and feels great and the looks are killer.  I am deducting 1 star because while it felt great and warm when I started my day skiing, my hands would get a bit on the cold side after several hours (usually around 2-3pm in 20's temps my finger tips felt a tad icy).  Several Dakine gloves with synthetic materials seems to do a better job than these gloves but those gloves are often bulkier and lacks a little bit of dexterity vs. the Hestra gloves so it is a compromise.  I still love these gloves and would recommend it."
4.0,I'm pretty happy with this purchase.
4.0,"My wife loves it, a very bright blue."
4.0,Gloves fit nice and snug.
4.0,This was great for travel as I had both my glasses and contacts in one place at all times.
4.0,"These are a nice option for layering. The shirts are soft and have a fair amount of stretch to them. My son has worn them under a fleece vest and also under a t-shirt. The sleeves were just a tad bit long, but it wasn't a major issue. He may grow into the shirt a bit more over the next few months."
4.0,"The material on this is a soft brushed feel, very nice .It fits true to size, a little tighter on the hips if you're curvy like me. It's a great fall pattern and perfect to wear to work."
4.0,"The sizes are right on, my only complaint is the straps are weird. They’re right in front of and behind my armpit, so the straps fall down a lot. Other than that they’re great!"
4.0,"I like the flowy fabric, the reason for the 4 stars... The design is a bit intricate makes it cumbersome to get on, otherwise pretty cute and moves well."
4.0,I love sloths so I just had to have this shirt... Plus the slogan is pretty funny! I purchased a large for a looser fit and it looks and feels good on me. It's super comfortable and I've washed it a couple of times and the logo still looks fine.
4.0,"I wear a size 4 jean from Express and a size 6 almost everywhere else. I'm a 32DD and I ordered the small. I have curves and while things usually fit well up top, they sometimes don't around my booty. As a result, I usually have to size up when buying tops. This sweater was more or less perfectly oversized. No issues around my bottom! It was roomy all over but the heavy material hung in a way that it didn't 100% look like a tent. It was insanely soft! My husband wouldn't stop petting me. haha. No problems with the material pulling but it did shed a bit. I think the only thing ""wrong"" is the color wasn't exactly gray. It was more of a silvery blue/lavender. I realize those are three different colors but that's the only way I can describe it. haha. But all in all I really like the sweater and it's beyond comfy. Definitely plan to order in another color!"
4.0,this will fit a 40 waist person but very snug. i like it alot its very cute!!!! but the belt does not fit me ;C
4.0,"My first ceramic piece, I wasn't sure what to expect but I was very pleased to have both an attractive and well balanced piece."
4.0,"This was a gift for my granddaughter, who loved it."
4.0,"really like the way the cardigan hangs on the body. it’s lightweight, yet just heavy enough to not fly off at a turn. wish the side slits were a little higher. one pocket is much higher (minus one star because of the pocket)."
4.0,They are cheap so I’m not worried if I break them. But they fit great.
4.0,Gosopin lace tank top. Cute white and black lace tank top. The top is not form fitting throughout the middle section and the top fits well without being tight. I am 5'4 111lbs and a 34D and I recieved a size small and it fits good. It is cute without being overdone. The lace detail on the shoulders is pretty and it didnt scratch me or make me itchy . The top falls like the picture of the model wearing it. It is not a deep vee at least it was not on me.  Great multipurpose top you can dress it up or throw it on with shorts and sandals.  The quality seems good. Nice lace tank top.
4.0,"After returning pants from a company I bought these instead and have a nice skinny fit, pockets a little small and looks like a cheap button, but great price for dress pants"
4.0,Not comfortable on a large adult but is fine on women and children.
4.0,"I prefer crew length running socks, which can be hard to find. I was skeptical these would work because they are thin. I have a callous that tends to be bothersome during runs. Though thin, the materials has an overall good feel that offers protection from  friction and some light compression. I plan to own all the colors I like."
4.0,"Sending it back, and hoping to purchase the next size up. It's beautiful! and even though my waist isn't currently hourglass at this time...I hope to train it to get there."
4.0,Cute dress. I haven't actually worn it yet but the fit was good. I'm 5'9&#34; it came about 2&#34; above my knee. True to size. I wear a small and it fit nicely. I will have to see how it washes and wears.
4.0,"I'm not pregnant but i like my tanks long to cover my belly because well it looks like I an about 5 months along but it's just fat.This is very nice and soft and it is very strechy while being a little form fitting. Slightly sheer so I would only wear light colored bras underneath this.I wish it had a built in bra , then it would be perfect for me.I like that the straps are adjustable. All in all very comfortable. I would buy again<br />Disclosure: I received this product for at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

4.0,Cheeky—be prepared to put a lot of sunscreen on your butt lol
4.0,"I was surprised that the Medium just hung off of me, its a cute dress but I may see if it fits one of my friends better and reorder in the small. Came in a timely manner."
4.0,"Fits nicely and the fabric is super comfortable, I also love the colors and length... ohh and it has pockets!!!!! It is important to be aware it is not a compressive fabric so it wont really help shape the body or hide anything... waistband is a bit loose and runs down when I am running"
4.0,The print on the fabric pops and it absorbs sweat. I like this product and use it in my own home. I like that it ties off in the back and I can tuck my hair up. I would recommend this product for home and business use.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for an honest and fair review.
4.0,Only problem they said they were gray but they were khaki
4.0,Very soft. A little “pilly” after a few washes but nice for the price.
4.0,I originally ordered this dress in the dark purple and loved it. I then ordered the powder blue and was not as impressed. The lighter color is a little more see-through and looks cheaper. I would happily go back and order a few more in the darker colors though!
4.0,"Love the color, fabric, and style! This is exactly what I wanted when I ordered it. One small thing though, the tank is very snug up into the armpits. If the strap were longer by even a half inch, this would not be a problem at all. I like the shirt enough I will enjoy it anyway"
4.0,"Bought to (try) wear around the house when in (over) loungewear.  They are perfect for this.  Soft, stretchy, not too tight but enough stretch to stay put.  I often forget they are there."
4.0,Love these linen summer beachy pants ... They actually were a replacement to a pair nearly identical I got a stain on so happy I bought them
4.0,I got this shirt to wear for Thanksgiving but I’ve worn it already.  Soft fabric and great fit!  Love the 3/4 sleeves.  Ordered one for my sister too!  We are thankful and blessed!
4.0,The dress is very cute and fits well. If you have bigger breaths it might be a little tight at the top but other than that it’s so cute and definitely worth purchasing.
4.0,Smaller than expected but it’s okay. Soft and warm material. Boyfie also liked it! Lol
4.0,"It fit great. I needed a long sleeve workout shirt so I didn't need my jacket going to and from my car to the gym in the colder months. While ita not thick it kept the warmth on and did as needed. I liked it, I would purchase it in other colors as well."
4.0,"I absolutely adore this dress. The only problem is that it is pulling in the waist area where the bow ties after only a few wears. They come off, but I doubt this dress will last longer than a year of wearing it a few times a month. It fits well! Roomy but not too roomy in the hip area, and enough room for my large arms and shoulders. I am a swimmer so finding sleeves dresses that fit is really tough. Very flattering shape."
4.0,These packing cubes were made really well.  The mesh allows for good ventilation and also lets you have a sneak peek of what's inside.  I purchased these in two different colors because I like to organize by outfit or by day when traveling depending on the type of trip I am on.  There was a great choice of sizes as well in this one package. I recommend these
4.0,"REALLY CUTE CLOCHE.  I WILL ENJOY WEARING IT, BUT IT'S A LITTLE LARGE - MAYBE IF I HAD LONGER, CURLY HAIR.  OH WELL."
4.0,Size is as should be. Correct fit.
4.0,Decent quality and shipped on time. My son thought the pockets were weird at first but suddenly they are cool. He loves these!
4.0,Can’t deny a gorgeous sexy red dress and this one is perfect!! Love it!
4.0,Kind of long. I’m 5’4 and it hits my knees
4.0,"Nice masks with pocket for filter. Adjustable which is nice, but the part that covers the face is huge even on my 13 year-old. Do not buy for young kids!"
4.0,"Very nice dress, but it runs a little small."
4.0,Really nice looking chain but it is really shiny. I bought it for myself to use with a pendent but it just looks to feminine for me. So I gave it as a gift to my mom and she loved it.
4.0,Good quality and the product is very true to image. Comfortable fit - good purchase.
4.0,I love then they fit perfect material a little thin but for the price can't complain. Seller is great and attentive.
4.0,"I like these types of button-downs.  Only wish they came in more colors at this price.  Pay attention to the available sizes and what they mean and you should be fine.  If you're a guy with a stocky upper body, go a size larger.  The pictures are accurate.  Expect the fabric thickness of a dress shirt, not a casual one."
4.0,its a very cute outfit but i will wash with care as the material seems a bit delicate
4.0,Beautiful bracelet.  Ordered for a friend that has a larger wrist & needed the elastic stretch style.  This works but is still a bit tight.  Thinking when advertising for an Adult they need to stretch to 8&#34; or so.
4.0,Colors are lighter than picture
4.0,The cut was just a bit off causing the fabric to bunch... had to return
4.0,I wish it was a darker turquoise
4.0,It works the best of any shoe stretch solution that I've used.
4.0,"I wear a 7.5 wide shoe they barely fit, they may be too small for someone with a bigger foot."
4.0,I love these but they do shrink a little in the washer/dryer
4.0,"These oversized sunglasses are very cool. The metal star studs looks pretty. They look no big difference from those designer ones. However, for me, I have small head but they are a bit too tight on the backs of my ears. I am gonna try to see if I can adjust them a bit loose. Other than that, I would recommend them."
4.0,I bit larger than I would have liked but good quality and beautiful color
4.0,"Cute style, medium/light warmth."
4.0,"Size down, especially if you are short!"
4.0,"Longer than I figured, but it works."
4.0,"I'm 5'10"", 27"" waist, 38"" hips. Typically a size 6 -- S or M depending on the item. I purchased the Medium and it fits perfectly. The only complaint I have is that being really tall, the arms and legs don't quite reach my wrists or ankles.  Otherwise, these are soft and comfy, great for wearing in the house under PJs or out on a cool day. They're so comfy I even sleep in them. They're not super hot, so when it's below 45 degrees I recommend an extra thermal layer to stay warm outdoors."
4.0,I purchased based on the size chart but ended up needing a size smaller. Otherwise it is good quality.
4.0,"It is warm and cute. The front pockets are great. Especially when you travel, it is convenient to store your phone, passport, boarding pass as you wait in the lines. Easy access. It is long enough to cover the butt area. For this price i think it is a decent product."
4.0,"Pretty nice and comfortable it was about what I expected, I question its durability and don't think it will last for all that long however."
4.0,Super cute!!! With the manufacturer would have put the back strap/tie in a more supportive place. It's a bit too low and doesn't support the chest area well. Even with the padding.
4.0,"If you have long arms, you may need to go up a size. My arms are 1+ so it isn't too bad. Arms straight out go right to my wrist bone.<br /><br />Otherwise super soft and comfy."
4.0,"Works greatand no problem with fasteners. Waist was a little loose, though."
4.0,"I LOVE these bras!!! They are extremely comfortable and true to size. I have always just had a hodge podge of sports bras and they were all either getting out of size or just plain old. The OCD in me was excited to find a matching set in a variety of colors. Not to mention, these bras were sold for a great price and they are good quality. The only downside is that when you put the bra sometimes the inserts flip up and need to be readjusted. The cup inserts in the white bra are visible but I don't plan on working out without a shirt on so I'm not worried about it. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,"Nice design, a little small but really nice. It rivals the quality of the other manufacturers and for a cheaper price."
4.0,front inserts sometimes come out 10% out of 100 pieces but it is workable
4.0,"Purchased to hold photography gear, which looks to be fine.  No reportable issues at this time."
4.0,"It's cute, a bit small in certain areas and the material is a bit transparent. Still deciding if it's worth keeping since the material seems cheap."
4.0,Material could have been a bit thicker but I like!!
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this skirt, and it's very pretty and somewhat retro looking. Unfortunately, the fabric is very cheap, and it looks like it too. It's a bizarre, rough-weave material, not smooth at all, and unfortunately after months of owning it, threads are constantly coming out and unraveling. Also, the zipper is very cheap and has torn in a place that makes it difficult to zip up properly. That is what you can expect from such a cheap purchase."
4.0,"I got this in a large. I am usually a medium but because my breast or a little large I got a larger size. The bottom fit very well. However, my boobs don’t want to stay in the top. I have a cover-up that will help. I guess I needed an extra large top and large bottom. Great material, will order again just larger. Very cute. Not cutting into skin."
4.0,May not wash as well as one would wish
4.0,I love how everyday you can choose a different color only thing i don't like is that it can fall off your nose easily.
4.0,Runs a bit small. Good quality. Made well.
4.0,"Looks good, works good enough, runs a bit small."
4.0,Really cute lightweight coat but it runs really small.  Had to return it.
4.0,I was very nervous when I bought this swim dress but I was not disappointed when It arrived. I bought a 2x but could have gotten away with an extra large. I wont return it but I'm going to get the extra large in a different color.
4.0,Glad I read other reviews on sizing-went up 2 sizes so I could zip it. Got as a present with a matching vest for my dog so now I am ‘that lady’ but I love it
4.0,It looks nice and sturdy. What I'm disappointed with is that the package only came with 2 rfid card holder instead of 3 of them as it says in the description and on the package box. :(
4.0,"This is a lovely product -- well made, high quality. Be forewarned, though, that if you're small-chested it may not work for you. It appears to be proportioned for women who are bigger up top in comparison to their waist and hips. As one who is more 'slim throughout' it doesn't quite work for me. (I'm 5'5"", 115 lbs, with an A bra cup.) The chest on the Small fits well, but the waist and hips are TIGHT. Going to try a Medium and see if the top might still fit while enough while allowing the waist and hip area to be more generous. Too bad, I really like it! And the bright solid colors are wonderful!"
4.0,"Best bag for the money for a inexpensive bug out bag. In keeping with always being prepared, especially in the big city I took a chance on this back pack because of the reviews and I'm glad I did. This back pack would not stand up to years of use on the trail, however, it is perfect for keeping your bug out items secured just in case things turn south due to weather, terrorism, etc.. Fits well, plenty of adjustments for different body sizes and storage pockets everywhere. This is what I would call a large back pack, definitely not a day pack."
4.0,Great dress for the price. Only down side is that it is a little sheer. Need to wear something underneath.
4.0,Product works perfectly for me. Thank you!
4.0,I ordered class. They were way to big. So I exchanged for l. They were way to small. So I went back to the xl. It is fine until it stretches out.
4.0,It can be a bit sheer a slip will fix it. its pretty other than that!
4.0,"These are adorable - I just couldn't do the pearls glass holder like my mom and grandmother. This is a nice updated option, purchased in rose gold, gold and sliver and have had them for a few months. They seem to hold up well."
4.0,"I really liked this item. It arrived quickly, and was about the size I thought it would be. The only thing is I thought from the pictures that the face of the watch was light blue and gold, but it is actually just white and gold. Other than that I love this item! It's very pretty and works well."
4.0,"Me gusta la calidad de  la tela, pero no los herrajes."
4.0,This guy wrinkles a bit but when you are on the beach.... does it really matter?
4.0,soft leather
4.0,"Runs very small. I am 5'9"" about 180lbs. DD . I normally order extra large shirts for extra room for the girls. The shirts that came were 3XL (don't know how that happned) but they fit perfectly. I have never worn a 3XL in my life,  this is the one exception."
4.0,"I do like this dress for summer and I'll be able to layer with a jacket for winter. I'm 5' 8.5"" and it laid on the top of my feet. I was worried it wouldn't be long enough, but a medium was good for me. It has some room in the waist, not my preference, maybe an inch or two. I'm 27 waist, 135 lbs and 36b bra. Just didn't wow me, I got the navy floral one. Might look better with a bustier girl?? Still a good purchase. I did wear a slip,  just in case"
4.0,Have no complaints.
4.0,"Work great, however still working on finding the easiest way to put on and take off."
4.0,Bought this for my husband Good quality product fit is true to size washes very well retains shape even with drying in dryer<br />We are  please with product
4.0,I bought this for my son. He loves it
4.0,"These are very cute and fashionable. They are a little long, but I expected that because I have short legs. I wish they came in a higher compression because they are very cute! Although the ekg does leave and imprint in my legs by the end of the day."
4.0,I like and really enjoy it this item. So defiitely I have to buy a new one. It is perfect.
4.0,"I like this pair of stockings, very comfortable and warm. Although it's tough to squeeze into in the beginning. Thankfully they do stretch and didn't rip. I had my spouse wear them and stretch them out. I wear a size 9. They have a good grip on the bottom too. I recommend this for size 9 or smaller. SRY not for all sizes"
4.0,I like it well enough. I should have gotten a size up.
4.0,"Many of the reviews had me afraid and dreading ordering but I have it and I love it so far!! Its .925 silver, fits like any other bracelet and its cute. Not flimsy or anything and I like how it looks...<br />***This is my 2nd bracelet! I ordered another because I lost my first.  Still love it alot, it's my daily bracelet, if I don't have any other jewelry on I have this on. That's why when I lost it I had to reorder!!!"
4.0,"Pros!<br />Great fit, Nicely made, Looks awesome, Best choice out of not getting a custom one.<br /><br />Cons...<br />Still sort of smelled like glue for five minutes. No. Nose. Holes. Can’t breathe much lol. The eye patch is too big for my face but that’s fine I don’t need it anyway LOL."
4.0,"Super soft and comfy. I ordered petite length but still kind of long for me at 5'3&#34;, but still wearable."
4.0,"Great value! Weren't too tight for my legs, but did stretch out after a couple uses. No stretchy bands to cut off circulation. I love them!"
4.0,The dress is as shown. Good quality and fabric.
4.0,"Go 2 sizes up if ordering and save yourself the headache and hassle. Example, if you normally take a 36 waist, do a 40 or even a 42."
4.0,This is a very elegant watch. It Has a very intricate design. The clasp is very secure. The watch band is a little large so you might have to get that adjusted.
4.0,"Wouldn't really recommend them for super sweaty feet. Does not really wick sweat or keep you cool. But it is suuuuper comfortable, as looove tight form fitting socks"
4.0,"While these combo clear/bifocal/sunglasses do work, I have some difficulty keeping the sunglasses attached, especially when I try to flip them up like in the picture. This can be a problem when I'm driving, as I just have to let them go and pick them up later when I stop the car. I got them for driving purposes, but find them better suited to being just outside, like around the pool where it does not matter as much if they fall off. The magnets could be stronger? They focus well for reading and close work, so no issues at all there. I also have to admit they look better on my son than they do on me, as they are quite large on my face."
4.0,"Beautiful quality, but larger on the chest than expected.<br />Great quality!"
4.0,Like the handbag but had to return it.  Handgun compartment is tiny.
4.0,My great grand kids loved the costumes.
4.0,The dress looks like the same as the picture but a little longer than expected. It is under my knees.
4.0,"Nearly.... what I wanted.  Still looking for the tanks that are long like tunics and go pretty much over the butt.  Looks like the picture, no surprises."
4.0,"I ordered the red and though it looks like a washed out red (at least it did to me) it is actually more of a raspberry/pink color.  I still like it, just if you wanted red, that isn't the color it is."
4.0,Great tshirt!  Good quality cotton.<br /><br />Sizing needs to better since I think my son needs the next size up when we got it but can still fit with the size I got.
4.0,"As another reviewer indicated, these walkers aren't really hiking boots due to the lack of decent gripping soles. Overall though, these worked great for easy trails and paved walking.Tongue could be a little longer. Seems to be an issue with most of the closed toe lace-up Vionics I've purchased."
4.0,They were tight through the hip and thigh.
4.0,The earrings are bigger than I wished for but they are not that heavy so I am keeping them. Did not like the nose pin.. the pin part is broad and uncomfortable to wear... it may be people with small noses ..
4.0,"I was looking for an additional back up watch to my Omega Seamaster that will go in for service. And I came across this attractive looking chronograph priced at a ridiculously low $29.95. The MiniFocus-watch arrived a few days ago. First impression: this is an even better watch now that I have it in my hand and have worn it a few days. Looks great, looks like it is well made. I am used to stainless steel watch bands; so I wasn’t sure how I’d do with this silicone band. But I must say it is comfortable (note: size of band is just perfect for me, but may be too short for someone with a bigger wrist). I am happy with this purchase. And although I am not complaining about the silicone band (how could I complain at $29.95 ?), what would make this watch even better, and I’d me more than happy to pay much more for this, would be if the added a blue stainless steel band with double locking clasp. Wow; that would be great ! And to me that would be worth the 5th star. But as said, for $29.95 this is just fine ! I’ll see how this watch will do in 6 months, the one year from now. If it still looks great and still works, then it will have been a phenomenal purchase at such a low price ! And I hope that at that time I will have a positive update to my review."
4.0,"The built in illumination is garbage. Spend a bit more on the ""illuminator"" watches if that would bother you.<br /><br />It's so light i don't mind wearing it every day. I tend to get messy at work, so it's been covered in various dirt, oil, grime, etc and only had me worried once. But then I squeezed it together and it started working again. I am a convert. I barely ever wear my other watches, this is just way more comfortable and worry free."
4.0,I love the color and it's comfortable
4.0,It's cute but my boyfriend thought I was just wearing a big t-shirt so I put tights on with it then it made sense (5'8)
4.0,"This is a generously sized aventurine pendant. It arrives inside a classy black box, which enhances it's high on the gifting scale. Inside the box is a nice fabric drawstring bag that contains the pendant and two forms of neckware (metal chain and black cord with silverish short links).<br />I received a dark green hue stone, which I really like. However, I 'm sure the color is luck of the draw. The tree of life is nicely fashioned, and there is an abundance of amethyst chips adorning the wire branches. Being picky, I'd like if the base of the tree, roots was better centered at the bottom of the pendant, but that is a very minor criticism.<br />My personal use of this particular pendant will be suspension on the wall in my home office. It will serve as wall ornamentation, conversation piece and encourage good luck and prosperity (chinese jade substitute). If it turns up missing, I know to check in my significant other's jewelry box.<br />Attached are photos to show close-ups and different aspects of the pendant (and accessories). Ruler provided for size reference.<br />Overall, very satisfied and happy with this aventurine/amethyst pendant. Very high recommendation."
4.0,Very nice pin for my smaller scarfs.<br />You can’t go wrong with this seller<br />They  go the extra mile to make sure your satisfied❤️
4.0,They were very snug. And not as big of a flare as I thought. But alright.
4.0,"The design, workmanship, and quality of this key holder exceeded my expectations. It's a bit larger than I expected, I was expecting something that would be more comfortable in my front pocket."
4.0,Loved this dress but get ready for a serious wardrobe malfunction if you have boobs bigger than size A or small B cups.... I'm 5'6&#34; 148 and 34C
4.0,Purchased this Christmas hoodie for myself & the material is OK. Super cute but wish it were a bit warmer. I bought a large for a bit more roomy fit.
4.0,The skirt is a bit wrinkled from packaging but simple to steam iron out. Fits nicely and is my new favorite dress. I love it! I'm a bit color blind so the navy blue does look black but that's OK I love the dress
4.0,These leggings are super stretchy & soft but have no compression which I don't love. I'm 5'2&#34; and around 128 lbs with short legs and a 26&#34; waist and the S/M mostly fit but were a little big in the waist and loose past the calves. I ended up rolling them up & was pretty happy with it. They are squat proof but super prone to camel toe because of how stretchy the fabric is. I also accidentally caught them on the velcro strap on my gym bag and they instantly fuzzed up in that spot which I wasn't pleased with.<br />TL;DR They're cute & comfy but probably not going to last long for anyone who works out regularly
4.0,As described what we needed for a costume
4.0,Very nice! I’m 5’2 and got a large. I’m on the bigger side but they stretch really good. Wore to the gym and they stayed put the whole time love these pants!!
4.0,Very solid glasses for the price.  Really like wearing them.  Very versatile
4.0,"These mittens are extremely warm and I have worn them a lot in this cold weather. They are comfortable and easy to get your thumb in. They are well made, but the outer leather layer seems a little thin so I do not know if it will last. My only real complaint is that they feel a little clumsy because they are thick. When I turn my steering wheel, I have to be careful not to hit the controls behind the wheel. I guess that this comes with being really warm, and they may compress a little with wear. I also like that they are made in Canada."
4.0,This necklace is really nice.  I used it with a pirate costume and it went perfect.  The only thing is it itched me after the end of the night but really looked good...
4.0,Love the bathing suit and would buy it again but the top part where you tie it slips so it's bulges open at the chest area and you could fall out if your not careful. If you tie it super tight it doesn't do that but then it's uncomfortable around the neck
4.0,Ordered a size up and fit as I would normally wear.  Perfect length.  Lightweight and comfortable.  Will buy more colors.
4.0,Nice looking rind little larger then thought for a pinky ring would pay extra if back was filled and smooth
4.0,I ordered a medium and I probably could have  used a small
4.0,Very nice quality. I really like them but they are a little snug on top. They leave marks even though I do have average to more slender ankles. I stretch them out before wearing.
4.0,Great value. Big and well made.
4.0,It's very cute but may be too small if you're over a size 12-14. I'm a 10-12 and fits fine but certainly doesnt close in the front
4.0,Comfortable and a nice wrap/skirt. Dont wear if you cant afford your undergarments shown.
4.0,"Not as thick as I expected, but that makes easier breathing.  Use for church which is outside at this time so I feel safe, even tho it is not very thick.  Very comfortable.  Good value for the $$"
4.0,"Initial thoughts: It came in late, not filled well with polyfill,top horns are floppy, runs small (or I have a big head) stipe pattern is slightly off.<br /><br />I was not sure what to expect but I was presently surprised! It's definitely ment for smaller heads and is by no means perfect but with a little work it's a great base! I plan on adding more polyfill, repainting the stripes and making the top horns more sturdy.<br />I did not plan on making my headpiece from scratch any time soon and thought this would be a good temporary alternative.<br /><br />Update :<br />After some trial and error this was definitely a great base for modifications, I plan on buying another to make her season 3 - 5 Montrails. If you have seasoned cosplay experience and love to tinker/trial error this is a good buy."
4.0,"A little big,  but comfy"
4.0,good quality! they look real
4.0,"Warm, thin, light, and soft. The color doesn’t look as good as pictured but it’s comfy. I ordered 2 size up so it would be a bit baggy. Overall good value."
4.0,"Loved the boots, but can't wear them as they are to big for me."
4.0,"This is a cute too-- very soft, nice print. For me, the arms are a little narrow and the body is a little body."
4.0,Was not flattering on me
4.0,"I like them, BUT the posts should be longer to accommodate the oversized safety backs...my earlobes are squished!"
4.0,Looks good through pants on but size runs really small
4.0,This is a nice shirt. Good for gift too. Mine though came with a stain got it out though and Amazon took care of that for me too. Overall it was a good buy.
4.0,Love it...just no quick looks for time. Lol...you have to look at it good to see the accurate time.
4.0,I got the  Large and they seem to fit a little big for my arm but that just means I have to start working out more lol over all this IM OK bought them as a joke.<br />So far they are holding up after 2 washes
4.0,really good. the crown might not be for boys older than 9yrs old. my son is 9 amd it barely fits him. but rather than that really good product
4.0,Needed a clear purse for work. It is the perfect size.
4.0,"I feel like these socks are a little thin for my liking. However, they are short and don't show above my shoes and have kept their shape after the first washing."
4.0,Nice quality.  Smaller than expected.
4.0,Great for the cold winters in Northern California. Had it for awhile now and has stayed true to form. You can wash it without shrinking it or damaging it. Colors don't fade. Great product.
4.0,I bought this as a last minute NYE outfit and the fit was perfect. Im 5’7” 165lbs and i got a Large. The waist band is elastic but it doesnt look bad. I give it 4 stars because upon trying it on the black covering on the button popped off leaving the silver button showing. I didnt mind overall bc I was wearing silver as well so it blended okay.
4.0,"The collar is about an inch too wide, and is a bit stiff, but lays flat so it looks ok. The length is good, but the garment tapers and doesn't totally wrap around the legs well, leaving a gap below my knees."
4.0,This is a very  attractive cover . The watch is very smooth and shinny. Just wish that it had a picture in the background of the watch inside. Price was great.
4.0,These are a great fit and stay in place without falling down or being too tight.
4.0,Loved this! Its amazing for the price im surprised with the material and it came in perfect condition .love the color!! Keep it mind its very cheeky
4.0,They were perfect for crazy sock day!
4.0,great lightweight scarf for warmer months.  Very pretty and will brighten up the most boring outfit.
4.0,"I play a silver-plated trumpet. During practice breaks, I polish my horn with this cloth. Great way to care for your instrument and save time. No cream or liquid needed.<br /><br />This product consists of 2 pieces of cloth sown together. The cream cloth contains the polishing compound, which turns into fine black dust when rubbed against silver. The blue cloth removes the black dust from the silver surfaces. If you don't remove the black smudges from the silver surface it will end up on your fingers. The jagged edges on the blue cloth shed, which is annoying. Lots of tiny bits of cloth fall out."
4.0,The necklace came in a very nice simple plastic casing which made sure there were no damages to it. The egg at the bottom is detailed where a few feet away you can notice that it is an egg. True Game of Thrones lovers should buy this to feel like the true Khaleesi you are! I was not disappointed and the description is exactly what I got!
4.0,"Bought this for our dog to wear to our Christmas party. It's a little on the cheap side, the bow isn't exactly centered, but looked very cute and worked well for our pup :)"
4.0,Beautiful thick and classy looking . unfortunately its too sall.but ordering a size 6..the 4 went up but i couldnt button . 5'1 130 with a small waist..i just need alik more room
4.0,"For the price...a good watch...so far.  My Skagen is thinner, but this watch is close."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful, but your arms will rub against the sharp beads and sequins on the side of the dress causing for scrapes along your arm. I'd still recommend it because it's so pretty, but not for long wear use."
4.0,These fit my 4 month old and my 2 year old. Only complaint was the frill was smashed and even after washing didn’t lay that great.
4.0,"This is a cute dress, especially for the price. Warning that it is quite low cut. It’s very stretchy, material is pretty thick and the cut is very flattering."
4.0,"Although these socks are stretchy and feel better than normal socks for my neuropathy, they are not true to size. Even though they are rated for size 10-13, they are still a tad tight on my extra wide side 12 feet. Other than that, they are great socks."
4.0,"This necklace is a good deal for the price. You March it up with any type of dress. My only concern is it has some awekward lenght. It's neither choker not lenghty. Doesn't have height adjustment. Whenever I wear it, bottom of it gets inside my top. Otherwise good steal for price."
4.0,The underwear are comfortable and breathable I enjoy the comfort and I wear them everyday
4.0,So comfortable. It fits so well and no worries that it will come undone. Favorite suit!
4.0,Beautiful ring just haven't gotten it yet
4.0,nice simple accessory that looks nice! can't complain with the good price and it arrived a little earlier than expected. Would totally buy again!
4.0,This mowom Bracelet is great. I really enjoyed it I think it would be a great gift for anyone. Its a nice sturdy good quality black silver and brown leather bracelet. Its stylish and unique design really draws you in. The clasp is easy to secure takes a minute to get the bracelet and clasp to lay smoothly but that's because it's leather.
4.0,"I bought this for my husband and I have to say, I really appreciate the way it looks on him. His only complaint is how the pockets sit since being placed on the front, they aren't natural feeling when you try to use them. The material feels and looks nice and it's holding up well so far. I'm actually on the hunt for a robe for me with the same material."
4.0,"What can you say?  It's a sweat shirt. Color what I wanted, and the size is right on. Will it shrink, though? We will see."
4.0,"A little bit pricey for what it is ( a sheet of stickers), but my daughter loves them!!"
4.0,"The first few times I wore these, they left black fuzzies on my hands. So I washed them, hoping to stop that from happening, and they faded to blue instead of purple. They ran a little big for me.<br />UPDATE: The seller contacted me to ask if they could remedy my problems, ended up sending me a new pair free of charge. The new pair (size small) fits great, no black fizzles, and stayed true to color  when I washed them. Washing instructions: cold water, air dry. Yay for great customer service!"
4.0,"Great size for shopping [on foot] so you are not over burdening your shoulders!  the feel is little stiff but easy to stuff it back into the attached bag - forget it - too challenging to fold it and fit it back the way they arrived!  life is too short for such effort: stuffing it into the bag still works.  For little local trips - this is an easy grab and go.  fun for women, nit sure hub will use this - so could have had one or two for men."
4.0,Good product/nice case.  Would suggest either a bright colored hard case or bright colored microfiber bag to make it easier to find in pocket or handbag.  A microfiber bag coud be used as len cleaning cloth..
4.0,"They're comfortable but they shrink a lot when you wash them. So after laundry, they're like tight pants for a night until they loosen up again."
4.0,it's too long
4.0,"These are very nice earrings. I love the color (purple) and the length. I would have given them 5 stars except that 2 of the beads were detached, the big one at the bottom and one of the smaller ones. But I loved everything else about them."
4.0,Not as tight as another I have but worth the price for the pair. Bought a second set for my mother
4.0,"The purse did not come with a dust cover bag. Does this mean its a fake? Other than that, its a nice bag."
4.0,I liked that there was a complete set and that they can also be warn as well as reading.
4.0,"Very cute black pants for money! However, all of the buttons fell off. Reinforce the buttons before you wear them. I’m 5’8” and 140. I usually wear a small or xtra small. I got a medium and they fit great! They sit above the belly butto & a little above the ankle on me."
4.0,"Cute dress, though it is NOT the style pictured.  It does NOT have the cold-shoulder sleeves.  It’s an empire waist with scalloped hem.  Pretty bright blue fabric as shown. Does run a tad small, so order accordingly."
4.0,arrived week of 092815. count is 2 pkg. each of SODIAL(R) Dual Hole Cylinder Barrel Cord Locks Stoppers 6mm Dia 20 Pcs Black.<br />count is correct. Appears undamaged.
4.0,I really love these. I wear a women’s 7.5/8 and these fit perfect. They are super soft and don’t feel cheap. The o my reason I deducted a star is because when you put them in the color gets weird stretched out.
4.0,Finally something that fits as expected.  Just enough pressure.
4.0,"Fit well, good support. They've been washed numerous times and show no signs of wear, so i'm pleased with them."
4.0,I like this mask (I also purchased it in light blue). It doesn’t fit as tightly around the nose and mouth as some masks. The ear straps are adjustable. I wish they had darker colors and a wire in the nose area. I have not washed either mask yet...as I’ve only worn each one time.
4.0,"I have mixed thoughts on this skirt. For 1- I’m usually a small, I’m 5’5 and roughly 120 pounds, but I had to order an XL to fit me (and it’s still a smidge tight) but still wearable. The color seemed brighter to me than displayed in the pictures. I ordered a burgundy and it still is burgundy but looks more red than I would have liked, maybe that’s just personal preference. Also kinda see- through. You can’t see underwear lines or anything but you can clearly see leg imprints right through the dress. It’s jusy an OK skirt to me. Not bad, but not excellent. Great for less dressy occasion- festivals or beaches, etc."
4.0,"I got this to hold my business cards so they wouldn't get destroyed in my wallet. Love how compact it is, fits a good amount of thick business cards and keeps them safe! The outside is a suede cover, not a hard smooth cover. The design is pretty. The only downside is the black velvet sheds on my cards a little bit but easy to wipe off."
4.0,"The LASHION MEN'S SUNGLASSES are lightweight sunglasss, made out of sturdy plastic that will protect your eyes from injury during a sports mishap.  My husband thinks the lenses are very clear, and he rates them as  ""excellent"".  In addition to being polarized, the lenses protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, as well as physical injury<br /><br />We ordered these for my husband and they are a style he usually loves.  He did not like the way these sat high on his face, even though he liked everything else about them.  These are larger  than sunglasses he has worn in the past, taking up a little more real estate on the face.  He does says they are comfortable because they are so lighteight.<br /><br />This is not a style I like on anyone, but when I tried them, on they actually looked pretty good. They felt a little uncomfortable and scratchy over the nose area, like they had a sharp edge that could benefit from rubber padding.  The lenses are very clear.<br /><br />Overall, I think if you are involved in sports or outdoor activities, and you like the style, you will be happy with the protection these glasses offer and the clarity of the lenses."
4.0,"Not really sure why they are called copper compression masks. There is no compression factor involved that I'm aware of. Wash easily, but get grimy pretty easily.<br />Great value. Half price compared to most, Home Depot, etc"
4.0,this was a gift for my son.  He loves how snuggly it holds is cards and ID.  But was disappointed that a few business cards he likes to keep in his wallet did not fit.
4.0,"I love the 90 Degree reflex yoga capris...I wear them every day. They are not see-through like several other brands, stretch well while maintaining shape. And very comfortable...they don't cut into your waist, even when sitting. I am 5'3&#34;, 160 pounds and purchased the Medium. The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the 22&#34; are longer than I like--I haven't been able to find 17&#34; in this brand, and the other brands I tried are either too thin or not well made like the 90 degrees. I end up rolling the hem up to the length I like. But you cannot go wrong with this brand."
4.0,Water proof and a good buy
4.0,"studs are a bit thicker than the ones my piercer used but I was still able to get them through with a bit of force. I used them for my cartilage. Pretty nice, they’re quite big. Some of them screw on from the ball and some screw on from the earring top itself."
4.0,Flimsy feel to them.  I'm not sure if that is standard for foldable reading glasses.  It is nice to get 3 pairs for the price.  They do work as they should for the +1.25 prescription.  And I believe they'll firm up a bit with some tweaking of the screws.
4.0,"PROS<br />Usually an XS (tall, skinny, long arms) and ordered a S. Fits perfectly and looks just like the picture. Simple and pairs well with everything!<br /><br />CONS<br />The only con is that the jacket is super thin for what it's priced (which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5). It's definitely more of a fashion jacket than a warm jacket but you can layer underneath it because it's so light."
4.0,"I loved this, but I like my bodysuits to be short in length so it hides my belly rolls when I stand up. This was normal length and didn't hide much."
4.0,This is a really cute shirt. I would have preferred it be a more bright color rather than a heather blue. I am currently kind of between sizes so ordered the larger size in case it ran small and had to return it. No fault of the shirt. Actually runs pretty true to size.
4.0,Good product. Am very happy with it.
4.0,"This is a great dress for a cosplay but I wouldn’t recommend it to add to your rotation of regularly worn dresses. It feels cheaply made, like the seams will rip at any given minute. When I moved too quick I could hear threads popping, I am a little busty so maybe that played a role, but it wasn’t snug or by any means too tight, it shouldn’t have been popping. Because of that I’m terrified to wash it so I’ve worn it once for Dapper day (I went as Woody). And I may wear it once or twice more but I doubt it’ll last much more than that. For the price I really didn’t expect much more though so I’ll give it 4 stars anyways. But buyer beware if you have high expectations!"
4.0,"Very comfortable,beautiful dress! I’m 5’5 and got a Med. I had to have mine hemmed because it was too long."
4.0,"This is such a cute and comfortable skirt!  I only wish that it was lined - it's pretty see-through in the sunshine.  Of course, then the price would have to go up, would it?!"
4.0,"Looking for a simple earring holder, this was perfect for me. It holds plenty of earrings. The only thing I was disappointed with was the bottom. I ended up putting foam on the metal bottom so that it would not scratch my dresser."
4.0,Zipper tab broke off in first week or so but it still works great!
4.0,"The product fit great and felt confortable, the only issue I would see is that it’s rides up near your butt and after only 2 wears the strap for the leg broke ."
4.0,kid likes it
4.0,Just got it probly have had it a week. I use it to store my monocular. It is  Very wide it works great I suppose if you have sunglasses some may not fit in standard eyeglass case this would do just fine. It is a little bit of a soft case have to be  Careful not  to sit on it.
4.0,"I'm pretty narrow at the waist, five foot ten, 120lbs but even I would say my correct size is tight at the waist. It fits fine but not extra room for when you eat a mean XD"
4.0,Just as listed. It is clean and new. Feels strong and likely to last for a very long time if you take care of it.
4.0,"Looks great, need to see how it holds up to baggage handlers.  Can't wait to try them out."
4.0,Perfect length but very narrow and tight. Granddaughter loved it too much and wouldn't let me return it.
4.0,Has a few scratches on it but for the price it's nice
4.0,"If you are 5'6 or above/ are a rather lanky person in general, it will be very short lolol. Adorable tho. Can be dressed up or down. I dig it."
4.0,Used for my ringmaster clown costume. Just added a few details. It was great!
4.0,Nice quality. I just choose the wrong size.
4.0,"wish i could do 3.5, but the watch is fine.  came quickly.  looks nice but the darker blue trim on the outside is a little bigger than i expected.  all the same i am wear it right now."
4.0,"36 DDD -- XL is a bit small. I would say this is an &#34;at home&#34; sports bra. I wore it to the gym today, and medium or light impact is ok - but running is out of the question if you have big boobs.<br /><br />In my picture - is me just standing around - and you can see the side boob spillage.<br />Overall not terrible -- especially for $10, but this style is probably better for a smaller bust.<br /><br />I should also add that mine are implants - so my bust is very full. DDD's that are natural may not have the same issue with the side boob."
4.0,"The case fits well and has helped the phone withstand a couple of drops.  The case glows when the flashlight is turned on which is awesome.  It is not as easy to turn the phone on and off - the case doesn't line up perfectly with the switch.  Not a deal breaker, but do need to press a little harder than normal to get the phone to turn off."
4.0,"Cute and reasonably priced. Not especially fancy or high quality, but definitely worth the price."
4.0,"Bigger than expected, but is nice"
4.0,Wish I’d read the reviews before purchasing. The size chart is not correct. I will reorder one size up.
4.0,I ordered the XL and it fits like a big medium. I'm a size 8-10. Still comfortable and adorable. Very soft. Did not receive tracking information until...2 weeks AFTER the product was received.
4.0,Nice basic watch.
4.0,"Bit too secure.<br /><br />Brightness is good, flash rate ok. No long term data on battery life (at least 5 hours)."
4.0,I wish I had read details better.  Straps are too short to use as shoulder bag.  But otherwise a nice bag.
4.0,"Showing/shaping the bottom of her boobs? UNNECESSARY. Not to mention it's not much like her bust would appear in the original series.<br /><br />Still, a quality pin and cute nod to a wonderful character. Good price. Great for all TMNT fans."
4.0,"The coat is nice.  Great price.  Seems to be well made and looks good.  I do agree with some of the comments that it runs a bit big, but not by much.  I also agree, if you are looking for it, you can see the black pockets through the white coat. But I'll say none of this would make me not want to get it for again for my daughter."
4.0,"So I really, really wanted to like this shirt and give it 5 stars. The color is beautiful, the material is thick so no sheerness and and it's just super comfy. My only issue is that I felt like it just didn't fit right on me...I felt like it was too big yet at the same time too small,  it was weird."
4.0,"Little bit tight up top to pull over my head, but overall just as it is pictured. Pretty dress."
4.0,They look great when I use them. Got a couple of compliments. Only bad thing about them is that they're easily damaged.
4.0,"I actually love this style with or without a bra. It's a little big, so order a size down. would give 5 stars but it came with the tag cut off and a small hole were that was, but they are sending me a new one. I really appreciate that. Buy this top!"
4.0,The clips that attach are small and difficult to use.
4.0,Love the look! Very comfortable.
4.0,"5’6 130 lbs ordered a Size Medium. This dress was very pretty. The color and style is exactly as pictured. The small probably would have fit me a little better, but I returned it because the package and dress got wet when It was delivered in the rain.<br />I took off a star because the clear fishing thread started to come undone as the night went on. The dress is still wearable, but I had to cut off the thread that was sticking out."
4.0,Black shirt was supposed to be 12-18 months...fit like 6 months. Its SUPER short.<br />The buffalo plaid part fit like 12 months and you can adjust length by the straps.<br />Hard to get a good bow on the back but still SUPER cute on. I put some leg warmers with it and oh..my...gosh 😍<br />Just wish the shirt would have fit better
4.0,This is the perfect length. The material is soft enough not to restrict movement and very warm. I used waterproofing spray to help keep it dry. Took a few applications.
4.0,I usually wear an XL.  This shirt is a little bit shorter than I expected and smaller. Otherwise very cute !
4.0,"Got my watch today and I love it. It is just the right size. I just wish you would stop it running before you sent it out. Not sure how long the battery will last. Otherwise, it is perfectly what I have looked for for years. Thanks"
4.0,"Nice, warm jacket. The shoulders are pretty snug."
4.0,I got this dress in an extra large because I am a little top heavy and tall. I love the way this dress fits and feels. The material is thick enough to feel high quality and super comfortable. The only thing is it is very long and the waist could have been a little tighter but not a deal breaker.  Also I suggest an adhesive bra as the top did not seem to supportive for larger bust sizes. I got lots of compliments and felt amazing.
4.0,Bought these as a novelty gift for my girlfriend.<br />They seem well made.<br />She got quite the giggle out of these.
4.0,"I travel twice yearly for work, so finding a way to maximize space in my luggage is key. I figured that this would be a nice way to store items in one place, particularly on the return trip when everything is just a teensy bit harder to fit into the suitcase.<br /><br />These are of a decent size and would be good for the smaller essentials such as socks and underwear or night clothes. I don't know that this does a huge-huge job of compressing size like I thought it would, but there may be a difference once I place them in my suitcase for travel (which is of the time of this review, not an option for me because of current events). At the very least this will help with organizing, which is always a plus."
4.0,"Overall, the dress served its purpose.  It was a birthday dress for my 4 year old.  The top is has a pretty sparkle.  It's worth the price I paid, but you can tell it's not quite the manufacturing quality of more expensive dresses.  There were loose strings, and a few very minor mistakes.  It WAS worth the price though..less than $20 vs $60 in the stores."
4.0,"Love this, but it's a tiny bit small. Sent it back for a larger size, and it's till small, but it's good with a camisole underneath."
4.0,I use this for back support. Do not size up if you want a good snug hold.
4.0,get one size larger than you normally would. Otherwise good product
4.0,"It took forever but it was worth it. I ordered Xl (one size bigger than what I wear) because a lot of people said it ran short. I really like the jacket and it looks straight out of the show. The pants are comfy but the color isn't spot on. I'm also glad it brings the basic accessories. In all honesty though it's good for the price and not bad quality.  However,  order at least 1 to 2 months ahead of time. (Mine said from 1 to 2 months and got here in 1 month and a few days)"
4.0,"Cheap and light but for my son who breaks every pair in baseball, it works great!"
4.0,"You always take a risk when you buy shoes online, and these are just a touch to big but not so big that I can't wear them. I can live with it. I like the way they have more cushion in them because I'm on my feet ALL THE TIME at work. If I could do it over I'd go down a size."
4.0,"The quality of the beanie is very good. However, it is a very large size, way too big for me. If the size works for you it is a well made and warm beanie.."
4.0,"I purchased this bathing suit for my teenage daughter. She likes it. For me, it's still hard to see my teenager in a bikini... Didn't bother me a bit when she was a little girl! Anyway, it is very nice quality, a great shade of blue and the top is incredibly cute! We both love the very top of this bikini, however my daughter thinks the top is a little too big on her. She is over 5'7&#34;, normally a size 5 and 34 B. We ordered a size large. We are both glad that the bottoms aren't any smaller. The cut in the back tends to ride into the crack and if you pull them down a little the top of her crack shows... The top is a bit difficult to clasp and tie by yourself. I hope the pictures will help those who are undecided, concerning what size to order ;)"
4.0,"Love the dresses, have three different colors, love the fit."
4.0,Needed a little alteration but afterwards it was a nice fit
4.0,"Comfortable for working out. I wouldn't say they were compression. A little loose, not tight fitting."
4.0,Too short to fit around my waist
4.0,Excellent performance wear.
4.0,Outdoors. Perfect size & fit.
4.0,"Good quality, received a lot of complements about it. I have only worn it once so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the gold tones might fade fast, I am a little worried about that. The only issue is that it took forever to receive it. I was well over a month."
4.0,"Great kid's watch.  The instructions were translated to English poorly, but you can figure out what is meant."
4.0,"Very thick, good quality, but runs a little big. Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and if his hair wasn't so fluffy or if he had a buzz cut I believe it would be too big. Nice beanie though! Great for winter or cooler months. Color is exactly like the picture."
4.0,My Grandson love it!
4.0,"Pants are great but fit much smaller than described. The fabric is soft, the stitching is not as durable as I'd expect."
4.0,Nice looking bag...great price
4.0,Chain is too thin...
4.0,I like these no regrets on this purchase.
4.0,"Honestly, for $16 you can't beat the price. Just a butterfly deployment clasp can run $20. The band is decent looking, shiny, and looks like alligator grain leather, is pretty subtle and flexible, and doesn't cause any irritation when wearing it. It has a distinct chemical odor when you take it out of the packaging, but the smell fades with time; need to air it out, I guess. Again, if you're looking for a top-of-the-line strap, look elsewhere. For the price, this one looks fine, and if it ever ends up showing wear, I'll have a spare deployment clasp out of the deal."
4.0,Nice necklace very shiny! Looks really nice . My son likes it. Good for the price!
4.0,they are good looks nice
4.0,Cute colors and they fit pretty well.  Just slightly too large for my tot but i've had others that were way off.  This is nothing in comparison.
4.0,"They were ok,"
4.0,"The reason for a 4 star review/ it is flattering, cute, affordable, and comfortable. My issue is with the hem between he top and bottom of the dress- where the two different fabrics meet at the waist. Mine isn’t straight- it is odd. But is it decent enough to keep."
4.0,Need a slightly smaller size directly for women.
4.0,Fits a little small...go up one size.
4.0,They are a bit tight & they don't come up as far as the photo shows but I do like them a lot.
4.0,"Looks very high quality, but quite small and arrived almost two weeks late. It’s very cute despite that though, and I love it lots!"
4.0,"Fun, casual dress.  It’s nice to wear a gentle floral print."
4.0,Came quick! Very nice and perfect for my Jade Harley cosplay. They were a little big for my head but not by much! Would buy from seller again!
4.0,I love that fact it matches my versa 2 fit bit perfectly.  It's comfortable for my wrist. It was not that easy to change one band to another.  One thing I don't like that rose color is coming off already after 2-3 months.
4.0,"I like this dress. It fits as expected and I like the color. But the fabric is thin. You can pull and stretch the fabric and it's a little sheer, too. I was expecting it to have a little more heft to it.  I'm a little self conscious without wearing a slip underneath."
4.0,"It looks cute but a little big for me<br />Choose your right size, and It'll fit you. I buy a size bigger than my size and it's somewhat large for me"
4.0,"Decent piece for the price. I did have to glue a bead back on. I didn't pay much attention before I ordered, but the chain is a brownish/bronze..or either it is tarnished."
4.0,The bras are very supportive! I will need to get used to them because they fit a little more snug than I’m used to. I would recommend buying it in one more size up if you’re not a fan of more fitted items. Impressed with how quickly it was shipped & the packaging!
4.0,I love the dress. It is good fabric and good workmanship on the sewing. The size is not what I expected from a 2X. Beware: it runs very small. I my estimation the 2x=14-16 Women Size.
4.0,Perfect for fall weather with leggings and a tall boot! I’m larger in the bust and stomach area and it fit nicely without  accentuating any flaws I wanted to conceal.
4.0,"in good condition, but if you want to find one could function like a minimizer like me, it does not work, but for most people, this characteristic should be good"
4.0,Would I buy them again? No<br />They have a heavy chemical smell to them.<br />I do not like that I can feel the indents of the polo figure and words when I walk.<br />I like the straps of the sandal.<br />They do their job.
4.0,Belt was comfortable and I liked having seven holes rather than just 5.  I think it is a great deal for the price
4.0,"I may be the rare exception, but I haven't had any of the issues everyone else is stating. It might come down to wrist size and how much wiggle room it has, but I've worn this almost everyday for almost 3 weeks with no problems. So from my experience, I couldn't really be happier. Only reason I deducted a star is because it can be difficult to put on at times, and a clasp would serve better."
4.0,Great glasses for a super sunny day. The lenses are decently dark. And the plastic is very thick and sturdy.
4.0,"UPDATE: Since I had no time to return these, nor shop for other gifts to present, I went ahead and gifted these to family members who didn't even notice the condition until I brought it up. Over a short time wearing them, the wrinkles are gone or barely noticeable. And... they were very happy with them. So I updated my review from 🌟 🌟 to 🌟 🌟 🌟🌟 !<br /><br />BEFORE CHRISTMAS 2021:<br />I purchased two of these hats for Uber drivers in the family, but won't be able to present them as gifts due to their unsightly appearance. So... I'm returning them. It's too bad because the quality isn't bad. It's not great, but good enough. However, the ""condition"" is bad."
4.0,I really like this dress. It runs big. Glad the straps are adjustable. The fabric is good quality. I can’t wait to wear it in my vacation.
4.0,"Bought these for my 10 year old daughter, that has sensitive ears. They are the perfect size and great quality for the price."
4.0,I was very surprised at how well they fit.  The shorts are well Worth the cost.  Shorts are good weight and not flimsy.  Not bright white but more off white.
4.0,It's cute.  Took awhile to get here.  But it's cute.
4.0,"It's okay. The material is to stiff for this type of blouse. I think what throws you off is the word &#34; CHIFFON &#34;.<br />So, if you are looking for a slinky cutesy leopard top, this is not it."
4.0,"This coat sure does compress down to a tiny size. The medium runs a bit large and the sleeves are a bit long so you may want to order a size down. It is pretty warm, though you would likely still need to layer it in snow (it's been 90 degrees here, so it's hard to test it's full cold weather capabilities). The hood stays on and provides lots of coverage.  Classic fitted puffer style. Well stitched. Nice vibrant blue."
4.0,"Was smaller than I expected,wish it was bigger than that"
4.0,"It's very small.  Very, very small.  But it's cute and I gave it to a friend who has a smaller head than me, and she adores it."
4.0,"Bought this for someone that works in a metal mill and as expected, it is 1000 degrees in there. A mask can be super uncomfortable and he always dogs up the face shield. This was very easy for him to wear; comfortable and very breathable. Although due to the mesh on the mouth area, I am not sure it the best for covid but as the doctor said, something is better than nothing. I really got it for the cooling effect, which he said didn't really offer much. He puts it in the fridge before work and while it is cool, it soon goes away. It doesn't make him hot either though. But def doesn't cool him... It may be because of how hot it is. But we are not sold on the claim that is cooling, but it really is very comfortable to wear in very hot climate where one has to be protected."
4.0,"I thought this dress was really cute. It looks very classy and is well packaged. It is the type of dress that is somewhat fitted across the bust but then falls away from the body, which is great if you are like me and want to camouflage a few areas.The material had a nice flow, but I didn't like the feel of it.As a result, I DID send it back, but that was the only reason. I also thought that it was a bit thin and much lighter in weight compared to a similar styled dress from another manufacturer. The burgundy color was not quite as deep as what is pictured, but it was still quite beautiful.The design at the bottom goes all the way around, which is a plus. Other manufacturers make a similar style, but the design is only in the front. If you are not sensitive to fabrics, then this is the dress for you! I am 5'0 149 lbs, bust is 39, waist is 34, and hips are 39. I felt that the dress fit true to size, as I typically wear either a medium or a large depending on the style and maker of the dress."
4.0,The watch is very pretty and sturdy. We got this a gift for our 11yo son. It seems to be well made and came packaged very nice.
4.0,"I got this belt for a cosplay, and it does what it was meant for, it holds up pants and it looks just like the picture. It's not super high quality and the studs feel like they will probably fall off over time, but isn't that the case with all studded belts?"
4.0,Good quailty for the price. I like the leather for when I’m dressed up and the sport band looks odd. The pink is cute and the rose gold matches the rose gold of the Garmin watch. I wish they made the rose gold clip in other leather colors.
4.0,"I liked the shirt itself, it fit nice. I ordered &#34;medium pink&#34; which looks nothing like the color in the photo, turns out to actually be baby pink. From the photo i was under the impression it was more red-ish...its not, at all. I returned it, prob will order a diff color now."
4.0,These are cute slippers but they might slip off. Seem to run a little big but will work for traveling.
4.0,"I have a 1 zipper cover i bought from another seller it hangs on the side of my coach bag and to avoid my keys scratching my bag i bought this one so everything is one place. Exactly what i expected, only thing that bothers me is that its a little bulky, could of been thinner. But LOVE IT anyways! 🤩"
4.0,"The lanyard is very pretty and the different buttons snap in and out quite easily. However, the medallion twists constantly. Not only can you not see the attractive design, my credentials twist backwards as well. I’m going to try find a heavier chai to see if that helps."
4.0,They were awesome came fast but the balls break easy so becareful not to screw them on to tight
4.0,"Very pretty, smaller than I expected"
4.0,A little on the snug side. Maybe they'll give a little after wearing them.
4.0,"I didn’t realize you had to put redo the straps! When I tried to readjust the straps the came apart, and I had to have my husband fix them. I bought a size LARGE, which is a bit tight, I probably could have gotten away with an XL. But they fit, they’re just not as comfortable."
4.0,"Relly cute outfit. Shirt fit perfectly,  but the pants were a little big."
4.0,Very nice size pendant. Just a personal preference but I think I would have preferred a different style chain. I think it looks a little cheap to be able to gift but nice as a cute casual necklace.
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE Jude Jewelers. However, like everything else I have ordered from them...their sizing is inconsistent. I ordered a 13 for my middle finger, and it came labeled as a size 13. Unfortunately it’s a half a size too small I threw it on the ring sizer to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind....nope...it’s a 12.5. Thankfully I have an obsession with jewelry and this can fit on other fingers - albeit more comfortably - but man I am disappointed. This is a gorgeous ring and looks beautiful on my middle finger....if only it wasn’t a half size too small!"
4.0,I love it but it would have been nice if a hair clip had been included.
4.0,"First...people...if you’re going to give stars leave a review. It’d be really helpful to the rest of us.<br /><br />Second...let me say I have spent the last TWO months ordering “gemmed” tunnels from a variety of vendors. These are the second ones I have ordered off of amazon (the other from a different company), but the FIRST to arrive with all the stones actually in place. They are more highly polished and smooth on the edges. With that said...I wish I would have read the description more clearly. The “wearable” area of these tunnels is INSANE. Even at 38mm (1.5”) I still have pretty thick loves. Thicker than all of my friends who are at my size and even some of those who are smaller in size. The wearable area of these tunnels is just unrealistic. It’s too big. However, they’re also thinner than other sellers versions and more comfortable because of this. I don’t like my ears “weighted” down, but I need classy professional looking tunnels as a business owner (unrelated to the body mod industry so it’s even more important to look professional).<br /><br />Am I going to return these? Probably not. I have a major event this weekend and don’t have time to replace them, but I will likely still continue looking for a pair to replace them with a more realistic “wearable” area. I do feel they are overpriced though, but...it is what it is.<br /><br />I’ve included photos for reference in hopes this helps future buyers."
4.0,very nice glasses  good quality.
4.0,"Silicone wedding rings offer a good option when there may be issues with wearing a regular wedding ring. We have used them when working in the yard, traveling and taking part in water sports. The different thing about this set is it comes with 4 rings in 4 sizes and a matching bracelet. It does seem unnecessary to have four different sizes when buying for one person, what should be done with the extra rings?<br /><br /> I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review"
4.0,"Great shirt, good quality. Very satisfied!"
4.0,"I like these earrings although I wish the stamping of the pattern was on both sides, it is only on one side."
4.0,Love! I am 5’10 and a 34 DD. I ordered two sizes up so that it would fit boobs & length. It’s perfect!
4.0,Got a lot of laughs.
4.0,They fit nicely and do the job I expected!  Wish they offered a slightly smaller size as I have a small face!
4.0,"This item was made of very nice quality material and was larger than I expected it to be. On the package, it stated ""fits up to size 10"". I am about a 12 to 14 size and it fit me just fine. When I ordered it, I was not sure as to the size, since I did not see it on the ordering page. It was a little long in the skirt area, but I tacked it up (I am short, 5'2"") However, I would recommend this item to anyone who wanted to be comfortable. It was fun to wear and got a lot of nice feedback."
4.0,"The belt is quite nice.  I had bought it as a gift, as it certainly looked very practical to me.  The recipient wished it were wider, and didn't really want to have to travel with two belts, but his most recent trip seems to have changed his mind."
4.0,"Super cute, love the colors! They seem well made but are a bit tight for me on the ankles, not where it cuts off blood supply or anything but enough to leave an imprint. They are made of the same thick Lycra type material opaque tights are made out of, so expect them to be soft and silky. I got these to wear with ankle booties and they’re perfect!"
4.0,I've been Mountain biking without padded shorts or tights for almost 2 years until earlier this month I hit a bump that hurt me where I don't want to hurt. Since it's winter in Pennsylvania I figured lets start with padded winter tights. I wear basketball shorts over tights when I ride and I must admit that I will wear padded tights from now in in my riding life!<br /><br />I wore these in 35 degree weather and was very comfortable. They didn't ride down and were every bit as comfortable and warm as my Reebok cold weather gear tights that I normally ride in. Will buy more!<br /><br />I'm 6'1&quot; 230 with a 38 waist and big thighs. I bought the XL and they were long and wide enough for me!
4.0,"I really love this top, but sadly it does run small and fits nothing like the picture.  I am not a small gal, but usually wear an XL and this was tight as you see in the pics.  It is thin, so a top under as in the model would be good... you can see my white bra somewhat through the top.  Although it is thin material, it is warm.  I don't think I would wear this in the heat at all.  It's got a great color and seems to be quality made material.  I would order another one (a little larger).<br />I received the top at a discounted price for my honest opinion."
4.0,"Cute sweater - little clingy but not too bad. It is super cute on and versatile.  Not super long. I’m short-wasted, and it works for me. It might short on someone longer-wasted.  I love it - would recommend."
4.0,This is so adorable. Don't be put off by the thin material yes it's very thin material but you got to consider the price you're paying for it. But honestly it's so cute. When you get it definitely put it on because it looks actually much better on then you'd think.  Runs small but I figured that and ordered a size larger for myself.
4.0,"I bought this dress to wear to a concert. The reason I liked it was because it was a wrap dress that hides your pooch. The reason its getting 4 instead of five stars is because I was under the assumption the dress was black and gold. Its really black and nudish/peach. I got the dress just a few days before the concert so I wasnt going to return it. I rolled with it.<br />I had to steam it but due to it being polyester, the wrinkles came out super easy. I also thought it would be a tad bit shorter but if you have a big butt, it'll probably sit right where you want it to.<br />But overall, I think its a cute dress. Nice fit in the arms. comfortable, can move without feeling restricted, and feels good to the touch. I wear a 38D and it gave ample coverage to my breast without a special bra. I would wear full body shape wear so the back can look slimming. For the record, I ordered a Large and I'm a true large. 5'6, 188 pounds. Fit me perfectly. True to size."
4.0,I really like these pants. I’m guessing they have to be your style for you to like it. I would say it’s true to size because I ordered a L knowing full well I’m a size 6. So this is way too big. I can alter it though. It’s a soft denim material and not stiff.
4.0,"Paper Thin, but did what we needed it to do"
4.0,If they were about 1 inch bigger they would be great.  I need a true ex-large
4.0,"Slightly worried the chain will be a little fragile, but so far holding up strong. Such cute designs engraved"
4.0,"very supportive.I play tennis and workout.Its much like the Champion sport bra I can no longer find in retail stores.Make sure you measure for the right size.The sizing is not generous.I like that it comes in bright colors.Yes,reccomend"
4.0,Great buy! Fits true to sizing chart size.
4.0,"These fit my Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 perfectly.  I love the texture and how snug they are.  I give 4 stars only because the purple one isn't really as purple as the listing shows. It's more of a raspberry burgundy color, which I still love but I wish it was true purple."
4.0,I like this dress. But I don't love it. I got it in grey & it fits much better
4.0,"The sunglasses arrived quickly and were well packaged.  They are nice looking and well made, especially for the money.  Unfortunately the ear portion of the frame is too stiff for my main use, under a full face motorcycle helmet.  If you do not plan to wear them under a helmet, you will probably be pleased with these glasses. While I was advised I could return them for refund, the return shipping cost makes that unworth the effort.  I will gift them to someone who they fit better."
4.0,"The size of the pendant is about half the size of what is shown in the photo of the lady wearing it. It also isn't flat and thin like expected. The spiral side comes out quite a bit. It's also a lot duller than those in the photos. Basically, it's not what I was expecting. It arrived super dirty on both sides, not sure what it is, but it's gross... But all-in-all, it is still beautiful and I would definitely still wear it. The chains are not adjustable in size, but it comes with 3 different length chains with almost-too-easy-to-clasp clasps, which makes me worried about it breaking easy, coming open, or falling off. Once again, though, the pendant itself is beautiful even though it's not what I expected!"
4.0,I bought this in dark grey. The fabric is soft and a great weight. The cut is flattering. Only 2 of the buttons show because of how the neck hangs. I bought a Medium and am 5’5” and the sleeves are barely long enough. After washing they will likely be too short.
4.0,"New to this boot. Out of the Box the boot they looks great. Then on my feet it looks a bit bulky, A little higher profile on the toe area than I would like and a little hot. I had to wear this boot around a couple times to break it in before I was comfortable on my first ride. After 4 rides in and going down multiple times, the boot is getting better with age and holding up well. They also deflected a fair amount of water better than I expected."
4.0,"I am 5’7” and usually a size 4 and have a booty. I usually order a size S but ordered a M. The shorts fit and are cute but do not fit like photo of model wearing them. They are a little shorter and though they don’t pull, they are more fitted. I will likely order a second pair but will size up to a large so they will allow for more of a flowy fit."
4.0,"Only complaint is about the strap in the back.  There are bits of blue in it, which doesn't really match."
4.0,"it's somewhat see-through, can't wear dark jeans under it"
4.0,"Not heavy material, very lightweight. Order 1 size larger for shrinkage."
4.0,"Loved the print, but material isn't very comfortable."
4.0,"Cute dress, but very little stretch.  If you’re a curvy girl, you may want to order a size up, there is no give.  I’m 5’4 and 148 right now, 34 DDD (nursing) and can’t comfortable where this size.  Once I’m done nursing, it’ll fit way better.  Nice material and well made, I’d recommend."
4.0,"Such a great summer dress. Easy to throw on to go out, even just for running errands. Looks put together with minimal effort! Would be great for brunch with friends or a summer evening BBQ... once life is back to normal and we are doing those things again!"
4.0,"Great fit, very warm and comfortable. a few little glitches when I tried to use the touch pads on them, but I have the habit of using my fingertips. when I use the pad of my finger instead, I had better results."
4.0,The neck hole is so small. You have to put the shirt on before you do your hair or makeup.
4.0,These shorts are so lite and comfortable! I have been wearing a 17 year-old pair of Wilson shorts for ever because I just dont like the modern shorts that REALLY look like a DRESS!
4.0,"I wear a 3X and it was comfortable albeit a little bigger than most, only reason 4 stars was I couldn’t get my collar to lie down without unbuttoning 2 of the buttons and looking “butterfly collar” all day.  The shirt fabric is similiar to and under armor shirts that worked out well during yesterday’s round in the rain."
4.0,"Love this dress, fits well but is too long."
4.0,"This is the second dress of this style I have bought. It is quite nice, but the color ran when I washed it (cold water, gentle cycle) so I would advise washing separately or with similar colors."
4.0,Good shirt for the price!
4.0,"LOVE these! I can't wait to get them in every color! The only thing I wish was different was that the lighter color is a little more sheer than I expected, but overall I love them!"
4.0,"They fit perfectly over my glasses (size 54x17) and are comfortable, easy to put on and to remove. The sides will  block peripheral vision, if that matters to you. I prefer the smoke lens over the G15. I am colorblind (red-green deficient) and the G15 lens makes everything look very two dimensional to me. The smoke lens provides better contrast."
4.0,"Unfortunately this suit is small and short for me. Since it was Medium, I thought it would fit me because I am 5'4&#34; and 110 pounds. Being short, it would be uncomfortable for lap swimming.  Why are some TRY suits sized S,M, and L and others 32, 34, etc? Is one sizing for junior sizes?<br />I don't know whether to order a Large?<br />The material is strong and love the reversable colors."
4.0,"The legs develop wrinkles because they’re a little bit too big, But I am still quite happy with them."
4.0,"Loved the pendant but, the chain was short. Looks like it was for a child not an adult. I had to go buy a new chain to go with it."
4.0,"The dress is exactly as pictured. The colors are vibrant and the material is very soft. I am 5'1&#34; , 130lbs and the length is fine with flats or without. I ordered an xsmall and the length was not an issue however, I returned the dress because the overall fit was not too my liking. It was too loose in the waistline and being that I am short it made me look even shorter. If you are petite, and plan on wearing heels go for it. I wanted to wear it with flats. For a taller person the dress would be beautiful."
4.0,"I got these for my wife, who loves the color purple. She has a few purple lingerers, but this is the first time I have been able to find a good pair of purple stockings to go with them. She is 5'7"" so I got her the large.  They fit just right, and are nice and soft."
4.0,"I love this sweater! The swallows are really bright and colorful. The splash of color on the buttons is really fun and kitch. the only reason it didn't receive 5 stars are the sacred heart patches on the wrists. they are a little too large. The good news, I can cuff the sleeves and cover them"
4.0,Looks great!  Fits nice.
4.0,"I AM NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY WITH THE CHEMICAL ODOR INSIDE THE BAG, BUT FOR THE PRICE I GIVE IT FOUR STARS.  IT IS MY OTHER BEST FRIEND'S FAVORITE COLOR"
4.0,"I LOVE this dress!!! It is super flattering , even though it fits a bit small in the chest and I’m only a size 36C in the bust. I’m 5’8 and weight 145lbs and got a medium. But it’s not too small that I can’t wear it comfortably. It’s so cute and comfortable. I’m going to buy another one in a different print I love it so much!! Easy to dress down for just a day out running errands, coffee with friends,work, or dress up for a special occasion. I only gave it 4 starts because I think the fabric could be better quality but for the price it is nice!"
4.0,"The sweatshirt is not to heavy, which is what I wanted.  Fits fine and arrived promptly."
4.0,"These PJ’s are great. I love the brushed back fabric as it adds a layer of warmth, and I wear them nearly year round because we live at a high elevation and night are almost always cool. I am 5’8” and160 and the large fits fine, my usual size."
4.0,It says it was for  a 12-14 I'm a 10-12. I like things loose so bought this size but it wasn't as baggy as I like. Still a great shirt
4.0,"The only D-ring I've been able to find that fits my fuller lips. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because the balls are too big, and I'll need to switch them out. Otherwise, I'm a satisfied customer."
4.0,"I am a woman with rather large hands and these worked perfectly. I use them indoors when the weather is really cold. Our family room is an addition and is not as warm as the rest of the house. When I am inactive, sitting to read a book, my hands get quite chilled and these are the perfect solution since the fingerless style lets me turn the pages with ease.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase these again. I subtracted one star because the quality was good but not great."
4.0,Lightweight piece of jewelry. The beading hangs independently in separate rows. It is made of a lightweight plastic which still looks rich and expensive but is light on the neck.
4.0,runs two sizes smaller than typical.
4.0,I like to dress it feels good on me
4.0,This hat is more than what expected for the price. I fly like it. It is a little bit small but still great.
4.0,"Its great but too rigid and takes time to conform to yoir wrist. Other than that, no other problems"
4.0,"Nice dress, but runs large"
4.0,"Okay well I have to give it 4 Stars because it is super sexy. But this is NOT what I thought it was... I bought this for a Slytherin Cosplay costume thinking it would cover my butt and everything. Nope, it didn’t even have that separator thing that most skirts have in the middle. It’s hard to describe but it’s like... I don’t know... but anyways TOTALLY NOT FOR COSPLAY. Unless that cosplay is Roleolay in the bedroom and you’re going to be Draco Malfoy and let Harry bury his wand in your chamber of secrets!!"
4.0,Fit exactly the way I expected
4.0,"In comparison to the ones they sell at hot topic, these are  decent amount larger. my neck is pretty thick, so I have to wear it on the largest snap. It fits though, so im happy about that! I have the four pack with pink, purple, black and a pearl/metalic grey? color. They feel pretty good on, arent too tight and dont feel like they will break very soon."
4.0,"I really like the material of these tank tops, but I wish they had an XS. I saw another reviewer complain that the tanks weren't true to size because they were too small, but I found the opposite to be true. This doesn't work for running because I hate having to continually pull down my shirts. I like them to be tight enough to stay in place. This is actually FLOWY and there's a lot of room all around the waist. I'm still keeping them because they are actually very cute and comfortable. The colors are vibrant and nice. But still, wish they had smaller sizes!"
4.0,I love it  very  nice  watch
4.0,Not quite as expected.  A little on the small side.
4.0,"This is (was) a very nice belt.  My husband loved it and it fit well.  However, a new, young stray dog chewed it good.  I actually cut the belt in pieces so he could continue to chew the leather.  If you can keep your dog away, go ahead and buy it."
4.0,I love it I'm just missing my strings !
4.0,Nice comfortable band. It is much brighter orange than in the ad.
4.0,Nice lightweight soft material.  Very pretty color.
4.0,This tie makes me wanna say: &#34;That's gansta&#34;. Paul Malone ties are always good quality. Too bad my wife and I have a difference of opinion on this tie.
4.0,"The red color bleeds onto my skin and I have to clean it off for a few days after that it's ok. I had to buy a second one because the first one I had got stripped when it was accidentally pulled out and I had to replace it. The second one seems to irritate me more and I have never had problems with naval rings before. So if u are sensitive, use caution."
4.0,"My stats: 5' 3.5"", 143 lbs, 32"" waist, 38"" hips, 26"" inseam, 10” front rise.<br />Item: Medium, Peacock blue, 75% nylon 25% spandex.<br />Pros: Comfortable, sits about an inch above the waist. Side pockets are roomy enough to fit my Pixel 3 XL phone with Moment case.<br />Cons: Fabric is pretty smooth so any bumps like panty lines and even the scrunch at the leg bottoms (because they're too long) are obvious. The pants slowly creep down over time so I have to continually adjust.<br />Decision: Returned."
4.0,"Very cute, wish the straps were adjustable."
4.0,They were for a cabbage patch doll
4.0,"I really like the look of this swim suit.  It is cute and would look great at the beach or pool.  However, when I ordered it came in too big for me in the bottoms and too small in the top, even after following the sizing recommendation of reviewers and the manufacturer’s information.  I was fortunate that I have a friend that it did fit, for the most part (not perfect).  I could have returned it and tried a different size but felt the back and forth would be more frustrating.<br /><br />The manufacturing looked good as I could see no loose strings or flaws in the suit itself.  It is a really nice looking suit, just did not fit me very well.  Overall a cute outfit but have issues with the mix match sizes.  The seller was receptive to replacing but I just passed it off to a friend to try and see if it works for her.  But if you can get the size right for yourself then this is a nicely made swim suit which is sexy and well-made.<br /><br />I did receive this quality product to try out at a discount for my unbiased and completely honest feedback. I do routinely provide feedback on products I try (paid or at a discount) so that other shoppers and friends may avoid some of the not so good choices on products they are looking for while avoiding the bad products. I have found this to be an effective and quality product which is nice and performed as promised by the seller. Please, if you find this review to be helpful to you be sure to hit YES. Thank you and happy shopping!"
4.0,It was fine for girth. but a bit shorter than expected.  I did get nice compliments on it at an Oktoberfest party at a friends house.
4.0,Delivery was prompt & the product was all that it was described to be. Fairly priced and considering that Coach was out of stock.....it was right on time. My wife loved it.
4.0,Size S looks good and fit on petite tiny figure.
4.0,a cheap ring. worth the price.
4.0,"Somewhat small but just as cute, really like it."
4.0,"Love the pattern and style, but it doesn’t feel like leather."
4.0,"This dress was very comfortable. I wore it in my friends wedding (I was the maid of honor) and I was in it for a good 7 or 8 hours and was very comfortable. I do recommend shape wear as it hugs your body, I also was dealing with starltic cling. My only complaint is that the lace part wasn't sewing on the way I would have expected and there was no stretch in the sleeves."
4.0,"Cute, good fit, bit very thin."
4.0,Loved it. Very cute
4.0,"The seller said these are hand measured and might be off 2cm,  well they are and my foot in a 9,  is all the way up to the top and bottom.  Why not carry larger sizes or fix the problem,  because they are very soft and feel comfortable,  otherwise."
4.0,Fits well. Classic and simple.
4.0,"I like this shirt because it isn't too short. I took one star off because the fabric is starting to look &#34;dirty&#34;. However, That might be from washing with dark clothes"
4.0,"Beautiful pendant,however the chain that came with it is too short for a pendant of that size."
4.0,Good but very tight at the ankle
4.0,"The Quality, and for my pandora bracelet"
4.0,I am 5'10 & 156 lbs.  This does not touch the ground on me. I got a medium size. It fits kind of loosely. Not really hugging but I still like the colors
4.0,Love these sunglasses. Worth the buy.
4.0,"I love the jacket, the only thing is the pockets are to far back, they need to be closer."
4.0,"I initially got this shirt in medium for my tween daughter, who usually wears small to medium.  While it’s wearable for her, it seemed really big on her. I usually wear a large or x-large, but it looked so big I decided to try it on... and it fits me!  In fact it even fits me loosely, so this shirt runs very big.  Overall I like the shirt - it’s comfortable and fits me well.  Anyone purchasing this shirt should plan to purchase 1-2 sizes smaller than what they usually wear for a proper fit.  The fabric is lightweight and soft, though I notice that the brown part is especially see-through.  I expect that anything other than a bra that’s close to your skin-tone will show through, but otherwise it doesn’t feel too revealing.  This shirt did not shrink or fade when washed according to the instructions on the tag.<br /><br />I’m rating this shirt 4 stars - I like it but can’t give full stars due to the size being off."
4.0,These were a little lighter than some other's I purchased which is why I only rated them as a 4.  I have not used them yet but really look well made and a super size for purchasing heavier items liked canned goods if you are using for groceries.  I would definitely purchased again.
4.0,"Great dress. I loved the color, better than online. Runs short, get a bigger size or a good girdle."
4.0,Beautiful watch very pleased with my purchase
4.0,Nice jacket. it fit perfect. it was longer than I expected but still nice.
4.0,The second time I purchased the hat from the store. I love the quality and design of the hats. They look very good on my baby girl.
4.0,"I was honestly hesitant to buy these earrings considering they didn’t have a review. I want to give this product 5/5 but where you have to attach them is odd, they are a heavy earring they’re not made for a long wear, and I do wish their were different color options"
4.0,"This is such a great quality shirt dress! It is extremely long. I'm 5'8&#34; size 16 top, and the 2XL hit just above my knees. The sleeve length is perfect and the elbow patches mostly hit at the right spot... I'm not sure that they're exact to the back of my arm but look close enough to look right. The material is not flimsy or sheer and the pocket is a decent size and well stitched."
4.0,"These are really nice joggers: the quality is outstanding; the color matches the picture; and there’s the perfect amount of stretch. Additionally, they’re nice enough that you could probably wear them to work without any issues, as they look like dress ankle pants. That being said, they run a little small, and if you want them to fit like the model pictured, I would size up. For reference, I’m 5’7 and around 190 lbs (about 5 weeks postpartum). I’m busty up top with a small waist and curvy through the butt and thigh. I ordered a size large in the dark grey color. I’ll keep them because the fit will work, but if I order another pair I will definitely size up to an XL."
4.0,"Bought these as a gift for a bird lover. Unfortunately, the picture is so dark and tiny that it's kind of tough to appreciate the scene. Still, she liked them and I think it's a clever idea."
4.0,Really cute on and stretchy for comfort
4.0,Nice gloves for being active outside.
4.0,"Not quite the material I expected.. More like &#34;tent material&#34;.. Cute though, just as pictured! Runs a little large but that's alright, gives my baby room to grow into it. All in all, it's worth the price, just don't expect anything made with very good material. Also, has a plastic smell, I'm sure will easily come out with a washing. Fast shipping!"
4.0,The stone is Beautiful
4.0,"Fabulous Chartreuse Color in pressed powder - hard to find color, decent case. I like this rare color that has hints of yellow, it is a great accent or my tiger eyes (hazel/olive/yellow). I like this in the pressed powder and the high pigment. *I am NOT a fan of the creme color version of this, careful shopping to pick the right one. This has staying power (especially with a primer) and allows for ombre artistry on the eyelid (dark to light). I apply with a small flat brush and use for everyday wear (not high impact lighting/stage). The case is basic but it is strong enough to survive your makeup bag and the lid stays shut. It's overpriced in my opinion (minus one star), but this unique color was what made the sale. All the other brands greens are too Kelley green and don't have the springy yellow undertones that make chartreuse. This is a wild but natural color that seems jungle inspired. Enjoy!"
4.0,"They’re nice looking shoes, just a tat bit on the narrow side. Other than that, fantastic for the price."
4.0,"Very nice item, enough room for larger sunglasses."
4.0,"Good fit. Nice material. Well-shaped, could have been a little baggier for my likes. Might get the desired floppiness with age. Also, there were storage/shipping creases that I had to steam out. Still, a very nice cap for the money!"
4.0,"Very cute & great color (red). It came with a long snag, but it doesn't seem to have affected the pattern."
4.0,"Loved it, the design is very cute! I wished they made the buckle in rose gold color."
4.0,"Nice piece. Low dough, couldn't lose."
4.0,I little long for my wife's taste but otherwise a great buy!
4.0,"It’s not my size it’s tight. My height is 5,7and my weight is 195 on"
4.0,"Beautiful fit, but a bit thin fabric"
4.0,I love the color. The material is very comfy and stretchy. Material is also very soft so you need to wear proper underwear.
4.0,"Didn't think it would be as large as it is, but lots of space.  Only downsides I found are the way the straps buckle and the zipper pocket gets caught on lining."
4.0,"So far, have really enjoyed the bracelets.  I can't tell as of yet, about helping with carpel tunnel or arthritis  as have not worn every day."
4.0,"These clogs are nicely made, except the picture peels off easily-only took off 1 star b/c that doesn’t mess w/ their function. These fit my daughter great (she has outgrown Crocs size 1, but isn’t quite ready for a 2, so these are perfect for in between, fit like a 1.5)."
4.0,"Perfect except pockets were sewn together with a tiny stitch which was very difficult to remove even with a seam ripper. They should have used a basting stitch. Otherwise, well made."
4.0,Only reason I can’t give this a 5 is one of the straps was disconnected when it arrived. Otherwise beautiful piece. I got the 3x = US L
4.0,This is a good set of sunglasses.
4.0,"Really pretty, came like what you see in the picture. But it's a bit tight and it has more of a costume jewelry look. But it's still very cute. Is stretchy so you can slip it over your foot. No clasp which is comfortable."
4.0,"It fits great and is comfortable. I could even wear it under a tshirt no problem. However, the boning in the side is painful. It's too long and it digs into my sides. I ended up returning it because of this."
4.0,"I really like these necklaces. I actually didn't realize it came with BOTH the silver and gold as a package. I just thought I picked 1 color and I guess I wasn't paying attention. So even better price than I thought. It looks pretty on, especially with a lower scoop neck cut top. It is a little shorter than you might expect, but you can adjust the way it drops by tugging the bottom chain leaf a little more or less through. So one day I wore it with the top leaf almost like a choker and the next I wore it with the 2 leaves touching and hanging closer to my chest. Both ways were pretty. It is nice super awesome high quality jewelry, but a good value."
4.0,Very adequate for the price. I bought medium and probably could have worn small but they're working fine.
4.0,"Very thin fabric, but not see through, very stretchy. When I first put it on, it bunched up in weird places, but I threw on a body shaper and it smoothed right out. Hem is slightly twisted, but it's hardly noticeable when wearing it. It's ok considering the price."
4.0,So soft and comfortable but cheap made! I still love them though because of the way they feel on!
4.0,Travel staple!
4.0,Ordered the smallest size but it’s bit bigger for me otherwise it looks beautiful to wear.
4.0,Love them because of the liner all the way around
4.0,Very nice and comfortable but the shirt runs a little small. The fabric does stretch so it does still fit. Overall very nice.
4.0,"These one-size-fits-all acrylic knit gloves are average in appearance and color. The ""Thinsulate"" lining is a huge plus because this fabric is light-weight, yet keeps your hands really warm."
4.0,Grrat top to wear with leggings or jeans. Runs a little big. But soo cute
4.0,"I am very happy and impressed with this dress. It doesn't look like a costume, rather a dress I can wear everyday. It is comfortable and absolutely beautiful.<br />I will say that this dress needs to be handwasged and air dried due to the pleather detail and straps. Im afraid if you put it through a wash cycle and then into a dryer, the Pletcher will start breaking down and flaking. Be aware. I hadn't been able to wear it yet because its too cold where I live to line dry it."
4.0,Nice for all occasions
4.0,"What a cute purse! I bought this for a vacation I'm going on and it's so cute and colorful, kind of retro-looking. It's not the most expensive looking purse but you get what you pay for. I like the fact that it does have numerous pockets and dividers so I can organize what's inside the purse. Can't wait to use it!"
4.0,Cute especially for the price!!
4.0,This is a cute outfit a little thin but it is still cute on. Only complaint it runs a little small but the color is as expected. Size M
4.0,"My son has gone through 3 drawstring backpacks  so far this school year! I hope because this one has padding on the shoulder straps and is made of nylon it will last longer. Fingers crossed! So far, so good."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings and better than I expected -- not too heavy and look great on, hangs longer than I expected but still look good."
4.0,They are nice but they are super baggy i hope they shrink when i wash them i should have bought a smaller size.
4.0,"no issues, showed up early and is good quality"
4.0,Love everything about it but where you store ID. Too small. Feels like leather. Like the snap coming over the zippered change compartment.
4.0,The item met my expectations except in respect of its functionality for flash photography. Neither was this clear to me when buying the item. The item has no wireless capability to trigger a flash system. It relies on sync cord connection (not supplied other than as an accessory at additional cost) or use of a timer function during which the camera shutter is used to trigger the flash. The term flashmate is therefore somewhat misleading.<br />Otherwise I have tested its incident and reflected light functions with my Cano 60d and found it to be very accurate. I think it is well priced for its capabilities.
4.0,"I both received and gave this robe as a Christmas present. So this review is actually for the one I received, which was a dark brown and larger. It's incredibly soft, and so far has survived being washed and dried with no issues."
4.0,The color I like but it fits a little tight
4.0,My girlfriend loves these earrings. I would have given them 5 stars instead of 4 if the backs to the earrings weren't so small. They are tiny & make it a bit more difficult to remove them than she would like. But very pleased otherwise.
4.0,"Nice looking, accurate watch. Easy to adjust date and day. Have been using for a month."
4.0,"Pros:<br />-Clean large-faced dial w. sweeping small second hand<br />-Hand-winding mechanism powers watch for a couple days & can sense tension when fully wounded to know when to stop<br />-Keeps excellent time w/o much loss of seconds<br />-Watch band is made of full genuine leather<br />-Good quality construction w. glass slightly domed from the bezel<br />-See-through rear of movement<br />-Watch came in faux leather box with a black nato strap & a few spring bars<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Loud stopwatch-style ticking, very audible when facing the watch & in dead silence when within proximity. Not noticeable when during work or recreation. Would advise it be stored in a watch box to silence it if kept in bedroom<br />-Potentially thin glass due to the ticking making it through<br />-Poor few minutes-lasting lume despite applied to hands & numbers (understandable for the price) Still legible in the dark once eyes adjust<br />-Onion-styled crown is a bit large yet proportional to watch size"
4.0,Larger than appeared
4.0,My granddaughter is 3 and wears size 4 in most clothes. Should have got a 3 in this dress. A little too long but with it. Will have it altered. Beautiful dress
4.0,Soft material but too baggy.
4.0,"I am 5' 2&#34; tall, so the top was longer than I needed. Suit was very nice though."
4.0,You get what you’re paying for. The frame is very thin and delicate. The “lenses” are pinched and bench as if the material were thin cheap plastic. These are great for a costume but don’t think they are gonna be your go-tos for legit wear and tear.
4.0,"I bought this in a small for my daughter who is 5'1&#34;, weighs 117 lbs and has a 34B chest size. It fit her just right.  The material is slinky, but not clingy. Pockets are a nice touch. I gave it 4 stars because I don't know about its longevity."
4.0,Shirt and sleeves a bit long.
4.0,"Me gustó el diseño y el producto,solo que es un poco más pequeño de lo que esperaba"
4.0,You can shape it into many different styles!
4.0,"I did love this and the look  but it runs super super small! It is too late for me to return the item, i totally put it away and been out of the country so it is too late to return :(  so wish I could.....anyway not sure what I will be doing with it now that I am stuck with it.....had the item fit I would have loved it to be my bathing suit cover., b/c I really loved the item....btw it is not a true chiffon, more polyblend."
4.0,I size woud size up it runs small
4.0,"A little flimsy, but not expensive.  Cool blue polarized tint, nice for wine tasting outings etc."
4.0,Worked for a costume; I wouldn't wear it out though. Material is very very sheer.
4.0,Too small in diameter.
4.0,"I got the green dress and loved it so much that I bought the other 2 colors. They are not the same dress. Green (tropical) and red (paisley) are made of comfy, stretchy material. Bottom material is thick; top material is a little more thin, but still good. They both fit great. I ordered medium. I'm 5'2&#34; and they come to top of my feet; 140lbs- hides the post baby weight well and is figure flattering; sm-med chest and top fits well. Love them! My 2 new favorite things to wear.<br />The yellow (roses) is not even close to the same dress. Made of a sheer, thin, rayon/polyester-like material. Has a zipper up the side; only fit ok (a little snug); not comfortable; completely see-through; not at all what I thought I was ordering. Returned it."
4.0,"This Ldurian ""Mom"" heart bracelet is really cute!  It is stainless steel and seems to be very sturdy.  The chain is about 8 inches long,  just over 8.5 inches long, including the heart charm. Listed at $19.99 at the time of this review, this bracelet is priced right.<br /><br />The bracelet arrived in a sturdy square box, which measures about 3 inches, and has a velvety black insert.  Inside the lid there is a message which states, ""Congratulations on becoming a(n) amazing mother!""  The bracelet was inside a tiny ziplock plastic bag and also inside a nice velvety drawstring bag.  The charm itself was covered with a thick and clingy piece of plastic for protection.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sweet gift for any mom, not just a new one, as the sentiment on the box lid suggests.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my honest and unbiased review, which is based solely on my experience with the product.  I hope that it has been beneficial.  If for any reason my experience with this item changes, I will update this review."
4.0,"The band is exactly what I wanted.  It's like. A boyfriend band, chunky and sturdy.  The only problem I had was taking links out.  It's super tricky especially when the tools kept bending and breaking on me.  I had to take out 4 links total.  I'm a woman and I have skinny wrists.  Otherwise I love this band!"
4.0,Nice fit and very cute.
4.0,Ordered for birthday party. They are cheaply made. Beware the wings have glitter on them. I now have glitter from one end of my house to the other! The girls loved them but because they were pricy and low quality I would not recommend them.
4.0,Decent shirt but runs small. I was hoping for a more loose fit. The pockets on the side make it look really awkward if it's snug. I'd go a size up if I bought another color. Quality was good. No holes.
4.0,Small but I like it.
4.0,"I just received this necklace and it is VERY lovely.  I'm a fairly large person but even I can wrap it around my necklace and have it draping nicely.  The only problem, which I suppose it to be expected, is that the back end of it will twist around and try to go to the front so every few minutes you need to adjust.  Otherwise I love the product,  it's a very simple yet elegant and fun necklace."
4.0,"Granddaughter liked it, haven’t seen her wear it yet."
4.0,"This sweater is cute and lightweight. Not super soft on the inside but it will be fine layered. The colors are bright and fun. If you like sweaters baggy, order up in size."
4.0,"Great quality fabric its soft and breathable. I wear between a 22/24 dress size and the 3XL fits perfectly but I also feel you can get away with wearing a 2XL but it would be a snugger fit. Its long. I'm 5'10 and it covers my feet, which I'm not complaining I wanted a long dress. It shipped fast but was delivered by UPS and required a signature. Not sure why a dress has to be signed for but since I wasnt home I had to go pick it up which was a bit of an inconvenience for me due to my work schedule but I can honestly say the dress was worth the hassle."
4.0,Pictures are worth 1000 words. No issues.
4.0,"Really cute, however they are quite big and don’t fit very snug. I really do love them though and can easily make them smaller."
4.0,Fits well. Mild compression only.
4.0,Everything was great and good quality except for the tablecloth: it was very thin and flimsy and tore very easily.
4.0,Great fit. I am 5’8 and I weigh 160. I bought a size medium.  The only thing is I wish the chest fit a little tighter. Other than that it’s a great/light fabric and it wasn’t too restricting. Theres a dress underneath so that it’s not see through which is lovely.
4.0,Cool! My son loves them.
4.0,Very cute and soft.  Easy opening for a child to put on by themselves.
4.0,Fits good. Will see how it washes.
4.0,Very beautiful earrings! Look a lot more expensive than the are! A little on the heavy side though
4.0,"This little clutch is the epitome of happy and it makes me think of summer dresses and cocktails by the water. My only gripe is that, unlike other KSNY clutches, this one doesn't come with the optional strap (body or wrist) so it is annoying to cary. I'll be looking at buying one of those detacheable wrist straps in a complimentary color to mitigate the problem."
4.0,"It's a very cute suit. Very nice neck line. I'm a 36DDD and it looks cute up there, BUT be aware that the cups may not hold all of you in underneath. It's okay though...still feels fine and looks cute. The torso is a bit long, but still okay. The hip area fits as expected. The fabric is just as you'd expect. The print is very pretty.<br />At 5'4&#34; and 145 lbs, I bought the xxxl but it's a bit large for me.<br />The seller is incredible and happily is sending me the xxl."
4.0,"The watch came very quickly, in one week, significantly before the expected delivery date. To my surprise, it came directly from Hong Kong in a very small plastic wrap. So, the packaging does not look presentable. At the same time the watch was not broken. The colors on the strap match the color and the image on the bezel. The watch itself looks good. The band looks very cheaply made. I was buying it for 12 year old girl and she is happy. For the price it is a very good purchase."
4.0,"I like these because 1. they're pink, and it's hard to find cute compression socks. 2. They compress and do the job. Definitely help with my leg pain. 3. I like that they're super tall and actually go over the thigh.<br /><br />However, I wish the toe spready bits were thicker, like my ""Yoga Toes"" stretcher things. I was hoping these would be a good substitute to those for when I am busy and still need to walk around the house. They're helpful, but not quite as much stretch as I was hoping for. I had a feeling that would happen though, so I'm not terribly disappointed."
4.0,"I don't think the description ""mesh"" is the best way to describe these masks.  And it goes without saying that a mesh mask wouldn't really provide protection anyway. That being said,  these two masks are definitely a lighter fabric than masks I own. These face coverings are made of two layers of very soft, I'm assuming some type of polyester fabric, which offers protection without being bulky. They seem to be a bit easier to breathe out of while still covering the nose and mouth.<br />Please note that the black dots you see on the exterior are just a colored patten and not holes in the fabric. Also, there is no metal nose bridge. <br />I think these masks are made very nice.  They are sewn neatly and have very good elastic ear loops with toggle adjusters.  And because of the lighter fabric, it may make for easier breathing during exercise.  My daughter will use these for socially distanced in-studio yoga classes and gym. The colors are lovely and the quality is very good.  I posted measurements and also this mask next to a typical face mask I own to give you an idea of size. The only negative I've found is that because of the silky smooth material and absence of a nose band,  you really need to tighten the ear loops to prevent the mask from slipping below the nose.  I sincerely hope that the photos,  along with my thoughts,  help you out a bit with your choice.  Thank you. "
4.0,Nothing wrong with product
4.0,"The quality of this product is good, but the garment is not at all what I expected.  I wanted something to wear to Physical Therapy sessions, but this is tight-fitting and the fabric is slinky.  Would be fine as an undershirt."
4.0,"I usually get a size medium in most of my dresses, but after reading the reviews, I decided to get a size small. It fits perfectly. It's not too big and not too tight. I thought that the material would be a shiny silk type material, but it's more of a stretchy material. I love this dress, however the opening is very low cut, so I plan to sew on some buttons or clasps on it. The button slits are also cut high, so if you're very modest, you may want to wear tights underneath. Overall, it's a cute dress. It's more casual than dressy, but with the right accessories, it can be both.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"The material is a little too thin and more casual looking than expected, but it fits really well and looks good (54L). However, out of the package my suit looks a little more on the navy/blue side than gray, so consider this when you are planning to pair it with something. I am happy, though!"
4.0,Great fabric and well made.
4.0,I ordered my correct size but the cups on this bra were too big. Otherwise the bra is very pretty.
4.0,"Thin fabric, Lightweigh, true size not stretch at all"
4.0,I live in Florida and boat all the time.  These are more classy then the plastic sunglasses.  Good buy
4.0,A hit with the bride and groom!
4.0,"Cute, love the color"
4.0,Gave as mother's day gifts at church.  All the participants complimented me on them .  The clasps are inexpensive but very useable.
4.0,These aren't the Capri style but full length.
4.0,"It was a good purchase for the price, but you get what you pay for. The colors are very vibrant and it seems to be good leather. The only problem with it is some of the slots for your cards aren't big enough, and the threads are coming out."
4.0,"This was a fine dress. Definitely not the most expensive and well-made dress I own, but it gets the job done. Best pat - there's pockets! It has survived several wearings and washings. I wash on delicate with all the rest of my clothing and I don't put in the dryer. I hang dry most of my clothing to try to make it last longer. The pockets aren't deep, so I don't really use them for anything important like phone, etc."
4.0,color was perfect for the dress I was matching them to. Just like the picture. A little big even though I ordered the size she wears. All in all I am happy with them.
4.0,Good buy. Good quality. Fit as expected and arrived on time.
4.0,"It fits the watch perfectly just like the original one did, but it feels a tad bit cheaper.  It's still plenty high quality, but feels a small step below the original material."
4.0,The size is just what I was looking for to carry my books in. Worth the price
4.0,"Nice blouse, wish I had gotten the large."
4.0,Very nice bag.  Lots of compartments. The color is red and I like it. The price made it so worth it. Happy with my new bag.
4.0,"I purchased the XL, hoping it would add some length, but it did not. Large would have fit better (less boxy) and would have been the same length.<br />Over all, it's a cute sweater and well made."
4.0,It was cute! I was going to wear it on my trip to Mexico but I ended up returning it because the size wasn’t perfect. I’ll probably order a different size!
4.0,"As other reviews said, very small, but my granddaughter loves it."
4.0,Its very pretty and not too big. The only thing its a little longer than I thought but it still works for me.
4.0,It was a gift but my friend says she likes it but has yet to use it.  But said it looked very nice and durable.
4.0,Very nice and a beautiful reminder. Thank you
4.0,"Comfortable and stays on securely to pants, I wore it with jeans which can be heavy but it kept the pants up."
4.0,"I love these so much, but the waist is a bit tighter than the rest of the fit. Other than that they are my new favorites. The fabric drapes well is super flattering and feels great against my skin. The purple is very dark, darker than the pic, but I like it.  I will warn I am 5'2"" and these are not ""too long"" which I normally experience. So, if you are tall these may be a bit short on you."
4.0,Nice dress. I got a large and is a little big but i figured it will get smaller when I wash it.
4.0,Size normal I sized up and they’re big on me so I could’ve worn my normal size.. cute tho
4.0,The top is cute. If you have a larger chest I recommend sizing up or else your buttons will come undone throughout the day.
4.0,"The images don't show you just how small this bracelet is. I was surprised. But I have to disagree with other reviewers who say it is not made for an adult wrist. The description does say that you need to stretch it a bit initially, to get it over your hand to your wrist. I found that was very easy to do, and after the first time, it now goes on and off very easily. Though at first I wasn't sure I liked that it was so thin (which is also not made clear by the images), now I'm finding that I really like it. The knots are very tiny, but it's not difficult to use it. My fingers find the knots easily. I'm glad I made this purchase. Besides, this is not for appearance, but for praying the Jesus prayer, and submitting one's heart to God in the process, in humility. So I'd just point out that this is perfectly functional for what it's for. A prayer rope is not meant to be a fashion statement for people who want to stand praying on the street corner so other people will see them.  [[ASIN:B00HFV95MG Handmade Christian Orthodox Komboskoini, Prayer Rope Bracelet Black - 5603]]"
4.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SWIMSUIT! I wore it to Vegas for my Bachelorette weekend. I am docking 1 star due to the fact that the strap pops off every once in a while. When I got home, I decided to sew the strap directly to the suit, and it's now perfect! I also got a few compliments on the suit as well!"
4.0,I love this ER set but the post bent the first time I tried to put them on--it's not very strong for the size of the ER.
4.0,"I got this for gardening, and even painting but now that I have it, I don’t really want paint all over it, ha ha. I can’t wear one that goes around my neck like many of them, so this one’s good.  It’s a little tricky to assemble in the back when you have it on but it’s not a big deal. I say go for it!"
4.0,They fit almost perfectly on my glasses and are very darkening
4.0,"Lightweight, adjustable wrist_cuffs. Tuckahoe hood. Fit well and comfortable.  Bought one for me and my mother (green). Usually wear a large but since it's fitted I bought xl. Mom is 125# 5' 1"". I gave 4 stars because the zipper is a little tough."
4.0,I'm not giving it 5 stars because the shipping was very long and because it can be a bit tricky to get on just right. But a good bow tie for people who want to learn.
4.0,"I got a size larger than I am, an XL, and it fits perfect. I got the blue, red, and grey all<br />perfect, but the grey fits kinda weird and feels different from the others. Love the hoodies tho! Would recommend."
4.0,"I like it. Only had problems with the zipper pulls coming off easily, but I am rough on purses"
4.0,Got as a temporary wedding band. Looks nice and didn't turn my finger green! I've worn it a good bit and it seems like it's going to be very durable so far!
4.0,Nice item. Warm and well built. With that said i would not use this in a stand. It is really loud and the zippers are metal and make a lot of noise. Better for ground hunting. Overall very nice
4.0,"Very nice.  Wish the chain had been a bit longer, but great item and good price."
4.0,"Nice necklace, I love that you can adjust the size of the necklace."
4.0,"Very good, considering the price"
4.0,These shoes are very nice looking and mostly comfortable but sometimes my feet get a little sore by the end of the day when I wear these.
4.0,"Usually wear a 1X,got a 2X and it fits nicely, not too tight.  The 2X tag says size 44.  The fabric is like an old fashioned slip. It does not cling to body and clothing worn over it does not cling to camisole.  Perfect length for me at 5'3&#34;.  It does have darts which I usually don't like but it does make the camisole more fitted and darts are not visible even under very sheer blouse.  Overall pretty good and hard to find item."
4.0,"good product, looks good, very light.  The rubber nose pads seem to come off somewhat easily, yet overall, I like the glasses."
4.0,It fits well  not very substantial  would have been better if felt was a bit thicker.  The shape is good.
4.0,Christmas gift for my mom she loves it
4.0,the plated part is a little sad. it started to chip as soon as i screwed off the top ball. you cant really see it while wearing it so its not really a big deal. its pretty cute on.
4.0,They fit really good and comfortable
4.0,"Though this is not down filled, it does provide some warmth with very little weight.<br />I liked the zippered pockets and the two inner pockets you can use for a cell phone.<br /><br />I would have vastly preferred the design if it didn’t have an elastic band at the bottom of the jacket. This may help retain heat, but it detracts from the potential attractiveness of the jacket.<br />Also, the model must be quite tall, as I am 5’2” and it falls to the top of my thigh.<br />Lastly, I was not fond of the white writing and blacked it out with a Sharpie permanent marker."
4.0,"The fit was just a bit smaller than preferred, but think the next size would have been too lose, and didn't have time to exchange it.  so I kept it.  Other than that it was very nice."
4.0,I love this dress for Halloween. It is made very well. My only complaint is that I ordered a size bigger because I wanted it to be baggie but it fits a little snug. The shipping was very fast.
4.0,Wish the logo was stitched into it but all in all great hat! love the washed faded look!
4.0,"These are extremely comfortable and well made. They do not propel me forward and make me fall on my face as some have suggested. If that were the case, I would be the first to go down since I am very unstable to begin with. I have a hard time finding shoes that work for me. These were a lucky find as far as I'm concerned."
4.0,"It's a cute design, I just think it would be better if there was some kind of clasp so it would be a little easier to put on and take off for those of us with bigger heads lol!"
4.0,I'm sure my grandson will like these.
4.0,A few mm short from advertised but work fair for me. Quality is good!
4.0,"Masks fit well and are comfortable. Thicker than expected (which was great) but still easy to wear. For the price, this was a great mask and filter set. I rated one star less due to the fact that one mask came ripped in the front - which wouldn’t be a big deal - but it’s pretty obvious once the mask is worn."
4.0,They’re not see through and they’re comfy. They’re definitely shorter than I thought they would be. And for me the belly part wasn’t compression enough. But no way I could Size down.
4.0,"Great quality and the designs are greatly noticeable. This is a one size fits many product, so it's a bit tight but it's still great. (I'm 175lbs and 5'3)."
4.0,Love these pajamas. Got the medium. Just wish the top was more slouchy.
4.0,Good I guess
4.0,Runs small other than that I loved it . Will gift it to someone.
4.0,"The only thing is the waist is a bit high, but works with a wide elastic belt"
4.0,"Watch is thin and magnetic mesh band is pretty cool. However, band is short in length and does not go over my wrist. I have to pull it out on one side and put the watch on like a bracelet.<br />It should be marketed solely as a lady’s watch."
4.0,"The crown is sufficiently low, the bill of good length and the fabric/cut is excellent -- just a little too big (I wear a Size 7 fitted)."
4.0,Looked stunning for a friends wedding. I had to get the dress hemmed. I am 5’5 and it was too king with heels for me. It’s lightweight and feels like a swimsuit
4.0,"Good looking bracelet, with some shiny parts. You'd better have thin wrists, though. The price is certainly right."
4.0,The chain for the necklace could be longer.
4.0,"The shirt was great, in good condition, ran a little small but still cute. The only reason this is 4 stars is because it was bought as a birthday gift, we have Prime so we expected it to be here within 2 days. However, because it was lost in the mail and sent to Ohio instead of Illinois, we got it 4 days late."
4.0,Fits perfect. Great material and beautiful design
4.0,"Very cute and fun.  Somewhat disappointed with the tail which looked sad and bedraggled.  But, otherwise satisfied."
4.0,"I do love this bracelet. I do yoga daily, so of course this piece really spoke to me when I saw it. It's very attractive and I like that the snaps are adjustable. I've gotten a few compliments on it as well. That said, I think the bracelet is a little overpriced. The brass colored plate (not sure if it is actually brass or some other metal) is thinner than it appears in the picture, as are the leather straps. It's still sturdy and something I can wear all the time, but I think a fairer price for the material is about twenty bucks.<br />In a nutshell, I was vaguely disappointed by the light weight of it when I received it, but it's aesthetic quality outweighed my disappointment. There was no way I was returning it once I put in on."
4.0,"I love the feel.  However, the top doesn't fit. The arms are too long I can deal with that but the body is too small. I will keep them and wear under a bigger top. I love the color."
4.0,I'm 5'5 and about 110 pounds. I got a large wanting it to be loose and not so short (because the photos make it look short) but it does run small. it's too short to wear waist jeans with so i wear my high waisted ones with it.<br /><br />It came in a package and the picture was pretty wrinkly but the fabric on the inside is really soft.
4.0,"This is the best pill case ever.  So glad they are now available from Amazon.  My family has used this case for about 5 years now.  It's great to carry in your purse, pocket and for traveling.<br />We all love them."
4.0,"These help a lot if you don't want to wear long sleeves, they are pretty comfortable.  My husband really likes them (he's the one that wears them).  I just don't like that when you wash them they will sometimes get real loose on the top edge, it doesn't happen to all of them but 1 our 3 will get like that.  Other than that we really like them."
4.0,"It's good but a little tight, causes ear pressure when wear for a long trip.<br />I think my head is too wide!"
4.0,Great material and badge material but larger than the usual L from Adidas
4.0,Exactly what I wanted. Great quality
4.0,Nice but was too small for me. Im like dd-ddd and i oder the d cup bc of other reviews
4.0,This chain is just as beautiful as the description says it was! I would definitely shop at this merchant again!
4.0,Stylish and light. Money's worth.
4.0,"Great shoes for a good price. Material could be a little thicker but other than that, it's great."
4.0,"It's obvious that this isn't an expensive or high quality necklace, but it still looks nice. It's simple, but lovely, and works well with a large variety of outfits. I didn't find it irritating on the back of my neck like some necklaces I've tried. It's also adjustable, which is perfect for coordinating with various necklines. It's not fancy, but I really like it."
4.0,Great price for what you get. They are not the highest quality of jewelry but you get what you pay for.
4.0,"For the price, I was very satisfied with this costume. It's pretty comfortable. It's cute. It was at the right price point. It was perfect for a last minute Halloween costume. That said, it is (as expected) pretty cheaply made. The zipper broke within seconds of trying it on, and the fuzz fell off all night. Basically, as long as you're expecting an inexpensive costime to wear once - it will be great!"
4.0,Lovely and just what I wanted but it was bent during shipping so that the stick pin is no longer perfectly straight and so it’s not giftable now.
4.0,Looks nice. Leather is stiff but it may soften with wear. The bund under the watch is asymmetrical larger on right side to go under watch crown(s).
4.0,Kindly small material is just ok
4.0,A bit uncomfortable at the front. Maybe after wearing them they will stretch. I do love them
4.0,"For $26.00 (the cost of these sunglasses as of this review) I'd expect a solid case and not a cloth bag.  Even a cheap solid case would have been fine.  That said, these sunglasses do filter out a lot of glaring rays but honestly, the shape of them leaves something to be desired.  If you want that retro 50's look then these would be a great choice.  They fit well on my narrow face and are comfortable, but these won't be my first choice when going outside."
4.0,hoping with summer coming it may fit better once I shed my winter layer .. IM excited to see how it will look when I Go out with friends
4.0,"These pair of earring looks really good, they are at a good price, the only bad part about them is the way they package them because the back part of it arrives bent, but you can bend it back"
4.0,I have bought these a few times.  Love the quality but these are so long.
4.0,"I like it, it's slightly tight even though I sent in my measurement but it's ok."
4.0,"After reading other reviews I feel like I totally lucked up! This jumpsuit fit me wonderfully.  I ordered a 3xl but realized today while taking it off that the tag says 4xl. Im 5/4, around 200lbs.  I own several similar style jumpsuits and typically buy 3xl just as with this jumpsuit. Not sure how or why the size mix up occurred but it worked in my favor. I'm satisfied with the fit of the 4xl. I wore it today for the first time and got lots of compliments. Its totally comfortable and fits baggy but not like a sack. The ties in the back are only just long enough to tie and don't hang like in the picture, mot a major issue for me. And length is perfectly to the sole of my shoes. I'm a little leery now about shrinkage when I wash so I will be sure to wash in cold water. I wouldn't order again out of fear of getting one the ill fitted jumpsuits mentioned in other reviews."
4.0,Material was just like a tshirt
4.0,Shirt fits better than expected. So good we bought another
4.0,"This is a quality shirt, and I bought two (green and navy) to use as PJ tops with Eddie Bauer flannel bottoms. Because it's designed as a cold-weather layer, it is a bit snug. I like it that way; your mileage my vary. My only nit: the colors are darker than shown in the photos, so I subtracted one star. Sure, a non-optimal color match with PJ bottoms is not a crisis, but, hey..."
4.0,Socks were comfy and stretched to fit those with larger feet.
4.0,"Material isn't the best , but it is cute on and true to size"
4.0,Runs a little big but great otherwise. Hard to button
4.0,Very nice and light weight. Suits for all your ethnic wear. I love the design. And it was delivered perfectly in a box tat doesn’t damage the jewelry.
4.0,NICE ACCENT
4.0,my daughter is very pleased with this gift.  the clasp could be better though.
4.0,"I do like them, they just are baggy in the private area, makes it all look awkward but other than that, they fit how i expected but definitely a different fabric from what i pictured.  only wore them yesterday so I’ll update after the first wash. 👍🏻😊"
4.0,A couple of the pieces of jewelry were duplicates but the jewelry was in good condition and fits the way it should. Cute designs.  Received it on time
4.0,"The hat fits good around the circumference of my head, speakers pretty good placement related to ears. It is warm for winter use. I like a beanie fitting hat vice floppy top. Floppy is annoying to me.  If it was a Riley type top ok, but this one is a tweener, not a Beanie nor a Riley. Reminds me of a vagina hat only blue. Bluetooth seems good has not dropped signal once it is synced to device. Looking for someone who can modify for me, which is possible."
4.0,They give great support
4.0,"Quality construction,  but about 2 sizes too small. Gave it to my daughter. She liked it."
4.0,I completely agree with the smell complaint. The worst. Otherwise great.
4.0,like it but to small lX is small
4.0,nice thin and classic belt.
4.0,Bought these for my husband.<br />His legs swell and are large.<br />These fit well and are comfortable.
4.0,"I love the suit!  However, my bottom is bigger than my top, so the top is a little loose so I ordered another suit one size smaller - incentive to fit into the bottoms! :)"
4.0,Great replacement bamd.
4.0,They were a bit hard to get used to as my other shoes are so crappy and have no arch support - but my feet love them and once I got used to them so didn't I.  :)
4.0,"These are comfortable, although thin. They definitely fit more like tights than leggings. I like them though."
4.0,This is a very cute necklace. The chain is cheap but the pendant itself is nice. I also ordered matching earrings but they haven't arrived yet.
4.0,"Great blouse! Wish I wouldn't have listened to the reviews, because I purchased 2 size larger and its too big but it works with a tank underneath!"
4.0,"I loved the quality of the shirts but didn’t realize they were “compression” so they were too tight and too fitted. So, I returned them and ordered the next size up. If you do not want a really tight fit, order your next size up."
4.0,So cute and comfortable. I was expecting it to be a way cheaper material because it was so inexpensive. It’s soooooo stretchy. I got it in black and brown in a small and I love it. Not sheer at all i dont know how the white would be though.
4.0,"Very warm for the price, be careful with the upper lace eyelets though, plastic."
4.0,I have 2 pairs of these pants that I got from Costco and love the way they fit but they don't carry them anymore. I was excited to find these on Amazon.  Trouble was the width of the legs wasn't the same. I should have ordered the slims instead. They are great pants though. I'm short so these pants hit me right above my ankles instead of higher up that the picture shows.
4.0,"It works.  However, my cards are sticking in the pockets.  After a few uses I noticed there is a tacky glue like substance on my card.  Tried scraping it off with my thumb nail, no luck.  I am kind of worried it will have an affect on my next transaction.  The flamingo is not as vivid as it is in the pictures. I am hoping the flamingo doesn't disappear all together after a few uses."
4.0,it is a little clingy
4.0,"Beautiful but if you have bigger wrists I wouldn't suggest to get this, ita pretty small."
4.0,"They are pretty, not too hard to put into my ear (I use them as tragus earrings). They are pretty tiny, which I like, but some people may not. I love the flat backing instead of the ball. Shipped quickly."
4.0,The earrings are beautiful especially for the cost. The only reason I didn’t give them a five is that the silver centers look more like white enamel than silver.
4.0,I wish the legs weren’t so wide. I would have liked them tighter.
4.0,This is exactly like the photo. Very nice casual dress.
4.0,"Love this dress!! Love the material, the fit, the length and so on. It was perfect. The only problem was the order. The first time I ordered it, despite how perfect it was the dress didn't have the belt. I was tempted to just keep it, but even though I loved the dress so much it was definitely lacking the belt and that became a deal breaker for me. I did take the risk after returning it to reorder the dress since I had prime in hopes that they wouldn't forget the belt. I'm glad I did. It was so worth it. I love this dress. It's perfect for any occasion. I wanted to give it 5 stars but since I had to deal with the ordering process I couldn't. So I say if you have amazon prime it is definitely worth the risk. Free return shipping. Otherwise I would of been bummed out with a nearly perfect dress"
4.0,I wear a 38DD so I went up on size and it’s a bit snug. I love the cool material and the color. Perfectly light weight for a summer dress.
4.0,Love this scarf. Very smooth and soft. keeps warm. Lengthy and no itchy feeling.
4.0,The product is what it says. Love my pendulum. It does look cheaply made.
4.0,This suit is absolutely beautiful. So Hot only problem is the center clasp that holds it together is week. Hopefully seller will send me a new top but if not my hubby can fix anything. He loves this bikini it's absolutely beautiful. Got it in 3 colors.
4.0,Great dress. Would like better if it had a straighter line rather than Aline.
4.0,I ordered a medium for my 18 year old and it fits my 11 year old. It's not true to size.
4.0,"I always order size large in Amazon clothing no matter the brand. This top did fit, but was a little more fitting than I hoped. If you want a loose fit, size up."
4.0,This nice shorts.I like this for my daughter they fits perfectly not too short are wide around the legs. She play in them comfortably.
4.0,"Beautiful shiny metal, nice lettering.  A little pinchy on the wrist taking it on and off."
4.0,"Pretty, more for a child?"
4.0,This dress is super cute and comfy but a little bit long on me and I am 5'7&#34;. I love it though!
4.0,"The quality of this cardigan is nice, it's a little shorter than expected (hits at the belly button - I'm only 5'6.5"" and my torso is not that long....) and the XL fits like an XXL on me."
4.0,"So I had seen one that looked just like the picture on my friend who bought it at Abercrombie. This one is visually not as high qualify. Fleece look is looser and quilting at the top is crinkly. That said, it fits nicely and is warm. Good for casual wear."
4.0,This dress is super soft and the pockets are a bonus. The dress is a little thin but still comfortable. I wish I would have bought more than one
4.0,"Bought this to replace the thick rubber band my fit watch came with but it didn't actually lock into the watch. Either I was incorrect in the size I purchased, or it just wasn't compatible. I would have tried to buy it in a different size but it was unavailable after I returned the original."
4.0,Short torso. Large fit more like a medium or small.
4.0,I believed I was buying a Chan Luu bracelet but it appears to be a knock off.  The product is nice enough but time will tell if it is a durable as the original.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the style and quality of this sweater for the price. I normally wear an XL but ordered an XXL based on some other reviews. However, that was way too big for me and I returned for an XL, which fits perfectly. (Actually, I replaced it with two XLs in different colors!) The style is quite pretty with the stitching detail and kind of a peplum in the back. It a somewhat loose knit that allows the color of the garment you're wearing underneath to show through. Very nice."
4.0,"Warmer than similar gloves I’ve tried. Fit is a little big, but I’m ok with that. Good value overall"
4.0,"Super cute and good quality for the price. Really really small though, my phone doesnt fit inside it haha. Will hold keys and a compact or lipstick, no wallet."
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 148lbs, and 34DD and bought this in a Large. It fits well and the fabric is soft. It's a cute, comfy, casual top."
4.0,I originally purchased a large but it was tight so I returned and purchased the XL.  The XL fits much better although I still needed to put on a camisole because the top does allow for a lot of breast exposure.  The material is comfortable and I love how the back of the shirt flow like a cape when I walk.  Everyone who has seen me in this top loves it.  I also bought it in black and white and red and white.
4.0,Looks like real gold. Recommend it. Also i shower in it and now problems. The only issue is that sometimes the evil eyes fall of the other chain. I just connect them back and use a tool to make the space smaller.
4.0,"Good inexpensive glasses. Only complaint is that one of the stones had fallen off the front, was like that when I opened them up. For the price, good product overall."
4.0,I loved the price $7.99 at time purchased.  Just what I needed.<br /><br />I thought they would be completely hard cases. Which they mostly are but there is some squishyness. Where I was expecting complete rigidness. There is some flexion in these cases.<br /><br />But for the price they work for me needs
4.0,"Nice pajama set. Soft fabric.  Picture doesn't do justice to color.  Brighter hue of pink.  Sizing is right, but I would expect it might shrink a little because of material."
4.0,"I ordered this sweater  after a trip when I was really cold on an airplane.  I needed an attractive but warm sweater.  I would have like a plain black sweater and this one has a white thread in the weave.  But it fits, is comfortable and keeps me warm."
4.0,It's beautiful but broke after wearing for about 100 times
4.0,Fit was great and delivery was quick
4.0,"I paid attention to the reviews about how it runs small, so I ordered an XL. Usually I am a medium.<br /><br />Having said that, I love the fit. It's loose but still cut in a flattering way. It's soft but not clingy. It is a really dark black and doesn't seem like it'll fade easily"
4.0,"I've included photos, so you all can see the true colors. Since this eyeglass frame has all transparent colors, your skin color and the lighting of your surroundings will impact the appearance of the frame colors. The burgundy can appear brown with a hint of red. The grey will also vary in color. If you look better in something other than black eyeglass frames, the color will probably work for you."
4.0,looks like the picture. I like the items.
4.0,"The picture and color were perfect but the material was thinner than I expected. However it fit great, so I happy with it."
4.0,I love the bracelet.  Was bought for my daughter upon the adoption of her 2nd child.  It is very big and can slip off.  Should be made a bit smaller.
4.0,"I really love these sweat pants.  Material is smooth and soft. You don’t have to be built like the model. But, these are cut for athletic guys.  I’m 6’ 210 and active and a large was fine, though I could easily gone up a size up for looser fit.  I love the pants.  I have other active wear from this line and they are great!"
4.0,"The actual earring is very pretty and just the right size. However, it sits right at your ear and doesn’t “dangle” very well. I will be changing the part that goes in my ear."
4.0,"Worked great, only issue I had was with the occasional falling out in my sleep"
4.0,Queda cómodo y es buena tela
4.0,This is very cozy and cute but it rolls up on me. I assume that means I got the wrong size but I got my normal size.
4.0,"Very comfortable and cute dress, i'll have to have it hemmed because its too long since I'm only 5'2&#34; but i like the fabric and style. Normally I wear a size 8 dress so i ordered the medium and fits perfectly!"
4.0,Love them at first they fit fine but after a few washes and drying the shrink a bit. I would buy more though they are comfortable to wear
4.0,Short on the calf.
4.0,Great for the price! I wear a large and ordered xxl it's fits me as a normal kimono would. I recommend ordering 2 sizes up.
4.0,Cute shirt. Nice quality but it was slightly wide through the middle. I was hoping for more fitted. Not a  disappointing purchase though
4.0,"It's runs a size small.  I've purchased dresses from this line before and never had a problem.  Otherwise, cute dress but be forewarned, it is very sheer."
4.0,"This bracelet contains 22 small skull beads made from (I think) what they call white brass, which contains more zinc than normal yellow brass.  It has a satisfying weight on the wrist, and the individual beads are a good bit smaller than many of the skull beads you see in Tibetan jewelry.  This bracelet is strung on thin, black waxed cord with sliding ""Chinese"" knots so you can take it on and off and adjust the size. The cords that slide through the knot are tipped with small black plastic beads which then dangle down. It's a bit big for me, but I like it regardless."
4.0,"I ordered the small size and it was too small. I got it replaced with a medium and it was too large. The quality of the shirt is otherwise good and the color and design are as depicted. Also, the vendor was prompt in processing the returns and replacement. Will order again if I find the right fit."
4.0,Slightly see through...
4.0,Pretty blouse - unfortunately runs very small.
4.0,Comfortable and functional.  These socks fit as expected.  The toe seam stays in place and didn’t irritate me by sliding around.  They kept my feet dry and protected on a recent mile and a half hike up the side of a mountain.
4.0,Seems to run large in bust
4.0,Fit true to size.  Super comfy.  The fabric is a little on the thin side so won’t be wearing them outside the house.
4.0,"Arrived on time and packaged well. Good product, kids used them in their games"
4.0,Not the sexiest looking panties but they’re comfortable and soft
4.0,I like this watch mostly got it because I believe in the 2nd Amendment.
4.0,"I dislike on my waist area, everything is fit but my belly is showing or seeing I am bloated even I’m normal but I guess my belly is bigger . But thank you.."
4.0,Great for my swelling. Ankles and feet don’t swell when I wear these. Also feel good when working out at gym. Keeps my veins from stinging all day.
4.0,"Love the dress, not the color. I ordered a size up after reading the reviews and the size was perfect - so size up!  However, I thought that this would be a &#34;Kelly&#34; Green by looking at the pic... it was not!  It was the most awful, dreaded cross between an olive green and an forest green that you could imagine. I would typically wear a cardigan with this and that was my plan, but unfortunately I couldn't find a color that would go well with this hideous green, so I returned it.  It is a really cute little dress and I would purchase it again, but not in that color!"
4.0,"Really flattering style and color. I had my guy wear a beautiful jewel tone dark blue shirt and the looked amazing together.<br />Very very very stretchy fabric. The zipper was so difficult to zip, I had to zip it up and then put it on, which is a bit of a testament to how stretchy the fabric is.<br />It's not lined but the fabric is soft and not see-through at all."
4.0,Very nice. I bought it even though reviews downed the product. So far [3 days] it takes time well and isn't too cheaply made. The problem is resetting the time is a*s-backards action and the part where you wind can pop out...
4.0,"Good supportive fit. There could be just a bit more compression, but adequate."
4.0,Fits a little loose. Most size 12 shoes fit snug. I wear everyday use around the house.
4.0,"The only thing I didn't like was it seemed like it atracted alot more dirt then would be normal. My boyfriend got a black and white one and his didn't get dirty at all? Otheriwse I love the fit, its super soft and warm and the pocket is awesome ;)"
4.0,Really should have something underneath for modesty
4.0,"It's exactly what it looks like and comfortable. My wrist is a bit small so it's not a perfect fit, but it looks nice!"
4.0,Perfect sun-glass with the best price!
4.0,Very nice looking and comfortable shoe.
4.0,"Like the buttons to adjust elastic sides and also like that it has a wire over the nose; however, this wire is a bit large."
4.0,"What a find, and just in time for Christmas. Every man should have a funny Christmas tie to wear at least once during the Christmas season. This for sure fits that bill."
4.0,A very nice looking watch. Like that it’s water proof too!
4.0,It came on time and looks so cute!
4.0,"I bought these as a gift, so I've never actually worn them, but I haven't heard any complaints."
4.0,I followed the guidelines and it was too big. It is a pretty color and looks like it’s decent quality. It was a cool material but also very sheer fabric. I gave it away as a gift to a friend and haven’t heard anything back....
4.0,Soft fits well can be worn with jeans or straight legs or starch paints. Very happy with product over all not happy with how long it took to receive.
4.0,Super cute for the price. fits comfortably and will be great during any USA holiday :)
4.0,"Super annoying, my son loves it!"
4.0,Got this for my little brother as a Christmas gift and he appears to love it. Not really my style but I can definitely say the teens love it.
4.0,Not as soft as I would have liked. Nice fi though. Ankle height was just right
4.0,Nice everyday shirt!
4.0,i liked the make of the dress and that it had pockets
4.0,I really like the soft cotton almost rayon feel of this tshirt. The scoop neck is great not to low and I like how the sleeves are loose as well as the entire tshirt it lays really nice it is not a stiff cotton. Fit runs spot on for me. I would not put in dryer because the heat made the bear all wonky.
4.0,OK Stuff
4.0,"This is really a lovely dress, I just think the style/size doesn't fit my body type well. The bust area is a little awkward, and for me not flattering. I'm 5'8"" and usually wear a size 14-16. I bought this dress in a size XXL and it was too large of a fit overall. My body type is a smaller chest, narrower waist, curvy tummy and hips. I'm kind of a spoonish pear, I guess, but for quizzes that have a Spoon, that's what I get. ;-)<br />I also think the bust color is inaccurately depicted for this specific dress, as it's darker than the white/ivory pictured in the photos. I've included a couple of pics of my own.<br />The quality seems nice and I'd consider buying it in a smaller size, however right now this one is out of stock."
4.0,Very cozy. Not as dark as I had hoped but I still love it
4.0,I bought this to wear under scrubs in the winter months. It fit perfectly and served the intended purpose. I really enjoyed it.
4.0,"Okay dress for the price, not great quality-"
4.0,"I should've ordered a size bigger, I went with Large, they're pretty tight around the waist. There really is no elastic or stretch in the waistline. I'm sure losing a couple pounds will get them to fit better, going to put these in my skinny pile."
4.0,"Loved the look, but the fit in the arms was a bit tight. Overall, it's a nice shirt."
4.0,Excellent style however misspelled wording on shirt.
4.0,"The fabric is more see through than I expected, however, so cute and super light! I have added this to my workout collection! Great product for the price! The color is adorable!"
4.0,Material is okay
4.0,"Cute dress but a little short. I am 5 foot 8&#34; and this was just a little short but the material is nice, thick and stretchy!"
4.0,"Adorable dress.  Wear a petticoat with it for that “WOW” effect.  I ordered a size up and it was still tight across the chest.  Kind of flattens you out rather than accentuating your curves in the chest area.  For reference, I’m usually a 18w and ordered 3xl.  Still love the dress!  The sunflowers are adorable and make you want to twirl."
4.0,I like the style but the quality of sewing is not what I had hoped. The buttons and buttonholes do not line up exactly.
4.0,"Nice look, could be a little more stretchy and not quite as long."
4.0,"I loove this robe. I bought it for my boyfriend and he is 6'. I thought this was a nice length, but, I'm 5'2"". On me, the sleeves are long. Overall, we love the 90s vibe, that it's lightweight, and it's very soft.  Would buy again"
4.0,My wife likes this holder as she does not have to have assistance to repair and install her jewelry. works well
4.0,This sweater is nice. I ordered an X-Large because I wanted a big sweater to wear with leggings.  It isn’t as big as I thought it would be for an X-Large.  I am 5’8 1/2” & 145 pounds.  The fit & pattern together just weren’t for me.
4.0,"Expensive little toy, but well loved by my grandaughter.<br />Exciting ""out of this world"" delivery"
4.0,"A lot thinner than i was expecting.  It's about the thickness of two quarters pushed together.  Not a bad thing, but from the pictures I had thought it would be a little wider.  Overall it's great.  It is a little delicate so I am cautious when taking it on and off so as not to tear it.  It has held up wonderfully and has maintained it's original color despite all the messes I've put it through."
4.0,"I received this bag in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />PROS<br />*Thick canvas outer fabric that seems color accurate to the pictures.<br />*Leather of decent thickness for pockets and accents.<br />*Leather that holds the D rings for the shoulder strap is extra thick and riveted in place.<br />*7 pockets, two of which are zippered inside the bag. The two outer ones have magnetic clasps.<br /><br />CONS<br />*After three days airing out, it STILL stinks heavily like chemical of some sort. It is slightly nauseating. (See updated note at bottom)<br />*No pad for the shoulder strap.<br />*The clasps on the shoulder strap are very tight and do not rotate well<br />*I have no idea what the lather loop on the front of the bag is for. I can only assume it's for holding the handles down like shown in my photograph. Nothing else makes any sense and the seller photos don't show it in use. The button is a leather disk, also.<br /><br />In Summary,<br /><br />This bag is OK for the price, but you might have to take measures to remove the smell from it. I'm going to try putting it in an airtight plastic bag with a box of baking soda or something. If I remember to do so, I will update here with how long it takes to get the smell out, or if it comes out at all. The other reviewers who seem to have paid for their bags didn't mention anything about a smell, so maybe I just got unlucky?<br /><br />Update: The smell came out after about 5-7 days, and it would have come out faster if it hadn't been raining so much here and could have set it outside. I didn't have to use anything on it to get the smell out. I gave one star back on my review since the smell was not permanant."
4.0,"It arrived a couple days early, which probably means nothing, but it did. It comes in a black leatherette box. Yes I said 'leatherette.' But grained like nice leatherette. So far so good. The lid of the box is clamshell sprung and when I opened it, it didn't break, it actually opened. The watch was teenier than I expected but it's for a teeny woman, so again, so far so good. But now comes the sad stuff: 1) the watch embraces a suedey pillow, which is common in nicely-packaged watches but the colour is icky, it's beige like some kind of skin-graft material from outer space, which is not great when it's a gift; 2) the strap is not leather as advertised but for this price no one should be surprised; 3) the pink in the photo on Amazon is candy-floss pink but in reality it's more a coral pink, a somewhat unhealthy coral pink but there's a lot of unhealthy coral in the world nowadays; 4) the case in the photo is a delicately pale yellow gold but in reality it's more a gold gold, a little less heavenly than hoped for; 5) there's a sapphire on the crown like they stick on Cartiers but it's prob'ly just glass or even acrylic, and it's kind of pale and blue-greeny, which a good sapphire should not be. And then, oh my gahd, the second hand isn't moving! They sent me a dud! But, unusually, I had the presence of mind to push on the crown. It went down in and the second hand started to track. Oh I was so happy! Happy because apart from 1), 2), 3), 4) and 5), everything's fine!"
4.0,Happy gifted it yet but it looks great
4.0,"I ordered a set of these from the CareRing website (careringcover.com). My ring size is 4.5 but I 'sized up' as recommended for a stone over 1-carat and ordered them in the medium size. The material is very pliable so I'm not sure how other reviewers had trouble getting them on. I can see how these would be great if you had a much flatter setting than I have (I have a traditional solitaire engagement ring). For my ring, there is not quite enough room for the stone which means that it pulls upward on the band and leaves gaps around my fingers so it's definitely not watertight for me. Again though, if I had a flatter setting and ordered the small, it would have totally worked. I'd exchange them for the small but my stone definitely wouldn't fit. If you have a smaller stone with a flatter setting, these things would be fantastic. I'm super bummed that they won't work for my ring.<br /><br />One more quick note...the sizes ARE true to ring size. I read a lot of reviews where people had a ring size similar to mine and they said the medium was too tight. Unless your ring is the wrong size for your finger, that isn't possible."
4.0,Gloria Vanderbilt clothes are nice
4.0,"Fit as expected, nice dress I like it."
4.0,Love the design and material.. does fit small around the mid section
4.0,I loved the print.  It was a little snug for my liking.
4.0,"Awkward fit for a spoon body type. If you know, you know. Very unflattering."
4.0,It's great for cold weather
4.0,Very nicely made sadly it looked to larger on my wrist.
4.0,"Super cozy! Love the feel and color. The zipper is a little sharp but otherwise I love it. The only odd thing is that there was a piece of crinkly plastic sewn into the lining (between the two layers, so i can’t remove it). It makes noise and it seems like maybe someone accidentally sewed a candy wrapper into there. It’s annoying, but probably a one off mistake."
4.0,Mom loves these loungers - thank you
4.0,These shorts are great but fit a size larger. I typically wear a large so next time I’ll be ordering a medium. Fits my iphone 8plus
4.0,Turns color.  Cooper look fading
4.0,I wasn't expecting the fabric to be all stretchy. It did fit well & sizing was accurate however it clung to all my lumps & bulges. Otherwise I would definitely recommend them & I could see myself shopping with them in the future.
4.0,Dial n thickness and strap was meeting my expectations
4.0,Very nice jacket purchased at a very reasonable price. Recommend.
4.0,The first dress I ordered was a bit tight around the breast area. I take it this dress was made for ladies who are not well endowed. I got the largest size and it fit pretty good. I recommend ladies who are well endowed get one size larger than you  normally wear.
4.0,Nice sweat top. Will buy again
4.0,"Lets get right into it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Shiny!<br />- Looks pretty cute and stylish.<br />- Moderately comfortable.<br />- Has a thick sole so when its raining outside your little one's feet will be safe from dampness.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Looks a little untidy, as shown in the picture, the top part looks a bit unfinished and frayed. Will probably get worse over time.<br />- Not the most comfiest. Don't think I would have my daughter wear these all day long. Maybe a couple hours at a time is okay.<br />- On the heavier side, my daughter complains that its hard for her to run in them because they are heavy."
4.0,It is simple to use not like other types of clasps that are hard to open and close and it is pretty and elegant.
4.0,"I bought this in 2014 due to wanting a regular necklace, but a non-leather cruelty free black necklace.  I also needed something sturdy enough to add 4 special lockets.  These lockets are special, as they contain ashes from the precious furbabies I have lost over the years.  Knowing I might be adding to the necklace in the future, I really needed something durable.  I have worn this necklace non-stop, literally every day and night for the over 5 years.  Am very thankful I was able to find this necklace and one that has held up for so long.  I think one side of the clasp gave way about 1 year or so, but hubby superglued it for me and that worked.  But finally broke yesterday and not repairable, so I will be purchasing another one.  Also really love the fact this is not made in China!  I did not buy due to the health benefits, but can definitely say, as an avid crossfitter and swimmer at 50 years old with a family history of severe osteoporosis, I do believe this has helped in my not having joint issues, multiple injuries as one would have thought, given my exercise routine.  So added benefit for me."
4.0,ok but tying string could be better
4.0,There is a part of the top material that flips up when wearing it. Kinda big. Definitely not tight. I like it
4.0,"Pretty standard for a PB jersey. Light, comfy, a little stretchy to move with you. But unlike the rest of P.E's gear you want to size this one down instead of up. I wear a Large shirt in just about any variety of clothing. I bought this in a large. The arms are the right length, but I could fit two of me in the body of the jersey, even with my padded compression shirt underneath. And that padded compression shirt is also P.E. and an XL and fits tight...so yeah...sizing inconsistency."
4.0,"Very comfortable and attractive.  I had compliments on this item the first day I wore it.  Easy wash, and wrinkle free."
4.0,I like the dress but not the material other than that it fits nice
4.0,bought for my daughter and she loved it
4.0,Super cute but have to size down. Based on reviews I ordered a 2x (160 lbs/5 ft 3in and normally wear a 10-12) but they were big everywhere. Well constructed and functional drawstring.
4.0,"These could be softer but I use them faithfully without complaint. Do not expect Victoria Secret V-string quality. You get what you pay for. With that being said, I'll also say i'd gladly order these again. Give them a trry!"
4.0,"Very soft, fit great. The sleeves are a little long but manageable."
4.0,"So I bought these with skepticism that they probably would fit. My waist is 37” and 45” hips. I also have a long torso so a lot of the time when something is supposed to be high waisted, the sit below my waist and give me a camel toe... I was pleasantly surprised that these fit how I would want high waisted pants to fit. They are just a little bit snug on the waist but I’m am “planning” on getting fitter so hopefully they will fit better soon. With the stretch though, they weren’t overly tight.<br />The fabric feels nice, light enough for a south Texas fall. A button did pop off but only because the baby carrier I was wearing caught it; it’s easy enough to sew back one."
4.0,I like the color and the details of this ankle brazalete it’s so beautiful and elegant.
4.0,"Got a 2X, I'm 5'6&#34; and 270lbs...quite long on me and a little big, but is still super cute"
4.0,"Cute, fits well.  Too low cut for my liking so I need to figure out how to pin or sew it together  at chest so indont pop out of the dress.  Bought for a summer wedding  and trip to Mexico.  Perfect length, I am 5'6"".  Fabric not my favorite,  kind of polyester shiny ish but the print is cute enough  to make up for it.  And it has pockets!!"
4.0,Very effective for keeping you warmer in cold weather.  Snug fit.  Would buy again.
4.0,Fun! Love them
4.0,"I am liking these slippers and they were less expensive than some others I considered.  I have been dealing with foot pain, so needed these for their strong arch support and insole softness.  I also wanted something with a firm sole to help shield my feet from my hard stone floors.  I also appreciate that they come with multiple insole options.<br /><br />My only complaint about these slippers is they have a really strong rubber smell, which I had hoped would dissipate over time, but has not."
4.0,"My husband really likes this. He actually uses it! Simple graphic dragon design. Heavy material, but I haven't washed it yet."
4.0,I ordered a 36/32.  The inseam is 33 not a 32 which although may not seem like much but will make all the difference down the road because the cuff of the pant legs will drag on the ground under the sole of my shoe and they will get torn up.  Other than that the pants fit very well in all other areas and the seem quite durable as well as comfortable.
4.0,"Gloves are a good fit, did have a hole in one when received but seller promptly replaced with new pair."
4.0,"Fits nice but is see-through, so I have to wear an undershirt."
4.0,I have not wore it yet.  Like the design and price of belts.
4.0,Fit as expected. Easy to put on but may be a struggle to remove
4.0,A little tight around my wrist but its cute and stylish
4.0,"These are really cute, and a great accent for summer outfits. Mine came with a small scratch on the surface of one lens, but it's not too noticable."
4.0,"I got this In size 2T for my 19 month old and it fits her just right so I would say it runs a bit small. The leotard is very basic. It is cotton and has thin spaghetti straps.  The cotton is thicker and higher quality.  It is not see through. It would be comfortable to wear but doesn’t have much stretch to it if your child is very active. I’m unsure of the current price, but if you need a basic leotard and the price is competitive then I would say this is of average quality and will work well for what you need."
4.0,"I was looking for comfy (but trendy) tees to wear out this summer with my shorts. This tee does the job. It arrived incredibly wrinkled (as you can see from my pics- I just threw it on to leave a review as soon as I got it) and it does not lay the same as shown in the product image. It's not fitted and soft, it's rather like a tough cotton and boxy. Regardless I dig it. I bought a small and glad I did. Might have been better off with an extra small. It falls short at the waist and very high at the neck. Overall I'd say it's cute and worth the price. Now I just need to iron it!"
4.0,I love the quality BUT the little mermaid shirt was faded at the bottom so I have to deduct a star but other than that my friends daughter loves them!
4.0,"A bit expensive, but good boot oil that is easy to apply and works well.  Can was delivered with at least a few ounces dispersed throughout the inside of the box which was disappointing."
4.0,"Great polarized sunglasses and inexpensive! If you are looking for &#34;big&#34; frames, these are the ones.  Received several compliments on the &#34;cool&#34; look. Pleased with my purchase.."
4.0,"The picture shows little paws on the keychain. Well, that’s not included."
4.0,"great jeans, fit very well if not a little bigger then expected."
4.0,"Thick, durable, comfortable.  Combined with a slide/ratchet belt, these are the only pants I enjoy wearing.  I live in a warm climate, and generally I prefer to wear athletic shorts when possible - but to provide a more professional image at work etc., I prefer to wear pants, and these are the best I've found.<br /><br />I have big thighs, and most pants that fit in the waist bind around the legs.  Not these pants.  With the elastic, they adjust to your body, and when combined with a slide belt, you can get such a comfortable fit, you may forget you're wearing pants at all.<br /><br />I only subtracted a star because the one time these pants will bind is while squatting down - Duluth Trading has proven that pants don't need to have that issue.  Aside from that, these are heavy-duty, very comfortable, all-around-favorite pants for me."
4.0,I usually buy real leather purses because they last longer and are better quality . I thought this was a great price for a leather purse ! I didn't realize it was manmade leather . I kept it anyway because it's a nice looking purse that goes with my navy leather pumps .
4.0,"My girlfriend really loved this bathing suit! It’s flattering and comfy, however, the clasp on the back is plastic. It broke only after a few wears; very disappointing."
4.0,"The Hoola is easy to put together, and fun to do."
4.0,"Some of the strap stitching was out of line, which left some material needing to be glued down..Poor quality control issue. Comfortable sandal. I like the sole cushioning and non treaded bottom."
4.0,"I like this ring. Purchased for me, by me. I feel no shame. The price was amazing, and I like the look of it! The pic, isn't good quality, but it's pretty much as described. I'm not into high end stuff. I just like a new inexpensive ring every once in awhile."
4.0,"These waders were of good quality but because of the rubber, they were heavy and too hot for Virginia trout streams.  These waders may be ok for WY, CO, ID fishing, especially streams that don't allow felt sole waders."
4.0,"I liked the style. I ordered from medium weight fabric, but the fabric shrank, so my sleeves are now too short. How do I account for shrinkage of sleeves for the next order? Also, medium weight isn’t very soft. Next time I’ll order light weight."
4.0,They run large but otherwise ok
4.0,"This is a nice watch, with some solid features and just a couple of drawbacks.<br /><br />For starters - the red isn't garish.  My major concern with ordering was that the strap would look silly, like a kid's toy watch or like a fitness band.  It doesn't.  The red on the dial is cool, just enough to make a statement.<br /><br />It keeps time by GPS (through its app connection to your phone) so you don't have to worry about whether you're losing a few minutes before work due to your watch being off.  If you usually use your watch to tell time, which I think most of us rarely do any more.<br /><br />To be totally honest I think this watch is really meant for people who don't want to have the phone on them all the time.  I can understand that, because running with the phone on your arm or waist can be kind of annoying.  The problem with that is the limited functionality of the watch in terms of tracking - unlike Fitbit it doesn't have a feature to show you how many steps you hit so you can tell whether you're approaching your goal.  And of course you can't play music or anything.  On the other hand, ALSO unlike Fitbit (or at least my Fitbit Flex2) it has a battery that doesn't need charging every three days.  A definite bonus.<br /><br />The app works fine, it doesn't offer anything that a phone can't give you, but you need it to see your progress.  Without an (expensive) partnership with another app developer they of course had to design their own, and as far as one-off apps go I think it's a good effort.  Easy to navigate, no weird UI.<br /><br />The strap is a mixed review from me.  It's nice and comfortable and doesn't tear off your arm hair, but it has the branding very obviously along the side.  Tacky.  I dislike wearing big brand labels all over my body so that was a miss for me."
4.0,"I bought a size small:)<br />I'm small framed 5ft 125lbs and bra size a 32DDD<br />It fits comfortably around my boobs, it's a bit lose everywhere else but I dig it:) the material is soft and breathable as well/)"
4.0,"Really cute shoes, my daughter loves them. Seem pretty sturdy. Gave 4 stars because one of the shoes doesn't light up."
4.0,"I could have ordered a size down, but still fits well enough.  It's cute on.  Has some good detailing with the thumb holes and black details.  I ordered a XL, could have gotten L. Ex"
4.0,I have owned several pairs of these over the years. They are always comfortable. And they keep your feet warm inside or outside.
4.0,Careful The raspberry color is not the exact color scheme as what's display
4.0,The nose piece isn't too adjustable. Also these are really heavy so they leave an indent in my nose
4.0,Great price looked good
4.0,Other than shipping issues it was fine
4.0,"Fits as expected only thing I wish is that it was an inch or so longer I’m 5’7’’ and it was right above my ankles.  Overall though, great buy!! Tons of compliments and I love the pockets! I have broad shoulders too and it still fit nicely and great quality. Buying the red one now!"
4.0,"It's light and warm, but I'm not crazy about the way it hangs.  It pulls across the front of you so there's gaps between the buttons.  And the bottoms of the pockets hang loose and puffy so it makes you look ""hippy.""<br />It's good a good hanging around the house sweater.  But I wouldn't wear it out in public.  I have not washed it yet so I don't know how it holds up to machine washing."
4.0,"The only problem was the necklace, much shorter than advertised and pretty easy to break."
4.0,"This is a very lightweight wrap. I had to add extra iron-on Velcro to help keep the wrap up. I usually wear an XS and this fit but fell with lots of movement, not bad but could be embarrassing."
4.0,see through...will need some spanx
4.0,I love this necklace. But just like as pictured. The one labeled blue is actually white. I ordered the blue opal (hoping pic was just wrong) and I was sent the white. I tried ordering it a while back and it was out of stock. So i kept it. Still disappointed it’s not blue. Get a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,weird at first but fits great after wearing a couple times came fast I like it a lot
4.0,This is a nice wallet and it holds my phone very nicely
4.0,"This size 16 is actually a little more &#34;fluffy&#34; than I might have wanted through the mid-section.  But I liked the fit/feel of the elastic on top .. not too tight.  I'm thinking I might be able to take in the middle just a bit. I'm 5'8&#34; and 155 lbs.  I am typically a 12-14, but like my swimwear bigger.  I think it will work well over shorts for a casual on/off beach look ... then slip into swim suit mode with ease."
4.0,I like that the band matches with serval of my outfits and that it is comfortable to wear while I type.
4.0,I like the bag but only chain is missing thats why I am giving 4 star other than that I'm happy with purchase.
4.0,Perfect for rain and light easy to clean
4.0,Too small but length was okay
4.0,"Much thinner than I expected. Fit to size 5'7&#34; 165lbs  Great color, holding up well."
4.0,These glasses are so big that the case you provided for them is great.  I wish all your glasses came with cases
4.0,Product as described.  Nice fit for gloves and cap.  Lighter weight so ideal for temps 35-60 degrees.  Anything colder may not be warm enough.
4.0,Cute style just runs small
4.0,"So even though I ordered three sizes up, it is very snug. Not actually boned. Definitely a cheap FASHION piece."
4.0,My husband loves this watch!  He would like to get 3 more links to make the band longer.
4.0,Product was as advertised and my niece was very happy to take them to college with her.
4.0,Okay but could be softer yarn
4.0,brim is curved a bit much---readjusted to allow more eyesight while wearing--otherwise a fine cap
4.0,"I liked it but the stone fell off,  but they replaced it and they were easy to deal with.  Overall a positive experience"
4.0,"If you're just looking for a bra that doesn't show, then this product is fine, especially at the price you get for two of them, but if you're looking for support or something to show off your cleavage, then these are not for you, especially if you have a smaller chest."
4.0,"Very comfortable and doesn't fade easy. Work in automotive industry and it can handle a lot of damage and wash beautifully. I'm usually a 4 to 8 in pants (you guys know how those sizes are) 5'7&#34; 140lbs. Got a medium. A bit tighter(read form fitting) than i normally like but they move so well I can barely tell. Flattering, GOOD POCKETS. Fits my s7, wallet, ect. And isn't uncomfortable with them in there. Didn't realise they're pull on, but good enough that I'd get another pair, just maybe a large for a looser fit."
4.0,"I truly like the style of this bag and the protective feet on the bottom.  I am unsure as to the quality.  The strap, which of course gets the most abuse, is not real leather."
4.0,Delivered on time and as described
4.0,Daughter wears for gymnastics class.  Fit is good.  She is 8 (not a string bean body type) and i ordered a size the 9-10 size.  Price was great!
4.0,Such a great shirt to just throw on quick love how it’s warm but I don’t get over warm and it’s comfortable I wish it was a little longer on my torso
4.0,I am pleased with my purchase. The dress fit as expected; loose and comfy. I like this dress because it’s modest and fashionable. I really like the cold shoulders with the ruffled sleeves. The only reason why I didn’t give my purchase a five star rating was because I was sent the wrong size. I ordered an extra large but was sent a medium; however the medium fits perfectly though.
4.0,It runs very small but it is light and breathable unlike some waist trainers
4.0,They're fly love Em
4.0,"It literally smells. I hope to God it washes out, so gross"
4.0,Bought this product for my husband who is a music lover! So far he loves it!
4.0,Got this for a friend of mine who is kinda tall and it was not as long on him as I thought it would be but it fit nonetheless. He loved it.
4.0,"I used this N-rit cooling scarf around my neck to help keep me cool during the heat wave we had this summer. This particular scarf is smaller than the ones I have gotten in the past, which was both a blessing and a disappointment. The blessing was that it was small enough and light enough that I didn't have to worry about my collarbone getting bruised by my active work. I could also tie it around my head!  The disappointment was that since it was small and lightweight, I had to refresh it often as the water evaporated very quickly. So I will use it, but I will also get some more of the larger ones for the extremely hot days."
4.0,Pretty rose. Looks nice.
4.0,"affordable, cute disney hat!! 1 star down because i couldn’t keep the ears to stand up right. one kept folding down."
4.0,"Got it large as suggested by the reviewers, normally I wear a medium, so this worked out well for me."
4.0,Love these very cute and comfortable just the thread came loose around the waist so had to return will be getting another pair
4.0,Verey nice colors. They are comfortable and meet my needs. One of them  has a small hole in it.
4.0,"I recommend when ordering to add at least 2 sizes. I wear a large, I ordered an xl and this is supposed to fit baggy which it didnt it is tight no room if its washed and shrinks at all. Very comfortable material."
4.0,"It's MUCH shorter than expected, more like a sports bra than a shirt, but it is still very high quality, ad VERY comfortable to wear. So I'm not all that dissatisfied!"
4.0,I like it.  Good fabric.  I wish I sized up a bit for the casual cardigan look
4.0,Very stylish for a good price. It looked just like the picture and was pretty sturdy/ stayed up well in my hair. The only reason I took off the star is because the black glitter went everywhere and I hate glitter. Otherwise a great product that just needs a bit of initial cleaning.
4.0,"Really cute, exactly as pictured. The bell is quiet-sounding.<br />The choker is soft material  (&#34;vegan leather&#34;) and adjusts to fit me perfectly."
4.0,"Nice looking necklace.  Seems durable at this point, but time will tell.  I bought it to see if it would help with neck pain.  I haven't had a headache and my neck pain it greatly deminished since I started wearing it.  My family thinks it's just a placebo effect, but I don't care because my pain is less than what it was."
4.0,"Great dress, just too long for me. Great quality, true color just lime the picture."
4.0,Nice skirt! I will where towards the fall when it's cooler.
4.0,"I found the belt to be a great value, good quality, and convenient ratchet mechanism.  Today the mechanism broke, unfortunately, it was its 7th month of use.  I liked this belt enough to use it daily.  I noticed that the buckle mechanism has a 180 day warranty, which is an interesting timeframe, until I saw what happened to me.  :-("
4.0,"Gorgeous dress!  It's more low cut than it looks in the picture... like close to my belly button.  Not a problem if you don't like that... just toss on a bandeau.<br />Very very short, as expected.  It's heavier than most dresses.<br />It's just not for me and my body currently. Maybe after a few months of eating clean and working out, I'll buy it again and feel more comfortable.  Have to return this one though.<br />It's beautiful and everything you expect by the description, just not for me."
4.0,"These are very pretty, but you can only fit a 6mm pearl in them and that’s if you set it dead center and close it. Would be better advertised as essentials oil only, or as a locket."
4.0,Very warm comfortable waist
4.0,"Warm and fits well, ordered 2xl because giant cardigans are the best. Sleeves are a bit long but hey its 2xl what can you do. The material has a cheap feel but is sturdy and not too scratchy. Definitely going to be my go to top this winter. Only problem I have is with the price, could be cheaper."
4.0,Cute and seem like good quality but were to small. I returned them for a full refund and am going to try a size up
4.0,"Little big for my face, but these are really nice sunglasses... Great pinkish-gold mirrored lens."
4.0,"This shapewear fits quite snugly and does define your body more. Make sure to get the proper size. Where the shapewear ends, tends to be a bit loose if you sit down."
4.0,If you are a captain of your boat this is the hat for you
4.0,The design on these is prettier even than the already pretty picture! I did think they would be a bit lighter but the package feels a little bit heavier but shouldn’t be too bad but don’t expect super light ! They’re no super light or super heavy they feel a little bit heavier than lightweight...overall super pleased at the amount of bling and unique style for the inexpensive price! Happy
4.0,"I loved it, But the top is kind of big for my daughter."
4.0,Nice comfortable material with a little stretch in it.
4.0,"Fits tight. Not for tall or short waist people that thankfully I'm not tall but still snug through the crotch. Ordered the US size medium tag size L at 120 lb 36.5, 27,35 it barely fits through the chest but the colors are vibrant and the fabric is decent quality"
4.0,"I was looking for a casual blouse to throw on for the hot summer, and didn't expect much from the photo and price, but the workmanship was better than expected. I gave it 4 stars because I usually don't encourage buying goods made in China."
4.0,Pendant is really pretty but the chain is cheaper looking and shorter than what I expected.
4.0,Beautiful watch but it's a bit hard to see the hands at just a glance. But it's nice.
4.0,"So far these are great.  My only issue is some of the backings don't fit the posts so I have to mix and match earring to backing.  But once I found backings that fit, they stay on and haven't bothered the earlobes."
4.0,These sets are super cute!  The fabric is very sturdy and they fit my 4 year old and 2 year old grandsons well.  The only downside is that the stickers that come with it don’t stick well to the fabric.  My grandsons had a great time with the stickers but they were disappointed that they fell off.
4.0,"Adorable pin! My daughter thought it was so cute. Not metal or heavy weight. She likes the metal, lacquer type,  like her other pins but she was still happy with this one."
4.0,"Overall, this was a great band. Unfortunately one of the clasps fell apart in 6 months of minimal wear. That being said, I contacted V-Moro and they offered to immediately ship me a replacement. Very happy!"
4.0,"While I don't recommend to use this as a daily driver, they are very funky and stylish and will do great for as part of an outfit going out or a costume."
4.0,looks great. A little hard to open.
4.0,This helmet is cheaply made but is a great platform to customize! I am very happy with it. Can’t wait to paint it and make my own Mandalorian costume.
4.0,"Wish they were a little longer.  I wear a women's 9.5 and my toes feel kind of cramped.  However, they are a great design with no slipping!"
4.0,I have allergic reactions to low quality metal earings. These are perfect for me! I use these as my nose rings and my triple helix earings. They do tend to fall out more often when I wear them as a triple helix earing but the entire set lasted me a year.
4.0,Loved them when they were in one piece. I was attempting to adjust them (per instructions from a Sunglass Hut associate) by gripping the lens and bending. Then SNAP!!! My heart broke and my stomach dropped. Luxottica said to send them to the warranty and repair center. Here's to hoping they can be fixed!
4.0,My daughter ❤ iit
4.0,"I ordered Ashuai Womens Turtleneck Loose Sweaters Batwing Sleeve Button Down Baggy Pullovers Knitted Jumper Top for review.  I ordered it in a large but this sweater was way to big for my wife.  You may want to consider ordering this a size down from your normal size.  Even it is slightly fitted, it would look better then wearing it loose or baggy.  It is a beautiful sweater though.  The red is vibrant.  The large buttons add a great touch.  The style with the cropped front, would be extremely flattering had it not been too large for her.  It is thick and cozy.<br /><br />This is a style my teenage daughter would love to wear.  It truly is a beautiful sweater.  Double check the sizing chart before ordering.  But it is definitely worth it's price."
4.0,Love how nice and thick these are but they ran a bit small for me.
4.0,"The gray one had a twisted strap.  Quality control sub par.  Other than that, nice item."
4.0,"I love this shoe! So cute and comfortable. For me, they were cut a little larger than the Clark's I usually wear (I went down 1/2 a size). I wish the back strap was adjustable- then they would be a five-star shoe!"
4.0,"I bought this set to take on a Jamaican vacation as I don't want to risk anything with my real rings and I like to wear my rings daily, a little bling is a good thing. This looks quite good for a fake ring. I only wish this came in half sizes. My current wedding band is a 5.5 and my engagement ring is a size 5. Well the size 5 in this is limit snug on my finger. I can see it's barely a millimeter smaller than my current rings. and while I can get them on, oh la they are tough to get back off! I am hoping my local jewelry store can stretch it out just a tiny bit. Once the fog is removed from the stones, they actually look quite good. The detail on the side of the engagement ring mimics a real ring and the center stone is not so enormous it looks unrealistic. This is a great option if one is looking for an inexpensive option to wear in lieu of expensive rings."
4.0,The fit & style.
4.0,"He likes it, said the clip didn't hold the keys really tight, but he still uses it. Looks nice and good quality."
4.0,Love these!! Very sexy and feel wonderful on. Drives my hubby wild when I wear them......I have a 32&#34; waist and the large fit perfect.
4.0,GREAT MEMORY
4.0,Will add pictures later. I love this skirt. The material feels like a sturdy material. I only took off a star because there are some loose threads on the hem. Nothing that can’t be clipped. Very worth the price.
4.0,"The medium was a bit larger than I expected. The shirt lettering seemed cheap, but the shirt material was good quality."
4.0,I bought this for my self and I like them.
4.0,Very comfortable.  Fits perfect
4.0,"Beautiful quality dress. I am 5’3” about 130Ibs, with an hourglass/pear shaped body. I got this dress for a work party & the medium fits me as expected!<br />The reason for 4 stars & not 5 are mainly for two reasons, first- as you can see in the pictures it has odd shaded areas in the dress where the slip underneath creases such as in the “lower” area........ 🙄 and the dress is not made to flatter a figure very much in my own opinion. I would have personally shaped it differently around the back & under the chest- it has some gaping, which with a tight fitting dress as this, it almost makes you look larger in that area. But overall a great dress!<br /><br />By the way.. I know my dog looks sad, but I swear he is a happy dog."
4.0,"I really love this top, the cutouts on the sides are super cute. The only problem is that when worn with shorts it looks a bit bulky and not so flattering to the hips. I got the black and white striped one and I love the pattern and color. I haven't worn it in the water yet, but I think it's going to be great, it's a really nice fabric.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,thin spandex but works fine. I just put it over my sports bra for a bit of modesty. good for the price
4.0,Got these for gym locker room and showers.  They do their job. They are a little tight. Length is good though.
4.0,"These kneepad are lightweight, easy to put on and off and do exactly what they are intended for. I like them because they are very flexible so my little one can move freely with them, they are not tight but don’t fall off."
4.0,okay shirt
4.0,This was a gift and it fit great and comfortable
4.0,Color is just as described and fit is perfect.  Thank You.
4.0,You get what you pay for and I am totally fine with it. These glasses are huge which is good as I have a huge face and these work well for it. The only thing I wish it had was a rubberized or non-slip surface by the ears cause these tend to slip.
4.0,"Really liked the look and function of the watch.  Intialy, I thought there was an issue with the clock as it seemed to loose 10-15 minutes each day.  Figured out the issue was me and I wasn't winding it enough.  Twisted it more and no issues.<br /><br />Watch was more fragile than expected, the bezel (front and back) shattered in my pocket while playing on the playground with my daughter.  I didn't take a hard hit or run into anything, just normal picking up a of a two year old.  Just a pocket of glass and stopped watch when i went to check.  I had carried it to work since it arrived with no issues and very little scratching.<br /><br />Was a really nice time piece while it lasted, and a great deal for the price.  Just use a little more care than I did, and it should last."
4.0,"I love most of these ear crawlers!!! Unfortunately, the set that I got had about 4 that are just too big for my ear (i.e they either won't fit in my piercing or the length is too long to fit on my ear correctly). Other than that, they are great and I love the way they look. I wear them all the time now!"
4.0,"Overall, this is a nice dress but the material to me was itchy on the inside. It did not fit true to size for me. I am 5’4 and 134 pounds. It said medium fits like a small and it was still big on me."
4.0,It is stunning. Great purchase Great price
4.0,Fit very good and comfortable material.
4.0,"Cute dress, but unfortunately too small for me."
4.0,Really love this outfit on my daughter. My only problem was there was a small hole in the front where  the drawstring was. And the straps were a little bit long but it was okay because I just type them up and pin them off to the side.
4.0,I’m using this dress as a costume for Halloween. It fit so perfect! I was nervous to order a medium(I usually fit anywhere from medium to large) but it was stretchy and I love it!
4.0,The top part is entirely way to small and the outfit was a little too tight but it looks just like the picture. Very pretty. I just wish I had to wear a shawl the whole time because I was afraid of my breast popping out
4.0,Very cute just run too small
4.0,Size 14 and it fit fine not too low cut either!
4.0,Not in box as expected but they work
4.0,"Great tie clips,my husband loves them."
4.0,"It's a very light bag. My 6lb pom fits perfectly in it, but i dont love the way the zipper opens at top amd i don't love that the flaps on the ends do not button up easily.  It also arrives with a really strong plastic/glue smell."
4.0,Good quality but diamonds are little dull.
4.0,"Nice vibrant colors, but tight thru the bust and material is not for hot summer weather."
4.0,The bracelets looked great.  I bought two sets (one for each daughter) and thought about getting a set for me.  I'm glad that I decided against it because the bracelets are meant for thin wrists.  I'm sure they could be bent to be larger - but bracelets never look as good when you do that.
4.0,"It was surprisingly loose at the top, and it was hard to tell the front from the back."
4.0,"This outfit is super cute, but the cut and feel of the material is not that great. The harem style pants are adorable and very gender neutral. However, the waist runs very small. I ordered the 4-5 for my 4 year old and it was too small. It fit my 2, year old well. The top is true to size. The material is a little stiff. It feels as if the pattern is printed on, so the pants are a little stiff wherever there is the black pattern. The material of the top is nice, but perhaps that is because there is not so much screen print on it.  The item came promptly and did not have any strange smells even though it is made in China. That is very important to me when buying anything for the kiddos.<br />I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I myself heavily rely on product reviews when making most of my purchases especially since 80% of my purchases comes from the Internet.  Because I really dislike making returns, I try to include as much helpful information for others buyers like myself. I most likely will not purchase this item again. The price is good, but I am not a fan of the material."
4.0,"Cute shirt,  just a little larger than I expected.  I would definitely purchase it again in different colors!"
4.0,"Super cute, but it is cut for someone with a flat behind.  It’s a peach color, not pink.  Plus, if you live alone the zip in the back is not ideal."
4.0,Cute but I will definitely hand wash it because I’m afraid it will shrink in the dryer. Looks like it would tight around the arms if so.
4.0,"So adorable on !! I wear an extra large usually but bought the XXLarge and it fits great !! I got the grey , Love it !! Washed but air dried , didn’t want to shrink at all !!"
4.0,"Beautiful earrings. Delivery took longer than expected, but beautiful."
4.0,Fits just right.  Love the pattern/color.  Wish that it came in &#34;warmer&#34; rather than &#34;warm&#34;.  I use it for skiing but up side to &#34;warm&#34; is I will use it more for daily wear.
4.0,"The cusion I get from these sandals is good since I have a bone spur on one foot. However, the straps are rather rough on the top of my foot & can irritate the skin. Being a red head, my skin tends to be very fussy about roughtness."
4.0,"These are pretty and perfect. They work extremely well, stay on my wrist and look great. 4 stars because at certain angles they could fall off  my wrist without the hair band on there but I also have small wrists so probably works perfect for regular size."
4.0,Love and really cute.
4.0,I bought this shirt to wear with leggings. However it was too short and yet a little wide. It's really cute but not what i wanted. It doesn't cover my butt like expected. Not my worst guy but not my best.
4.0,It looks very nice but the seams around the neck are pretty rough and they leave marks if worn too long. It is also a bit small. Luckily my niece is very slim and it fits.
4.0,Descent quality.
4.0,It is so soft and it fits great. I want to wear it all the time. It's well made. It does shed and I worry it might snag if caught on anything. It did have a slight odor upon arrival but it did not linger long at all. I used a little febreeze and aired it out for a couple hours and it was fine
4.0,"This puncho has a unique design.  I like it very much although I think it's a bit over priced. The knit is light weight, which could be a good thing for some.  I would give it 5 stars easily if it  made of finer material or had a lower price tag.  otherwise it's a great piece to add to your wardrobe.  I can see this being one of my favorite cool weather tops."
4.0,"Over the last couple of years, for whatever reason I've found myself interested in different types of rings that I wear on my left ring finger (having been married for over 20 years I've just never liked wearing a wedding ring at all, one of those things that just constantly drove me crazy and I couldn't get over).<br /><br />Well, beginning with silicone rings I began wearing a wedding ring again! After a while, I came to realize that the problem was not wearing a ring, but that I just picked a bad rating back when I got married! It just isn't comfortable and never has been. I've worn so few rings my whole life I didn't even know that.<br /><br />Anyway, after getting probably a dozen different very cool silicone rings, I graduated a little bit into various types of tungsten, stainless steel, and other rings that I wear on occasion particularly on formal occasions.<br /><br />So, enter the TTVOVO 8MM Dragon ring. On the face of it, the pattern is cool, the ring is attractive. Upon wearing the ring a little bit, I've come to not consider it not very high quality, compared to most of the other rings I have. It is attractive, and also tends to reflect enough light that people comment that it looks like it's backlit. So, kudos to the designer for that, the blue pattern does stand out particularly in interior hard lighting. Additionally, the internal surface of the ring is very comfortable and the ring is actually quite light, particular compared to the full steel and tungsten rings I have.<br /><br />The entire outer surface of the ring definitely has a look and feel as it begins to wear have some kind of a hard plastic resin. Not claiming that's what it is, that's what it looks and feels like to me now. So, the more I live with it or use it the more I consider it kind of cheap. Then, I have to remember the price it sells for! Which is barely more than a silicone plastic ring! Because of that, I can't rate this less than four stars. Additionally the core pattern of the ring is pretty cool and as I already mentioned, garners attention. So, I consider this a great formal-ish ring that I pull out on occasion particularly when I'm wearing a medium blue suit, jeans with a blazer, that sort of thing. It does stand out and contrasts extremely well with a watch that shares the same colors, or formal and semi formal clothing. Happy shopping!"
4.0,"I really love this necklace, I also purchased an “L”. But, the seller should be advised the “S” appears upside down on the necklace. It wasn’t a deal breaker for me given the price."
4.0,"nice tee, sleeves are a shiny fabric,which i didn't expect"
4.0,It's a little bulky and kind of hard to put on. But it looks so cool and pretty on.
4.0,It’s cute but size up! Got to wear it a few times because it came literally 2 sizes smaller:( my baby is in 30% weight and 20% height so was disappointed it was still too small.
4.0,I wrote a wrong review for his item.  It was nice!
4.0,"I like the material, leather. I like the well made and stlish design of it. But I wish it will be a little smaller."
4.0,Won't last long on the grandson's growing foot.
4.0,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this and indeed it's a kinda strange material - a bit papery feeling - but overall I like it. It's not baggy or tight, but flows well so I can throw it on with a pair of black pants or black jeans and look plenty professional enough to go to work without thought."
4.0,"Fit as expected, but just dont look how I want them to. I still wear them though."
4.0,It’s thinner than I thought and a little delicate but it looks rad layered with other chains
4.0,Ordered xl for my husband he wears a 40 reg
4.0,It was less long and more wide than I expected.
4.0,"This stretchy watch band is even more comfortable than the velcro strap (which is comfy but can be scratchy or the plastic bar attached to the end of the Velcro strap can poke or scratch) or the hair scrunchy styles (soft but too much fabric that gets dirty very quickly). The purple-blue boho design is pretty and well done, and the elastic is such that it doesn't dig into your skin and leave a red, itchy imprint. My one complaint about this band is the slide is made out of plastic rather than metal.  If it were to get caught on something, chances are high that it will snap and the band will come apart. The only way to fix it would be to pin the band to the best fit for your wrist and then sew the loose end to the main strap."
4.0,"This beautiful dress was worth the price for a designer dress. It is well-made, accurately sized, just the right length and suitable for formal settings. There has been no shedding of sequins. The only drawback is that it is “dry clean only,” which is why I did not give it five stars."
4.0,Super cute! 4 star only because shirt runs big. I ordered a size 5-6 so my daughter can wear on her birthday.  She's on the slim side. Colors are as pictured.
4.0,work better than expected!
4.0,"Purchased for my mom! She loved it, only problem is she says the chain is too short, it kind of sits close to her neck."
4.0,dad loved it too
4.0,"I got this for my 13-year-old middle-school daughter to wear at casual times, or under a sweatshirt at school. She's been wearing it for a couple of weeks and likes it a lot. The ribbed material is slightly rough, but comfortable. It has a firm stretch, so it fits tightly. And the sizing is just a bit on the small side, which suggests it might be best to go a 1/2 size up. The material and stitching are good quality. After a few wash/dry cycles, it still looks and feels like new. A good, basic tank. I recommend it."
4.0,"I’ve ordered a second bra because I liked my first so much. The quality of the fabric isn’t the best but I’ve had them for a couple weeks and they hold up well in the wash. They are comfortable and really convenient for holding my phone. I feel good doing moderately high impact and low impact activities. I don’t feel like I would want to do a ton of jumping in these, I feel like there isn’t enough support for that. I am pleased with this product."
4.0,"Great quality. The glasses shipped quickly and have a very 60s quality to them. They are a bit larger than expected but overall, they are fantastic."
4.0,Has lots of stretch and is very comfortable.
4.0,So far after 3 weeks -<br />Like the product. Runs tight but I find they give 1/2 size after wearing for a while.  Construction seems solid.
4.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet. I bought it silver as well. I gave it 4 stars because it states it's a red color but looks a lot more pink, but still very pretty."
4.0,Love these jumpsuits
4.0,These earrings are so cute! I usually don't wear hoops but I loved the tortoise/leopard pattern of these.  I will say mine are much darker than the stock photo which I was a little bummed about so I took a star off but overall I still really like them.  They look awesome with a sweater or just a plain t-shirt and jeans! They are pretty lightweight and don't bother my ears at all.  Overall super cute and would definitely recommend!
4.0,Stylish but not as comfortable as I would like
4.0,I like this bag a lot. I noticed a bit of overlap of lining at the seams on the flap that needed to be trimmed because of fraying when I got it. Nothing I could not take care of easily. The color was along the lines of light camel so some of the photos can be deceiving. I don't find the leather to be too shiny as others have suggested and wonder if there is some inconsistency in the product. I really like that the straps are lined with a thick canvas on the inside as it is much more supportive and durable. Overall this is a great casual bag especially for the price.
4.0,"Looks very nice, full wind keeps it going about 2 days, and keeps time well.  Good middle of the road piece for function and appearance.  The chain is quite nice, the clasp that connect the watch to the chain is too cheap and will scratch the part of the watch it attaches to if not careful.  The gearing is good enough that you won't over wind too easily, but you could, and you don't have to change the time too slowly to keep from breaking.  Maybe it will stop a bullet someday."
4.0,"I’m 36C. The size chart recommended a size medium for me. That’s my usual sports bra size. These fits pretty well, a bit big through the waist. But still definitely wearable. I love the long line length on this because it meets up to my high waist leggings. I could wear it on its own on my more confident days. Was comfortable to wear during my upper body workout. I’d recommend."
4.0,"If you are buying in the US, remember these run very small.  XL is about a Medium for women.  Very light weight, but a beautiful."
4.0,Love the feeling of this bracelet
4.0,So I am in love with this jacket but for one flaw - the zipper malfunctions. and it’s sticking all of the time. I hope the designers take note. I would also prefer this with pockets but that’s my bad that I didn’t check .
4.0,"Barely fits me, luckily I'm small-chested.<br />Is cute and picture was high quality, material is fine<br />Just really small, large barely fits me."
4.0,I love this hat it's super cute I got it in the blue a must hav 💙
4.0,"Beautiful shoe, just to wide.  I had to return it."
4.0,"The frames feel sturdy for being rather thin, and the lenses themselves are fantastic! My only complaint is the plastic nose pieces. They leave some pretty heavy indents on my nose. Which to me is very minor. Overall these glasses have my approval and I will gladly grab another pair when these ones go."
4.0,"This is an outstanding buy. You get all your money's worth and more. It takes a while to come to your home, but worth the wait."
4.0,I like the fit okay. But the color is like an light orange color. Not as the color the picture is showing..
4.0,"It's a nice suit. It just runs small. I usually wear a size small in everything, but I needed to order a size large for this swimsuit."
4.0,Really keeps the sun off my face because of the longer brim. Fits a little tight on the head like a skull cap so did not vent as well as I would have liked. I truly bought it because the Model in the photo looked so happy to wear it.
4.0,El vestido es bonito y estira pero es algo transparente
4.0,"Make sure you order a size or two larger. Chinese sizes are far smaller than ours. A Chinese XL is an American Medium, other than that looks great!"
4.0,"This is a really cute cover up!  The only issue I have with it is that it gets caught on everyyyything!  So wear it but be wary of door knobs, pool chairs, beach bags, etc...it will get snagged and you will have to sometimes un snag yourself."
4.0,"Love it, get a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,Fast shipping clear picture I am satisfied thus far I was trying to wait until after the Christmas party to comment. I am sad I purchased this before he met with Trump otherwise I would have selected a different sweater
4.0,"I love this watch and the fact that it's waterproof but I'm not so sure that the band will withstand water.  The stones are gorgeous, the actual clock part is small, but still easy to read.  I have small wrists so I had to make an extra hole so it wasn't so loose.  I considered replacing the band because of that and because it is not the type I like-- it's more like a cheap belt that would break at the point of closure due to bending from putting it on and taking it off-- then the other day (I'd had it maybe a week or two) I was putting it on and I guess I pulled it too tight because the wristband snapped off, breaking the pin that holds it together.  I think if I replace the band with a better one, it will be wonderful.  Otherwise, well worth the price."
4.0,My son uses these for shower shoes at college.  Looks just as pictured - Recommend
4.0,Runs large based on the measurements provided. Nice quality and comfortable. Ordered in a different size.
4.0,Product color is lighter than it looks in the presentation.. I was expecting darker shades of blue!
4.0,"These sunglasses look good.....they appear just as advertised.  They needed a little tweaking, but if you wear glasses it really isn't a problem to straightening them out"
4.0,"actually a nice looking shirt , the odd part is I always wear a large , so I ordered a large. the shirt came as an xxx large , but fit perfect , so go figure!! dumb luck but it fits."
4.0,"I had ordered one prior and the stone fell out. Liked it though that ordered another. Beautiful ring, though size wasn't right."
4.0,I really only wanted the Boba Fett pin but I like the set
4.0,Nice lightweight loose legging. Took off one star as material could be a bit thicker.
4.0,Would have liked them darker.
4.0,"Love the bra but bra size does not match the sizes they have listed. I wear a 36C bra but the large did not fit like it should have. I did, however, reorder a size bigger"
4.0,This is one of the softest tshirts I have ever felt. Fits my husband perfectly.
4.0,"I loved this dress, but if you do not have an ass, do not get it. You have to have some junk in the trunk to make this dress look good."
4.0,"I love the style of this stop! But the sizing is Japanese sizing...so with that said I ordered and XXL. Well, that was a little big. So for future ordering I will order an XL! But other than that...great top and color. I'm a 36C bust and a size 6 if this helps with ordering a size."
4.0,Helped with plantar fasciitis symptoms.  Sturdy and comfortable.
4.0,"Very useful. The chain links are a bit unstable at times, but the key ring itself is great."
4.0,"works well, needed to polish the pieces before i used it but for day to day cleaning it will work fine."
4.0,Loved the item<br />The bottoms are pretty skimpy<br />Overall good quality
4.0,Gave to my husband when he bought his motorcycle. Came much smaller than expected but since it’s for a mans motorcycle keychain I preferred it this way.
4.0,"It is a GREAT hat, my husband loved his Christmas gift.  There were a few small imperfections in the sewing and a few random black threads that were part of the fabric that made up the hat were white, but other than that, great!"
4.0,"I am 5'6"" I wish it was about an inch longer so I could wear a little bit of heel with it.  Everything else fit as expected."
4.0,I should take the bigger size but wear it without sweater it's good not great.
4.0,"These are pretty nice glasses. I usually go for the bigger lens &quot;bug eyed&quot; glasses. These are smaller lenses. Came with a soft storage bag. Nice sized not too small but by no means the normal I would wear but I do like them. Nice adjustable nose pieces. These are UV 400 and scratch resistant which is a plus for me because I break glasses like I change shoes, Constantly. These have held up to my roughness and look great while on. Nice fade to them the top is darker blue and bottom is almost clear. There is no top plastic just metal attached to the lenses and these float pretty much on my face. Nice fitting cute glasses. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
4.0,I have a 34 size waist and the medium did not fit. Upgraded to the large and cut it to fit. Very happy with the quality. Design looks like it will last much longer than previous click belts I have purchased.
4.0,"its really cute, but its a bit big hight wise ans tight length wise. still fits and every thing but not the way i want it too. still happy with the purchase and excited to wear it out and about."
4.0,"I bought this for my fiancée and he was very happy with both the fit and the warmth. Two things that I feel should be mentioned. The first is, there are that there are not many pockets-which is not a complete deal-breaker. The other annoyance is that of the very few pockets, one came with a large hole in the pocket. This will be fixed by us as we will just sew it closed, it is just something to be mentioned. All in all, I would say this is a good coat for keeping warm in our(usually) very cold Michigan winters."
4.0,"I was expecting it to be a little bigger-a little more slouchy. It fits good and I do like it, just kind of wish it had more slouch to it!"
4.0,Decent leggings for the price. Very thin but full coverage. Tummy control is ok but band constantly rolls down.<br /><br />Has an emblem on the left leg. I washed inside out to preserve it. Unsure how long it'll hold up but will post update if it doesn't hold up after a few washings!
4.0,Great dress. Looks and fits as expected.  I would purchase this item again.
4.0,Charms on a charm bracelet
4.0,Super cute dress just didn't fit me right. Would be perfect for a thinner more petite person.
4.0,The corset came on time and was nicely packaged. The material of the corset was great but the fit was off. I followed the size chart and the corset was completely too small. :/
4.0,It is little too small.
4.0,I love the design of frame but lens don't work for me
4.0,The gloves are soft and kept my hands warm. The only complaint I have is I wasn’t able to use the touch screen on my phone very easily. I ended up taking them off a lot to use my phone. But other than that they look nice and feel good.
4.0,"It's very difficult to put on, but looks good. Could use a better alternative to put on, and also kept going down"
4.0,I read the reviews and knew to order a size up. I’m a 38B or 32C and normally wear a M. I got a L and it fits well. It is not tight at the bottom so not sure if it will ride up if you worked out in it. I had to have the Chinese take out crop top since I’m half Chinese. It is quite short and a true crop top. I bit pricey for $14 but I had to have it. You know how it goes!
4.0,"These glasses look really nice!!!  I have super light eyes, so I need the darker lenses and these fill the bill.  They are comfortable.  There is a little bit of the polarized &#34;thing&#34; going on but if you have ever worn polarized glasses, you know what I mean, and it is not bad.  All in all, nice but and I would buy again."
4.0,Nice color.  Good fabric. Was flattering
4.0,"Very cute and flattering swimsuit, swim dress. I got a ton of compliments on this suit. Only thing is (to me) it needed a bow or a tie thingy in the middle, so I added a bow with a safety pin."
4.0,Indeed the shirt was too large for her but it still looks good. the shirt has faded now but my daughter likes wearing it. The plus side of it being big is that she gets to enjoy it for a longer time as she grows into it.
4.0,"I love love love the 2g I bought for my earlobes so much that  I ordered 8g for my conch(s) . I would have ordered a 10g had there been one but there wasn't ,  so 8g it was . Bad bad bad . The flare  is quite large and not squishy enough to fit . So I forced  it , or rather tired to. Let's just say it didn't end well. I returned  them. However , I liked the ones that did work so much that I ordered some 7/8."
4.0,"some of the many pair of underwear are slightly small, so i would recommend ordering a size up.  it would not mean that they will all be too big.<br />the colors and designs are fun and they are comfy.  i would recommend purchasing them."
4.0,Fits my daughter Pandora bracelet perfect
4.0,"I would say your regular size would work for these blazers. I'm 5'5&#34; 150 lbs 36-30-40 and the M fit perfectly. They're very cute, but definitely a lighter fabric (not see-through)--perfect for summer--but more like a smooth cardigan than a structured blazer. They also arrived wrinkled, which isn't a big deal, but keep in mind they will probably require a bit of upkeep. I took a star off for the horrendous smell when I pulled them out of the package (smelled noxious like chemical dye). Left them out on my porch for 2 days to air out and it went away mostly. Overall, very satisfied for the price."
4.0,"I'm a woman - a tall one, with the shoe size to match - but I wanted to give these a try because I've started doing quite a bit of running and jogging, and had been noticing quite a bit of leg fatigue, and I've experienced some issues with shin splints, as well.<br /><br />As others have noted, these aren't the easiest socks to put on, which has been the case with every other pair of compression socks or stockings I've ever worn.  Unlike those reviewers, I found the most difficult part of the process was putting the socks on my feet and then pulling them past my heels - that takes some time, especially since they tend to bunch up a bit on the foot so you have to work to get that excess material pulled down the foot, over the heel, and smoothed out.  Where others have noted having difficulty pulling these up over calves, I found that to be relatively easy which surprised me, as my calves are not small.<br /><br />Once they are on - and it's important that they're pulled all the way up so that the band doesn't double back on itself, because if that happens, it pinches the leg and feels less than pleasant - they are comfortable; you can a little bit of compression but once you get used to that sensation, it's easy to forget they're on.<br /><br />In terms of effectiveness, I've been on my feet a lot while wearing them, doing everything from day-to-day activities, to chasing after a new puppy, to the aforementioned running and jogging, and I can say that these have helped cut down on some (but not all) of the leg fatigue I'd generally feel after doing such things, and the shin splints haven't really been an issue.<br /><br />These are decent compression socks that may help runners, but only to an extent: they won't completely stave off all muscle fatigue.  If the cost weren't so unreasonable, I'd feel more comfortable recommending these. As the situation stands, though, these socks just aren't worth such a ridiculously high price."
4.0,I like it a lot very pretty
4.0,Super super thin. Very comfortable i will purchase another
4.0,"La téla se ajusta muy bien, el color muy bonito, me gusto mucho"
4.0,"Like the feel of shirt BUT don't go a size up.  I am 115 lbs, 5 feet and smaller chest size.  I sent to a M bc of reviews and its TOO BIG. gave to my sister and she loves but she is a true M.  Stick with your true size."
4.0,love clip ons
4.0,Really cute and comfortable.  Not sure how it will hold up after a few washes but i still am happy with the purchase. Im 5 ft3 and wear US size 8. I bought a large in this and it fit well.
4.0,I wish the dress up heels had been sturdier.  One shoe broke the first time my granddaughter wore it.
4.0,We like that the sizes we ordered fit just right!! My wrist is very small and the 6:5 fit perfect and the same for my daughter!:) The 8 fit my husband good too!! Here’s hoping now that they will Benefit us Health Wise!!
4.0,Only gave this a 4 star because sailor mars looks a bit inappropriate. Def cannot give this to my niece lol
4.0,The stone in all 3 necklaces are brilliant and catch the light beautifully. For the price the quality is worth much more than what I paid!
4.0,Simple design and easy to change.
4.0,"Really like these shirts.  I had bought the pack of black ones earlier and wanted to get some grey/white to replace my older undershirts.  I do find that the grey ones fit a bit shorter than the white and black ones.  Not sure why, as they seem to be the same design.  Either way, they are still very comfortable and appear to be well made.  I'm 6'4&#34; and around 200lbs.  These fit comfortably.  They feel snug to the body, but not tight.  I like the fabric and how it allows your outer shirt to glide over it without bunching up.  4 stars because of the grey fit, otherwise a solid deal."
4.0,"Very soft and warm, but the hat runs very small and tight. Instead of wearing it myself, I gave it to my 7 year old."
4.0,The skirt is a little shorter than what it looks like on the picture.  Thought it would cover a little more upper thigh area.  It is super cute and comfortable and the ruching is great!
4.0,"This is really pretty.  The color is nice,  but there is no structure to the bag.  When I set it on a hard surface it just crumples and folds up.  It would be amazing with a little structure,  but as it is I still like it and carry it daily to and from work."
4.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; 135lbs and a 36B. I bought a medium. The top fits well might be a little snug but I have a large ribcage and prefer not to be squeezed. Top has ample padding and provides good support. This is my compromise between a bikini and one piece with my had two kids bod. Top is long enough I feel confident it wont rise up over that post baby pooch. Bottoms are too big, but I also have a tiny butt. Still wish I had a small for the bottoms only because they are a little saggy. I found shorts that match perfectly though so problem solved."
4.0,"I always have to wear something like this over my ice cold, corpse hands in the winter. I like gloves like these because I can still wear my rings when I have these on. There was a run at the thumb hole on the black and white pair and there was a loose thread at the wrist with the gray pair. Other than that, I’m happy with them."
4.0,"My sister loves the pajama top, although she doesn’t like to match it with the bottoms, but the shirt fits well and keeps her warm."
4.0,i got lots of compliments
4.0,"This is a thinner material dress, so great for warm weather. I love the pink color, looked great with a Navy Blue cardigan."
4.0,These are great for my vein issues in my legs.  I bought them for work and they are perfect!  Don't dry them in the dryer!  They will shrink and then won't fit properly.  But the material is comfortable and just what I was looking for.
4.0,"Bought this to go with a dress I was wearing. Its thinner than I was expecting, but I guess it gets the job done so that's good."
4.0,"Good product, but the hood is a little small and doesn't stay up on the head. So cute though, still."
4.0,The fit is snug .
4.0,"Good Insulation. Good fit. Got them for driving. When holding the steering wheel, feel that grip is a bit loose."
4.0,This is a really pretty initial necklace that would make a great gift. It came with the authenticity card which makes you confident about your purchase. The clasp is hard to open and close to high is my only issue.
4.0,I liked the fit and the way it looks.
4.0,So i decided to go up two sizes cuz i like a little wiggle room. I got the xl when i normally buy med. Im glad i did. I love the fit of the xl. Its still a little short with my legs but makes me feel pretty and femine. Please please order at least a size up ** ignore the clothes on the floor i was in such a rush to try it on lol
4.0,"It’s a beautiful piece but it is larger than I thought, about the size and weight of a 50 cent piece - otherwise I love it"
4.0,See review title.
4.0,"They kept my hands warm and fit well, but there was already a small hole in the left glove when I recieved them. I was already aware that that was a common problem with these but I sew, so it was minor. Fixed it no problem."
4.0,"I got this in 3 different colors.  They are nice, and long enough to wrap around your neck, and still have some length to hang.  Well worth the asking price!"
4.0,Bought for the wife and she actually likes it! One of her favorite shirts. She doesn’t love the pockets because it makes it “less formal” but she still wears it a lot outside of the office.
4.0,"If I had single vision lenses, I would give these five stars.  They are a little bit hard to wear with bifocals as they tend to make my glasses slide down my nose to where I'm not looking out the right part of the lens.  I'd still rather push them up than deal with the glare from oncoming headlights, though."
4.0,Its a very pretty ring. Sturdy and not cheap looking. Awesome buy for the price.
4.0,"cant expect a lot at the price, but this was actually quite nice. Leather is soft and pliable, breaks in well, color is nice, holes are cut precisely, and seams seem to be good as well. Quick release is nice too, though the spring bars feel a little on the light-duty side. Clasp is nothing special (compared to what you'd get on a Barton band at a similar price), but the brushed finish is uniform and it doesn't look like those cheap flat stamped metal pieces you sometimes see. Glad they are making these in the hard to find 19mm width, best reasonably price option I've seen so far"
4.0,"I order a size bigger but it's very light in weight, so it's the perfect shoe for my daughter because she now learning to walk"
4.0,"This is really cute, just like the picture but I would go a size up."
4.0,"This is a great low-profile backpack for a minimalist or someone who wants to carry only the essentials day-to-day.  It looks cool and is comfortable to wear.  Don’t buy this if you stuff a ton of items in your bag already, they will not fit."
4.0,"Thought it was a nice little black dress for the price. It’s thin but with a slip, it’s worth it."
4.0,They are about half a size smaller than expected but overall Jordan sandals are some of the best sandals out there.
4.0,"I, too, recieved a bunch of ugly and horrifying ""huggy wuggy"" charms and not one was any of the 'random' charms shown in the description, or anything close to it. IRONICALLY & LUCKILY for me, i was looking to buy huggy wuggy charms for my 6 year old anyways which all would of costed me double what i paid here, but thats besides the point. My 10 year old wasnt too thrilled to say the least, lol. Im still pissed off that they played me and all these other people who had trusted this company enough to spend money buying their product expecting something different, something as described. BS.<br /><br />If yall got this product and are unhappy, make sure you return them. Dont think ""oh its just 3.99, F-it, ill just take it as a loss"" because thats what they want you to do. They price their shoddy product low for this reason so that you dont mind too much and make you believe its more work to return it than its worth and in return they still make their profit. Dont let them make a profit off of playing you! :D"
4.0,"The purse was a little bigger than I usually carry and expected, but I love the color and I've received so many compliments on it!"
4.0,This dress was bought for a night out with some friends for a birthday celebration and it fits awesome!  The dress is very flattering and has received many compliments!  The material feels as one could imagine and the color is right.
4.0,Great dress! Light weight and cute
4.0,"This is a nice bag.  There was a smell when I first opened it and it wasn't a fine leather smell, but it's gone now.  Good size.  Beautiful color."
4.0,enjoy a little larger than I usually buy
4.0,I love these! They’re so cute. Only complaint is I ordered rose gold and they look like yellow gold.
4.0,"I like the product, works well, great with the three different tips.. Only thing is the storage of the extra tips is so bizarre. They like don't fit in the top of the stick."
4.0,"Got these for our 2 oldest granddaughters (9 & 10) for Christmas. The actual colors are not quite as bright as pictured but lavender background & cartoons still nice. It is made of polyester, which I did not notice when buying online. Will work fine as a winter/spring layering piece or light jacket. I ordered the 2 different cartoon images so each child's wouldn't be just alike but y'all sent 2 of the very same one. I hope they like them."
4.0,Better quality than most recent purchases on Amazon.
4.0,"Purchased a large the fit was ok but way too long even with heels, I returned it."
4.0,"Really like this bracelet. Just got it , was able to secure it alone and did not break.  Great way to test out if I want the bracelet this one is inspired by."
4.0,the school was very appreciative.
4.0,"Cute shirt.  No &#34;stretch&#34; in the fabric, so buy a size up."
4.0,"worked out perfect for our cruise. used it to carry some cash, will use it next cruise. glad we got it"
4.0,Doesn't always stick and hold on curved surfaces.
4.0,"nice fun cheap idea for extra stocking stuffers and for gift bags for kids who come to birthday parties.  the reason I gave them a 5 is because to my understanding, if someone looks into a LED light for too long it can ruin their eyes."
4.0,"I liked the quality of the item, however, the sizing felt smaller than the size I ordered."
4.0,Higher quality than expected.  I assumed it would have a cheaper feel to it given the price but was happy to find it was very well made.  Shipping was slow but item arrived within a month of ordering.
4.0,I love the nose ring I love them small and cute I have a big nose so I don’t want a big diamond the description said ball at the end and it doesn’t which is totally fine with me some of them the claw holding the diamond in sticks up and I had to fix it so I’m give it a 3 star cuz of that and it didn’t give exactly what it said but I do love the product
4.0,Fun bracelet for costume wear. Thick and sparkly as posted. Good value for what it is.
4.0,"This was purchased for my husband because he wanted the bands to May h his clothing.  It came really fast and it seems durable.  However, one of the bands is a little difficult to put on but he is satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,"you should definitely size up. I haven't found an occasion to wear it yet, but I am excited. HOWEVER, the fabric wrinkles so easily. I have it hanging up and it's already wrinkled."
4.0,11/29/17 update - I am updating my initial 1 star rating to 4 star as the company promptly contacted me expressing regret that the product didn't meet my quality expectations and willing to refund me. I feel good customer service should be commended.<br /><br />I am not impressed with the quality of the hats to say the least. There is no liner on the inside of the hats. Every time you put the hat on there are pieces of thread and some fuzz in the hair. I would have been better off buying similar quality product at Target or similar store.
4.0,Not as low cut as advertised!
4.0,Really nice but waist made to be pulled so high up thgh. It still looks ok but preferred average level
4.0,"great for the party, packaged nicely."
4.0,This floral designed protective glasses case is so cute. Love the design. Very durable
4.0,Super cute and comfy knit skirt. Loved the yellow lychee color!! Fabric weight isn't too heavy but would definitely add some tights if I expect the temps to dip super low. The quality is comparable to Forever 21. Lots of stretch. The waist band could have been a little less snug though. I brought an XL I wear a size 12 sometimes 14 for reference.
4.0,Really liked this dress the only issue I had was the pleat on the front of the dress hit right where I have a small belly poof. It caused the pleat to really bump out.  Would have kept it if the front laid smoother.  Loved the navy over the green. Material stretchy and good weight.
4.0,"Love this suit! I’m 5ft3 and 145lbs, followed their sizing and ordered a large. Would like if the waist was just a little longer, but still super cute and comfy!"
4.0,"Sooo I thought this would be a little bit smaller because of the photo - It's a bit baggy and almost goes down to my knees (125lb, 5'5, ordered a small). It IS however super cute, well made, and comfortable. If you're wanting comfy, go your size - if you're wanting a bit tighter, shorter and sexy, go a size down. Overall I'm happy with it though."
4.0,"The fit was great, they're thin enough to wear under jeans, but yet warm. Saw a little seam coming undone in the back after just one wear. but overall, a good value for the money."
4.0,Super soft and comfy. They feel like a microfiber blend and are a soft tshirt weight. True to size. Only drawback is they tend to pickup lint easily but I still ordered 2 more sets. Worth the $$$.
4.0,Gloves seem nice and warm. Only problem is it’s hard to get the child’s thumb in the thumb hole
4.0,Not as much support as I would like (my fault it clearly states medium support) but I can use these as every day bra. Like the material and the fact one is a solid white.
4.0,Good quality. wear a L or XL. 40D. I ordered a L. It fits nice but it is tight around the arms. I am working in my weight but I do recommend.  It's nice and hides the bulge.
4.0,I really like this luggage. I've use both the small and medium and they've held up better during the airline treatment than my softsided luggage. I like the zipper locks. BEWARE of the big one however. It is considered OVERSIZE and you will be charged. The measurments for the luggage doesn't include wheels and handles which the airlines require. No problems with the small or medium. The print is fabulous because you can spot your luggage from far away and so far not another set  like it.
4.0,"I've had this strap for three months. Overall, it's great. I use it on a Samsung Galaxy watch and it tones down the shininess and makes it look more rustic and casual. The leather molds to your wrist so the fit is phenomenal. Quick release mechanism has been sturdy and reliable. The hardware is heavy and durable. Stitching is ok. The leather is just ok too. It's not high quality leather, it's just an ok quality leather. The leather has softened with use, so the leather has become more supple which has made this a very comfortable strap. The color has darkened quite substantially which I love because it shows the age and becomes a unique piece. 4 stars!"
4.0,"I'm a solid 34"" waist and a Large fit just right.  (5' 11"" & 195lbs).  Fit perfectly but no room for padded shorts underneath.  A smaller waist can def fit in these due to adjustable waistbands and probably a 35"" would be fine too but not much larger.  Very comfortable and flexible, the build seems solid.  I can't wait to wear them out once we are above 40 degrees in mid-May (Michigan)."
4.0,Reduces flyaways for the next day. Nice and soft. And stays on head.
4.0,"good fit. skin colored ones were not the color that was on the screen, but it works for now"
4.0,"Ordered both the front man and square mask.  Good mask for Halloween costume, and arrived quickly (5 days after order date).  Hubby and son are happy!"
4.0,"I love this suit. However, I wish it was sold as separates. In order for the top to fit correctly, the bottom is slightly too big. It is perfect to lay by the pool but I can't wear it to the lake or anywhere that I may be moving around a lot."
4.0,"I absolutely love this shirt.  The feel is soft, more like a heavyset rayon feel.  It also has some stretch.  And it also has some sheerness to it. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is first of all because it’s HUGE.  I got my recommended size from the given chart.  But I literally swim in it (and I rarely say that about clothing).  Secondly, the color is not true brown, it’s more of a burnt orange brown.  But it still complements my skin tone nicely and will be perfect for cool autumn nights.  I’m most definitely going to need to exchange for a smaller size (I’ll get my actual size, which is large).  If that size fits better, I will be ordering others in different colors because I really like it."
4.0,I really like these socks. The material & cushioning is great but the tops are a bit tight. I think it’ll get better after some wear & laundering.
4.0,Nice worth the money.
4.0,I like that the straps are adjustable. Can be used for pediatric and adult sizes.
4.0,"I liked these shoes, but they were a little too glittery for me and didn't match what I bought them for, but very cute if you like sparkle!"
4.0,"Great little shoe.  They have a thick quilted lining, so will be great for cooler days.<br /><br />My son struggles a little to put them on (so perhaps a bit narrow) but it’s easily resolved with a shoe horn."
4.0,"My head, i guess is average size ,around  7 plus inches. This hat fits a little tight but I still wear it. I like how it looks and the price. I think it would hot on a lady."
4.0,Love red and white
4.0,The key fab already came off of the pearl chain and I almost lost my badge .
4.0,"I'm not one for wearing strapless anything because I find strapless bras to be so uncomfortable. This tube bra has changed the game. It's comfortable with nice padding. I'm super sensitive to anything on my skin, but the bra fits perfectly. There's no issue with elastic, though it does roll a little bit underneath. I would have given 5 stars, but I received the purple/lilac bra which apparently doesn't come in a 2-pack. It's actually very deceptive as the item description says 2-pack, but the photos underneath clearly show the purple by itself."
4.0,"Was a good deal. Price was great. My granddaughter loves them. Good to have a spare, one for home, another for grandmas house. Material seems ok. If it lasts the one summer, thats fine, she will likely outgrow it anyway."
4.0,I accidentally ordered a medium but it came just as I thought it would. Not disappointed other than my own stupidity lol
4.0,Bought these shoes for myself very comfortable look for another pair
4.0,"They are exactly as described. The edges are thin and bend easily, though. Antique brass color, though, I was not completely happy with the color, but can't place my finger on why. Fits easily on the wrist with adustability for fit."
4.0,A bit too hard to place in your pocket but still worked as stated.
4.0,"The quality and fit was good. Stretchy and cute, perfect easy summer look."
4.0,Great material with lots of stretch! I can’t say the same for the other colors. They were itchy and a lot smaller.
4.0,got this for my boyfriend as his zippered wallet busted...not really his style but if he ditches it then I will take it...credit cards etc are really tight fitting...guess thats a good thing in a way...he would perfer something he could carry in his jeans...all in all....nice wallet for the price
4.0,"Running. Has no reflective signs for night running, which is not good."
4.0,"Aunque no fué el modelo que elegí, me gustó la calidad y la echura, pedí talla mediana y me quedó muy bien👍🏻"
4.0,I’m usually. A 2 x but ordered big and it fits
4.0,"Nice case. I am 83 and make deliveries for my daughter. Before I make a trip I must take wallet, purse for loose change,<br />a water container, tissues, medications, hearing aid batteries and medications if I eat lunch  out and so forth. I always would forget something. Now I grab bag and go. Deducted one star is because long strap has a twist and is sewed on so I can't correct that. Better quality inspection could have prevented that."
4.0,"Cheap but my daughter loves it.  This is the 2nd one I've bought, she lost the first one and was super disappointed."
4.0,"cute dress, very long which I love. does run a little small"
4.0,"Soft, thin material, perfect for Arizona summer. There is plenty of stretch to it. Good value for the price. Planning to wear it mainly in the house. I am size 12-14 and ordered XL."
4.0,It fits really well! Fabric feels good and it’s super cute! I love it
4.0,Loved it but the top fit a little snug. Shorts in size 3x fit perfect. Very cute going out set.
4.0,Great Charm Small But Nice
4.0,No problems so far and it has a clean look.
4.0,Gift for grandson.  Good value.
4.0,It’s super cute... hand washed it looks great still air dried it and it was smaller as if it shrank by air drying it. It’s great material and is still adorable but my daughter can’t wear it after 1 hand wash.
4.0,Very comfortable. A bit on the thin side so it's perfect for wearing at work in the warm summer weather.
4.0,They look ok but they're too tight and inflexible
4.0,Bought 2 of these cool headbands for my daughter. She really liked them!
4.0,"I would have given it 5 stars had there not been that seam that separates the bust from the rib cage. it wasn't portioned properly to fit women with bigger breast. Honestly speaking, the dress could do without it."
4.0,"Sizing run bigs, mens tshirts are a bit thin."
4.0,"I wear a Large, but ordered an XL for room in the shoulders.  It felt like a Med, so exchanged it for a 2X.  The new one gives added range of motion, but just.  I would suggest ordering up 2 sizes.  Otherwise, I do like the quality of materials/construction."
4.0,"Appeared larger in photo turned out to be moderately roomy, durable nylon construction handy size for on the go, like the extensive color selections too."
4.0,It fell apart a few times
4.0,"Good glasses, looks nice to me. Perfectly fit your face for compete comfort and increased peripheral vision. Fashion and stylish design. Used them while driving a car."
4.0,"I've been using these since they were delivered to me in June. Great protection against the UV light, they fit pretty well, too. The fabric around the thumb did begin the flair, so I sewn them up. This works great for me while out cycling or at work. Keeps my arms from flapping about. Please note, they don't cool as advertised."
4.0,Looks like you're ordering three.  Didn't read carefully enough.  Why they have a picture of three is beyond me.  Still a great product.
4.0,Just s little gift for my 9 year old grandson who loves Fortnite. He loved them. Thank you
4.0,Very hard to get on. Doesn't fit my ear well but it fit my sisters great.<br />It was tight around my ear and didn't go all the way around. It looked awesome on my sisters ear. Her ears are smaller
4.0,I bought a large and they were big in the waist but after washing and drying them they fit great<br />I’m 5’1 1/4 and about 135 lbs
4.0,"These were really nice. As previous reviews stated, the white backside was a poor choice. I’d prefer to have it black or a plain wood backing."
4.0,I keep all my travel accessories together now when I fly
4.0,"They were pretty good socks, of course very cute but very thin!"
4.0,"the medium is a bit small on my size 8. Its not as cute  and colorful as the picture shows, but for the money it's alright, and if it holds up against the chlorine, I'll be perfectly happy."
4.0,"good belt, fits my 32 waist just fine without too much slack left over. as others have said, the end portion of the belt is a bit bulky and can be tough to get through a belt loop depending on how big it is."
4.0,Cute peice. I have it in the upper carlage of my ear. Little long so it spins but not a big deal.
4.0,Top fits perfect but the bottoms are a bit tight
4.0,"This is a large, floppy sun hat.  It has a very large brim on it and will keep your face from the sun.  I call it my sun-shade hat.  It is all light tan in color with a nice ribbon on it tied into a bow in the back of the hat.  The hat is nicely made and seems like it will last a long time.  The only thing that I would change is when they ship this hat they fold it and it has taken several days to unfold the bend in the hat.  Once the hat is on your head it is much better.  I have worn the hat several times to sunny events and it has kept me completely shaded.  The works very well for shading your face and neck.  The hat is nice looking and can really go with any colors since it is a neutral color.  I like how the hat is very light weight and not heavy at all.  Some hats I have had in the past have been to heavy and that was uncomfortable.  I do like the hat, how it looks and that it seems as though it will last a long time.  I received a discount on this product in a special promotion. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine."
4.0,"Gorgeous earrings with beautiful shine and sparkle! Very nice size, about the same as a dime. The branches bend very easily though, even on the card they come on."
4.0,I’m 5’8 230 lbs and wear a 38 DDD bra. The bottoms are high waisted and do create some little love handles but it doesn’t look bad. Covers the booty and your snatch. The top is really small. I ordered an XL and if you combined the fabric for both breast’s it MIGHT cover one of mine. No complaints because i expected that but wanted to give an honest review with my measurements.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful! The yellow is just the perfect shade. However, the sewing on the neck of this dress is kind of messy buuuut for the price, who cares? I dressed it up and wore it to a wedding. I got many compliments and felt very pretty."
4.0,"I got this one for my wife and she liked it a lot. It is stylish and shiny without being gaudy.<br />For the pendant itself, size wise this one is small; the manufacturer pictures are a bit deceiving to that regard. This one is way smaller than it looks, but to a certain degree, it makes it look delicate and elegant.<br />The length of the bracelet can be adjusted by pulling the ends and it works as it should. That being said, it is short. It fits my wife well but it was a bit hard to get her through her hand and she has small hands. The pendant itself is shinny but the stones are small enough that is hard to definitely say they are diamonds. Nonetheless the shine appears to be the real deal.<br />In addition to the the length of the bracelet, the other negative I have is the box it comes on. The box is intended for the kind of bracelet that you open up, which is too long for this kind and aesthetically makes this one look even smaller than what it is. When gifting it, this is not a good thing...<br />Price wise, I think is priced appropriately, in line with similar bracelets in the market...<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below. Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture. Very cute dress. I would say it is true to size, but it is not a stretchy material. If you’re doubting what size to get just go up one. Wore it with my flats and a big floppy hat to the farmers market today. My S/O thought it fit me perfectly."
4.0,"fir well, like the look of them also"
4.0,The belt is nice. But my person opinion is that the belt they gave me is way to big. Im a 34 and the belt starts at around 33. I have more than 1 foot of belt left. If thats the new trend then i must not be aware of it.
4.0,"Great product although when I received it, it had a terrible smell inside had to wash"
4.0,Super comfy slipping it on- can be dressed up with fun shoes or worn casual with simple flip flops or wedges
4.0,"Very comfortable, would recommend"
4.0,I love the design of these ear rings!<br />But some how I didn’t notice they are clip ons and have problems with keeping on.
4.0,Fits but they should not have the wig in the photo if it doesn't come with it.
4.0,"Just received this little gem.  I wanted to remove my flexible metal watch band so that I could clean it in my ultrasonic device.<br /><br />It took me well over an hour plus some penetrating oil but I got it off and cleaned.<br /><br />The reason for the oil and the length of time was that one of the spring loaded pins that connects the band to the watch had become frozen due to the dirt build up inside the pin assembly and would not budge.  I was applying so much force to this little tool I really expected it to bend and/or break.  It didn't.<br /><br />As a note to anyone else, think about getting a set of new pins (measure the old ones; they are all different) prior to removal.  Definitely a time and aggravation saver."
4.0,"I love it, so sad that it came out of the package with a hole, but I wore it anyway."
4.0,This is a cute shirt. Buy it
4.0,It is a go to top for spring & summer
4.0,"The fabric outside is satiny-smooth but the inside has cotton which feels cozy and warm on the skin. In cold weather I usually put flannel sheets on the bed, but most pajamas get twisted up every time I turn. These solve the problem. I am 5 foot 5, 110 lbs, and Medium fit just fine. I bought the pink ones; the color was different than the photo. It is a coral pink."
4.0,"I love this tank top, it did arrive quite large and I had to actually have it taken in to wear it.  But overall it is great."
4.0,Very Nice and light weight glasses.  They may not cost alot but when worn they look really expensive.  I quite like it
4.0,"I like the looks of these, the fit and the comfort. They are by no means Oakleys, but I sure wont cry If I sit on them! Good cheap sunglasses."
4.0,"It says lined with fleece, but is not completely and the fleece is really thin. Is not for winter, more like autumn or spring, when you need something lightweight. I bought size 2T for my 15 month old baby and it fits, perfectly. So I suggest by one or two sizes up"
4.0,Super soft and have good cushion on the bottom.  Love them.
4.0,Carter's tend to run small but this fit well enough. My only problem with it was the spaces between the buttons gaped even though my baby wasn't stretching the fabric at all. If anything the outfit was a big loose on her. I think it's more likely a design flaw. Bib is perfect and adorable.
4.0,Got this for my Daughter because it her birthstone and she can't stop wearing it. Very well made.
4.0,Great shoes but were just a little smaller than expected.  Still able to use them but sizing guidelines may be off.
4.0,"It is a bit big. I ordered up a size being 9 months pregnant, but it still swallows  me. It is comfortable and I believe it will work nicely for nursing a newborn."
4.0,"A little smaller than expected, but nice crosses.  We had to get jewelry coupling rings to be able to attach to a ribbon. The eye was just too small to fit our 1/2 inch ribbon through."
4.0,My husband was impressed when I gave him this bracelet! He said it was great because it's obviously not just made to be &#34;fashionable&#34;. It has a pretty decent about of paracord braided in. And he likes the fire starter and tiny saw. I wondered if the serrated edge would be uncomfortable when you're wearing it on your wrist but he said that he doesn't touch the serrated edge at all when he's wearing it. It looks awesome and it's functional. My husband said he will definitely use it when he goes out into the woods.  This would make an awesome gift for an outdoorsy type for sure!<br /><br /> I was offered this para cord bracelet at a discount for my honest review. I am not compensated to leave a positive review only asked to use the product and share my opinions with you.
4.0,"The belt fits fine, and looks fine while being worn.  When I examine it though, the buckle is loose and seems to wiggle a lot.  Not a super big deal, and I would still recommend purchasing it.  I think it was a good value for what I paid for it."
4.0,"The color is beautiful and the leather is so soft with a nice sheen. It's appears to look light brown in the picture, but it's actually a burnt orange. It hangs well when it's empty, but looks good when it's full. It could use a couple of pockets on the inside to store small items like lipstick, pencils and hand sanitizer, but having plenty of room is not an issue, you just don't want those things lying down. Overall, it's a wonderful product and I plan to use it for a long, long time."
4.0,I like two different arches Sports dislike they don't come in half sizes
4.0,"Good bag. I purchased a Small (12""x15"", $10 ). It seems very well made. Need a larger one too. I will order this same bag in a larger size."
4.0,Cute top but was a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,"Fit as expected , nice pair will buy again , but time must first tell in a month. People like them"
4.0,"Very cute style, but loose on the top and the skirt is way too long. I am 5'2'', 32C, 115lbs and the small was a little too big. If you like your dresses loose fitting I would recommend, but definitely can see parts falling out of the top, wasn't very secure like shown in the picture."
4.0,Had to send back the original a little short in the sleeves the second one works my grandson is stoked
4.0,Super cute. She just always gets water in them and they take forever to dry out.
4.0,"Absolutely love these! Unfortunately they are of a very poor quality so of the 4 I purchased, only one hasn't fallen apart. Some were able to be fixed but it's a bit of a disappointment. Probably wouldn't buy again."
4.0,Super cute!! Fits great
4.0,"I'm usually between a Small and Medium and though I went by the size chart, I definitely should have gone for the small here. Super cute though."
4.0,I Bought this as a gift for my brother who loves wrist watches- this is one that he wears all the time. It is a very handsome design with the large face. The look of the wood and leather is a great contrast in texture.
4.0,Use it everyday and have for 6 months
4.0,"I like the feel of the suede and also how the band feels on my wrist.  I am giving the band only 4 stars because one of the screws fell out while I was at work.  Luckily, I was wearing a long sleeved shirt and the watch just fell into my sleeve.  Once I found the screw (I’m glad I did!), I tightened it.  However, the exact thing happened again one week later.  This time, I tightened all of the screws and put a drop of super glue on each one."
4.0,Great material but it says “Push Youe Limit” at the bottom
4.0,Worked fine except on some shorts made out of a very light material. Clamps slipped loose on those
4.0,"Nice watch, solid build quality, but man is this thing tiny. I have skinny arms and wrists, and it still looks really small, like it's not for men. Whatever, I still like it though."
4.0,Helpful in relieving pain.
4.0,"I love my fit flops, they are cute and comfy.  My only issue is that they kind of hurt my toes.  The leather rubs on the top of my feet in between my toes if I wear them too long.  I'm not sure if I am getting a work out wearing them, I haven't noticed anything, but they are very comfortable, especially if you are standing all day."
4.0,"Bought it for my daughter but she thought the pink was too bright. It was true to the photo on the listing though. Seems well made, maybe runs a little big. I'm going to keep it and dye it another color."
4.0,too big for my fingers its very lovely but the mantra is popping off after a few weeks of wearing it
4.0,"Had to keep a star off b/c the face part is too small, and the velcro comes up over my son's chin which is bothersome.  Other than that, great material, great design, well made!"
4.0,"I ordered a Medium, keep in mind that i'm 5'4 at 130 lbs, the top cup size is perfect, however the back strap doesn't stay tight or in place and i found myself exposed in front of my family for my niece's 3rd birthday at the beach. The bottoms are huge and i have a fairly large butt so i was entertainingly surprised to find my medium bottom is too big. However i was pleased to find that it covered my butt entirely. Overall, i still looked good in the bathing suit and its really cute!"
4.0,I received my scarf yesterday. I opened it and tried it on. It fits me nicely. It is soft and covers my head.  If I need it tighter I can tie it in back. I am very pleased with it.
4.0,"Packaged neatly, fast delivery, great quality."
4.0,Would be nice if the item could run xxl. Although the xl is nice coverage tucked or untucked.
4.0,I wore these sandal all day walking the streets of Manhattan and never once did my feet bother me. Great sandal. The ties straps do not stay up on my legs so I have to tie them down low. Otherwise it's a great sandal. Many compliments on them
4.0,I really love these suits. They are great quality and I love the designs.
4.0,"I always laugh at the furry balls keychain idea, but these are not that bad and are soft. I like the snap, but I wouldn't use it as an actual keychain, just as decorations on a handbag. The snap easily pops open and closed and if I had concerns about my keys falling off, this would make me nervous."
4.0,"This pack of thongs is pretty nice overall, the shape of it is okay but I did thin kit would fit like it looks on te photos. However I feel the waistbands of these were a bit smaller and constricting around my waist. The actual length of the thong that goes in between my legs is quite long and makes it feel as if these are supposed to be high waisted, because it either settles below the stomach or really high up. What I didn't particularly like was how long it goes that the back portion doesn't stop at the waist but can go up really high. The fabric is really soft and nice on the skin and there is no issue and causes no irritation or discomfort for me.<br /><br />I love that it brings six different colors that are really cute and the vivid bright ones are kind of neon which is really cute. They look very sporty and are comfortable. They don't ride up or move too much. The logo is not very big on it which I like and the waistband could be a little bigger  but it does look okay. I did notice after wearing several of these for a few days that the fit does vary and that the darker and neutral colors have been a lot more stretchy and longer in the crotch area then the brighter ones. When I've worn the bright colors such as the neon pink and the teal green, they have been much more forgiving in the way they fit where they are not too long in length and I feel are more flattering than the neutral colors. I'm not sure if this supposed to be consistent but I do prefer the fit the brighter colors have had on me. Overall, I like these very much and they are of nice quality.<br /><br />I was given this as a gift with no obligation to review"
4.0,neck is wide. i want it to cover fully and had to sew it  a little bit to fix it
4.0,stylish pants with a nice pattern but they run rather large.  order a size down if curvy.  maybe two if not so shapely.
4.0,"Nice stretch, comfortable and so many ways to wear it. Great for bad hair days."
4.0,Good fit but after the first washing some threads came loose.
4.0,"Cute, durable. Would love a hook or closure."
4.0,These are going to look beautiful on my bridesmaids!
4.0,"XL is for people with wide hips, not for people with wide bust... My whole front bunches up wearing this t-shirt, but other than that, it is working magic with my upper back/ shoulder blade muscle pain."
4.0,It's nice but so fake!
4.0,"Order a size smaller... These were a bit too large for me, but are great for working out. And you can't beat the price."
4.0,This necklace was bought for my 18 YO daughter to give to a friend.  She loves it but I'm not sure how long it will look nice.
4.0,"Perfect time to got the packing cube set, can't wait to try to travel next week. The quality is really good."
4.0,"Perfect for fall! Notice that the smallest size available is a small, (which looks loose on the model). I ordered a small and it was form fitting on me, (which is fine because it showed off my curves). I’m giving my review a 4-star because the straps are too long and are not adjustable! It would have costed me the price of the dress just to have the straps altered, which is why I had to return the item. If the straps were adjustable, I would not have returned it, and therefore I would have given a five star review."
4.0,"This costume is a typical costume you'd find during the holidays at a retail store.  I actually cut the hem into a zig-zag, and added jingle bells and rickrack trim.  My child is tall, 13 months old, normally wears a 12M size, and this fit with plenty of room. the hat was different from what is pictured here - it was a striped cap with foam elf ears - very cute. We got lots of compliments on the outfit.  I would recommend this as long as you don't have high expectations for quality."
4.0,I could barely get them on aftre trying for several minutes.  I expect compression hose to be tight but these are not marked correctly.  I ordered the next larger size; we'll see how they fit.
4.0,"I have a 39&#34; chest, 32&#34; waist and am 5'8&#34; 150lbs.  I ordered a large, fits good, about how the fit looks on the picture above.<br /><br />The quality is good, and fabric is as expected. I dont recall shipping times, but I was in no hurry.<br /><br />So, good fit, expected quality, and comfy, I can sleep or work out in this shirt."
4.0,ordered a size up as suggested and fits great!  i love the quality!
4.0,good fit.  cool tribal design
4.0,"it was nice quality, but it fit me weird, i think you need larger boobs than a 32a for this to fit right"
4.0,My husband seemed happy with this gift.  Has not worn it yet.
4.0,It fits really nice and makes u feel good I'm a larger guy and it didn't make me feel fat loose fitting good buy
4.0,Product is okay. Just not as tight as regular panties fit.
4.0,It looks exactly as pictured.
4.0,"Nice shirt, good fit.  I bought the XXL so that it wouldn't be too tight.  I am a 38DD"
4.0,"The watch is really very nice.  It looks just like the picture.  My only complaint I am including as something of a warning to others is about the length of the band.  The description says the band is 9.3&#34;.  This is not true, the total length of the watch plus the band is 9.3&#34;.  If someone needed a long band this might not be their first choice."
4.0,"I like the breathable material. Very comfy and dura me. I have had mine for about a year. And even tho I usually go thru gym shirts every couple months, due to bad smelling or staining, this has kept clean and odor free. Will buy again."
4.0,"The earring part is fine, so is the post. But the slide on called the clutch is so tiny i can hardly work it. I've already broken one. But it looks pretty real, already had one person caution me about people ripping it out of my ear to get the diamond. Guess i'd have to say it looks real."
4.0,I like this shirt! It fits really nice and it is very comfy. I can wear it around my house or sometimes I even wear it out.<br />It's a nice shirt.
4.0,"Good for running, light, doesn’t slip, good shade coloring, but a little big for me, otherwise a good deal for the price. Frame and lens colors are fun too!"
4.0,"Can't beat a classic.  Starting a new generation on the watch I had forever.  Nicely sized for a pre-teen.  Hasn't been in use long, so cannot confirm if durability is the same as it used to be."
4.0,Cute and perfect for the price. Easy to put on and take off. Looks really good with my tan.
4.0,"I am sensitive to blue light so I bought these to wear at night in my house. I am going to get the larger ones since my regular glasses are wider, but they fit great. I plan to use these in my office to block out the light of the computer. I held my breath for a moment when I saw that they arrived in a bubble envelope with no packaging. The box inside was crushed...but because they are BluBlockers, there was no damage to the actual lenses."
4.0,"when I purchased these I was initially worried because I have a larger calf, these fit great and I had no problem! I do feel they are a little on the short side-wld like them to come up a bit closer to my knee."
4.0,"I am trying to get this in a smaller size.  but the one I ordered was HUGE.  suggest downsizing when ordering.  I usually order larger and it works out, but in the case of this dress less is more.  the quality is good."
4.0,Seems to work as advertised.  I purchased it because my watch starting running one minute fast within minutes of hacking.  After demagnetizing the watch it stayed within +/- 5 seconds overnight.  Over several days my watch now remains within +/- 30 seconds.  The product does not come with instructions but there's plenty videos on YouTube.  Search for videos on demagnetizing a watch.
4.0,I order a large because first order was xl and was to big now send me a small medium is not what i wanted but overall is a good product and fit well.
4.0,Very cute dress. Its flattering little green dress.<br />Sm.<br />5’3<br />125lb<br />Perfect fit
4.0,Very cute! Looks just like pictured.
4.0,Meh. It's good. Incredibly sturdy. I just don't think I have the nose for a hoop and thank God there are products like these to save me from the actual piercing. Thankful for this purchase
4.0,Ordered one size larger and it fit.
4.0,Pretty but too small up top.
4.0,"This shirt is so unique and beautiful. Generally, I'm a size small in shirts, with a 38 bust and 28 waist. I ordered a small in this shirt and a medium in the swan shirt by the same company. Both fit, but the small had the slim fit I wanted. The only issue is the slightly tight fit in the bust."
4.0,"Runs a bit large, order a size down. Well made shirt, and is never issued new in packaging British issue. Plenty of pockets, velcro, and easily removable elbow and forearm pads. I am happy with mine other than it being a little larger than expected but nothing to warrant sending it back. I would recommend"
4.0,"These come out of the package smelling like a diesel engine in need of a tuneup; fortunately, washing them with oxy or baking soda will take care of that."
4.0,The fabric is thin and they fit small.
4.0,Dresses are great quality but definitely not acceptable for adults.  These are waaaaaaay too small!  I would recommend for children ages 6-14 years.  Sucks because I was hoping to wear mine.  Oh well.  It will make a great gift later down the road for a kid's party.
4.0,Fit smaller then expected
4.0,Bought it so I could time myself in the pool. Great job and large fonts so I can actually read it
4.0,"Muy lindo, es para verano"
4.0,The fit is very close to size. Bust slightly snug. Beautiful colors. Not actually wearing until June but felt very comfortable when tried on.
4.0,"This is a really nice umbrella with lots of features you find in the more expensive umbrellas including the crank, the tilt the vented top and the tie for storage.  I like the color and the fabric and the supports look very well made.  My box was in good shape but the top of the bottom pole was bent.  This had to have occurred BEFORE packaging.  Since the bottom of the pile was bent, the top wouldn’t slide in and lock.  The good news is I fix things and this is aluminum so I was able to quickly bend it out with a large cylindrical shaped object.  Be careful if you are using players because they will damage the paint.  I was able to get the opening back to round and the top of the umbrella installed just like it was meant to be.  I circled the area in my  photo.  I would have easily given this 5 stars but the part had to be repaired.  Not everyone would have been able to deal with this type of issue.  Overall, it is a very nice umbrella."
4.0,"I love this! I don't wear it enough, but it's very comfortable!"
4.0,Look good in a bag! But way to big on small hand :(
4.0,"My issue with this watch, and it's a big one, is it's claim of Water Resistance.  Mine apparently had moisture enter the inner mechanism, and no longer works.  I opened the crown to allow the moisture to evaporate.  Which worked for a number of days, but watch has stopped again.<br /><br />The moisture apparently entered while watch was left on bathroom sink counter, surrounded by very little water after washing watch.  Certainly w/in the water-resistant IP-68 rating criteria.  Unfortunately, though I have the watch paperwork/manual, I cannot find my receipt.  And JC Penny, where I bought the watch, has gone out of business.<br /><br />Though others have had better luck, if you care about any kind of water 'resistance', you look for a watch that has a 'screw-down' crown.  This watch does not, and that is the weak link, I believe.<br /><br />A shame, as I like the watch.  But without a replacement under Warranty I would not buy it again.  Instead, I will look for the important screw-down crown ensuring better water resistance.<br /><br />Love the light-rechargeable battery feature.  And, excepting lack of night illumination, everything else about the watch.  Easy enough for me to read at a glance, though I understand others might not agree.<br /><br />*Update:  It finally dawned on me that I could unscrew the watch crown pin and let the interior of the watch 'ventilate' and moisture escape.  A few days was not enough, so I gave it a solid MONTH to dry-out and that did the trick.<br /><br />Watch has been keeping perfect time and functioning beautifully since.  Good to know that, even after a week or so of giving the watch up for dead, ventilating it adequately restored it to perfect operating condition.  Consequently, I'm upgrading my rating to 4 stars --- Very Good."
4.0,Glasses are a little small if you have a big face like me. But I really like the brown lens
4.0,It fit and was easy to change out.
4.0,"These are very soft and feminine. They are very comfortable to wear. They smooth out the jiggly bits. The legs do tend to crawl up as you walk. I wish they had the lining that makes them stick.  Other than that, they are great. I may have even been able to go a size down for more control of the jiggly bits.  For reference I'm 5 ft 145 lbs and ordered the 2X according to the size chart."
4.0,"Great belt, super comfy, I love it."
4.0,"Cute dress, comfortable but is just a bit oversized.  I am 5'10&#34;, athletic and 165lbs.  Usually wear a Med or Lrg, ordered XL based on other reviews.  Should have gone with a large."
4.0,Very nice just a bit big for the size.
4.0,Disappointed  trash
4.0,"Very well made, reasonably priced.  I will definitely purchase from this product line again."
4.0,Great for my daughter’s birthday outfit. My only complaint is that the wings fold easily and are constantly in the way.
4.0,"I love oversized sweater but this one was a little slouchier than I like. I had to roll the sleeves back and I'll probably end up getting a thin belt to go around the waste to help cinch it in. Overall, it's a great quality, warm, and very cute."
4.0,"The Sonja Betro Knit/Lace Sleeve Babydoll Tunic is cute. It is oversized and comfortable. The fabric is cool (100% cotton) and easy to maintain (machine washable). You can wear it with leggings, jeans or shorts. I would describe it as having an empire waistline with slight gathers. My only warning is that it has the potential to make you look fat if you aren’t careful, depending on your body shape. Overall, 4 stars."
4.0,"If you spend a lot of time outdoors this is s good lightweight hat with a strap to keep it in place in the wind. Wish it came with a pony tail opening but that was easily remedied by putting a slit in the back and stitching the edges. Also wish it had more flexibility in brim shape ability or turn up snaps, but was a good value and does the job."
4.0,No push up but still looked great!
4.0,This was a gift for my sister in law & she loved it.
4.0,"Very nice quality, and they fit well."
4.0,I'm a 5'3 female 160lb and got a size large. I like the high-waisted fit. The cinched waistband is a little too tight so it's not as comfortable for lounging / sleeping which was why I wanted them. Super cute though!
4.0,"Listed as &#34;compression&#34; style, but I would not consider to be. They are somewhat stretchy but by no means do they compress. Perhaps ordering a size smaller would have made a difference."
4.0,"Love these slippers, nice and soft and very colorful.  However, I'm a bit disappointed in the sizing.  I ordered the LG/XL and there isn't any room in the toe."
4.0,"This purse works great,  This is the second one I purchased.  My only issue with it is the strap."
4.0,"The product is great, sturdy, and yet pretty.  I would give it 5 stars, however, for me, with a new cartilage piercing, the ends with the screws are a little too large to make it through.  They are not pointed as say a hoop or stud earring would have; here it will take a little more time to get through, and I will definitely keep trying as I like the look of this product."
4.0,"I've tried several products before, but this one works better than the rest. It is easy to use and lasts for a while. Not perfect, but better than most I've used."
4.0,"Comfortable, cuts wind well and is moisture repellant. I’m 5’6” 140 lbs and got a large. Definitely could have gotten by with the medium but did not return. I use it to run in 30s to 50 and it breathes well while keeping me warm. The only issue is that if the zipper isn’t all the way up- it falls down/becomes more unzipped during my runs which is slightly annoying as far as temperature control is concerned."
4.0,"Fit is perfect. I'm 5'3 115 pounds and usually wear a size 1-3 depending on the brand, and size small fits perfectly. Looks and feels well made, satin-y fabric"
4.0,This beautiful clutch is a great piece.  It is covered with AB stones and is great to just look at even if you don't use it very often.  It has plenty of room and comes with two different straps.  One short and one long that makes the purse more versatile.
4.0,Super soft.  Larger than expected for a 0-3 mos<br />Head band won’t work. It’s basically a stretchy pony-o<br />Will replace that with a baby band but knot of the headband will work on a different band
4.0,"I really like this little coat. Wouldn’t recommend it for Montana winters, but for fall it’s great. SIZES ARE NOT TRUE, ORDER 2 SIZES UP<br />I’m a small, I ordered a medium, should’ve ordered a large. The sleeves are too short"
4.0,I’m a shorter curvy lady with 34 D’s. Very hour glass figure. There’s no way to wear a strapless bra with this. The color and flow are as expected but the boob area does not cover like the photos and it’s longer than I expected but I’m 5’3 so I usually expect it.
4.0,"I finally was able to use this product due to the weather.  They work great, only lost one ball during the round, which I hit in the woods.  If there are any questions, they work on colored balls as well."
4.0,"I bought these to reduce the swelling in my feet/legs when I fly.  I haven't used them for that purpose yet, just around the house and at work (desk job).  I have a 16&#34; calf translating to a size Large. They fit well and aren't too tight or hard to put on. I've never worn any sort of compression sleeve/sock before. They were comfortable to wear, didn't cause any itching. Looking forward to trying these for travel. Will bump up to 5 stars if it helps the swelling."
4.0,"Very cute, but too small for my 14 month olds head.  It  is very well made and looks like it would be very warm.  Sadly will have to return."
4.0,I got the xl thinking it would be a bit longer. It was not. But overall i am very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"I bought a small-- I am a size 6 / 34DDD and the dress fits perfect. The material drapes and is slightly thinner than cotton, but with ""TShirt"" bra, you won't see lines. Waist line sits slightly above my true waist (even at 5'2"") and the seam is slightly annoying (which is why I gave it 4stars for comfort). Wrinkle free if you pull it from the dryer while damp or immediately after cycle completes. Great with leggings & extends to just above my knee, which is great for the middle-aged-me that likes more length coverage. Inexpensive, easy to wear, looks perfectly fine on video-meetings, and would be appropriate for in-person business casual office."
4.0,"arrived quickly, i like how the chain looks but wish it was higher quality"
4.0,"This OD green field cap is really comfortable and well-made.  It fit as expected.  The only drawback was the red 'Rapidom' tag sewn to the visor brim - I felt it detracted some from the look.  Maybe sew it along the band at the back instead?  I would still recommend this to a friend, though."
4.0,Good quality but small interior.
4.0,"I ordered 10, and received two of each color. The colors are fun and bright. They shrink a bit after washing and are small, but still a nice size for carrying in a purse or diaper bag. The color is printed on one side, but saturates the backside pretty well. I'll probably order more, I'd like more prints and colors. Photos were taken before washing, and show packaging. The color did not fade after the first wash."
4.0,This gown is heavy and way big. Well made though. Laundered well and didn’t fade or shrink.
4.0,Tight for my 10 year old & got a little hot.  Great for school because he can't set it down @ our school if student sets mask down they have to have a clean back up.
4.0,I am pretty firmly a medium sized person and this dress was just a little baggy on me. The dress is fine overall but I expected it to fit a little better.
4.0,"I like these socks, but this weigh and fabric does run slightly warm IMO compared to your typical cotton/synthetic socks. If I was ordering again, I would get one of the &#34;cool&#34; series or experiment with a pair with less cushion. (The Darn Tough brand is still amazing. Just, if you run warm like me, consider something that will not have you sweating on a warm day.)"
4.0,"They were too small and initially the company was going to charge a return shipping fee.  When I complained, they shipped the return for free.  I ordered my usual size and would never order any shoe without knowing that I could return for free as shoes are too hard to predict if they will fit.  So I'm happy with the company.  The shoes were just too small.  Not a big deal."
4.0,This shirt is fitted so it is great for laying because it won't add bulk.  It runs a little short which is perfect if you want to tuck it into your pants. The fabric is thin.
4.0,You get what you pay for with this and I needed it because it looks professional and its low profile.
4.0,Love the shirt but it’s a little short
4.0,"I really like this toe ring, it's made well and the stars are pretty.  You can fit it to your size perfectly and it doesn't slide around. The stars near the opening look different from those in the front but since you don't really see the back, no big deal."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:7ee75bb0d09bb25c267182c6c32efc02]] We order purple but got white so okay but she wanted purple really . Don't understand mixed on color really but we need a good watch. Love the different color of lights too
4.0,But the large size looks like small size! I should get the c Large
4.0,This dress is made of soft material. Fits as I expected. Would definitely buy again
4.0,"Love them!! Perfect fit and just as picture described!! Can't wait to go bigger so I can order more, only negative thing is one of them was really hard to unscrew I had to have my brother help me it was that tight! I had read a review saying the same thing but I guess it's every pair? Still love them no problems besides that"
4.0,"The top and the bottom fits well cause I followed the recommendation suggestion in ordering the sizes, it’s the bra/cup that is somewhat not so perfect. It fits me, it’s just not as comfy."
4.0,a little small but look nice
4.0,"I love these - they're great quality fabric (similar to BSP brand), and the pattern is very nice. However... I got a Small and they are too baggy for me, especially in the waist and ankles (I'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs). I returned it because I like my leggings to fit more snugly. If they ever get stock of X-Small, I will absolutely buy these again!"
4.0,"I expected it may run small, but I was wrong. Good quality and a nice company to deal with. Very pleased. Thank you !"
4.0,"These shoes are really cute, but really uncomfortable.  I am keeping them because of the cute factor, but will have to wear them when I will mostly be sitting!"
4.0,"It runs big, but I think that’s the idea… it fit my 36 week belly really nicely, and was quite flattering. The coloring was off… the cream had a bit more yellow to it, but I didn’t mind."
4.0,this fits good and is easy enough to wear i just am not sure if it is doing anything
4.0,The bust area is slightly see through. The rest isn’t however so I’m hoping a dark camisole will help the situation. The dress as a whole fits nicely and the fabric is amazingly soft.
4.0,They are small and lightweight. But very elegant
4.0,Perfect for a costume.  Not sure I would use it for any athletic purposes.
4.0,"I got this set because I thought it would be neat for my boyfriend and I to have something that we could have with us all the time that reminded each other of one another. He has the key, I have the lock. He has the key to my heart, basically, haha. I like the sleekness of it also. I recommend this for any couple!"
4.0,Good quality. There is a L and R. Logo only on one side
4.0,"Really cute, somewhat cheap fabric but good value for price. Definitely longer than pictured though. Get lots of compliments."
4.0,They are nice shoes but not what I was hoping for. The orthotic was to high. It made my feet hurt more. I am trying to adjust by wearing them only for a short time each day. If you have no arch you may not want to purchase these.
4.0,Nice but a sweatshirt
4.0,"I returned it but am giving it four stars.  Because it was adorable, I loved it, but it didn't fit.  I'm 5'8 and 134 lbs.  It looked great on, fabric was nice, loved the look, loved it.  But I either was pulling up the top or pulling down the bottom - a fantastic purchase for someone shorter."
4.0,Run a little big but very pretty just like picture
4.0,"The boots are perfect for the work I'm doing at this time Lightweigh,Flexable and I really like the zipper on the side."
4.0,Fits beautifully but I didn’t realize it was cotton material.
4.0,"We bought these fleece lined leggings for our teen daughter, her first pair ever. She enjoys them! Comfy, warm, durable, breathable. Not bulky. Recommended!"
4.0,Nice product made well. But runs really small! Bought a medium and needed to exchange for XL. Not much stretch due to the beautiful BRIDE lettering! Made 4 just due to sizing.
4.0,looks very real
4.0,very cute and comfortatble
4.0,Cute but the wood gets pretty dry
4.0,The bracelet has a metallic finish. Each metal circle is interlocked with each other to form a cute pattern. It is not too heavy to wear. It latches securely to the hand. Its design is pretty.
4.0,This is a great product however it does run 2 sizes too small so order two sizes up and the the arm straps even when its as lose as it can go still feels constricting so I wouldn't suggest this if you have broad shoulders or big arms and don't like the feeling on being a little bit confined. Like I said it a great product and works really good but order 2 sizes up. I'm a medium and order an extra large and it fits nicely.
4.0,"Tip: I followed the advice from some of these folks to get a size up... Actually, these shoes fit true to size or a size down. I learned the hard way. Now I have to plan a return and exchange because of misleading info. Nice build quality of shoes though."
4.0,love this charm
4.0,"They are larger than I though they would be and they almost immediately started beading up but honestly I still love them! They are so warm and cozy, so thick. And did I mention warm?"
4.0,smol
4.0,I like these hanafuda earrings a lot. They should make a version for real hook earrings too because that's what I'm going to do with these anyways. Some bubbles in the pour.<br /><br />Overall they're nice acrylic earrings but not worth $12.99. They're more like $8.00.
4.0,Its very cute but fits me weird. Big on the top and tight on the bottom
4.0,Not as I large as I was expecting but nic size.
4.0,"Beautiful materials, fits as expected."
4.0,"I really like this hat, it covers my face and neck very well and is very cute!! It has a sturdy brim which is so helpful when windy so that the brim does not just flip back like with other sun hats I have. It's also sturdy enough that I can fold the brim up and give it a different look.<br />I also received wonderful help from customer service.<br />I would highly recommend this hat!<br />Update: the only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the hat did not come with a removable strap (as stated) which would be very helpful in the wind. It's otherwise a great hat."
4.0,"Cut straight down, which gives it a slightly boxy appearance, but a very nice, sturdy cotton knit. Great for work, and a true boyfriend cardigan, as advertised."
4.0,Good overall fit and flowy
4.0,I like it. But not easy to put on with it's clasp. Lessen learned.
4.0,"Purchased as gift, arrived on time, fit was too big for my daughter"
4.0,"Soooooooo soft. Maybe a little baggy, but sooooooo soft."
4.0,Fue un regalo para una de mis niñas. Es bonito y hasta se la deja para bañarse y la calidad es buena.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ab0a3df0335d0c07940c9b23b3018337]] I love the color and quality, very cute suit. Runs a little smaller in the bottoms and creates a muffin top. I'd suggest ordering a size larger. The top doesn't support the girls the way it is wrapped. You can see the boobs falling out if you put your arms up.<br />But a decent quality suit for the price."
4.0,I also have it in white!!<br />Wish there were more colors.
4.0,Heavy leather belt. I purchased a larger size on sale and cut off the top after unscrewing the belt and made smaller without having to deal with the holes. Sturdy leather belt. Good quality for price. Easy to resize. Happy with this purchase!
4.0,Nice thin material so you can wear it year round with a cute cami.
4.0,I could only order by waist size with no choice in length.  I received a 34X34 pair of pants which for me was the right length but does not mean you will get the right length (unless they correct the ordering).<br />As for jeans these are very nice and fit well.
4.0,"Nice large compartment space in purse. Akward positioning of shoulder straps though. You have to wear as a backpack, even that position is akward as well."
4.0,"Soft and keeps most of the lining.  Be ware, it has odd stitching around the crotch and butt areas so you must wear them with a long shirt.  The stitching is kind of like thermal underwear has."
4.0,"I wanted a boot to keep my feet warm and be able to withstand snow.  These did keep my feet warm, but I haven't tried them in snow yet. I normally wear between a 7 1/2 - 8 and opted for the 8 and these fit perfectly."
4.0,Very soft but a large is snug.
4.0,Perfect to cover my chemo bald head!
4.0,Gloves
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter.  It's very nice.  The material is light weight, similar to a heavy t-shirt and it's well made.  There are a few nice touches, like metal aglets on the ends of the draw string so the won't fray.  There are no tags on the neck, which can be irritating.<br /><br />This particular version doesn't have a pocket, which is a disappointment.  Also, this ran large.  I ordered a small, but it is more comparable to a medium in other brands."
4.0,This jersey is a nice heavy weight practice jersey. I ordered a youth small for my mite player and it was quite large. We decided to keep it because my son liked the style of the jersey.
4.0,Jacket was good for temps in the mid 30s but nothing lower. Also was a resale from Costco.
4.0,looks much nicer than the picture.
4.0,I bought 3. 2 for gifts and one for myself. The 2 gift ones were perfect but mine the chain was messed up pretty bad. I threw it away. I'm sure for the price quality control is not an issue.
4.0,"I ended up with a little over half a gram of gold, or 0.0177 oz, which is worth at the time of writing this around $27. As for silver, quite a bit but it's worth less than a dollar so it's just cooler to look at. As far as platinum goes, there's no straight up distinguishable platinum. What you got is a bunch of white crystal looking rocks, which I assume is silver, and nothing that looks like melted aluminum. There's also a bunch of rocks that look like regular rocks that I'll do more research on to see if maybe I'm just uneducated on this type of raw platinum and redo the dirt again to make sure. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that there's platinum here, and that I just don't know enough, and that's my own fault here if that's the case. But so far for a $50 bag, I ended up (without any platinum counted) to have a $30ish return, which isn't bad counting in gas money and such to go out and search for gold. Like I said, I plan to redo it and get any microscopic gold out as well just to say I did it. For a disclaimer, this was my first time trying out panning, but after a ton of research and such so this should be relatively all the gold there is in here. It was pretty mixed in, mostly sand, and not as much gold as I was expecting to see visually. But after weighing it and surprising myself that this super tiny amount was worth that much, I'm quite happy with my finds. I would recommend giving this a try. But do your research on platinum first, or find some platinum first so that you can tell the difference, otherwise you're missing out like I am currently."
4.0,Great price at a comfortable fit
4.0,It is difficult to tighten and the gold band is not flexible. Color is great.
4.0,Very soft material and love the graphics
4.0,Looks really good esp with a belt. It is a little loose around the arms but this could be isolated incident. But will be ordering again.
4.0,I wish the garnet was darker
4.0,"Even the smaller size was too big for my wrists, slides around. Otherwise it does the job."
4.0,The zipper could be better. But it works. Received several compliments. Perfect for a Florida winter evening.
4.0,The pink is a little light and the blue is a bit dark. Aside from that everything else seems good.
4.0,allot smaller than expecting and on a shorter chain but over all I like the product. Probably will change chain to one a bit longer. Very small in size but the price doesn't upset me
4.0,Too bad this doesnt run in a bigger size its a super cute bikini. Rins small on breast.
4.0,Fits nice but the sleeves are a bit baggier that I hoped despite me having thicker arms than the average. Also much lighter than the images. Looks more like a light blue linen than denim.
4.0,"First I want to say that this is a cute outfit for my 14 year old. I brought a large. She is 5'9, 150. It's cute. I just thought it would be alittle thicker. The material is thin. But it's cute."
4.0,"They need to make the listing clearer, I received two small earrings(w/diamonds) and one loose big diamond. clean looking earrings though."
4.0,quality item. wish they made a tall version.
4.0,While the sweatshirt was of good quality I ordered based on reviews for sizing<br />My son is 8 and I saw that several other parents with children my son's age ordered Larger sizes (XL was recommended by a mother of a girl about my son's age)<br />The XL would fit me. So I am returning the item since I wont be able to get a correct size before Christmas. So for reference- an XL fits like a MD/LG adult. I will update my review after the return process.
4.0,"Beautiful top but runs small. suggest you buy one size larger. purchased two tops one in black, the other in white. plan to return for larger size."
4.0,nice wide headband
4.0,"Overall I really do like this shirt, and it’s very comfortable. BUT, I am 6’2 which makes clothes fit me oddly at times. It wasn’t as long as I had hoped it would be. Don’t let that scare you normal sized people away though! It’s great, I’m just a giant and hoped it would slightly contain my long torso and arms."
4.0,A little too tight but they look good. They are comfortable and I'd buy again.
4.0,I bought this as a gift for someone. It's wonderful.
4.0,I hope my grand daughter likes it.
4.0,I tried it on but haven't worn it out as yet. It was a bit shorter than shown in the pic; however I do like it
4.0,somewhat short to the knees but they are comfortable
4.0,Stretch jeans are Ok. They shrink after washing is my main gripe. Second after washing in hot water the color fades pretty bad.  Update got another pair in a larger size. World of difference
4.0,"Love the color, nice structure of dress- can squish your chest though"
4.0,This is an adorable outfit and very well made!<br />My only issue is the 5-6 is definitely just a 5. My daughter is in a 5 and some 6s so I thought these would at least be close to a 6 but they aren’t. The top fits perfectly and I love that it covers her tummy.
4.0,"I thought I would try the Waist Trimmer Belt when I ride my bike to help me keep my core and lower back more stable.  First I have to say that it creates a sauna around my middle - I have just worn the Belt around the house and when I remove it you can tell it has created a sauna effect.  Then I tried it riding my bike - I like that it is soft enough to move with me while I ride plus gives me the stability for my core/back I was looking for and is very comfortable.  Again, a sauna effect when I took it off from riding.  I also like the fact that it does not move once you place it around your stomach - it stays very secure.  I have not tried it with anything but workout clothes, but it fits nicely under the workout cloths.  I have worn this for about a week at different times, so I really have not seen any real changes in my stomach (less inches or weight loss), but will update at a later date if I see major changes because of the belt."
4.0,"Nice band the material is a bit light weight, however it looks awesome on my Bulova &#34;military style&#34; watch!  This band is twice the band that came with the watch."
4.0,"Just what i odered in happy to get this rabbit foot,to give my family luck this year as well all my family have a maching 🔑 chains.💖"
4.0,May want to go one more size up if you are petite and normally 1x
4.0,"This watch is beautiful.  The band is a little thicker than I expected and looks a tad more masculine than I would like, but the rose gold saves the watch from looking like a man's watch.  The face is a good size, making it easy to see the numbers.  I am satisfied."
4.0,"As pictured but a little different than expected. Overall it's a cute, dressy, thin top."
4.0,We bought 4 of these for drill sergeant costumes.  They are definitely a bit flimsy and a little floppy but for the money they look and work great!  Sizes are a bit big so probably wouldn’t work well for kids but there is a draw string that helps.  We got them for our teen age kids for an event and they are great.
4.0,Luv it. Pretty and comfortable. I get a lot of compliments.
4.0,Bought in white. Very pretty hat now somewhere to wear it
4.0,"Would prefer more rayon,silkier feel."
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34;, 115 pounds with dress size 4-6.  I ordered the small and while it looked great on top, it was too snug on the bottom.  I'm a curvy gal so sometimes it's a win, sometimes not.  I ordered the medium and will return the small.  Medium is better for the bottom, a bit too loose on top.  I'll revise the button closure on the back.  Price point is awesome and it's cute."
4.0,My son uses these and likes how comfortable they are.  Good for keeping warm and he also uses them while doing his online classes to help his arm from rubbing his desk while doing homework.
4.0,"I like the belt thus far, but the sizing is off.  I ordered 32-34 (I have a 32-inch waist) and it's way too big.  My suggest would be to order down in size."
4.0,Had to give it to a different person than originally intended as gift due to it being smaller than some tshirts but its a great shirt and it looks nice!
4.0,this is fine. I don't mind it
4.0,Light weight. Small. Skimpy on the material so its hard to cover the mouth and nose.
4.0,This shirt fit as expected and is very comfortable.
4.0,nice material but too long
4.0,A good deal because four in the pack. More for fall than for summer.
4.0,"Great color, nice and rich gold sequins, but the top needs someone more busty than my nearly B size. I should have known. The slit is really high, but I could have lived with that. Also, the underside (soft!) does show when you walk. I'm 5'4"" 130 lb and the medium fit nicely, really made me look curvy!"
4.0,It says it’s gray but not gray.
4.0,"I was looking to liven up my earlobes with a little spiral taper and some fun new sizes in &#34;earrings&#34;. These worked perfectly, lubricated as they are meant to be, and my ears are no longer closing up and preventing me from wearing regular earrings either. Definitely would buy from seller again."
4.0,"Great starts. However, the packages need to be label since they have to be worn in stages."
4.0,I love a costume hoodie to wear around Halloween and when I'm at home. But this scuba costume material isn't exactly comfy. I love the leeve arms and tail but may not keep it. Fits as expected based on the size chart and the hood fits good but will cover your eyes to look right.
4.0,"I really like this style of belt because they allow infinite adjustability:  I like my belts to be looser when I am sitting down and relaxing, but tighter when I am active.<br /><br />Sure, you can adjust traditional leather belts by just moving to a different hole, but that sometimes exposes wear marks on the leather, and sometimes there isn’t a hole that allows the belt to be long or short enough.<br /><br />And - these cost a lot less than leather, plus I think they look good as well.<br /><br />A few minor complaints:<br />- Compared to other similar belts that I own, these require quite a bit more force on the buckle to open and close.<br />- These only come in 2 sizes.  I got the smaller size, but that still leaves a lot of extra belt hanging beyond the buckle on my 32” waist."
4.0,Great design except the balls behind the ears get caught in my hair all the time. A bit tall and hits my eyebrows a bit. Other than that it's very clear.
4.0,"Adorable, but even at its smallest setting, the tie did not go up high enough, so my grandsons just looked &#34;chill&#34; with their slightly loosened tie look."
4.0,Material is not what I expected but it serves the purpose.
4.0,Really cute but no way to adjust the calf width
4.0,This is cute and worked for my costume.  Really itchy though so must have a bad reaction.
4.0,"Very cute. A little overpriced for what it is, so taking away 1 star for that."
4.0,"I had a Bridal Tea to attend. This was absolutely wonderful for the price! Great construction, did not look cheap at all. The ONLY issue I had was that the clip is set up for use for someone right-handed for the left side of the head. I would've liked to have had it on my right side. But, I used it as a hair clip to pull the left side back and it worked just fine. I'd buy it again, if I had to."
4.0,Warm and cozy but leaves black fuz all over bed
4.0,The only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is due to it being see through. Maybe this is my fault for not understanding the terms they use to describe the product but either way I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />This fits well. Size seems to be pretty accurate. It doesn't seem over sized or loose like some are made. It moves well and doesn't seem restrictive. The back panel is a little longer than the front. It's made that way because people wearing this will be sitting on some sort of bike. Helps cover up the plumbers but. Materials and build seem to be all very good. If you ride in a very hot environment this Jersey is a good choice. It breaths really well. I ordered a XXL because I'm fat. I was able to get a snug fitting long sleeve shirt under it to keep me warm on cool days. I plan to send it off to have a logo printed on the back. There is plenty of room for numbers and names back there.
4.0,"I love this wallet.  It is very well made and of good quality.  My ONLY complaints are that the zipper compartment for coins in too small (but I've never had a wallet of this style that had one big enough) AND the color is not as pink as the picture looks.  It's more of a rose color than pink, but I can live with it."
4.0,"This ran small enough that it looked painted on. It is a beautiful dress though,and very well made. But size up unless you want it tight. I prefer a skin skimming fit rather than outlining every inch of me o.O<br /><br />For as tight as it was, it was cut to accommodate a full bustline. At 32D (size 8) I wasn't smashed in. Well no more than the rest of me was, lol."
4.0,Fits great i got XL and because of some meds I am large in the middle super controll there got another pair
4.0,"The Paramour by Felina Women's Temptress Push Up Bra is a nice, well-fitting bra. I got it in the Ivory, and it's a basic barely off-white shade. The bra comes with removable pads, and I wore it without those. I would call it a moderate push-up/lift--nothing extreme, but definitely a little extra cleavage.<br /><br />The bra is a bit itchy at first, I assume because the straps are not lined and you can feel some stitching. For me, the scratchiness went away with an hour or so. The fit seems to be spot-on, at least in the 36C, which is what I got. The straps may be a tiny bit shorter than average, as I did need to extend them quite a bit.<br /><br />This is an attractive, subtle bra. It has a full lace overlay and appears at least a bit &#34;decorative&#34; while still providing adequate support and push up. For the list price of $19.99 for the configuration I got, I'd say it's a decent value for the price as well.<br /><br />I was able to purchase the Paramour by Felina Women's Temptress Push Up Bra at a discount in return for a fair, honest, and unbiased review of the product. The opinion above is strictly my own, and I was in no way influenced by Amazon or the seller. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."
4.0,Para shellac
4.0,"Actually purchased this adult costume for a child.  Still looked cute...just had to add suspenders to hold it up.  As other reviewers have said, the neck flops down and has to be held up.  But it was still a hit at Halloween with the child wearer and any audience."
4.0,"I love these gloves, however they run a little small.  I wear a 7.5 to 8.0 and they were a little tight. I will try cutting down my nails to help out.  I purchased both colors."
4.0,They fit as expected and are good quality. I accidentally made a hole in one ripping off the tag so be careful with that
4.0,"Bought a size up because there were complaints of them being too small. I could've used a size down and I was wishing I had a belt with me to hold my pants up when I was on the mountain! Overall, they kept me warm and dry so I can't complain."
4.0,Expected a little better quality.
4.0,"Generally very good. Would be perfect if the canvas sides were a bit more substantial so they would more easily remain upright<br />while placing the fire wood into the tote. Not bad, though."
4.0,"Very cute, casual, stylish"
4.0,"It was a cute ring, just enough sparkle to it. I gave it to my granddaughter and she liked it, it fit her good."
4.0,Looks pretty wears well!
4.0,Super cute but as with any jeans the tattered look will change and eventually become dingey
4.0,gifted it to a friend. She loved it. I thought it was a little long. Friend iis short.
4.0,Nice scarf but fuzz gets all over your clothes when you wear it
4.0,i read reviews before i purchased so i knew to get a bigger size. i got the 4xl i am 6'0 and 180 so normally i would get l-xl for my chest 36dd. good for price tho
4.0,Very pretty shoes that I got for my daughter. She loves it and it's good for a couple of hours at a party for example but not for long treks anywhere. She did that one day and got blisters on her feet. But overall they're comfortable and great for wide feet.
4.0,Important get the right size.
4.0,Nice sweater for the price
4.0,"BARELY fits an ipad air, you have to put it in at a diagonal for it to fit.<br /><br />Great for your every-day carries if you like to carry more than usual."
4.0,"Knowing that I'm a beer drinking middle aged fat man and I wear a 2XL shirt, I thought I had better order the 3XL apron. Glad I did too as it just barely fits me. If I was pound heavier I wouldn't be able to snap the buckle closed. I have all the straps stretched to their limits and it's still tight. I know I need to lose some weight but still I could use a buckle extender or something. As for the rest of the apron it's great. The length gets down below the knees, the pockets are good for those of us with large hands. I can actually reach into them to grab things.  Plenty of pockets for various things. It  also came with a stick sack and some shoulder pads. Overall a good product, I would say that whatever your shirt size is, go up one size with this."
4.0,"4.2* Pretty. I wish there was more ways to carry it, but any addition would probably ruin its looks. It is very deep, wide at the bottom,  but narrow through out. It fits a lot but it all depends what you want to carry in it.  Its size is a bit deceptive. I tried using it for laptop, books, and some other stuff. Not good for that for several reasons, but we'll see.<br />Edit: added 4 pics with my old 15 inches laptop.  This is the biggest that can pass by the bag's opening. The last pic shows the 15in laptop and my 13in macbook...spooning. I hope this helps."
4.0,"Loved the stretchiness and comfort of the dress but I'm only 5'0 and because I'm so short, the band right under the bust makes the body look a little too 'top heavy' (I'm a full 38C) so I returned it ... would recommend for someone taller or with a smaller bust."
4.0,Yellow ones are super cute! Fun shape and fit good.
4.0,"Super cute dress. I am  5'2&#34;, 140 lbs, bust size 34DD/36D, and I usually wear US size 6 pants or dresses, sometimes 8P, depending on the cut. I ordered the XL judging by the size chart. I could barely zip myself into it and once it was completely zipped up, it pancaked my breasts. There is definitely not enough room in the chest area. Otherwise, it's really cute and flattering. I love the style and think that it will be great for the winter holidays since it is green and, for me, well past knee-length. I reordered an XXL instead and hopefully, it will fit better."
4.0,"I'm actually surprised how much I like this dress, from the pic online I was expecting the print to be a grey/sage but it is more brown/tan.  It has a slip underneath the flowy layer so it is not see through- the slip is very fitted but it doesn't move around or ride up at all.  I'm short and curvy (size 10, 36dd) so I wasn't sure how the dress would look on but I really find it flattering.  It is especially nice with nude strappy sandals, but you could certainly dress it down with flats and a denim vest or jacket.  Since I'm short (5;3&#34;)  I can belt it without the slip showing but that may be an issue for someone taller- the slip is easy to remove and the straps are adjustable.  Light fabric, summer perfect."
4.0,"Nothings wrong with this band, it’s just a. Little too thin for my liking for a 44mm iwatch. It’s a good price for the band."
4.0,I would have loved it and kept it but the fit was odd.  Tight at the chest and loose at the hips.
4.0,"I love everything about this purse, the quality leather and craftsmanship, and  the perfect size. But.... the color is Not a happy Easter blue!  It is a gray-blue."
4.0,Shirt seems nice. Ordered one size bigger than normal and it still didn't fit.
4.0,Used for a costume.  Wore all night and was comfortable but then again I was also drinking all night too so who knows.
4.0,Love concept but bracelet is very big on me....disappointed about that.
4.0,"DBM should NOT have grouped FOUR DIFFERENT dresses together under ONE space--a polka dot pleated dress called BLACK--where as there is a short version and a pattern chiffon-looking dress with ""hanker chief hemming"", --- being called Black ONE and black TWO respectively.  Moreover, there was ALSO a PINK dress in this one and same category!!!<br /><br />[What criteria they used for grouping I wonder,; for having four rather different dresses in one and only one place for the reviews --- while clearly, the design and cut were quite different--- making all reviews to be ambiguous for each dress type .]<br /><br /> I have noticed that negative comments tended to land on those black dresses WITH number one or two--NOT at the Black only--without any number!!!<br /><br />My review is for the long black dress--labelled as ""Black"" only--- with pleated skirt and long sleeves with ruffles<br /><br />The dress was well-tailored with even  side darts.  It has been a long time since I last saw a blouse or a dress with side darts for the chest area ""to help"" full grown ladies. Had it been fully lined, I would have given a five-starred rating.<br /><br />It is well cut, well sewn, and well presented.--from Mrs. A. Webb"
4.0,I would give this five stars and order more except for the fact that the top is too sheer. Could easily make out the details of my bra underneath when I tried it on. I'll keep it since I believe it would be cute when paired with another top but wish I could wear it alone.
4.0,"The shirt looks and fits as described. It's a little thinner than I would like, but not too sheer to wear. I've worn mine with shorts, but it will also look cute with cropped pants this Summer!"
4.0,The strap has to be re-ajusted often and the mesh pocket made security question it but overall it worked for what I needed.
4.0,"This chain is exactly what I was looking for and is a good value for the price.  It is a dainty, short chain that will look best with a pendant rather than on its own.  I took off a star because the item was packaged poorly.  Although it is in a small gift box, it is just thrown in there loosely and the chain was in a tangled heap when I received it."
4.0,The grandkids love these!
4.0,"Works great for all my credit cards, cash and phone. The phone is a Moto X, and it just fits perfectly.  Very happy with the appearance."
4.0,I like it ... for my nieces... its beautiful
4.0,"These shorts run small so size up one or two sizes if you want a comfy fit (I sized up two sizes and they were just right) they are soft and stretchy enough to make them comfortable- but not too stretchy and thin.<br />The distressed look is OK, the areas where the holes are isn’t bothersome to me, but I could have done with a couple less holes.<br />Anyway: size up, comfortable, decent shorts for the price."
4.0,"It is as described, it is modern and elegant at once. The material is soft, it will require hand washing to last.<br />I liked how it feels sexy with the open design of the front.<br />I give it four stars because I think the sizes run a little small"
4.0,I was unable to keep it because it was too small.  I liked how it looked and it seemed like it could be comfortable. It was just not the right size.
4.0,"These are pretty.  They don't quite stay in place as the picture shows as they are only so tight against your ear, so you need to adjust them throughout the day, but a pretty option for the office without being overly fancy.  Can accessorize with lots of other jewelry because of the rose gold and crystal, so you don't have a gold/silver mismatch."
4.0,I would have loved it if it were a bit bigger. I thought it would be big enough to fit my computer but doesn't. probably should've measured my computer. Super cute though and matches with everything!
4.0,"I like this dress. It fits true to size and is flattering on my pear shaped body. However,  it is polyester and can hug the body's contours unlike cotton. It will show the body's shape even though it's a swing cut. Keep this in mind. I'd avoid buying unless you have prime and could possibly return. That being said, I have no issues with the fit and will be keeping the garment. I'm 5'9&#34; and a size 12 and I find that it is an appropriate length dress and not a top."
4.0,I like my dress but prefer it longer.
4.0,"The polarity on the keyring compass is reversed, not unusual on that type of compass, but disappointing none the less. The compass on the bracelet works fine. Everything else is nice and makes this a good deal."
4.0,"I love sweaters and always jump for ones that aren't the typical style! This off the shoulder sweater is so cute and comfy on. Not itchy, not too thin and not too thick. My only complaint is that the top of the sweater made to fall off of the shoulder is almost like a big circle and hangs a little funny. It is oversized with large sleeves so I would stick to your size!"
4.0,I bought these in black and they seem a little small.  I would consider these a mid rise.....when I bend over my backside shows a little.  They are tighter in my butt than in my waist.  The waist is actually perfect.  I kept them even though I'm not 100% happy with them bc of the above reasons so I'll just wear them around the house.
4.0,"The gown was as expected. Since it is a one size, I was happy to find it fit. The construction was good, though I felt the necessity to join the lace edging on the front and back approximately one inch to keep it from sliding from my shoulders. It is a tad long (I am 5' 5&#34; tall) but I think it makes a lovely train. My boyfriend loves it on me and that is the most important issue. I may buy another in black."
4.0,"I bought a Large, I am usually a small. Runs small, it's thick and heavy, not a flimsy dress. Bought it with a code for $2.90  so it was worth the risk!"
4.0,They are very cute and look great.
4.0,"Not as good of arch support as I expected, butt still has some support, and is snuggly for cold winter evenings and mornings"
4.0,"Really nice hat, but it’s entirely too big for me. I have a small head and short hear so it was not flattering on me at all. Seems well made and grey is pretty."
4.0,"Bought this for my sister , she had no complaints ."
4.0,This met my expectations for a face covering I could wear somewhat comfortably when required.
4.0,"Cons: the battery housing is pretty cheap, no charging indicator."
4.0,"Beautiful dress but it runs small. I typically wear a medium and it was too snug, it fit because it’s stretchy, but too tight to be flattering. I wanted to order up but they didn’t have it."
4.0,"Good value for the price.  Looks good on, but moves around a lot.  Get a tie clip."
4.0,"Great price, decent construction. Even if each one only lasts 3 washes, I feel like it's the same as an overpriced store name bra. Plus the straps are all adjustable, so could be halter, one shoulder, racer back, which was an unexpected plus. Super cute colors, smell a bit like the plastic bags they came in, but honestly one wash and im sure they'll be fine."
4.0,"I like to shop on amazon for unique accessories like this to incorporate into my original character cosplay shoots.  I used these for a self-portrait a couple weeks ago and I was really happy with how the pictures turned out.  The design of the visor is a little odd with the batteries being on the outside with no on/off switch.  Taking them in and out was kind of a hassle, but not too bad.  They're built pretty solidly besides that.  I like the design etched on the front.  The light this visor gives off is pretty good too for what they are.  Although that being said, it made it somewhat difficult to edit in Adobe Lightroom in a way that my face didn't look washed out around the light given off from the visor.  All in all though, its a solid 4 out of 5 stars."
4.0,"I ordered a small and it's bigger than I wanted even for a lose sweater I was looking for. I kept it though because it's super cute and cute with leggings and boots.  It's soft, comfortable and easy to wash. I wash cold and dry on low."
4.0,"My only issue is that the product description states “brand new in box” and this obviously was not the case. It’s supposed to be a 7 pack but ours only had 6 and one had obviously been re-taped with home tape. Unfortunately I had already ripped open the package. The ones we did get are great and fit as expected, Hanes is always a good brand. And I know I could have probably sent it back but since the package was torn open it didn’t feel right to do that."
4.0,A little smaller than I thought but it otherwise its great!
4.0,"perfect sexy summer dress. Light and flowing, great for this hot weather in CA. fits as expected. Love to wear this at the pool. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Very cute pair of everyday shades.
4.0,Runs a little small. Order a size up. Cute.
4.0,beautiful dress.. just too big!
4.0,smaller than expected.  color was nice.
4.0,Good design and sturdy
4.0,"this product is as advertised. the little fastener things are very easy to attach and detach, so one can remove a particular key or set of keys to give to someone else, for example. thus far, the fasteners have shown no tendency to unsnap while i am in transit, which was something i had worried about.<br />it is hard to get the keys on the individual rings of the fasteners, but then it always is a struggle to get keys onto a key ring. the product is sturdy -- the chain could be just a bit heavier, but it is ok. the end that  fastens to the circular part with the rings on it worries me just a bit, as i can see it breaking eventually, but it, too is ok.  and the clip that attaches to one's belt loop or bag seems quite strong.<br />the chain is not as long as i would have liked, but that is my own fault. i assume that the length of the chain is mentioned in the product description, and i should have taken note of it. this is a problem when i have the clip fastened to my belt loop, as it is hard to bring my bike key low enough to lock my bike lock without stooping, and hard to bring the key to my building's front door high enough to unlock that lock without standing on my toes. if i fastened the clip to my bag instead of to my belt loop, this would not be a problem."
4.0,Great shoe but the cleats on the back of the heel peal off the shoe when driving.  Maybe my heels are too narrow.  Otherwise very comfortable  and light weight.
4.0,"I like the concept of these but they are too big for my women's size 6 shoes and boots. I sit them upright in my boots if they are sweaty to help, but I don't feel they get the full benefit of the product without the full &#34;shoe&#34; fitting into my shoes and boots."
4.0,"I love the way this feels on my skin. The nylon fabric is so light and comfortable, will be great in warm weather. The easily removable lightly padded cups add great comfort and conceal the nipple, which nursing mom's know the struggle of hiding those is real. It also gives me extra absorbency if my nursing pads fail.<br /><br />I normally wear a 34c but I decided to get the large for extra comfort and future pregnancy. I find fits well the nylon/ spandex allows the bra to hug my bust just perfectly. The 3 row of hook and eye gives me great security and comfort. The straps are a little wider than traditional bras which is always a plus. The only flaw I've found is the straps are placed to far apart. I prefer if the straps attach closer to the clasp than what the Mirity bra provides. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Nice watch just wish they had instruction on how to set date each picture was different then the one i have
4.0,The dress fits well. The material is of high quality. The feel and weight will let you know that the value is a steal
4.0,Beautiful and high quality work. I had to send in measurements for this dress and was not familiar with how to measure for it. The directions seemed easy enough but when received it was too large so will need alteration. I understand that it probably the way I measured for it so it is no fault of the seller.
4.0,"i ordered it so it'd be big on me, but it's a little too big. nice color, though, and very warm."
4.0,Zipper could be better.
4.0,"These worked well for me for one Spring/Summer season.  I wore them for both running and yoga.  By summer's end, though, they had gotten too loose in the belly and I retired them.  I cared for them by washing in cold and air-drying best I can, but, still, they proved to last only about six months."
4.0,"This is a cute little purse! It holds my wallet, my diabetic meter and my phone. If I had just a tiny little bit more room it would hold my cigarettes!"
4.0,Well made. Good value for the price. The tail elastic is way too small. It barely fit around my 35 lb. child and it snapped a couple times. The ears are nice.
4.0,I am in LOVE with this shirt.  I added a heat transfer to the front panel and wear it often.  It washes well and is super comfy!  I bought another as a gift and will probably buy more in the future.
4.0,Yes I like it.
4.0,"These are well made lightweight earrings, but rather large."
4.0,"The pants and shirt was a shug fit across the chest , stomach area, maybe about a 1 1/2"" would make the outfit a more comfortable. The outer cape was perfect. The button holes on sleeves were to small, I couldn't button up the sleeves."
4.0,"This fits kind of strangely on me. I'm short, so the legs and arms are long on me. The waist in the pants fit more like a medium, but the hip/crotch area is so long I have to fold the waist over for them to fit comfortably. The top is loose, but not baggy, and covers my rear. So basically, the whole set is long and somewhat slim. I think if I had sized down it may have fit in the length, but would have been too tight. But, it is super comfortable, despite the odd fit, and it's made with a super comfortable material, although not as thick as traditional sweats. I honestly want to wear this set every day, just based on comfort factor alone."
4.0,I love the length. And the quality is pretty good.
4.0,"The style is cute! But the color of the flowers are dull, not vibrant as shown. I’m returning it and getting a different color."
4.0,"Good value, warm and comfy. Don't slip"
4.0,Very practice
4.0,Great for party supplies in a hurry!
4.0,"Not sheer, nice fabric, stretch fit and comfort are all spot on. Waist is big compared to the rest of the fit....I had to add elastic to keep them up."
4.0,"The belt is not made of great quality, but it served its purpose. While wearing the thing I almost lost it.  I dont know if it will stand the test of time and for the price I paid I would not purchase it again unless the quality was improved."
4.0,I really like this shirt. I just wish there was a tagless writing or something so you could tell which side is the front vs back.
4.0,This is so cute! I dressed it up with a simple pair of heels. I got a few compliments :). I had to take it to a seamstress though to give it some shape.
4.0,"Was a little small but, I ordered a medium and it was a little too small on the bottom. Gave it to my sister-in-law who is a small and it fit perfectly!"
4.0,They are pretty and do not irritate my skin
4.0,A tad small but I made it work. I just wish you could mix match the sizes for the top and bottom but I still love it either way
4.0,"This wristlet is pretty and holds a lot.<br />If my phone case is on the phone, it is<br />a tight squeeze to put it in the outside pocket,<br />but it still fits.  I do like ir."
4.0,"I did not liked the cut at the skirt part which devided the top from buttom portion, otherwise very pritty dress."
4.0,"Very light, delicate.  Can't tell you're wearing it because it is light weight.  I like that.  Cat is more of a rose gold color so it won't match with gold jewelry.  Stones well placed, doesn't look cheap."
4.0,I am 5’9” and it is long enough for me only problem one pocket was not completely sewn so has large hole  but other pocket is big enough for large cell phone. Also like how stretchy material is and colors are great
4.0,I love this suit for my 4 year old daughter.  Very cute and stylish. Wish I could find one in my size!
4.0,We got a lot of compliments
4.0,"The material feels good , but when stretched on legs it's see through that's the only problem."
4.0,My daughter loved these tanks so much that she stole them all from me! I will be buying more for sure. They fit as expected and hold up to my teenage daughter's standards. They wash well too. I do think the fabric is a bit rough thus the 4 star rating but not horrible.
4.0,My little girl loved the ring. Perfect fit for her. It looks cute. One of the earrings fell out but I just brought a better back for it. No complaints.
4.0,Exactly what I expected 👌
4.0,quite thicker than I thought but warm and great for winter
4.0,Look great but a little bigger than expected
4.0,"The Dress fits great, but be warned the dress becomes very hot because of the material."
4.0,"The bottoms were a bit slippery but after a few wears, they seemed to grip better."
4.0,This is cute but I find it fits small. I’m 5ft and 105lbs with a short torso and I find it a little small. Also it fits right on the chest area so if you have a larger chest and longer torso size up. I still like it even thou the color is different from the picture.
4.0,"This awkward design is actually easy to put on, even with one hand and the product performs well. I tried to use it in an industrial factory setting and this did not work out too well, the opposing ends slip, but it would be very excellent for an evening at the he-man gym or impressing the chicks on a mountain hike. Get a pair of them, otherwise it looks like you are covering up a dog bite or suicide attempt."
4.0,Very pretty skirt just as pictured. But way too long. I'm 5'3 and the bottom drags on the floor.
4.0,"Ordered this dress in an a L and XL but ended up returning both because it didn't give me the 'wow' factor I was looking for.  For reference I am 145lbs / 5'-7&#34; / 36DD / long legs / short torso.  I wanted the bodice to look on me the way it does in the picture.  Not a chance and I should have known better due to my bust size.  It was ultimately going to be a swim cover-up as there is absolutely no support for ladies with large bosoms and an open back means no bra.  It looked fine with my white bikini top just not fine enough hence the 4 and not 5 star rating.  There is a zipper in the back that assists with getting it over your hips.  The halter tie at the neck is long and adjustable.  The accent tie front and center is a nice detail but pulls up the front of the skirt a bit when you 'tie it closed'.  The bottom of the dress hit at my ankles, slightly higher that it shows in the picture but still gorgeous with my Ipanema sandals.  BEWARE the fabric is see-through when back-lit.  Technically both sizes fit, however, I preferred the fit of the XL as it looked more like picture in the bust area."
4.0,"The sleeves are about a 3/4 length, I was thinking they were long. Still really like the top!!"
4.0,"Cute, great quality and size is perfect but not as stretchy as I wanted it to be"
4.0,I think I was hoping the logo would be stitched embroidery instead of screened. I wear the sweatshirt and it fits as expected.
4.0,"I liked the earrings, quality seemed good, what didn’t work for me was the post, it wasn’t in the middle, so they didn’t hang right on my earlobe. I returned them"
4.0,I absolutely love the look of the glasses but they are really loose on my face.  If I bend over they will fall off.  Not sure if I'll keep them and just try to adjust or what I'll do with them.
4.0,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a very forgiving top. If you are self-conscious about your under-the-bra bulge at all, this garment will not hide it. I typically wear a size Medium top, and I ordered a Large. I could have even gone up another size for added comfort, and for the top to be less figure-hugging. But all that being said, it is a nice top for the price. The material is very soft and comfortable, but I would size up, if you are debating which size to get. Hope you enjoy!"
4.0,"Easy fit, easy wash"
4.0,"Nice fabric, very soft. Washed it many times no shrinking!"
4.0,Got these for my boyfriend because he's always looking for comfortable socks. He has to wear boots at work and he's on his feet 10 hours a day. He says he likes them and they were super comfortable. Would not get them again because they are expensive for one pair of socks.
4.0,"They are great, but I think the wolf can be better."
4.0,Warmest hand cover ever.<br />Can’t do much motor activity w hands due to bulk but well made w a sweet note from the nice lady who knits them.<br />Very nice touch.<br />I’d buy again.
4.0,"These MAFEEDSS Polarized Sunglasses are an okay value for the price. The fact that they are polarized and have darker lens makes them perfect for summer beach or boating on the lake. I ordered the orange but ended up with the green. I’m okay with that but if they were more expensive than they are, I would have sent them back for the right color. The frames seem pretty solid basic mat black plastic with no spring hinges. The accent color give them a pretty sporty look and will pop with a nice summer tan. The soft silicone nose pads were not included with the pair that I received either? The lens even though they are polarized are very thin plastic and will scratch pretty easily so you’ll want to keep them in the case when their not on your head. The included hard case in my opinion exceeds the quality that is usually included with a pair of $16 sunglasses. It has a magnetic closure and with its solid design will protect your glasses pretty well. Overall for the price of the glasses, case, silk pouch and cleaning cloth these should give you decent protection from the harsh rays and make you look pretty good while you’re in the sun having fun!"
4.0,"This fit my wife, and she likes it for casual wear around the house.  It's one piece, comfortable, and not warm."
4.0,Nice and warm.  A little larger that my other earmuffs so I don't have to yank and pull to get them around my ears.
4.0,"Super cute, it looks just like it does in the picture. It's just a tad bit smaller than I expected, but I'm still satisfied!"
4.0,"I love the look of this and the feel of the material, But I think I got a size too big."
4.0,My 9 year old loves this hoodie. He is a big Minecraft fan and wheres this constantly. It washes well and is durable. Only thing I caulk say ahas we ordered his size and it was small ordered up a size and that was perfect. and I think my son is on the small size. He just turned 9  and is 4 foot 1inch and weighs 55 pounds
4.0,Too many crazy angled seams
4.0,"I like that it's warm, and I love the fur collar. I wish the sleeves were longer."
4.0,"Chinese watch but using Japanese movt. (Seiko) All functions are working well, great in real. Cheap but not cheap at all."
4.0,"I bought an XXXL, Height 5'6&#34;, size 12-14, cup size 36DDD. The bottoms fit perfectly, but the cups on the top are somewhat small. It's not a huge deal, just be prepared to have to adjust if you have a large bust.<br /><br />For the price, the quality of the swimsuit is out of this world."
4.0,My granddaughter loved it. So far no issues.
4.0,"They arrived late and they ended right past my elbow so they rolled down a all the time so I had to constantly put them back into place. However, luckily for me, I didn't need it by a certain date. I just wanted them. If I had needed them by a certain date though, I probably would've given a lower rating because damn, they were almost a month and a half late. The materiel was nice though and it looked really pretty, and the price is great. I would suggest this to someone who needed it right away but if you have time to wait, it might work for you"
4.0,"Comes vacuum packed in plastic, so it’s wrinkled and shiny and needs washing before wearing. Once washed the material becomes amazing. Soft and not shiny and substantial and stretchy. Really nice and looks like a more expensive sweater.<br /><br />Would be 5 stars but there was a half inch of white seem showing on the shoulder that I had to hit with a black sharpie. Sounds strange but once blackened the sweater was amazing."
4.0,I USE THESE MASKS WHEN I GO OUTSIDE TO WALK I JUST WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE THICKER
4.0,"Very beautiful swimming suit, but for my 23 month old baby seize 2T was too small. It was so tight that my baby cried, so I had to take it of ASAP. My recommendation is to go with a size higher.wish I could change the size but they don’t have a flamingo one in 3T."
4.0,"I loved the deal of so many anklets for the price, but a lot of them wouldn’t go over my foot, and I wear a size 5.5 ladies shoe. All in all, a good price , but not what I expected for the size description. Many only fit my wrist."
4.0,"They are perfect. The size is bigger than what I expected, but still comfortable. The backs fit on really tight, so I have yet to lose an earring even when I am sleep."
4.0,"Ordered wrong size, item is as advertised. Easy return"
4.0,My mom loved me in this shirt!
4.0,These are good goggles one can see out of them well. Suction could be a bit better but then seem to work well
4.0,Very pretty.  Wish the clasp was better quality.
4.0,"They're well made and comfy. They cost a lot for what they are, but they're exactly what I wanted."
4.0,"like them a lot ,go well with next item Gotomore bracelet."
4.0,"LOVE this top. Fits me perfectly. Just better hope my arms don't get any bigger! Usually a Small, but ordered this in an XS. 5'2&#34;, 110 pounds."
4.0,"This dress is super comfortable and looks like it does in the pictures. However, it is see-through (i.e.: I had on white underwear and they were clearly visible). It'll probably just be an around the house dress, but I do like it."
4.0,"Very cute swimsuit. Runs small. The fabric is not as stretchy as other suits.  The rear lackss full coverage, not cheeky cut, but leaves a little bum exposed. Size up when ordering."
4.0,Yes they are very comfy! But should've gotten a size smaller.
4.0,"The flamingo head goes too far down into the fluffy body. Other than that, pretty good."
4.0,"Good product, but small size"
4.0,Nice lil outfit to wear on errands!
4.0,The product is too good for the cost!!
4.0,I'm on the fence about this one.  Love the design.  I'm 5'2&#34; and it hits me right at the knee.  I was a bit concerned about the vee but it stays in place and doesn't expose anything.  The seam where the top ends and the bottom begins hits me a bit above the waist so I'm not sure yet if I'm keeping it.
4.0,"Love this swimsuit, but it is tiny! I ordered a Large, but should have gotten an XL to accommodate the bust area. I will definitely order other prints, but in a bigger size to avoid any malfunctions! The bottoms are very cheeky but still comfy."
4.0,"I love this mask and get compliments on it all the time. However it did not come as pictured, instead it was an accordion mask and just a bit too big for my face. Unfortunately I have to move it every few minutes or I’ll have to find someone who can hopefully fix it so I can wear it more comfortably."
4.0,"Mine came in Good quality, as described"
4.0,"I love this suit, but it did leave me with a weird black stain on my stomach and legs the first time I wore it - It came off easily in the shower and once washed again i've had no issues."
4.0,"I got the blue ones for my nephew and they look great on him! They fit his face well (he’s a teen). These are labeled as polarized, but I’m not sure if they are really polarized. He doesn’t seem to mind as he likes the way they look on him. Adjusting the arms is very difficult with this brand though. I had bought him a pair of these from another vendor on Amazon and returned those because quality was terrible, the quality of these are really good! Shipping was fast too!"
4.0,Very comfy and fits true to size!! I think I will be ordering another color 😍
4.0,"I was very apprehensive when I ordered this dress but I am so glad I did. I generally wear a size 8 dress but ordered a large based on the previous reviews and it fits like a normal medium, so my suggestion is to size up. I am also 5'5'' and the large hit me about 2 inches about the knee, making it appropriate for a formal event. Sequins are stitched on so they don't fall off for the most part. Maybe a little cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. Overall, I would definitely suggest this to someone looking for a nice, gold dress."
4.0,Nice.  I like the sizes.
4.0,Necklace is very short but the pendant is lovely.
4.0,"While they are all very pretty, the packaging they used bent them in a way that made them harder to wear but nothing unfixable. The chains at the ends pretty much broke off the moment I went to test-wear them. Luckily I have a small neck otherwise it would have been a waste. For 10 bucks, they are decent."
4.0,It's a little too big so we will save it for next year.
4.0,"Purchased this item as an accessory to my 80's night outfit. The quality was okay, the color was true to the picture shown, and the shipping was quick. The cost of the shipping was a bit too high."
4.0,My  husband wore these when we met many years ago.  They have been very hard to find until now.  The glasses are inexpensive therefore the frame is not very durable but what do you expect.  It is all about the look.  The lens are very dark and work suprisingly well against the strain of the sun.  My husband is enjoying his nostalgia! Thanks.
4.0,Slightly large on me but I  really like it!
4.0,It is beautiful and nice...for myself....
4.0,"This was pretty cute, I am only returning because the torso is a tad short.  I never thought about myself as having a long torso, but I it is possible.  The top definitely needs to be tacked closed or taped in place, but it is supposed to be a little blousy.  I felt the size was fairly accurate on the #9 style.  I am 5'6 170 lbs and somewhere between a 14-16 pant.  I ordered an XL and it fit pretty well.  loose in the waist but I thing this needs a belt anyway."
4.0,Brought these in 4t for a small 4 year old and they fit him great. He loves them and has wanted to wear them every night since he got them!
4.0,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of this sweater. The sweater is quite baggy and I should have ordered a size down. However, I’m going to wear as a dress so it works out."
4.0,"It's absolutely gorgeous. I use it to cinch my shirts because I hate fussing with having to tuck them in all the time. Works well for that depending on the fabric.  I don't use it with the pin because I don't like the idea of poking holes in my shirt. It is a bit on the heavy side so it has slid down throughout the day on some shirts with smoother, more slippery fabric."
4.0,"It is an adorable cap! So many compliments when my son wearing this cap. But, I am not sure whether it is made of cotton inside."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my younger sister who lives for Supernatural. She absolutely loved it and put it on immediately! It is a little plasticy to the touch, but that doesn't affect the appearance. For the price you can't beat it. I would definitely recommend!"
4.0,I love this top and it fits me just fine. I haven't had any of the too-small issues other people mentioned. I would've given it 5 stars except it's super delicate. The sleeves are kind of like nylon stockings -- you have to put them on really carefully. It's actually a sign of how much I loved the look of this top that the first one I ordered ripped as soon as I put it on and I ordered a new one. But I hold my breath a bit every time I put on the sleeves.
4.0,"very pretty, but I wish the cord was a bit longer"
4.0,"Great price. 75% I really liked. Easy on and off and I have bigger hands. One broke, easy fix. All others very durable. No regrets buying."
4.0,The colors are not what was portrayed
4.0,"This is my first cycling jersey since I just started training. I loved the design, it was cool enough, and fitted me a bit loose in the middle (i like more fitted) but for the price it was great, no complains."
4.0,"Love them so far. Now to see how durable and reliable they are. If they suck, i will be back to complain. If not, they are great."
4.0,Very bright. Great dress for the price. My daughter just turned 4 and is wearing a 4t. The bow is not attached very well so I don't see it lasting very long. Overall I would buy again.
4.0,"Worked great for my costume as a rock lobster , I could still hold drinks . Had to air out the paint smell but would recommend."
4.0,This is super cute! Much prettier in person. Beware when shopping...it is on the shorter side so before purchase..check fit :)
4.0,"I ordered a large, they are a bit short & a bit tight. Not so bad that I would return them though. It's hard to find colors other than black. Note: I am 5'8"" and normally wear a 10/12."
4.0,Love love love this bathing suit. Fits good. The ruffles are a little annoying. But that’s fine. Two downsides. 1. Have to remove all when needing to use the restroom. 2. Doesn’t fit my chest the best. I’m a size 4/6 in bottom. Small shirt. But a 34D in the chest.
4.0,It fit fine.. It was to short for my height and shape!
4.0,work as expected even tho i don't wear them at night but works good in daylight
4.0,Very beautiful set of shoes for my daughter. The only issue is the jewels on them come off easily but can be put back on if you find them. These are used for play but can easily be used for a special occasion outfit as well.
4.0,Will buy again but
4.0,"Great for thick calves. Be careful removing the little pastic dohickeys, though. I pulled a few threads in one sock trying to separate them. Ugh, those things are annoying. Just use stickers instead so the product isn't ruined in trying to get it into a usable state."
4.0,I got these for yoga class and working from home. They’re very stretchy - I’m 5’5 165 lbs and ordered a large. They have 2 side pockets and a key pocket in the back. Not 5 stars because these let wind right through. Even walking to my gym from the parking lot in these had my legs freezing. So not a good option if you want to wear them out regularly and you live in cold climate
4.0,"I ended up returning the product as it seems to be not sized properly.  The upper arms fit tight in the size that I needed for the rest of my body.  I am a fairly average built, so size L should have fit correctly.  That is the size I wear in the short sleeve dress.  Additionally, I would prefer that the cotton used be a bit nicer.  The dress was a little clingy.  That, I do not like at all!"
4.0,I really like these sports bras. Supportive and like the colors especially the chamo.
4.0,"I had received another Jastore® clutch wallet (same price) for review purposes and the workmanship on it was much better than this wallet. This wallet has a crookedly sewn seam that allows one corner of the wallet to be in danger of pulling apart one day in the future. There were also loose threads on some of the seams.<br /><br />It is still a cute, useful wallet. I received the pink wallet. It is made of a textured faux leather and has tulips on the front of the wallet. It is trimmed with a medium-brown faux leather trim and there is a 1.5&#34; x 1&#34; piece of the brown leather sewn on the front with a picture of a young girl on it and the words &#34;Swim in the natural beauty.&#34;<br /><br />The inside of the wallet is a tan smooth faux leather. There are 11 credit card slots and a windowed slot for your driver's license or ID. There are also 3 long slots for cash or receipts or ?? That section of the wallet closes with a good strong snap.<br /><br />Next to the snapped section is a fully zippered compartment divided down the middle. My Samsung Galaxy phone fits perfectly in one side of the zippered compartment. It closes with a nylon zipper that has a gold colored chain attached to a brown faux leather tag. The tag is 1.5&#34; x 2 1/8&#34; and has a picture of the young girl on it, like on the front of the wallet.<br /><br />The wallet itself measures 7.5&#34; long x 4&#34; tall x 1&#34; thick (when empty).<br /><br />This is a fun wallet for the young ladies in your life or for those who are young at heart.<br /><br />I'm glad I received this wallet in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"It doesn't flair at the bottom when I put it on, but there were many who gave compliments when I wore it."
4.0,Loved the color & fit. The bottoms give more coverage than regular bathing suits which made me feel comfortable without wearing shorts over the bottoms.
4.0,"The workout comes when you try to take off these socks!  I don't have too much trouble getting them on, but they are not easy to get off, especially with my rough heels.  I had to wear thigh-high compression stockings in the past for a period of time, and I thought those were easier to get on and off.<br /><br />Assuming you are more adept than I, you probably won't have as much trouble.  These really do make my calves feel good.  I don't run very far, but I do walk and hike a lot, and these socks help.  My legs are not as tired after a long walk.<br /><br />Where I live, these are winter socks unless I am having an unusual issue and really need the extra compression.  They are warm enough that they won't be as comfortable in the hot summers.<br /><br />I was impressed with the upper band.  It didn't roll or pinch or move at all, just stayed where I put it, a bit below my knee.  The seam near the toe is a bit bumpy on the end, as with many socks, and I had to adjust them a little to make them comfortable in my running shoes.  Part of the issue might be that these felt just a little big on me.  I usually wear a size 7 women's shoe, and this size is supposed to go to size 7.5.  I think it would be better if small, medium, large, and extra large sizes were offered rather than small/medium and large/extra large.  I'm sure that would be more expensive, and with regular socks the two sizes wouldn't be a problem.  However, with this design, fit is important, and I think the sizes are just too limited.<br /><br />These do just fine with a regular trip through the washer and dryer.  I don't know if bleach is acceptable but I would avoid it because I'm afraid it could hurt the compression capabilities.<br /><br />Now, you aren't going to wear these under short pants unless you are going to an ugly sock party.  While I do like the way they make my legs feel, I can't say they are pretty.  I think the gray and the bright blue are to emphasize the different areas of compression, but they are a bit on the gaudy side.  Yep, definitely winter socks for me."
4.0,"If you have cowboy boots or horse riding boots, this product is perfect for easily removing the boots and not harming the leather.  I love it."
4.0,Light weight and fits great.
4.0,Fits great. Does bleed on first wash.
4.0,Works good and blocks glare from oncoming traffic but it's little too dark for night time driving
4.0,"I just got it and haven't even had the time to break it in yet, but Amazon is dunning me for a review so here I go.<br />The finish is good. In fact it is finished on both sides, which is in my experience, unusual.<br />Being new to non-metal belt buckles I have no idea how long the one on this belt will hold up, but I have hope that it will perform the same way belt buckles have always performed for me, which is to say... for decades.<br /><br />The only drawback, if it is a drawback, is that the belt arrived in a plastic sleeve and when took the belt of it, an apparently spare belt &#34;loop&#34; that was unconnected to the belt itself fell out on the floor. It is identical to the &#34;loop&#34; shown in the illustration, but there is no obvious place to use it and no instructions for its use were provided. I have assumed it was included in error and threw it away."
4.0,"This was perfect for pictures and for playing on her birthday. The tutu wasn't one single piece as I had expected - it was pieces of colored fabric tied into an elastic waist piece.  This wasn't a problem for me, I just felt like she needed some tights underneath so you couldn't see the bottom of the onsie. The onsie was perfect, even made it through a couple washes and still looks great. I wound up buying a different crown, but only because I wanted something a little more elaborate."
4.0,"Smaller than I expected it to be, more like a longish shirt than a dress"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ba45b99db6669c0bf5cd896dabd562ea]] The pants right leg inside seam is torn will need to return them and receive another pair other than the fact they are torn the fit is fine
4.0,Pretty and comfortable to wear. Would like a product like this with more support and the back designed just like this one.
4.0,"Wasn't sure this would fit a 5'10"" very thin person but fit great. He wears them daily only thing we are disappointed in is the feet are totally worn out already. This is March & he got them for Christmas. Too pricey to be worn out already."
4.0,The material is so perfect and comfortable! The dress did fit a bit larger but I am also in between sizes. I ordered a Medium and a Small would have most likely fit better. Def recommend very comfortable and super cute!
4.0,"This was the second time I ordered these, and was very pleased, I wish they were a little larger around the wrist in diameter, as its smaller opening limits its gift potential.."
4.0,"The ring fits well and looks great, especially the patterns and logo on the inside of the ring. However, it arrived with a few tarnish spots which I will have to remove with some silver polish cloths when I get a chance. This is likely due to the fact there wasn't any desiccant packet or other oxidation preventative in the package. Other than that, it should make for a nice addition to my jewelry collection."
4.0,"The shirt material is thick and very stretchy. For me I ordered an extra large (I'm 5'7 and around 160-170 lbs. and curvy) and found it to be a little too big when it first came, so I washed it inside out in warm water and it stink down to the perfect size! I have worn it and gotten plenty of compliments about the quote, and it's super comfortable. I would definitely recommend."
4.0,"Dress fit great!!  I am 5'8 and currently 200lbs in my third trimester.  Typically wear a large to XL and ordered this in a large. It has plenty of stretch and length.  I will say that if you have any rolls, dimples, or lace bras they will show through on this fabric.  It is just that kind of material.  You know, the kind of clingy kind?  Still loved it and would buy again."
4.0,"Good shirt, thinner than other hoodies which is exactly what I wanted. Only problem is that the pic shows a darker grey color and what I received is almost white."
4.0,"Cute but not what I was looking for, I’m very short and have almost no torso so it wasn’t very flattering."
4.0,"I've been looking for minimalist hiking boots and this one has earned a place on my feet.  I'd say it's less a hiking boot and more like a high-top tennis shoe.  The tread is weak but good enough.  The upper is mesh, rather than leather, which keeps it light-weight but doesn't allow for much water or puncture resistance.  My late fall and winter outdoor areas can be unexpectedly wet, have thorny plants and harbor critters like rattlers & scorpions.  I tend to do more off-trail hiking this time of year (hunting) so the huarache-inspired strap, iconic of this brand, and the mesh upper is a serious drawback.  I may have to keep looking for a good cool-weather boot.  However, for summer & early fall hunts, I expect that this boot will suffice.  Ground feel is good.  Construction seems solid enough.  It's light enough that I feel confident in taking it on 15-20 mile hikes.  For warmer weather, this one is going to be my go-to boot.  If Xero could make an all-leather upper with a higher top and a deeper lug-sole, I'd be sold.  In the meantime, this will do."
4.0,Smaller than realized. Otherwise beautiful.
4.0,overall like boot
4.0,I bought the kids size for my 5 year old granddaughter! Perfect fit! The price is a little high.
4.0,This is a nice looking band but not for me. It’s a little to wide for my taste so I returned it. I would still recommend it.
4.0,"First time that I use I overfill k-cup, made a little mess, but then figure out how much coffee to use in k-cup"
4.0,"For the price, this is a great dress - seriously.  I was looking at dresses in the $500 range and thought I would go ahead and check this one out.  I would have kept it had it been longer.  I'm 5'10&#34; and like to wear heels and it was too short - definitely hit the ground but wouldn't look good with heels.  Don't hesitate on this one!"
4.0,"Nice dress, very nice material, size perfect"
4.0,"I got a 6xl, wish I would have got the five xl. It's a little big along the top and straps. But otherwise is perfect. I love it, and got it right on time. I just know now next one to order in the size I wear and not go larger."
4.0,"Turned out to be a great gift, fit just right, no shrinking. Very happy."
4.0,I bought this mask for a cosplay all in all it’s really nicely made! The only issue I have with it is how you wear it. The straps to the mask aren’t adjustable so you gotta kinda maneuver it to to actually stay on. But that’s the only issue I have with it
4.0,"Nice bag.  Birthday gift for my daughter, she loves it"
4.0,"Attractive and functional mesh watchband. I was pleased to find this watchband offered with replacement pins and a tool for changing out the old band and installing this one. I've struggled before without having the proper tool. That issue is resolved with this helpful package.<br /><br />I did have to do some internet research to figure out how to adjust the length of the watchband. Apparently most mesh watchbands are adjusted in approximately the same way, by flipping up a clip on the clasp, under the main clasp clip, sliding the clasp to where you want it, and locking it back down. Simple, but it wasn't obvious to me and there were no instructions on this detail included with the wristband. Puzzling.<br /><br />No regrets. It's a quality product."
4.0,"It fits as expected ASSUMING you buy a size up. If your kids are wearing a 4, definitely buy a 5."
4.0,Fits a little too close. Fabric feels a bit thick. Nice design though.
4.0,"GREAT LOOKING, WELL MADE BUT FITS A LITTLE SMALL."
4.0,"They just didn't fit. I'm a 36C and the padding extended to maybe an 1"" outside the ""center"" of each side. They appear to be fine in all other respects so I passed them to my 13yo daughters who really love them."
4.0,"When I read some of the reviews for this, one thing people said to watch out for was the quality. When I opened these and tried them on, I was very happy with them. They were almost as nice as the $100 pair I have from lululemon. I have not yet washed them and have already noticed some poor stitching in one of the seams (as pictured). A little disappointed with that but otherwise, really great leggings. Just check for quality!"
4.0,"This is an extremely cute and flattering swim suit... Unfortunately when ordering a two piece you can't change the sizes and get a top smaller than the bottom. I knew the bottoms probably wouldn't fit if got a small and if I got a medium the top might be too big.. Being 5'4&#34; 130lbs, 34A bra, I decided to take my chances with a small. Although I can get the bottoms on, they are way too tight. Which is alright because I have a couple bottoms already and they look awesome with the top. The top on the other hand was a bit disappointing at first. I didn't realize the back has a bra like clasp so there is no tie and no adjusting.. fortunately it fit! The other disappointing factor was the seam that goes up the cup ended with a pooch that looks like a nipple! But still loving the looks of the top I took out the inserts and turned the top a little inside out to check out the stitching and to my surprise the extra thread that was unnecessarily in there was about an inch and I was able to cut it and it helped the &#34;nipple look&#34; a lot! I think if I had bigger breasts this would have pushed the material out more and helped but I don't so after altering a bit I'm very pleased!!! Like I mentioned already, ordering a two piece set is always a gamble when they are the same size but I wanted this suit for the top and it does look smokin' hot with bikini bottoms or boy shorts! I love that the fringe covers the stomach! I was fortunate enough to receive this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review but that doesn't change my true opinion in any way, just an extra bonus!!!"
4.0,Great necklace for the price.  I was surprised at the quality.
4.0,"Cute pants, material looks good and comfortable. You have to do the lace part, hole by hole. They run a little bit short, like 7cms from ankle. I'm 5'6 -<br />Weigh 140."
4.0,Quality made for the price.
4.0,"For as small as tne.medium/large fit, not sure if the larger sizes will fit. That's too bad because I really liked how they were looking. I guess I'll just look for so.drying similar."
4.0,"These are great, love the little butt detail to help accentuate. However. These are a THICK material. Thick. Hard to practice yoga asana in for sure. But they’ve got a great stretch and are pretty flattering. @RiniStrong"
4.0,These gloves work like a charm keeping my finger prints off of things when I'm out committing crimes. I just wish they repelled fluids a little better. I got the white ones and now they are stained red.
4.0,"Nice hat, looks good and fits well, but a bit firmer than the other hats of the same style that I have."
4.0,Looks good but has too much oil on them.
4.0,Great material and it looks great I felt like it was too large for me. It's worth trying it out Oh and the color was pretty nice
4.0,"The material is really soft and kind of silky, and the shirt us flattering and cute. I didn't give 5 stars because I'm not sure how well it will hold up after several washing. I've only worn out twice and washed it once."
4.0,Like the sweat shirt 👕 would like even better if price was lower
4.0,"This is a nice, cute dress...I wore tights because a bit short for my taste.  (Sz 16...ordered XXL)"
4.0,Nice but a little hard but not bad
4.0,Always get compliments on this dress when I wear it. Very flattering empire waist accentuates the body and the stripes are timeless. Love the black but would possibly buy again in other color. Is a little bit long but I am only 5'4&#34;.
4.0,"I was hoping it would be baggy, but since it only went up to a large in US sizes I kinda expected it to just fit as normal shirt would on me. It's a bit tighter than stuff I'd normally wear but it fits at least. I'm 5'6, it fits me okay I guess."
4.0,I bought this not really paying attention to size right and ordered the wrong size.. I’d recommend maybe listening them based off of the actual year and model rather then the 42 mm stuff you do. It’s rather confusing for some buyers. Other then that it’s super cute and wish it fit
4.0,Good quality  doesn't change color really cute .. the only bad thing is I struggled  a bit to put the L shape studs but ither than that great purchase!
4.0,"This dress is nice. A little tight in the sleeves.<br />After reading the reviews, I ordered a size larger than I normally wear. I’m glad that I did, because of the sleeves being tight. It is a very thin material and with the cutout design, it seems a little short. Just be careful bending over. I paired it with a cute belt and it added a little bit of flair. Overall I would recommend this dress. Order a size up though. I’m usually a medium and got a large. Happy with my choice!"
4.0,great gift for dedicated fan.
4.0,Nice match to the earrings.  Pleasantly surprised with the quality.
4.0,Love this dress despite it hugging my hips in a way I don't particularly like; the material is SO soft and the adjustable straps are comfortable and easy to use. The green is the same color advertised. Really like that it's completely reversible. Overall quite pleased with this.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:fa15c65f02094349b98cbdd988d31de]] This watch looks amazing, lot of detailing in the dial . I got small wrist 6.5 inch hence it fits ok , if you have 7inch or more it will fit you perfectly. Have a look of expensive watch and can wear it daily without any worries . I had problem with my watch clasp which was not getting locked but reached out to the manufacturer and he said he will send me a new strap that’s the only negative I can say about this watch hence no 5 star and gave 4 star ."
4.0,It was a little bigger than expected but it's still a great bag.
4.0,I like the shirt.
4.0,A little thin but they look good. Was a gift and she liked them
4.0,"Pretty colors, good tunic length, very floaty so it will be cool in hot weather.  Sleeves are never long enough for me, so I push them up a bit for a 3/4 length with great pom-pom details.  The only thing is, the whole collar area flopped around as it's thin with no support sewn in.  I ended up sewing on a hook and eye up near the top so now it stays put.  For the price, they could have done that themselves."
4.0,"The fit is nice, and the dress is very comfortable, but in the image the dress appears to be cotton, but it’s actually synthetic and the material is a bit shiny."
4.0,"Love the fabric. Extremely comfortable. The size was slightly smaller than expected. My shoulders chest and arms need a little more space than large in this particular offering. Normally Royal Robbins  shirts fit as expected. Still I’m tempted to give five stars because the fabric is truly more comfortable in the merciless heat and humidity of South Louisiana than other fabric I have worn. In fairness, the size large was closer to a medium in some ways, e.g., my over-sized guns ( biceps) will barely fit in the sleeves, so I gave this shirt a four-star rating in stead of five."
4.0,"nice quality, but didn't fit."
4.0,Item as described swift delivery wish it was a lil more discounted for such a small amount of gold regardless of the current price of gold.
4.0,"Really pretty necklace.  Definitely would buy again.  Only complaint, it took forever for me to get it."
4.0,Not bad liked it
4.0,Very stretchy and comfortable. And I like the material because it is easy to clean off if you spill something on it. Will be purchasing more from this seller.
4.0,Loved the dress but it was to small.
4.0,"These socks are great! I love the old Activision games!! I wish they would make more of these with other games, like River Raid, Enduro, Stampede, Pitfall II, Frostbite, Decathlon, etc... I'd get those too!"
4.0,Accurate description fast delivery.
4.0,"Ordered XXL and while there was enough material to fit me, the waistband was the size of a 10 year olds waist. I had to remove the stitching and the elastic and re-sew them without the elastic. The ankle elastic is the same, super tight. I'm 235 and about 5'1. I'll have to adjust the ankle elastic as well, but otherwise I love them."
4.0,I only ended up having to use one but lost one of the balls so it was nice to have a lot of extras. But i couldnt even tell i was wearing it. Very comfortable and flexible. I even wore it for a couple months after i was preggers since it was so comfortable. I would def recommend it.
4.0,"This is a cute, comfy top. My only complaint is that it is a little tight through the chest. I ordered an XXL. I am normally a 14-16/XXL/XL and 36 DD. I would prefer a little looser but will keep it because it's cute!"
4.0,"Nice band seems to be built hardy. Holes are a little rougher than some brands but overall the build quality is good,the hardware is good and the price is great."
4.0,I like these but the plastic moves around and and when you are running sometimes presses against your feet
4.0,"Loose fitting around arms, bow is a little odd because it’s just kind of there but doesn’t really look the greatest. Other than that this romper is adorable.<br />My daughter fit in a Large at 6-12m"
4.0,"I love the yellow tint ones, they make seeing while driving so much clearer."
4.0,Very nice gloves for the price. Their sizing guide said I should have gotten the xl glove but I went a size larger and was happy I did.
4.0,Works well to keep the dust out of my contacts. I do put a bandana to seal the breathing holes on the hop and bottom for extra protection
4.0,Great umbrella for travel or any place you do not want to take an bulky umbrella.
4.0,Comfort at work
4.0,"Arrived as expected, fit me well"
4.0,Cute on but could have ordered a smaller size.
4.0,"So, first of all these slippers are so cute! (I got the White pair with the &quot; X &quot; eyes.) They look basically the same as the photographs shown, however the right foot of mine kinda bends upwards, or back towards my body, for some reason. But other than that I basically got what I was hoping for visually.<br /><br />However, I do want to warn people that these are not very comfy. And for someone like me who wears their slippers basically 24/7, I really would not recommend these. They offer little support and after maybe three weeks of VERY regular wear, they started to get a little gross and almost wet feeling inside, and slippers sometimes do (I can't be the only one with this problem, right?).<br /><br />They are somewhat thin and the sole is hard, but not very durrable against water, so I would avoid wearing these outside. I got a similar type, but different brand, grey pair with a bow from Amazon before buying these and I liked those ones much much more.<br /><br />In short, you are picking cuteness over comfort with these guys. But for someone who wants them for just maybe relaxing at home sometimes or something, they'll probably work great!"
4.0,Fun top and had several compliments on it.  Great with white pants or jeans.
4.0,"Fit is a little wonky, I won't be ordering bathing suits online anymore."
4.0,Very comfortable nice fit.
4.0,Like: it soft and comfortable<br /><br />Dislike: that it little to big (but that my fault)
4.0,"Its cute and all and made fairly well, except the 3rd time she wore it the chain broke. Able to get it fixed, but now I don't see it too much."
4.0,I love this gown and wear it most nights. It's a little big (I ordered 2x) but I thought it would shrink... it hasn't after 2 washes. I am keeping it and will probably order another in a size smaller.
4.0,"So far there's a chip in my green aventurine. I don't know what the black stone is supposed to be and that is not white turquoise, it is really Howlite stone. So I do not know if any of these are real stones or glass or resin/epoxy. But either way they're very cute, perfect size and as long as the chain doesn't turn my neck green, I will give this a 4-star rating"
4.0,Es más decorativa que funcional. Igual me encantó. Es linda y ligera pero un po o ancha para mi muñeca. Si te dedicas a explorar nuevos mundos mejor compra una brújula profesional jejejej
4.0,Very cute just order one size bigger tight around her toes she loves them tho
4.0,"My son loves these. They do seem to run smaller than expected, will have to order a new pair for him a half size bigger as he got a blister from them being too tight. They seem well made and are light weight. I would recommend them but perhaps order a half size to a size larger. It's hard to buy shoes for online and have them fit perfectly so I'm not faulting the merchant."
4.0,Very cute dress! Larger than expected but nothing that can't be adjusted. Also very good quality fabric
4.0,"Love the pockets and not heavy. I bought XL and probably should have gotten a Large instead. It is a favorite of mine, so comfy."
4.0,"Great dress, material a little thin so u will need to wear a slip. Also the slit in back runs a bit to high up so I had to have it altered and closed."
4.0,"The fangs were good, a bit expensive for plastic fangs though."
4.0,Slippers are of good construction. Insoles labeled 14W and I had ordered 14M.  The slipper was sized at 14 M.  Why the difference?
4.0,"Great material, stretchy.. Feels comfortable"
4.0,Simple and somewhat unique are the characteristics I love about these earrings-
4.0,"Nice colors, soft material, going to wear in the summer"
4.0,"I liked the item for wearing during Virus outbreak as well as riding. However, this item for myself and my husband ran a bit on the small side. I'm hoping that over time it will stretch out a bit and fit a bit looser. the material is thin and can easily breath through it. I would not recommend this item for a larger head or face."
4.0,"I wear this cuff often now. It actually came in quicker than most comments said, so I was surprised! The detail is nice but it's nothing astonishing; it's fairly simple looking but I like it. Fits comfortably, but the rubber backing of the earring part is loose and comes off easily so often need to check and makes sure it's not coming out. Other than that I love this earring. =)"
4.0,I like the fit and stretchy comfortable feel of these shorts  They washed up nicely.  Deeper pockets would be nice. I bought an XL
4.0,Cute pajama. I'm 4'11 and ordered an XS. Fits perfect. Comfortable and washes well. Would buy another set.
4.0,"I got 2 dresses in blue floral and white/pink/black floral. The patterns are very pretty and the fit is perfect. I am a curvy 10/12 and a medium fit perfect but more like a body con dress. If you want it to look a little more on the loose side like the models, you may want to size up.<br /><br />Although I love it, I am contemplating returning it because it’s not a very breathable polyester. The point of getting a dress for the summer is to have something light and breathable. I may end up returning one and keeping one to see how it does."
4.0,It's really cute! But just be aware that there is some major side boob.
4.0,Nice watch but the band is soooo small. Came with the battery. I have to get a larger band for it.
4.0,Haven't worn them yet but I anticipate liking them.
4.0,Great if you have tiny dancers.  Bought for my tiny granddaughter she loves looking like one of the big girl ballet dancers
4.0,"I was not sure what to expect about the quality, but it seem well-enough.  I've stretched well over a dozen pair of the wife shoes without disappointment so far."
4.0,Lovely. Lightweight.  Elegant.
4.0,Bought these as a Christmas present for my wife.  She absolutely loves them but they did shrink in length about 1.5 inches.  Maybe low heat dry or hang is in order
4.0,"Very cute top! I love the colors! Goes great with dark jeans or navy slacks for work.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it’s pretty thin so I wear a tank top underneath, and I don’t really like how the shoulders are mended.  But overall it’s a very cute top."
4.0,Amazing feel against the body<br />Looks very sexy on.<br />I’m a plushie so to my plushie ladies as you can see I’m very hippyish but my waist is a little on the small side not like it used to be but smaller then some plushies<br />So getting the bottoms up was a struggle but once on very very comfortable!<br />If I was able to go up a size like I always do when I online shop it would have been perfect!!!<br />But I had to order my actual size which was the biggest the 2x<br />I feel like when I have to do business it’ll be struggle to get off because of how tight it was getting in but fits comfortably on my waist.<br />It did not hurt one bit<br />I also have a big back side as well so the back of it rises up a little and I hated that but over all still decent buy if I loose more weight it’ll fit how I want it too.<br />I absolutely loved the top it fit my breast perfectly.<br />So I say if you can go a size up if you are very hippy and curvy like me.<br />Best of luck plushie bae’s
4.0,"These socks are super cute and good quality, but they're too small for my 9.5 feet."
4.0,"Great deal. Not the most supportive, but the most for this price."
4.0,"One of the best quality pants on market, but doesn’t work for protection my butt ( snowboarding)"
4.0,Good wallet. Bad chain
4.0,Love these! A little thin and see through so I don't recommend the white but very nice looking and comfortable for running.<br />They seem well made and they breathe and dry quickly.
4.0,"thinner material than I thought it would be. but still of good quality! great price. It ships from China, so don't expect to have it in 2 days, although it was delivered in 8-9 days after it was ordered."
4.0,"My son is quite happy with these and we both love the buckles on the back.  I looked quite a while for some that could also act as sunglasses when on the tube behind the boat...they aren't really that dark and only so-so as sunglasses, but he thinks they are super cool so is happy to wear them anyway."
4.0,"I liked a previous bamboo sock from Caraloha better as it had the palm trees on the side.  This particular style is OK, but not as wide in the ankle area and binds a little bit.  I hope it will be long lasting.  The previous kind do not last very long for the cost.  They got holes in the toes fairly quickly.  I'll have to wait to see what the longevity of these are.  I love the feel on the foot.  They keep my feet dry.  They wash up very nicely."
4.0,The 12-14 was slightly large in the torso - re-ordered one size smaller.
4.0,Soft and comfortable.  Flattering neckline.  Runs small and shrinks when washed.  Size up one.
4.0,"So far so good.  They're warm, comfortable.  The only thing I have to say about them is they look like cats, not bunnies ..but , all in all, a good buy.<br /><br />Ok, it has been a month and now they won't stay on my feet.  Buy one size smaller so when they stretch,  they'll stay on."
4.0,The fabric feels amazing! The sizing is a bit off considering I've bought other pajamas of the same size these run a little small. If you're busty you might considered going up a size. The L was pretty fitted. I'm a 38D for reference.
4.0,My wife loves this coat. Very warm she said and comfy
4.0,"These are great socks! Well made, cute and comfy! They wash well too! The only reason for 4 stars is because the company sent the wrong color. I couldn’t return them, it would take to long. So they gave me a 10% refund."
4.0,Basic Tshirt. Decals look like they will hpld up in the wash.
4.0,The top is cute. Sleeves are not blousy like shown in the stock photo but cuff is long. I ordered a medium to be safe and like it a little bigger. More of a tee material and lightweight but not see-through.
4.0,has held up well
4.0,Bottoms are smaller than anticipated but overall cute swimsuit
4.0,Little smaller than expected. Really pretty though
4.0,Super comfy! Made well & very Cheap
4.0,My husband really loved this jacket it is the perfect weight for a chilly day. He says it is comfortable to wear a fits right. I ordered him the small. He normally wears a small top and had a 31&#34;waist. I saw other reviewers complaining about the sleeves being short but they got him just fine. The jacket feels like a neoprene and has plenty of pockets. There is also a hood that is attached to the jacket.  The fabric is really nice. The zippers could be better. He is very happy with the look and comfort of the jackets.<br />I received the jacket at a promotional price in order to evaluate it and to share my honest and unbiased opinions.
4.0,size M is too large for asian
4.0,"Comfortable, fit as expected! Not much shape but good for a night out"
4.0,"Others said these run large.  I found the opposite.. they seem a bit tight but are okay without socks, plus they will stretch some I am sure.  I normally wear 10 to 10.5  and ordered 10 based on what others said.  I would probably have ordered 11 in hind sight since they do not come in 1/2 sizes.  Good value.  I have 3 pairs of Tamarac now, like them all.  They have become my outdoor pair, my pair for when I come indoors, and now my special new pair that I want to keep looking that way for a while.  Probably only make it a month before I walk outdoors into the michigan snow though"
4.0,"This product is easily my most used bag. It's light, portable and a half-decent size for my everyday use. The only issue with it was the length of the straps. If those were longer than 5 stars. I've since replaced them with paracord [highly recommend for anyone who ones this product] and now it is perfect."
4.0,"Good product, had a small hole in one of the pockets and lost a key. Overall good."
4.0,"It is a nice  cover-up for the price, however the material is cheap."
4.0,Absolutely love it. The material is nice and I like how thick the skirt it.
4.0,Color more of aqua than true blue but still pretty hat
4.0,"These Les umes pants are super cute and fashionable. They are black, flair legged pants with a colorful ribbon down the sides. They seem to run a little large and are a little long, so you might want to wear them with some heels. The material (a cotton/polyester blend) is thick, jersey like material (kind of like sweatshirt material) but is very comfortable. There is an elastic waistband and pockets. You can wear these with a sweatshirt or blouse. My only criticism would be that they run a little long, so the taller you are the better these would probably hang. Overall, these are worth 4 stars."
4.0,I like and do not like this for multiple reasons. Blouse is sheer and flowy. Practically never wrinkles even if it falls off the hanger (which it will) and sits on the closet floor for a bit. No wrinkles. The buttons in the back gave it an interesting silhouette and more than one way to wear. The material is almost like crepe paper but surprisingly has not ripped. Very slippery material need rubberized hanger or slotted for ribbons.
4.0,This is great for $25. Medium sized bag with lots of pockets. The straps are thin but it dies the job.
4.0,"Good jacket, I would buy this again."
4.0,"5’6” 130 pounds, ordered a size medium in black. They fit perfect and are super comfortable. However they are a tad see through when you bend over. I just wear long tunics or flannels with them. Glad I ordered a medium instead of a small. Small may fit better but I’m sure you would be able to see through them more with a tighter fit. Would buy again."
4.0,"This review is for the Foxnovo 5 piece disposable raincoats with hat cap. This raincoat pack is so convenient my family and I used them this past weekend. I like the fact that you get 5 raincoats for the price which works perfectly for the number of members in my family. However these are adult sized so I  had to tie the bottom of these on my kids, which is no problem just a heads up. They fit my husband and myself perfectly which is great,  easy to dispose of these, I recommend these for people who dont want to have to worry about lugging, losing umbrellas.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review all opinions expressed in this review are from my own personal experience with this product.

4.0,Wish they would show a side view of the ring. It sticks up higher than I would have liked. But overall the ring is beautiful. If it had a lower profile it would be a 5 star!
4.0,I wanted something that I had a sleeve and links and was respectable but still cute and trendy and this was the perfect fit
4.0,"Cute bag, lots of compartments. The material will wipe clean easy."
4.0,The watch is high quality.  However I had to return due to the watch band pins coming out.
4.0,"Very warm. Not scratchy, very comfortable.  Love the product"
4.0,Nice comfy and lightweight robe.
4.0,"I feel like I received a high end designer set of glasses.  They come in a zippered hard case, caribener clip included and soft cleaning cloth.  Soft rubber ear pieces keep them from slipping.  When you open the arms up they appear to be small but they're designed to pull open and apply a slight grip to your head.  They're coming off by accident.  The lenses are crystal clear and wrap so your peripheral view is protected as well.<br /><br />Included are very specific care instructions in order to maintain the anti-fog capability.  One area of care is slightly confusing.  The instructions are very clear, ""DO NOT clean the lens with water...""  then later it instructs that every 2 weeks you should wash your lens with water.  huh?  That aside, these are top quality safety glasses.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After a couple of days of wearing these I'm sorry to say that I have to pull a star off the rank.  There is a slight distortion in the lenses that give the impression that they're prescription.  It might be distortion from the wrap around design but it can be disorienting at times when you move your head.  Maybe I'll get used to it."
4.0,"This little choker is so cute! The tiny triangle is a nice, minimal touch. My only complaint is that it's a little too large for my neck to sit up where a choker should (vs at the bottom with a necklace). It's not adjustable unfortunately but it still looks amazing so I'm not complaining. The best part is that it's not made of leather, which tends to wear out faster and is also not suitable for vegans/vegetarians. Overall, I love this!"
4.0,"Very pretty, but the lace on the back is upside down."
4.0,Overall it is a cute shirt for the price.  Although I would say that he runs a little big. I am normally a L to XL so I ordered a Large. This fits like an XL to XXL . if you have a small chess I suggest going 1 to 2 sizes down. Bigger chest I would just 1 size down. I think after one was it may shrink and if would be just right.
4.0,"IT IS A NICE LOOKING WATCH. FOR ME IT COULD BE A LITTLE SMALLER, BUT I THINK MOST OTHERS WOULD LIKE THE SIZE."
4.0,"Gives you a little lift, not too tight. A good bra for non-sports events, just kicking around, or when you're going out and want to be comfortable. I love that this isn't super expensive, so you can stock up on them. I wasn't too fond of the cup inserts, because they didn't give much support. I took them out. Otherwise, well worth the wait."
4.0,Snug in the shoulders and hip area. Otherwise fits as expected.
4.0,This hat fits big...I usually buy Black Clover hats that seem to always fit perfect.
4.0,"Fits a big small but super soft and I love the colors. The length is perfect... Covering the butt of the issue Should!,"
4.0,"The belt is fine. It's a bit loose on me and I don't have a tiny waist, so be aware of that before you order it. The belt buckle on the belt I received is VERY brassy--not what I was hoping for. But it's totally fine for what it is. Arrived relatively quickly too."
4.0,Very comfy. Keeps my feet warm.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised. I usually were between a small and a medium and after reading the past reviews I decided to get a large and I am glad I did, it is the perfect size I know I have to be careful when I wash.  Quality of it is better than expected as well."
4.0,I ordered the green. It looks way more vibrant in the picture. It looks more like a pastel green but it is a good quality so I will keep it. I ordered the XXL and I normally wear a L-XL. It fit okay but I had my daughter who wears a M-L try it on and it fits her even better.
4.0,"Bought these for my husband....he loves them! Soft, comfortable and breathable. Great quality."
4.0,Very cute top but go up a size it runs very small.
4.0,Fits as I had hoped.
4.0,"My expectations weren't set high for such an inexpensive dress. That said, I'll probably wear it when I can't find something else a little more flattering. When I pulled it over my head I hesitated because it's that kind of material that doesn't have much give to it, but it does stretch a little bit- I say hesitated because I've been known to get stuck trying on clothes that go on easily but not off for that reason and it's not fun (or am I the only one who has panicked in a fitting room?). Anyway, it's comfortable, like a less stretchy t shirt material but sitting on the crocheted part is a little irritating. The sleeves hit my right at the wrist and it's slightly tent-like, but it moves nicely. It runs big, but it does hide my mom belly nicely, I wish it were slightly more form fitting/flattering. I like the crocheted hem, it's better quality than I expected and pretty much the reason I bought the dress. I bought a size Small. I'm 5 foot 6 inches, between 125-128lbs. I'm smaller chested (36b with a bra) and carry most of my extra weight in my hips and thighs."
4.0,"This dress is so beautiful! The pattern is bold, I ordered mine in navy blue and the brighter colors really pop against the darker background. There are small loops and knotted fabric 'buttons' to fasten around the collar and the front of the dress and an invisible zipper that runs down the side of the dress. I've never seen a zipper sewn in like this, when I say it's invisible I really mean it. You can't tell at all that there's a zipper there, even when you're looking for it and know its there. They have it tucked into the seam in a way that completely hides it from view. The slits up the side of the skirt are modest but look really cute.  I live the traditional look that this dress has. I only wish that the fabric had just a bit more stretch to it. For reference I am 5'5 147lbs with measurements of 36-29-40 and usually wear a size 9-11 in pants. I ordered this dress in L and it still doesn't quite fit my hips well at all so if your hips are as wide as mine I would say to pass on this one. It's absolutely gorgeous but until I shed a couple more inches from my hips I won't be able to wear this dress. I knew by reading the size chart that ordering this was a gamble but it's so beautiful that I had to try. Final thoughts: if you are smaller than I am I highly, HIGHLY recommend it. It's sewn beautifully and looks gorgeous. The silk is soft and beautifully patterned and the traditional cut and design make it a really cool dress for all kinds of occasions. If your measurements are larger than mine I would have to recommend you pass on this because probably won't fit. The size chart is correct it should be easy enough follow. Hopefully my experience will help you make the right decision.<br /><br />I did receive my dress as a free promotional sample for testing and evaluation. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have about the product, whether it be positive or negative. I welcome both positive and negative feedback as well. My review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions of this dress."
4.0,"These stay put nicely; great threads.  They are a little irregular in the glue-job,  which leaves a couple of sharp spots in the settings and slightly offset stones.  I bought a whole bunch thinking I'd need replacements for lost balls that came unscrewed, so I picked the good ones, and I'm hanging on to them, which is better than my original replacement plan."
4.0,"I truly love these pants.  The only reason that I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is because they sent me the wrong color; (I got Navy Blue instead of Grey).  I decided to keep the blue because, let's face it, who doesn't need a nice pair of blue slacks.  Sadly, I can not find the grey on here, so... that is is.  But these slacks are pretty awesome."
4.0,"I love this dress. It has a nice sleeve length and neckline. Buttons are easy to open/close.  My only complaint is the length. It is ridiculously long. The hem is hot a straight line all the way around. It is linger on the sides. I had it hemmed 6 inches and it still touches the floor on the sides. I also added buttons to close some of the gap on  the legs. It is so comfy, light and breezy and I love the color."
4.0,Nice for the money got 3xl should have got 2xl
4.0,I was disappointed in the smallest band. It was like it wasn't completed (full circle). I'm afraid it will break soon.
4.0,"Love this purse. It's beautiful. At times it is a little on the heavy side though (it could just be me) . But other than that, it's a great purse"
4.0,"This is a really cute bag. It was bigger than I expected, the extra shoulder strap is also very cute and comfortable."
4.0,"My sisters and I ordered four of these costumes to wear during an honorary program for our father, who is a WWII pilot. Although we are different sizes and figure types, these seemed to accommodate each of us pretty well, particularly because of the elasticized waistbands. (One sister did use an office clip in the back to take up some slack.) We were surprised to see real pockets sewn into the jackets. The only downside was that the buttons were loosely sewn on and several of them popped off. Keep needle and thread handy! They served the purpose though, and our father was delighted to be serenaded by his daughters in these outfits. I would recommend this product."
4.0,"Of the silicone rings I have tried, I like the texture/feeling of the Enso brand most. They are super comfy."
4.0,"Good product, I’d buy again."
4.0,"As a 6' tall girl, it's a bit difficult for me to find girls button down shirts with sleeves that are actually long enough, so I usually buy guys flannels for the length. I got this shirt in both red and white, size medium (US 38), and they both fit pretty much the same. However, they weren't quite the material I was expecting (not as soft) and both the sleeves and hem are barely long enough. However, had I gone up another size they would have been even looser in the torso. I'm letting them air dry to avoid shrinkage when washed, and they're still quite comfortable. Just a tad short."
4.0,"Nice, comfortable but thin. I wouldn't wear them with a short shirt. I only use them with long maternity shirts that go down to my thighs or dresses."
4.0,These were cute but pricey ($29). I gave them as gifts and my friends liked them
4.0,"Overall it is a very good sweater, warm and loose (I like loose). My only problem with it is that the sleeves don't quite reach my wrists, and I generally like the sleeves to be too long, or at least to easily reach my wrists."
4.0,It was very smooth and pretty. It was one-sided. The mask was completely linen and it does not stand firm. There is no dress that come with it. Overall the wings are awesome.
4.0,Dad likes it!!!  It is loose on him and does blow off but he doesn't mind that as he says it is the lightest and airiest hat he's ever had.
4.0,"Fit perfectly, but would be better if they had the house words on them"
4.0,"If you want it big,, buy it true to size, if not but it a size down"
4.0,The shirt is great. Very comfortable and looks great tucked or untucked. I would say they tend to be a tad snug in the elbow region but other then that that shirts great.
4.0,I loverreeee this ring it wasn’t expensive and it looks like Pandora’s feather ring!!!!!
4.0,These shoes wear and feel really nice on your feet. Good cushioning and support. I use them as a house slipper. I'd buy another pair if I had to.
4.0,We loved these frames but unfortunately they were a little too strong for my husband so we had to return but they come in a really nice box and look great!
4.0,This strap looks great and has a very strong leather smell. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the strap is pretty thin. But it still looks great.
4.0,This scarf is very different. It is long and beautiful. You can not wear it as a wrap but it looks cute as a scarf.
4.0,exactly what we needed - until the puppy chewed them
4.0,"These earrings are made with quality gemstones and silver. I wear them every day. They can be dressed up, or down. Definately worth the $$. You won't be dissapointed."
4.0,It came stained! I’m so upset too because I planned to wear it to my sons graduation and now I don’t have time to order something else.<br /><br />Edit: I raised my star rating from a 1 to a 4 because the company who manufactured the dress reached out and apologized for their mistake with the stains. Anytime a company goes out of there way and acknowledges their mistake I appreciate it.
4.0,"For the price, you get a true merino wool underwear that is true-to-size and that doesn't feel itchy when wearing. However, the fit and softness could be better. Merino.Tech makes great T-shirts. Meriwool makes great underwear. I ordered Meriwool underwear shortly after ordering this Merino.Tech underwear, and I have to say there are some minor differences that make Meriwool supreme in the underwear section.<br /><br />As a company, I have to say Merino.Tech is disrupting the merino wool market because their prices are very competitive and the quality of their products is comparable to that of their competitors.<br /><br />Time, end user wear and tear, and end user wash cycles will be the greatest factors in determining the life of these products."
4.0,"Fit well, likes the white for sneakers, feel fine."
4.0,"The underwear itself is a nice color, and it feels very comfortable. However, I am a nurse and realized that after wearing for extended work hours, I noticed I was sweating more than usual in my perineal area. The underwear eventually felt sweaty, so I am unsure how breathable the material was. It stretches considerably, and the feeling is smooth and comfy, so I have been wearing it when I do not need to be working for twelve hours straight."
4.0,"I like this necklace-very inexpensive! It adds a little glam to my outfits. Close up, you can tell it's not very expensive, but who looks at your jewelry close up? Suits me just fine."
4.0,This is a very cute bracelet but some of the bands are put in looser than the others so they don't fit properly when the latch is hooked. Other than that love it.
4.0,Fits and looks good with the slacks I have.
4.0,I was skeptical about this fitting me.  But the sizing is good on this item.  I may change it to I love it-- once I actually wear it.<br />It's a bit too warm right now to be wearing this jacket - but this was on sale- and I tried ordering it off a tennis clothing web site and they were sold out in my size.  I really like the material and the fit.  I am sure I will get a lot of use out of it come Spring and Fall and probably even Winter.  But I will not be wearing it yet for Summer.
4.0,So far I have worn the 2 on the top and like them. No issues at all
4.0,They are a gift for someone else. I can only presume they are good as that was what was asked for.  Merry Christmas
4.0,Cute small bag. Print slightly different than what's pictured but is still wonderful for my needs.
4.0,"They fit, just a little short legged but I enjoy them when I wear boots, thank you."
4.0,I like this style belt. Had a few similar ones before and needed another.<br />Does not slip on you yet it allows for any length to be used rather than being forced to use indexed sizes.<br />Only thing is the end is reinforced which seems nice but it can make completely opening it difficult sometimes.
4.0,"it will be broken, if you dont be carefully"
4.0,"I hesitated to buy these replacement bands for my Apple watch; they are significantly less expensive than any watchbands I've purchased before.  I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they are. I can't attest to durability yet, but at this price you can afford to replace as frequently as you want."
4.0,"A gift from the grandkids in my dads favorite color. The material wasn't what I expected, but at that price I wouldn't expect too much. It does what it says fits his head and will keep a little chill off."
4.0,Cute. Definitely need good nipples for these guys to stay on. Instead of coming with a larger size they should come with a smaller one or maybe three sizes. Can’t imagine anyone needing the bigger ones???
4.0,"It's cute. I do have a large wrist and it did say it would fit an 8 inch, but it's tight."
4.0,"I love the dress.  The fit is a little big, but it's comfortable."
4.0,Very nice. Runs very large.
4.0,"Doesn't fit as loosely as I would like but fit is ok.  Disappointed in pattern.  The picture shows a good portion of the pattern in front, however the top that arrived had only one flower at the bottom on one side.  The rest of the front is solid pink.  Little more pattern on the back.  Would recommend if you are ok with pattern not being as pictured.."
4.0,"Very beautiful, but hard to tie on. My fiance loved it!"
4.0,"These are good imitation stones, they look real and hold luster. I think the 8mm were too big for my ears so I'd make sure you measure or have something to compare to before ordering."
4.0,"These are good quality leggings, they don’t slide down during exercise and are comfortable.<br /><br />However the pictures shows a deep dark red, closet to red wine, whereas the leggings are very bright red - see attached picture. The long sleeve shirt this brand offers that looks the same colors in the picture is the deeper red, so they unfortunately don’t match. So keep that in mind.<br /><br />Otherwise I can recommend the leggings. The black one was black, no color discrepancies there. The stitching on both is excellent.<br /><br />Recommended with the warning about the misleading red color in the amazon product page."
4.0,"I like the sleeve and the zipper pocket.  I got a large and do not have large arms, but felt the area at the bend in my elbow may be a little snug especially with the seam there.  I would consider ordering a size up unless you want it to be a compression sleeve."
4.0,Very good quality for the price. Love it
4.0,"Great value For your money! These underwear are a tad thin, but overall great product. They do run a bit small so size up."
4.0,"These are cute but pretty basic open cuff bracelets.  There are three but each is ultra thin.  The design is cute and I had no tarnish marks while wearing.  You can easily compress these to close more firmly on your wrists.  Light weight , I don't know if you would notice if these came off while wearing them.  Overall, just basic."
4.0,Shrunk after washing and a little too short for maternity.
4.0,Lovely necklace. Chain is far too thin though.
4.0,Nice ring.  Runs small and I had to return.  Quality seemed ok.
4.0,This was shipped gas and it is very pretty.  It's a gift and we are happy with this purchase.
4.0,I love these but the sizes run bigger. I got a small and would swear it was a medium but they are soft and worth money
4.0,ok for my legs support.
4.0,Nice watch. looks good on my wrist.
4.0,"Weren't quite as tiny as I was hoping but they're still very small.  I was looking for something that was flush against my ear lobe and these leave a little gap.  However, they're very pretty and seem to be good quality, I just have little lobes."
4.0,Too large. Co. Very nice about refund
4.0,"My second D jacket. The first one is a summer jacket (forgot the name) and size 48.<br />The Laguna Evo (non-perforate) is about 1/2 size larger without the thermo-liner. With the liner, it is a good fit, but still not as good as the summer jacket.<br />The Shield G2 back protector in the summer jacket also fits in the Laguna Evo.<br />Overall, a very nice jacket for the price."
4.0,I wish the sewn emblem was a bit smaller.
4.0,Read this carefully it is ONLY ONE SOCK.  I did not read it carefully so not only was it super late arriving like two weeks late but it is a single sock.  So now I had to pay shipping again to order the other sock.  My fault for not reading it but who buys one sock?  Yes I get that some people’s jersey number is double digit and they need two different numbers so it makes sense that you would select two different numbers but socks sold separately?  I am seriously hand slap to forehead.  Sock does appear to be decent quality but of course we can’t test it out until the next order arrives which hopefully won’t take weeks and weeks like this one did.
4.0,It’s a feminine nightgown with a lining so it’s not see through. Material is soft on the skin. Length hits around the knee. I didn’t give it a give because I’m not sure if the lining will make it too hot to sleep in on summer nights.
4.0,"Love the gown...the taped on lettering, not so much. Washed on delicate, cold cycle but letters stuck together and tore when I tried to separate. The gown is perfect, otherwise. Need higher quality applications."
4.0,"I have quite a few pieces from Mordenmiss. I liked the patchwork pattern on this one - it’s different from the others I’ve purchased. As usual, it’s well-made. I do wish the neckline was a bit lower but overall I’m happy with it."
4.0,good quality for the price. Size fitted as I expected it to .
4.0,"I have chronic pain and wanted a bra that felt as close to braless as possible while providing some control...and this one generally does. The straps stay in place, and the bottom doesn't cut or creep up. Most important, it hooks from the front. It takes some wrangling to get it on, but over time it may become easier. It runs smaller than I'd expected. I got both the L and XL and went with the latter, but wondering if I couldn't go even one more size up...territory I've never been in before."
4.0,"My first pari of no-tie laces.  Size two is really too big for my size 8 feet, probably because I have a narrow foot.  I will try a smaller size."
4.0,It fits small but I like the item it sheds a lot on my cloths but it makes you look great worn over different outfits.
4.0,GREAT shorts but I got a medium and it still feels a bit small for me.... will order a large next time.
4.0,Love the design but they are the same size as the necklace and I was hoping they would be a little smaller.
4.0,A little big but super comfy and cute! Received to a of compliments while wearing this dress! Got to love the pockets!
4.0,"I was surprised to find that the medium was tight for my modest size 38 chest. Because of this it doesn't lay flat in the underarm area. I like it, though and might buy another in a large."
4.0,Love it wish chain was a bit longer
4.0,"Super soft and very cute, a little small"
4.0,The product is in good quality but I don't like the color when I get it. It is too light for me.
4.0,I picked the wrong size now I have to return it and get the right size
4.0,Everything fits great but the straps are a bit loose. Super flattering.
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): I was worried that these would be too big but they are actually the perfect size.  The biggest and top circle is the size of a nickel (but they are the color of copper pennies).  The texture and color are beautiful.  The earrings definitely stand out.  The posts are comfortable and non-irritating.  The earrings are lightweight.  My only complaint is that they are a bit noisy.  There is a jingle-jangle noise right by your ear every time you move.  That is something to consider when purchasing these earrings.  They come in a nice gift box that ties shut with a ribbon.
4.0,"The hat served its purpose of providing the much needed shade during the summer at Disneyland. The length of the bill even provided full coverage over my face. The ears, however, were a flop. No pun intended, but really... they flop over. I fixed this by sewing the ears to the bow, and the bow did a great job keeping the ears propped up! As long as you don't mind the extra work modifying the hat, then this hat is totally sufficient."
4.0,Nice soft material.  Very comfortable
4.0,"The was great, was as advertised… had to remove it when the flower girl needed to sit"
4.0,The dress fits nicely but is a little see trough. Going to have to wear something under the dress.
4.0,bought it for my wife. she loves it . that's fine with me.
4.0,good material and very comfortable
4.0,"Cheaply made, but cute.  I'm afraid to wash it."
4.0,As advertised. These bands fit my Apple Watch series 5. They are pretty and the price is right.
4.0,These pocket squares are nice and not to big. They provide a variety of colors to go with my suits.
4.0,The top zipper entry is a bit small for my taste so I removed it. Now it is a cute open tote. All the zippers are a bit rough to open but for $22 I expected that. Love the bright blue color.
4.0,"Very pretty stitching and soft material, but when I first out it on, it was HUGE! As in an XL-XXL American sizes. I needed it for a Puerto Rican themed party, so decided I'd just belt it and make it a dress. Because it was super wrinkly, I completely wet it threw it in the dryer. When I  pulled it back out, it was wrinkle free but had shrunk considerably. Now it is definitely too short for a dress, I ended up wearing it with leggings as a big top (probably around a L in size post wash). I will probably try and wash it again soon in hopes it shrinks even more... Still for only $18, not a bad buy and worked for the event. For reference, I'm 5ft 1in and usually around a size 6."
4.0,"Not 100% wool, but I liked them & bought more!"
4.0,"great soft product. Screen printing is off centered, but otherwise great and if I had a need for a second, I'd order again."
4.0,"I love this skirt, and the waist sizing was as expected. I'm 5 foot 6 with a 28.5 inch waist and the medium fit with enough room to comfortably tuck a shirt into. However, this skirt hits me at the mid calf rather than at the knee, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5."
4.0,"Fits perfectly, the waist band on the shorts are twisted only issue"
4.0,I bought two sets for my two daughters. I hope they liked them. But not every pearl is perfect. Beautiful color. Very fast delivery.
4.0,"This is the third dress we purchased for a costume in our escape room. It is cost effective, comfortable, and the look is exactly what we needed. The one drawback is the collar grays after only 2 washings in cold water. If dry cleaning doesn't prevent, I'll have to look for an alternative."
4.0,"Great dress, but not for anyone above a size 8/10.  I ordered the XL and the arm girth and hip width are a bit snug.  Else, the length is great and the material is much better than anticipated.  I am just under 6' tall, 150lbs, 36B, 29-30 waist, and 37 hip with a 17&#34; shoulder span."
4.0,I only gave it four stars because I thought it was a little large for a wallet.  This is just a personal style preference and has nothing to do with the quality of the item itself.  This wallet was absolutely beautiful and my son loved it.
4.0,rib tank top are very cute but run very short
4.0,"Being blesses on top,I am so glad these have pads in them. Does what I need it to do and fits exactly as I thought it would."
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress, it was perfect for our Christmas party. It fit beautifully and looked even more beautiful. I found this dress to be comfortable and classy , I can’t wait to wear it again."
4.0,A great basic dress. The fabric hangs well and fit is exactly what I expected. The only complaint I have is the stitching is at the neckline is a bit off so it makes a small roll that I find myself trying to adjust.
4.0,A lot bigger than I expected but still a good purchase
4.0,Very nice. I like them
4.0,"Took a month to arrive! Other than that, these are pretty good especially for the price. Sometimes the ends get stuck on my hair which is annoying. Really cute though and seem to be somewhat sturdy!"
4.0,Little bigger then I thought it was going to be
4.0,These are perfect for my Sally Jupiter cosplay. They are comfortable to wear and arrived in good time.
4.0,Another great hat.  I have small head so I wear a knit hat under and it fits great and keeps me even warmer. gets nice feedback from others. It looks rich and people think i paid bunches. Want other colors.
4.0,Such a cute shirt that goes with so many outfits
4.0,"This dress runs big, my 33 pound 4 year old wears 4/5 in most dresses so that’s the size I got and the top portion is big, the dress was falling off her shoulders every time she moved. The back of the dress is see through, which I wasn’t expecting. We ordered this for a father daughter dance and didn’t have time to return and get a smaller size so I took the one stitch out in the back that was holding the dress together and just pulled it tighter and restitched it and it fits a lot better and doesn’t fall off her shoulders. Overall it’s a pretty dress and my daughter loves it!"
4.0,"Cute keyring and great size and materials.  If it weren't for the poor quality and bent condition of the ring that holds Elsa on to the key ring, I would have given this 5 stars. The first one of these I ordered had a little bit of space where this jump ring was not completely closed, so I ordered this replacement. This is worse than the one I initially got!!!  I'll have to send this back instead of my original one. Disgusted with the defective keyrings I keep ordering from different sellers on this website!"
4.0,Very warm and cozy. A tad shorter than I hoped but I have a long torso so it is probably just me. Overall a nice fall coat. Worked nice at a bonfire the other night
4.0,Very good value for the price. Long and warm!
4.0,"This dress is amazing on.  I love how I look in it!  I am 5'5"" and about 120 lbs.  I got the small I believe.  My only problem with this dress is the area  just below your armpits is a bit baggy and exposes way too much sideboob.  I have to use those weird double sided fashion tape things to stick the dress to my sides in those areas to avoid a Janet Jackson-ish exposure.  I am not overly well endowed, so if you are bigger, you might be ok.  Also, this dress is very thin!  Prepare to go commando or wear really thin undies to avoid unsightly lines and bulges because it leaves little to the imagination."
4.0,They fit good but are too long for me. But can be easily shortened.
4.0,"Gigantic bracelet. It was very cool, but if you have small wrists (like I do) it will not work for you."
4.0,"The suit fits great and it hides my mother of 2 belly just like I wanted. I thought the color was purple, but it's really more pink. However, the color is very becoming on me and I've even gotten compliments. Also, the edges of the fringe in the front is not sewn, but overall, I'm happy with this suit."
4.0,Need to be larger 4xl
4.0,"Wanted a pair of holiday themed compression running socks and these fit the bill. The compression could be a bit tighter for me, but overall really happy with these socks. I’ve worn them a dozen times now and they are still the same quality."
4.0,The front of the wallet is all glitter...strange for a wallet made for boys.
4.0,"It’s a nice mask, but it’s so incredibly long that you can’t tell it’s a Venezuelan flag. It looks like random stripes."
4.0,"Nice and comfortavle, but goes about mid calf and I'm 5'5"
4.0,"I like this hat, but it is definitely gray and black NOT olive and black as the picture shows."
4.0,Good product for the price. Really like the designs as well. I would recommend.
4.0,"Worth the price, but somewhat longer than expected."
4.0,"Love this cherry print dress that doesn't come across as too young. The dress itself is flattering. Body-conscious, but not too, too tight. Fabric is thick and adds some hold.  Will be good for a special evening out."
4.0,"The red stones are no where near as red as pictured. Otherwise, the products arrived on time and were of good quality."
4.0,"Love the animal print elastic band. It fits comfortably and totally changes the look of the Fitbit. Took a star off because the attachment to the band is quite exposed and it's silver in color. It would have been better if black.<br />As a super-plus, the pattern is not printed on it's actually woven through so it will not fade."
4.0,"It's not really large, it's more so very long for my stature of 5'2&#34;. It's much thinner material than I originally thought it would be however it will work for what I need it for"
4.0,its okay it's a hat what you expect?
4.0,"Warm, comfortable, and looks pretty snazzy."
4.0,"I'm about 5' 3"" at 120 lbs. I ordered two mediums because I like my workout clothes to be loose and a little bit bigger, but a small probably would have been a better fit. The tanks are a little longer than I would like, but that is fix easily by tying the top to the side. The material is light and comfortable. Overall happy with them!"
4.0,A bit thin but still cute - my 7 year old fits into the size 5 - thank you reviewers for the heads up!
4.0,"Wear on my 12hr shifts, helps with leg pain."
4.0,"Love it, a bit big should of ordered a medium but that’s my fault."
4.0,They look cool - and they are polarized.....love them....great value
4.0,That keeps your noggin and ears warm on those chilly days all while being able to listen to your favorite tunes and being able to hear whats going on around you! Much more convenient and comfortable then earbuds.
4.0,The only thing I didn’t like was the color i picked out for me but other than that I love the dress ! The material is nice and it fit wells .  Next time I’m buying a black one.
4.0,"looks nice, but quality feels a little weak"
4.0,Great color and structure. They are sturdy but a bit more snug than expected.
4.0,Cute kids love them
4.0,Got this for my niece's birthday since she is a big Dean fan. So far the necklace is decent enough but could do with a stronger link connecting the Jewelery to the necklace itself.
4.0,"They where too big , I need a medium instead of a large."
4.0,The dress is really cute! The only reason I took a star was because I find the off the shoulder straps to be rather tight and somewhat uncomfortable.
4.0,"The leather is s bit more stiff than other brands of ""apple"" type watch bands."
4.0,Does the job but does make a little sound
4.0,"It's heavier than I thought it would be, feels sturdy and well made. The protection case is a bit cheapo but it does it's job."
4.0,Nice leggings BUT way TOO small. I ordered a Large and they fit like a small. I gave them to  my friend she likes them. Nice quality bad sizing.
4.0,"Super cute! Not crazy comfy but more so than many of my other band, maybe equal to my mesh metal magnetic band. A little annoying you have to stretch it out to take on and off as the watch needs charging often and this must be pulled over the hand. Also, I have very small wrists so I have to have it on pretty much as tight as it will go, a little extra length could go a long way. All in all good for what it is."
4.0,"The Corvette graphics on the shirt I received is not as vivid as what is shown in the ad.  The cotton fabric is rough to the touch and feel.  A heather color would have taken care of the rough fabric but was not offered.  Strangely the neck garment tag had been cut off for reasons unknown to me.  Maybe the shirt was sold before and returned.  I don't know for sure.  The processing was relatively quick, however it should have not taken so long for me to receive the t-shirt.  I ordered and received a size 2XL, however, I could have gotten by with an XL.  For sizing reference, I am 6'4"", 38-40 inch waist and 210#.  Since it's 100% cotton, I'll attempt to reduce the size by washing in cold water and use a softener to hopefully take the roughness out of the fabric.  I will use the heat from a clothes dryer in hopes to shrink the shirt.  I never owned a 1963 Split Window Corvette Coupe but I always wanted one.  I worked for 47 years and now can afford this t-shirt with the image of the car I always wanted.  It will have to do."
4.0,"These are really like a second skin. They fit so snug but not to tight. They go on easy because they have some stretch to them so you just slip your foot right in. They really are comfortable to wear and the bottoms are a tougher material so walking on small seashells and rocks will not hurt your feet. We go to the mountain's often and you really need water shoes in most of the streams and rivers, there can be rocks, and pebbles everywhere , far from sandy beaches but a lot of fun. As I said these really work great, very comfortable to wear and they come in a array of great colors so you you will easily find a color you love, actually some very fashionable colors, some very bright colors too, you can make your fashion statement with these very easily and still be comfy."
4.0,They are nice socks but so far they seem to be no different than a regular thick sock.  Not really worth the money.
4.0,For men. I like the color and the design. It fits nicely especially if the person wearing it is well-built. The material is thin and soft but it can definitely be softer. Goes well with jeans.
4.0,They look like real pearls so I often get compliments.
4.0,"I read all of the reviews so I was expecting the waist to be a little tighter than usual despite the elastic.  That was the case but not uncomfortable enough that I need to return them.  They should give a little more room in the waist for the plus sizes.  I have a legitimate curvy athletic build with a round rear end and very muscular thighs, and a little bit of a belly and some other extras; therefore, I ordered the largest size that they had.  It fit roomy in the thigh area and was just above my ankles.  The color was spot on -- I ordered the brown/rust colored ones.  I like them and am looking forward to wearing them."
4.0,Cute keys chains
4.0,Cut pajamas but the pants are cut very narrow.  Our grandchild is not at all plump but the bottoms are very tight.  She is 7 and we have a size 8.  The length on the top is good.  They are cute.
4.0,"I love this coat.  It's warm, and fits my chest which is a concern.  I am 34DDD and I bought a large, which is a bit snug, but it zips and the belt helps to tie it in at the waist where I am medium to small.  The 4 stars is because of the hood.  I love the fur, but it doesn't really have an option for you to tighten in around your neck so when your head moves the hood doesn't and you get an eye full of fur.  If you pull it back, then it slips off.  Regardless of this, I would buy the coat again, and recommend it.  It's a great bargain, well made, and it's pretty."
4.0,cute but digs into your belly when you sit down.
4.0,"Great chemo cap, but will shrink if you put it through the regular wash, so use the handwash cycle and hang dry."
4.0,"I wore these neck gaiters whilst walking and cycling toward the end of winter. It kept my neck warm and if I got too cold, I could pull it up<br />To my nose.<br /><br />They are not fleece but some synthetic material. They are a bit scratchy but not too much."
4.0,"Solid sweatshirt, good quality, but a little overpriced"
4.0,A solid kit and you can't beat the price.
4.0,"I finally found a cover up I like! I'm 5'4&#34;,  a 36DDD and size M/L tops and this fit well. It was slightly small across the bust, but I expect that from anything that isn't stretchy. With the plunging neckline the it wasn't a big deal. Super flattering. Hides the things you want to hide and flaunts the legs and bust. Was comfy and flowy enough to flatter. Bought it in two colors. Only complaint is the material is a little cheesy feeling but its all good!"
4.0,Super soft and just as described! Great that it came with two batteries!
4.0,"I love the grey color. It’s thin material so you stay cool in the heat of summer. I bought a white one as well, but it was too sheer and didn’t look right layered."
4.0,"Really nice, the girls like that it is different.  It is a bit narrower than most but it seems to work for them.  They like the matching extras."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and is a five star.  The heels in the accessories come off easily, but would be easy to glue back on.  (Only reason I’m goving this a 4 star rating)."
4.0,"Really cute skirt, has a good girly look about it. Big buttons for easy undoing."
4.0,"I love these masks. But, the only thing I dislike is the breathability. Since they are two layered it is a big warm and harder to breather vs other masks I have (surgical, one layer cotton). Other than this, no complaints!"
4.0,It is an okay shirt for a t-shirt. I wanted a cream shirt and that is what I got.
4.0,Too cold right now to really work with these gloves but they arrived on time and paper to be exactly as described.
4.0,This suit is Cute and functional. I bought it to breast-feed in and the halter top function makes it perfect for summer feeding a baby.
4.0,"Cute, as pictured, fabric is not that thick. Good for layering."
4.0,Light t-shirt material. My hubby usually wears a medium so I ordered up a size. He says it's a tight fitting large. It looks good just remember to order a size or two up.
4.0,"It fits perfect, I followed the size guideline instant  tummy tuck, the heat generated is real, even after removing it. I wear it at least 8 hrs while going about my daily routine and chores. Been a week, so far so good."
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter. Very nice. It is a bit larger than I expected, but still very nice. Seems to be a good value for the price."
4.0,good stuff.
4.0,Great value great look.
4.0,Works well and is very quiet
4.0,"We purchased quite a few of these for a promotion at work.  They were super cute and staff fought over who got to wear them when they came in.  Sadly, the adhesive that holds the Velcro in place is not strong and all of them continuously popped loose.  A little super glue will fix the problem, but if I purchased a product, I don't expect to have to modify it right out of the gate."
4.0,"Good quality, comfortable flip-flops. Would recommend breaking them in a little before spending too much time in them though as the leather can be a bit stiff and they run a touch small. The bottle opener under the arch is a nice touch."
4.0,"Good band for the 360. Stylish and solid build, with extra pins/tools."
4.0,"A good pack for biking around town, won't hold a ton of stuff, but will keep that stuff dry."
4.0,Just what Fred and Wilma needed for going out.
4.0,"Very nice bracelet. Took a while to get here, but so far liking this band to switch out for work and casual evening wear."
4.0,"The cut of this blazer is off for my body. My hips and ribs are sized for a small frame, but my shoulders are not able to move around. The length of the shoulders are quite long and will need to be placed in for it to fit me properly. I am not sure if this is an intentional design, but this will cost me extra to fix. If you have a Dorito shaped body, you will have difficulty wearing this until you can get it fitted properly. It looks great to look at though when it's on the hanger. It's been sitting on a hanger for more month now. I haven't had the time to get it fitted yet.<br />Update: The company has contacted me and is willing to negotiate a deal to compensate for my loss. When a company is willing to jump through hoops to satisfy their customers, to me that is beyond amazing. I am updating my original 2 stars to 4 due to customer satisfaction. I wish more companies were like this. Thank you for contacting me. Everyone should definitely check them out."
4.0,They are not very high quality but they do the job!
4.0,This shirt and several in other colours I bought for my husbands acrobatic performances on stage...nice and shimmery....for all the action they are going through I am pretty happy how they are holding up. A seam has come undone by the arm but I quickly fixed it with some hand sewing. I don't think this was because it is a bad made item but because my husband does backflips cartwheels etc....if you know what I am trying to say....they are not used for going to church! One more thing....They don't fare so well in the washing machine.
4.0,Just like the photo. The claw clip at the back not working.
4.0,Perfect and worth the price. Zipper is a little cheap or I would give it 5 stars.
4.0,"I have a VP shunt and a huge head. These are my absolute go to masks. It is painful when there is pressure on my valve. I have 3 of these masks that I have bought at 2 different times. I love the filters and the nose bridge strip is invaluable. I have a huge head. Initially they were too tight but got over time it has loosened. I only hand wash. I highly recommend them. One improvement would be added a drawstring & toggle to the top of the mask, I have a different design from a different company that has that. Other than that these have been super helpful"
4.0,"A bit of a tight fit, otherwise, a very good garment."
4.0,This is a cute lavender and coconut lotion set makes your skin feel soft  and feel smell good. It would make a great gift idea as well.
4.0,i thought it was pretty small for the price but my knowledge is none in jewelry but it was great shape quickly mailed
4.0,Material is think and comfy but this cardigan is somewhat too short. I'm a petite girl and it definitely goes up over the top of my pants. It was kind of awkward fitting.
4.0,"I really like that this bracelet says something in a code that means something to me! It is very thin & comfortable. I did have a bit of trouble adjusting at first, which may be why one small part of the cord is a little bit frayed. It comes with a useful and well-designed card with the Morse Code alphabet, which I really appreciated. I also like that it seems to be designed for the YLs of the ham radio community- there may be fewer of us than the OMs, but we do like to take pride in our participation in the community and this is the perfect, stylish way to do so. de KE0TWT"
4.0,"It’s so beautifully made and has a lot of character. Really like the charms and ornaments attached to it. My hand however could not fit through the leash so that was a little disappointing, but I love it."
4.0,"This is definitely a/an cool/elegant lighter. Comes in an impressively classy, solid box, and includes a usb cord. The lighter itself has a very nice weight to it (all metal casing), is not flimsy, and feels well made.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Even though it's a solid lighter, I have opened it up, and the inside casing is plastic (understandable)... but I wouldn't throw it around like Zippo's if I were you.<br />- The battery is a small regular lithium battery, so do not overcharge it.<br />- the arc/gap is quite small. In fact, it's shorter than the width of a regular cigarette. But it doesn't have problems lighting cigarettes. It will, however, be an issue if you want to light anything of larger width, like cigars or pipes etc. Also, you cannot light jar candles due to the lighter's top flip-cover.<br />- Makes a bit of a screeching noise when lighting ( I personally don't mind).<br />- The thing that I personally  disliked very much is how the pictures are a BIT dishonest. Unlike the pictures shown, the actual lighter has the &#34;Tiger&#34; brand name and year &#34;Since 1992&#34; printed on the front just beneath the button. Some may like it, some may be indifferent to it, or some may not like it at all (like me), and I feel like that they shouldn't hide that detail in the pictures.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice lighter to have. But compared to traditional gas lighters, electronic lighter are more prone to breaking down, so I just hope this lighter LASTS..that's the most important thing!"
4.0,This dress is cute.
4.0,i liked it as its very handy comfortable and also it meets my requirement. i liked the appearance and the neutral color of it.
4.0,I am very pleased with these bands.  I purchased one rose gold face plate and one black.  The bands are very easy to put on.
4.0,"So it definitely didn't match the photo, but I knew the expect that when I ordered since I read a lot of reviews and it was pretty close. I still really liked the dress and ordered it for a last minute bridal shoot. It fit the model exact and didn't need dress clamps or anything. I like that you don't need a bra as well with it and loved the back sheer lace with buttons. The lace is a little stiff and cheaper looking than what is pictured, but you can't tell in photos so that's why I didn't mind. The dress also didn't have as many pleats so less fabric than what's shown, but it still flowed pretty. Overall, happy with what I got though! Just don't buy it expecting to see what is in the sample photos. Look at the review photos instead!"
4.0,Nice top but a little small for an XL.
4.0,Nice hat and very comfortable.
4.0,I bought this for my migraines and I notice  a significant difference. The only thing I wish I could find out is the strength of the magnet. I have had compliments on the way it looks too.
4.0,Love the way it looks ! Received many compliments. Although it does not look over sized as shown in the picture . it does run small!! I'm 5'5' 204lbs I ordered XL and. It fit snug . very thin material and lace looks fragile. Hand wash is a must.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for Valentine’s Day and she loved it!
4.0,Comfortable but since there were no half sizes I chose to round down and they are snug but still comfortable and I don't risk tripping over an elongated toe.
4.0,Took awhile to get but good quality ... but I'll never order another thing from Amazon. After the rest of my orders come in I'm completely done with Amazon. Going back to stores and shopping in the USA made products again..
4.0,"I wore this to work and all my co-workers loved this piece. It look the same way as you see in the picture, it fits perfect."
4.0,I like how they were mirror finish but kind of wished they were gloss white and not flat black. Makes me feel like they had black frames and just painted it with flat white because it stuck better. But they arent bad I still like them just would have preferred gloss paint.
4.0,"I ordered this for work. I deliver mail, and with the heat, I sweat a lot. My thought was this would stop the sweat from soaking into the mail, but I soon discovered a flaw.... The zipper and underlying strip of neoprene. The neoprene underneath is only about 1.5"" wide, and with it working so well, and the heat (100° in Sacramento), I had an ever increasing strip of sweat, from collarbone to waist. The rest of me was bone dry as the vest material worked wonders, but the seam needs a wider strip of neoprene.<br /><br />I still wear this as it's better than nothing, and the fit is perfect! I also discovered it kept me warm in the cold American River waters."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f6c90bb38851179b38a1c390119789db]] I love animals. I have 2 dogs, a cat and 2 kids :-) I recently had to have my cat of 16 years put down and it was very difficult and anyone who has gone through that sort of pain knows what a special place our animals have in our heart, they are our family and our best friends. Sometimes a simple piece of jewelry to remember them by is nice to have.<br /><br />This is a very lovely silver necklace with the cutest little paw print right on the heart. The paw has several tiny black crystals in it. The silver on this necklace shines especially when it hits the light just right. I have included measurements in the video part of my review in case you were wondering about the size.<br /><br />The other nice thing about this necklace is is the presentation, they way this arrives makes it a perfect gift. Be prepared to wait a bit to receive it but it came way earlier than the expected date.<br /><br />I thought at first that I would keep this for myself to help me to remember my Sir Simon (my cat who passed) but I think I would rather give it to a good friend of mine who is a surgical vet tech because she spends everyday saving the lives of animals and I would rather picture this as a symbol of hope rather than of remembrance. No matter what you are getting this for, to remember a pet that has passed, or to commemorate the adoption of a new pet or for someone who works with and loves animals I'm sure they will be thrilled with this necklace.<br /><br />I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I ordered these sandals because I love the look of the them, and also because I wanted a shoe that felt like a flip-flop but had a band around the back of the foot for support. The shoes are adorable on and come in several different fun colors. Each pair comes in a cute carrying bag that will work well for storing or if traveling.<br /><br />The material of the strap is a soft and stretchy, and works well to provide support to the heel. They feel very much like wearing a flip-flop, so if you're comfortable with those you will find these to be similar when walking. I ordered true to size and didn't have any issues length-wise or width-wise. I purchased these sandals more for a casual night out where I won't be doing a lot of walking, so for me they were purchased more for looks than for function (walking long distances).<br /><br />Pros: Cute designs in fun colors<br />Cushy bottom made of yoga mat material<br />The bands around the foot are comfortable<br />They are washable; I love anything that can tossed in the washing machine!<br /><br />Cons: There are two slight improvements that could be made; first, there is no arch support; the foot bed is one solid piece of material. Second, the part of the fabric that goes between the toes is a bit wide; if you're very comfortable with flip-flops or fabric between your toes you may not notice it, but the fabric just seemed a bit wider than what I'm used to."
4.0,So I just received my gloves and I'm very happy. The knitting is nice and tight and thick. So comfy and cute. I tried out the touch screen feature on my Galaxy and it works great!!! I put four instead of five stars only because I haven't worn them outside yet so I have to see if they hold up against the cold as well as they seem. I also want to see how the hold up as far as any snagging or ripping. Other than the wait and see factor I would have given them five stars.
4.0,"Very cute, warm comfortable. Wish there was a strap to keep them from falling off easily. Toddler loves them!"
4.0,Perfect little day-to-day earrings. Packaging was fun too.
4.0,Easy to carry My daughter She like it
4.0,These are decently good tie clips. They are professional looking and I have a lot of choices and I change them out weekly. The only con I have against these clips are some of the clips aren't very tight so when I clip my tie to my shirt if I have to move somewhere quickly it comes out quick but not to the point where I lose them.
4.0,Nice got compliments especially the cream with buttons ones only wish they stretch a little for people who have big calves
4.0,I like hasnt fallen apart yet.
4.0,I really do like these! They stretch for those concerned about that. The belts are as shown in the pic and clip on in the front. On a solid colored dress this would stand out and look great! Does not look terrible or cheap just a pretty accessory!
4.0,"Looks some expensive, but is ok."
4.0,Good value for its price
4.0,bought this shirt for my husband and he loves it! He normally wears a L but this shirt seems to run a size small.
4.0,"I ordered these masks for my daughters to wear at school. The prints are great and the quality seemed good as well. They seemed to fit my daughters fine. (For reference they are ages 6 and 8.) However, my girls found them to be much hotter and harder to breathe through than a traditional mask. They also caused their glasses to fog up so I ended up returning the masks."
4.0,Comfy and warm the patterns are a little hard to see but wasn’t a big issue
4.0,"I liked the umbrella. It looks sturdy and well built. But I cannot give this 5 stars because I feel short changed.<br /><br />The umbrella I received did not match the picture I saw when I ordered. The umbrella I received was a dark blue on both sides. But the one I ordered was supposed to be a light blue on the outside and dark blue on the inside of the umbrella.<br />After I received my order, the picture changed to a dark blue on both sides of the umbrella. Even the picture in my order history got changed to a dark blue!"
4.0,"This is a nice shirt - well constructed and fits well, but it is pretty long. I bought several of these in different colors and cut off over 4 inches from the bottom and re-hemmed them. I'm only 5'3"", so that may be part of the issue, but petite wasn't an option. Just be aware if you don't like really long shirts (or don't want to alter them yourself) you might not love these."
4.0,I wish the netting  would turn down more.  would be easier to fit on the head but still a good buy and pretty
4.0,"This earring set is cute, but I must have thicker ear cartilage or something because the top feather kind of juts away from my ear at an odd angle without hanging down naturally. If I take care to adjust it to look right, it's great, but it doesn't stay that way for long. The shipping took over a week longer than the estimate (totally not Amazon's fault -- they did keep me updated as to what they knew. I never heard from the actual seller.)"
4.0,Cool bracket for under mask to keep off your mouth and help w air pocket to breathe better . I use while exercising at gym. Wish they were diff sizes but if you firmly place it does the trick for the hour i use!
4.0,Cute pin.  Gave as gift.
4.0,I like these hiking boot. Comfortable and very stylish!
4.0,"I opened the package and the stone as the first thing to come out. I had to pay to have the stone set into the setting, I love the necklace!"
4.0,"However, poor stitching.  After one wash stitching started to come undone."
4.0,they were nice fitting and colors!
4.0,"Good quality, lightweight, compacts nicely. I use this as a day pack for camping trips. It is ideal since it stays small until you need it. Then it is a full functioning backpack."
4.0,"I am still wearing watch for each time checking. This one has lowest price I could find on Amazon with decent quality. I prefer stainless band as it won't track water after getting wet (comparing with leather band).<br /><br />This watch does not have any other functions (timer, alarm, date, ...etc). It just shows the time...simple and easy. I don't recall using other function with my last feature-rich electronic watch anyway.<br /><br />Adjusting the band to fit my wrist is quite a work. I have to bring out hardware tools from garage to adjust the band. Luckily, this is just one time  effort.<br /><br />It's pretty thing and light. It does not look cheap. All and all, with this good price, it's a good value."
4.0,"No complaints on these, other than they fog a little. But we love that we can see our childrens' beautiful smiles when we go out. Other people have commented saying the same. I have read that they are nice for the deaf/hard of hearing children as well for lip reading. Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"Cute, the coloring is a very orange/pink for a regular gold, it is almost rose gold. But still cute."
4.0,"fit is exactly what i thought. soft fabric. ordered the tan color, but it’s not at all like the picture. tan is mustard yellow and fish/stripes are black and white not white and green."
4.0,The color was darker than the picture
4.0,I love them. I would give it 5 stars but the ride up at times. 😔
4.0,Really pretty but too big for my ear...and I do not have small ears. Something to consider before buying.<br /><br />Thanks!
4.0,"It keeps my daughter's mittens on attached to her coat. No lost mittens. Not super cute, but it is functional and that's what I needed."
4.0,This dress arrived on time but runs somewhat large. I do love the dress but I gave it one star short of 5 because it does not fit true to size. I would normally wear a XL and I could have fit into a medium. Still very beautiful and comfortable.
4.0,Great shirt and good fit. It’s true to size.
4.0,Fits longer but nice colors
4.0,"I've been in the market for a new wallet and definitely wanted a minimalist wallet, since I keep my wallet in my front pocket.  I like a traditional bi-fold style, not just a money clip with card holder. I'm not the type of guy that will have a money clip or &quot;going-out&quot; wallet, want just one think wallet all the time. My current wallet started to fall a part and could not find the same one.  I decided to give the Viosi wallet a try.  When I first received it I was disappointed that it was bigger than my current wallet and was not a big fan of the design, but I decided to try it out. I am able to fit my driver's license and 3 cards inside.  On the outside pockets, I am able to fit about 5 business cards and then the other side about 5-6 other thin cards (AAA card, loyalty punch cards, etc.).<br /><br />To Summarize:<br />Pros:<br />-Nice looking, leather wallet (the look grew on me)<br />-Minimalist and thin enough to comfortably fit in my front pocket.<br />-Sturdy money clip inside (contrary to other reviews, I like the clip inside with cash exposed--but I rarely carry cash)<br />-The outside pockets have enough give for me to put about 5 business cards in on one side and about 5-6 other thin cards.<br />-It comes in a nice box, could make a nice gift.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Does not fit too many credit cards, the inside pockets are super tight and I was able to fit 3 max, wish it could fit more.<br />-When you lay it down it does a &quot;v&quot; shape instead of laying flat, minor cosmetic preference, but for me, I like my wallet to lay a little flat, maybe over time it will flatten out a bit more.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for an honest review."
4.0,"This is a nice bag for the money. Size is large and it doesn't feel cheap. However, the sides are very soft so the bag doesn't stay open on it's own. Also, the fabric liner ""catches"" on clothes as you load the bag with clothes. It's just something to keep in mind when looking to buy this bag."
4.0,"This bathing suit is so flattering. I have it 4 stars because part of it ripped off and I had to sew it back together- basically just reinforced the stitches. I did not return it because of this though, because it’s such a flattering suit. I am 5’2”, 135lbs and ordered a medium."
4.0,Very nice material and pretty color.  It wasn't as long as it looks here.  I'm about 5'6&#34; and it comes a little past my knees.  I thought it would come it at least my ankle.  Cute dress though.
4.0,"The appearance of the swimsuit is great for walking around in public; however, the fruit could have been up more in the front with more support. I purchased for my 14 year old so she wouldn't have to walk around with separate clothes to be decent on her trip. However, she was uncomfortable with the low rise in the front and having to keep pulling it up."
4.0,"Great price for the product. It is the perfect amount of cropped where it doesn’t show any skin, but sits nicely on the waist. The color is beautiful. The only con is that there are no pockets"
4.0,"These no show socks are alright.  They have a bit of an absorbent bottom on them but not much.  The lace top is good , but it does show quite a bit with your typical ballet flat type shoe, so it's good they come in different colors to match.  I was hoping it would be a little more &#34;no show&#34; than it is.  Quality is ok.  They left a weird &#34;grease&#34; stain on the cardboard pieces they come on to hold the shape, which was a little concerning to me about what chemicals are on it.  Overall they are ok, but didn't get 5 stars from me."
4.0,"Its just right. I was looking for something simple to enhance my solitaire, add the right amount of flare, yet not be overstated. I wanted to be able to wear it everyday and so far it has held up to everyday wear, haven’t lost any stones. I wear a size 7 and the enhancer is an 8. I suggest sizing up the enhancer for a comfortable fit. The stones are smaller than expected but Im ok with it. The smaller stones actually accent my solitaire better than I thought and without overpowering it. Worth the purchase."
4.0,"Having worn this watch for a work day, I feel it's comfortable.<br /><br />It looks ""svelte"".  The black lugs ( I think) with the brown leather band make it look compact for a watch with a 42mm face.<br /><br />The green face is great, I like green faced watches.<br /><br />The x-wing and yoda designs are subtle, which is good and bad.<br /><br />The date ( day of month) is hard to read, like every other Citizen watch I have.  Come on, Citizen, some people don't have 20/20 vision, and actually want to be able to read the date on a date watch.  The date is of course no perpetual, you will have to adjust it 5 times a year.  It's the standard adjustment, two stops out for the time, one stop for the day of month, with a counter clockwise turn.<br /><br />Don't forget when setting the date, to first set it to a day earlier, than turn the watch until the date changes, so you know when midnight is.<br /><br />As is standard for Citizen ( as it should be for the price,) there's no obvious issues such as the second hand not lining up on the markers exactly.<br /><br />This is my fourth Citizen watch, so I will presume the Eco drive will work properly for a long time.<br /><br />Rated at WR100, you should be able to wash your face and shower with it, but not sure showering with a watch with a leather band is a good idea."
4.0,My watch hasn't gained or lost a second in the last week. To bad it doesn't have a Hacking function.
4.0,I bought a mid tone leather bench that had some stain taken off by my son running his toys cars up and down it. This has mostly removed the marring.
4.0,Good sandals
4.0,"They are great for the price, but just keep in mind that they are the cheap knock-off versions that are pretty short, regardless of what they say or options are given. If you are looking for real nato type straps, go on eBay. I can't find any long nato straps on Amazon. But again, for the price, these are fine for messing around with."
4.0,"These are absolutely stunning earrings. The pictures cannot capture how lovely and elegant they are. Would have been 5 stars, except that the gauge that goes through the ears is larger than standard earrings. They are heavier weight than most, so perhaps it needs to be, but be prepared for sore ears for a few days after wearing."
4.0,True to size measurements. Soft material. Thinner than sweat pants
4.0,"This necklace was affordable! I like how it looks for the most part. My flower was a little more yellow then this picture shows. Also, the back of the necklace catches on my clothing sometimes causing pulls in the thread of my shirts. As a result I don't wear this necklace often."
4.0,"It fits nicely & is pretty & soft but very wrinkled.  Since the tag says &#34;dry clean only, do not iron&#34; I will take it to the cleaners for pressing before wearing to the dressy event we have coming up."
4.0,They are fantastic but have to return them wayyyy too small. Ordering a new pair a full size up
4.0,"I own a model cb153 which is the same watch as the cb173. itlooks great and keeps near perfect time.However to remove a link or two,you must have very small screwdrivers as the pins are held in place by screws,or tke it to ajeweler.I've done it myself and it can be fidgety."
4.0,I normally wear a large.  Thankfully the item's description warns that it runs very small.  The 2xL fits perfectly.<br /><br />The shirt is comfortable and light weight.
4.0,I bought these to put on a suit to make a Polar Express conductor costume and they worked perfectly!
4.0,The quality is great and I love the look.  But this runs a little big.  I would suggest you get a size smaller then what you usually get.
4.0,"Super cute and so warm for Montana winter! My only complaint is when you really look there’s weird small patches where Sherpa is missing. You don’t notice unless you’re looking. I’m 5’7” and 127lbs and ordered a medium and it’s pretty big. I wish I would have gotten a small, other then that it’s great and I can’t wait to wear it all winter!"
4.0,Pretty tie. Did not match my dress Ordered it for.
4.0,Bought for my daughter who loves it! It is comfortable and fashionable.
4.0,The Velcro at the end of the sleeves tore off. I sewed it back on though. Overall a good jacket. I had to walk in a rain storm for 20 minutes and the jacket worked well. Dried quick
4.0,"I ordered my usual size and definitely would have gone a size smaller. It was baggy and unflattering on. I didn't reorder either. It looks form fitting and snug, and maybe for some people it is, but it unfortunately didn't do that for me :( The material was good though and it didn't seem cheaply made. You'll just have to roll the dice and see if it fits you or not! However, I can't give a poor review for something that just didn't fit me the way I was hoping it to."
4.0,my fault...did not notice the work &#34;kids&#34;  traded them for regular which are fine
4.0,fast shipping and quality item. Fit my<br />son perfect
4.0,"These masks as very comfortable.  We bought lanyards with clips so the kids could wear them to school, and hang them around their neck when they don't need them on, so they don't have to worry about losing them or dropping them.  They fit the whole family, which I love... from ages 11-42.  The only things I don't like are that the ear adjusters rip.  They're rubbery and split easily.  Also, the nose clip moves around a lot, but most of the time I can shimmy it back into place.  They're durable and wash very well.  We air-dry them."
4.0,Light material.
4.0,nice quality but runs a little small
4.0,This band is very beautiful !!! it is also light weight but it’s  too tight for my wrist and I don’t feel like I have big wrists.  I should’ve sent it back but I love it so much I kept it and I’m just wearing it too tight.  it also seemed a little harder to attach than other bands
4.0,Satisfied with Vendors response.  Received the product on time.  I think the necklace is very beautiful and very feminine.
4.0,"I’m very happy with this smock. Works well when grooming my dog, or trimming hair. It’s a thin slick fabric, which is a little water resistant. To make more waterproof, need to spray with Scotchgard. Hair doesn’t stick. I got an XL and wear a size 10-12. It’s alittle big, but allows for a sweatshirt under."
4.0,"I expected it to be a bit wider, it does fit but I wish it was a loose fit being a one size fits all but overall I love it."
4.0,Nice but for price expected more body forming. Very comfy. Definitely good for what I was looking for.
4.0,"There are very fashionable for women and men. I like them. However, they do not come with a nice case. The soft pouch does not provide good protection. So be ready to spend more money to buy additional hard case."
4.0,My boys love the gaiters more than the masks that go around the ear. Love the colors too. They are just a little tight for my 4 and 6 year old boys
4.0,"Peach colored, not really pink.  A tiny bit snug but still pretty.  I'm 5'6 and it hits above my knees."
4.0,"Thinner than I accpected, but overall I like them"
4.0,This dress is nice and cool and comfortable but it is very thin might need a slip but it fits good  and great fit also soft and flowing great summer dress
4.0,"This tie is narrow just as it says in the description, but it is very nice. Our daughter gave it to her high school orchestra teacher for the class Secret Santa exchange and she said he loved it."
4.0,Love it the fit and color are perfect and very comfortable.
4.0,"So easy to sleep in, kind of hard to tie up myself, not discreet at all under clothing.. But it's actually long enough for my torso! I probably will buy a waist trainer-cincher for the day & wear this at night."
4.0,"I ordered a large, but it fits like a xl or xxl. I’m normally a large extra xl, but this fits really big. It’s really cute though."
4.0,"Husband is normally a 2X in pants. We ordered these and they were more of a large. He just couldn't fit into them. So, if you're ordering, note that they are Very Slim fit! Looks comfy otherwise."
4.0,"I really like the vest, I just wish it was a bit longer. I love all the pockets. Looking forward to wearing it on my upcoming trip."
4.0,"I ordered my usually size medium (I’m 5 2’, 140 pounds) and they are a bit large. They are super cute so I gave them to my daughter and I ordered a new pair in small for myself."
4.0,Well made but huge. Doesn't come anywhere close to fitting our 9mo
4.0,Very comfy.  Would have given five stars but drawstring came out in first wash
4.0,Awesome socks!  They are thin - but they are exactly what they say.
4.0,"Soft and flexible leather with no scratchy stitches or edges. Very comfortable overall and seems to be of good quality. I wish it were a bit shorter or available in a smaller size because I have a lot of excess band once tightened to my wrist. However, my wrist is very small and there are still two tighter slots so it should fit a good range of sizes. I like it enough that I will probably buy it in another color or two."
4.0,Very nice colors. Would look good as cover up or with jeans too.
4.0,"For me they were too small. I have an orthodic brace and it wouldn’t accommodate it! However, they are beautiful! I really wish they fit! I’ll be sending them back!"
4.0,"Fabric is thin as others have commented.  Also, the color leans toward an orangey-red.  I am ok  with the color but it is good to know that."
4.0,"This is a cute vest!  Quite thin but I wasn't looking for something very thick. Overall, seems great for the price!"
4.0,Our son (originally from MA) bought this for his girlfriend.... They live in Florida of all places but he swears she lives in it in their apartment...<br />It is exactly what it says... A VERY large sweatshirt/hoodie that she can pretty much snuggle all of herself into on the sofa to keep cozy on the 'chilly' (as if) evenings in Florida...
4.0,"In my search for a swimsuit and reading reviews it seems as is you have to buy multiple sizes larger than normal. Thanks to the girls who replied to my question, I ordered a 10 and a 14. The 14 fit but I'm kinda left wondering what a 16 would have felt like.<br />I'm 5'2, ~150lbs, 38 (typically wear 36c), 33 (empire waist), 39 (widest point at belly 😖) and 41 hips. I usually wear a medium in tops and somewhere between a medium/large or an 8 or a 10 in jeans.<br />Never the less I'm keeping the size 14 suit. It's sexy without being revealing and disguises and holds in any problem areas you might have very well. I kinda feel like a movie star in this suit. All I need now is a big fancy hat... and a yacht. I do wish it had more butt coverage but it's okay.<br />Also... Just a little FYI... The strap is over the left shoulder. And if I'm thinking correctly, chemo ports are on the left side. So if you're on the search for a suit and you're concerned about covering it, this suit is for you.<br />It's a fun sexy swimsuit that makes you feel fancy and I highly recommend it for all ages, shapes and sizes."
4.0,Very cute key holder. Only dislike is that it is very thick and hard to get through the key ring.
4.0,It's a soft and cure shirt but for me i ordered too big. I needed about a large.
4.0,"Color  didn't fade, it washed very well.<br />The top is better quality than the  bottoms. Looks good I got lots of complements"
4.0,"This was item came exactly as shown in the pictures and was just what I was looking for. The headband fit snugly, everything sat securely on the band, and the materials have held up to some abuse.<br /><br />The only issue I had was the hat was flat. As if it had either been kept in a stack of many hats, or it under something heavy.<br /><br />We stuffed cotton balls into the hat to fill it out and it looked great. Thanks guys."
4.0,Not water water proof. But very warm and very cute. Love the way they look.
4.0,"Perfect fit for 7+ just need a slim case for my phone so my phone is a bit more protected. A textured back would also work to help the phone, so it becomes a little more ridged when you unzip the case. This way the phone doesn't slide out. Also a leash would be perfect for this because there is room along the spine of the case to easily feed a leash through it. Change zipper had a little hiccup in it but that was easily fixed."
4.0,Nice replacement laces for Rockport Classic Walker shoes.
4.0,"the black pair did not have the screw on part, they where just plain double flared but other than that, they were good quality."
4.0,El producto es bueno
4.0,good for what i need.
4.0,"Good quality, very comfy"
4.0,This is working great I still have it and I’m still working with it hopefully I’ll be looking to get it in another site soon
4.0,Dress perfect as stated. Wears will.<br />Have worn to Church . lots of comments
4.0,The length was just right.  I liked the way it is designed. One thing I do not like about it is that it is noisy.
4.0,Be careful when washing.
4.0,light compression works well
4.0,"I’d wear it much more often if the parts to go around my ears weren’t made out of rope. Easy enough fix though, I think it’s so cool. I love it!"
4.0,It’s well made and a true patchwork. It’s just not full length. If I wear of off my hips it goes to mid calf. I don’t mind this length at all just something to note if you want it ankle length. I’m 5’5.5 for reference.
4.0,"Bought it as a gift she seemed to like it, but took a long time to ship."
4.0,Really nice glasses but the arms got loose too quick for me.  Bought 2 pair but lost 3 screws pretty quick.  Wish I knew who to contact to send some screws
4.0,Very light weight and comfortable. Fit great to. Don't listen to the winers. There fine.
4.0,Really cute. My teen daughter loved them!
4.0,good umbrella - live in Florida and the fabics fade after one or two years - so don't overinvest!
4.0,"I bought it for my husband who is 6ft 3in. It fit nicely and served the purpose. True to the size, however, the shoe cover did not fit well, probably because he has big feet."
4.0,It is a really good purchase for the price. I wish the stone was slightly bigger so it would bling longer but other then that good quality.
4.0,They are comfortable on bottom of feet so soft<br />But with the elastic strip on top a bit to tight<br />I don't wear them with the strip and much more suited for my feet
4.0,"The bracelet is ok, but it seems the length of 7.5 isn't really true to the size seems smaller.  Doesn't match my other 7.5 bracelets."
4.0,"Great shirt,but I have to lose my fupa for it to roll down.  It’s not even a crop top. It’s and under boob roll up.  If I was smaller ,maybe 50l less -it would have fit nicely.  Anyone under 125lbs would love it."
4.0,"I normally wear a medium. I got this in a large as I didn’t want it to be too tight.<br />I think I could have been good with a medium.<br />The pants are baggy on me - I would say correctly sized.<br />The top feels a little like a medium around the stomach but is correctly sized in the shoulder/arms area.<br />This outfit is very comfortable. My only complaint is that it’s softer in the outside then it is on the inside.<br />The inside isn’t scratchy or anything- it’s comfortable just not cozy.<br />This outfit is great for lounging around or a quick run out to do errands.<br />I wouldn’t actually without in this outfit.<br /><br />**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below."
4.0,Pjs fit great and are very comfortable
4.0,"This is a pretty, flattering top, and the price is good."
4.0,"The pants themselves fit very well. My grandson loves them! Only problem is they are sooooooo long. I had to cut several inches off and hem them. I guess when they say Boys they mean teenagers who are much taller than the ""tween"" I got the pants for."
4.0,I love the design but I should have looked at the size more closely- larger than I expected.
4.0,A little hard to see out of but work
4.0,"Nice slipper, fits good."
4.0,"Yes it is inexpensive, but the wow factor is still there from this piece.  Nice and light and easy to wear,  it does not look cheap."
4.0,Like the gloves and would have given 5 stars except the fingers are a bit too long for my hand.
4.0,"This is a pretty dress. I especially like that it is made of 65% cotton, which makes it so much more comfortable in the heat of the summer. It washes easily and comes out very nicely after drying it on delicate. It is sized a little on the smaller size so be sure to take that into account."
4.0,"Definitely get a size larger than what you wear but other than that I love this, it brought my idea to life! Cant wait to wear this to AWA in October"
4.0,"Timex makes great Ironman digital watches and this analog watch is even more impressive. It is a great looking and functional time piece. I wear it everyday and prefer it to a finer watch.<br /><br />Features like: stop watch are easy to engage, the bezel has a slide rule to help with simple calculations (guess this is handy for pilots), and the dual time zone is easy to set and handy.<br /><br />Great watch if you like analog, just know it runs on a battery, isn't as rugged as a Casio G-Shock, and the chronograph second hand at times needs to be re-adjusted (which is simple). If it were more rugged, weren't 100% reliant on battery, and the chronograph didn't require adjustment from time to time I'd give it 4 stars.<br /><br />So great watch that looks nice but not perfect."
4.0,"I love this sweater. It's big, soft and has pockets! I would give it a five star rating except it snags easily and on everything so I usually only wear it at home but it would be a perfect office sweater."
4.0,Amazing deal for the price definitely use again and recommend to friends and family. My son was very happy when he saw these.
4.0,"Decent mask, a little tight, you need to practically have no head hair of facial hair for max comfort, but overall it’s a good mask"
4.0,Haven't open it it's a birthday gift its very small
4.0,Ok but kinda gaudy colors. Keeping it tho.
4.0,"using the bracelet as an anklet for my daughter. it fits her perfectly and arrived double bubble wrapped. The reason i only gave 4 stars is that the elephants almost look like lions unless you look up close at the correct ankle.  It is as pictured, They must have gotten the lighting perfectly though."
4.0,"My first one arrived promptly however the tassles that looked as though they held the back in place we're missing. I contacted seller and received a replacement immediately. I tried it on just to see the fit and it was a bit loose in the chest, I assumed because the tassles weren't holding the back snug.<br />While trying on the replacement I realized that it fit a bit better than the first despite the tassels falling off so... I'm not sure itlf the tassles help or not. I've worn it several times now and the fit has remained snug. Will update if things change."
4.0,"I like it but i think the paint on the edges should be better, i totally loved it it is so elegant."
4.0,"Super cute, only thing i would change is the fact that the pattern doesn't continue into the inside and is just white. Other than that its a really cute sweater"
4.0,"Is there anything worse than online when no one has left a review!?! Well for me, I'm really iffy on product when there is zero word from anyone!! I took a chance on this blouse as it is reather lovely! I purchased a medium, I wear an American small. 34a/b cup. I usually go up at least one size when buying from overseas. This shirt is just as lovely in person! It is rather shear so a cami or tank is a must! The medium fits me well, good sleeve length. It buttons up nicely without any gapping. It does not feel too tight at the neck or wrists. I dont feel any constriction anywhere. The material is not bad and the sewing quality is ok. The material feels very light and breathable. So in summation: pretty shirt, shear, not bad quality faster shipping than predicted. I would recommend and purchase from this company again!"
4.0,"The color was deceptive on my computer, but I still liked the scarf well enough to order another in a different color. I liked the length and the heavier fabric toward the ends."
4.0,"Color excellent, very soft but does shed a lot. Keep a lint roller close by."
4.0,"These are perfect,the language mistake in two of them actually is pretty funny,my boy loves these,especially the numbers. He's weird tho"
4.0,This is a great shirt. The quality was good. My 14 year old son loved it. It was a perfect fit.
4.0,"It's a watch, tells time and looks weird"
4.0,"I love it I really do!  My problem is it's so heavy, you have to be casreful what you pin it onto."
4.0,It wears quickly. You get what you pay for.
4.0,These were awesome except the ball on the hat came off the first day and I was very gentle with it to begin with. Great quality.
4.0,"This is a very lovely skirt. The colors are beautiful and the gold trim around the bottom is beautiful. It does have an inner skirt that is quite a bit shorter than the outer skirt. The elastic waistband is nice and wide for comfortable wearing.<br />It would be perfect for a warm summer evening.<br />I had just one problem.. And it's not the fault of the garment.<br />Needs to be addressed tho. This skirt is very long. 38 inches to be exact. As a short girl this posed a problem. I am 5ft2 and a US size 2 unfortunately it's unwearable for me. I tried every way I could think because I really like it. I am an avid sewer and you cannot hem it because of the beautiful gold trim . And rolling the wide elastic waistband.... Well that was not a very attractive option for me.<br />But if you have the height to wear this skirt, by all means get one for yourself. It's a lovely addition to your summer wardrobe."
4.0,I bought these as an extra pair for tournaments and my son actually prefers this pair over his other.
4.0,"I originally ordered these in a small, since that is my normal size for pants and I own other small Lands End pants (I am 5'6"", 140 lbs). The smalls were too big and cinched at the waist, causing undesirable pleating at the crotch. It made the pants look MUCH more baggy and casual, which is an issue for a print that I feel could easily look like pajama pants.<br /><br />I reordered in an XS, and I am much happier. The waist stretches enough thay there are no pleats in the rest of the fabric. They seem much more like work pants than pajama pants now!<br /><br />The fabric is surprisingly thick, and the pants are really comfortable. I did need to hem the pants significantly, which is unusual. The waist is quite high, higher than anticipated - the elastic band sits on my belly button. I haven't found any shirts that look good tucked in."
4.0,Very beautiful bracelets. Worth the price. Problems with USPS delivery-why 4 stars.
4.0,"Great dress, fits my wife well! She is 4'11&#34; and 125lbs and she said was very comfortable. She will have to hem a couple inches as the dress is a little below her knees. The only thing she was not crazy about was the material of the skirt was a little rough to the touch but other than that it was a great deal."
4.0,Like the cloth and general fit.  A little snugger than normal.  Other than that it's good.
4.0,Very good glove. Style is not what i expected and is not good enough for Chicago winter.
4.0,I'm a large and bought a medium. Fits well and it's great for the gym.
4.0,My only problem is the opening is a bit smaller than I would care to have.
4.0,Cute and a great variety. Happy with purchase.
4.0,very dressy pendant the earings have lovely clasps
4.0,"Clearly these are a good value but, in fact, for larger folks there will be some disappointment"
4.0,These earrings look beautiful. They are well put together. I docked a star though due to how easily they tangle. When not wearing them the 2 sides of it tangled really bad. Not sure how that could be fixed.
4.0,Nice Scarf...
4.0,"Way too large, and too warm for climate."
4.0,They work well to keep stretchy jeans up without changing the look.
4.0,Outfit amazing hat sucks and can’t fit a human head
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter for her fifth birthday. It's beautiful the only thing is you have to be extremely careful with the rose because it loses its color very easily.
4.0,Shirt was super tighten it the shorts fit perfect!
4.0,soft and comfortable- there a little thin so these are good for warmer months.
4.0,I love the material! Very lightweight. The color is vibrant too. They’re just a little too small. Small enough to know that I wouldn’t be able to even try to wear them yet. I did order my size though. I guess just order a size or too up if you like them a little looser.
4.0,It’s cute. But I think it’s sole is little thick and heavy for the beginners to walk.
4.0,"It is great quality, especially for the price.  It is heavy stainless steel.  However, I didnt check the measurements.  I thought it was lighter and dainty.  Its heavy for my taste.  I know many will love it for the weight!"
4.0,"The material is thin and it's very see-through.  Top is tight on my chest.  I should have gotten an XL instead of a L.  Love the color and length.  Bought some pashmina's to wear with the dress to dress it up, and to cover my chest.  I hope my diet that I'm on helps it fit better."
4.0,Lovebthe color and style of the boot. Not able to zip up
4.0,"Bought this for my wife.  She said the pajama is nice and comfy, but the size a bit small."
4.0,"I received this item on time, and it matched the description as well but when I opened the sealed packaging I noticed there was a brownish/reddish quarter size stain right in the middle of the scarf. I am unsure as to what the stain is as I wasn't about to touch it so unfortunately I must return this. I did not want to give a horrible review as it is a beautiful scarf. The scarf itself is lightweight and sheer, skull heads are normal and not an abstract shape as sometimes they are when ordering online, but it was stained so therefore I could not give it 5 stars."
4.0,Order your size. I sized up like some comments stated to do and it's to big.
4.0,"I would have loved this suit if it fit in the bust. I bought a size up, due to recommendations that it would be a bit easier to put on. Unfortunately, my average-sized &#34;girls&#34; didn't come close to filling the bra cups. So, back it went. It's a lovely, good looking suit for you better-endowed ladies!"
4.0,They were awesome .....just sized a little bit to small ...but a good deal...my son was very happy ...I would order again ...just bigger
4.0,"These overalls are super comfy! For the price, they seem well made. They got softer after washing. The do kind of stretch out while you wear them which I think is good but some might not like that."
4.0,I bought it for my car.  The dice are great and pretty solid.  The chain is slightly too short and I have to switch it out for another longer one to be able to do what I want.  Otherwise it's a great product.
4.0,Very large bag and once the smell was gone it was nice.
4.0,"Nice, but run small. So order a size up"
4.0,"They fold it oddly so it's taking days to get the creases out, but for the price, it's a good deal."
4.0,I'm well endowed and this covered the girls but was large in the bodice and shoulders.
4.0,It is a pretty dress but runs small. I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it is a bit snug.
4.0,Great for a hiking or a day of sight seeing.  Well made and comfortable to wear.
4.0,I didn't realize how high the neck was but I like this okay and the price was great.
4.0,Today is tge 1st day I am wearing it and so far I love it! The chain is very beautiful! I may order one more!
4.0,My daughter really loved the shoes. Only reason I did not give a five is because the charging port for both shoes where not in the same place. We had to cut down in one shoe to move it up so that the shoe would charge properly.
4.0,"Great watch. It keeps exact time and it a nice looking watch. The price was great also. The only thing I didn't like was the metal closer where you connect the watch band, that metal closer was silver and the watch I ordered was gold. Other than that it's a great watch."
4.0,"Great item for the price.  I do wish it had pockets but otherwise it is what I expected based on the listing, very warm and comfortable! I typically wear and XL but based on the listing I ordered the 3X and I am glad I did...the top is a very slim fit so you will be best served sizing up at least once, twice if you like a looser fit.  I ordered the Black color and I appears exactly as listed.  Nearly identical to one currently selling at Abercrombie for nearly $50, but that one has pockets."
4.0,They ok. would be better if both side were the same.  Hard to get a good two point look but its doable. Cuff links kind of cheesey but needed the hanky to mach the vest  and tie i bought.
4.0,It is cute!!!
4.0,These showed up carefully packaged and looking exactly as described. Cant wait to wear them.
4.0,"Basic bands, easy to install. My friends think I bought a new watch every time I change bands!"
4.0,"At $7 each for the 3-pack at this writing, not a bad deal if you like to do that color coordination thing.  I’m more of a monochromatic guy but this assortment forces me to try to develop my fashion sense.  They’re nylon but don’t look cheap or plastic-y.<br /><br />Warning: it takes a bit of practice to be able to reflexively release the belt.  Until you get a feel for it, you’d be wise to avoid spicy food that might prompt...how should I put this...a sudden urge to purge if you get my meaning.  And depending on how you thread the belt through the belt loops on your pants, the tiny release lever may end up on the top or the bottom of the buckle when you wear it.  Just be aware that there’s a learning curve involved that you’re probably not used to."
4.0,"VERY soft. I'm sure that it's more comfortable to get them in when you're working with a larger gauge, but I was trying to stuff one into a 6 gauge cart piercing. I ultimately used a piece of paper as a tube to stiffen it up a bit to get it in. (It worked.)<br /><br />Its purpose is to keep the hole open while I find the jewelry I misplaced. It's going to work perfectly."
4.0,"The colors are not as bright as the photo shows, the yellow is very faded.  Otherwise good product."
4.0,Nice like alot just a little to big
4.0,im so glad it was adjustable! i got 2 for me and my sister and they were both thick and good quality rings.
4.0,Looks great!  but a little big.
4.0,Big to carry required stuff and handy to carry around
4.0,I got this gift for a girlfriend for her birthday. She loves butterflies specifically blue ones so when I came across these earrings I thought it be the perfect gift. The packaging it came in was beautiful and made it easy to make it a gift. She loved them and thought they were beautiful. I highly recommend these for a gift or just to buy for yourself.
4.0,It's a little baggy but my daugher loved it. She's obsessed with the Little Mermaid
4.0,"I like how it looks, how it feels but it slides off/down. lol I am 5’9” tall but very skinny & bought the smallest size they have yet it still was sliding low. I always have to pull my pants up."
4.0,"They could be a little longer. They barely reach over my 7 yr old's waist. They do fit snugly, but as intended, not as though they were too small. They're made for layering. They are comfortable, wash well, and look cute under her school uniform shirts. I like the lace in front, it's a nice touch!"
4.0,for a slightly tall and lanky girl I had to return and get a size larger. But she loved the gift
4.0,It wasn't what my customer wanted
4.0,"Got as a gift & they look exactly as shown! They sparkle like crazy which is what I want! I am a little worried about the little stones falling out because it came with 2 extra ones in the bag. Hopefully all goes well, am waiting for the big day for these!"
4.0,Great addition to my extensive costume jewelry collection. The orange color is just as pictured.  Very delicate though. So far I love them.
4.0,"Cute shirt but the large is huge. I'm 5'9"" 160#. Will be returning."
4.0,"This 35L Molle tactical backpack is truely wonderful as far as storage durability and price goes in my opinion. Has 2 major compartments with separators in each located underneath the flap that secures down which is a nice touch in itself. Makes the bag look unique and gives an extra layer of protection. Fold over flap has a nice 4""x4 zipup pocket, another thin flat zipup pocket, a place to tread your knife shealth into place and a velcro patch area. The flap part secure with a thick buckle which is adjustable in my ways to suit the thickness of your bag. Front of backpack has tons of places to attach molle accessories as well as velcro to attach patches. Other than the two main compartments the bag has a nice size 7x6"" pocket that zips up with an internal small zipup pocket and net. On the front of that pocket is another thin flat pocket as well for more storage. The front straps have a chest securement strap which is nice to assure the bag stays secure. I did buy a few molle attachments for my bag so far like a cell phone pouch for the front straps, A molle adjustable cup holder attachment, detachable waist strap for better securement and an accessory kit that had many different pieces that will be useful in the future. I threw my magazine pouch on the other strap and added my personal touches like my patches and pins to make it my own. Had someone do a few mods to it like folding the bands over so they dont come loose from there buckles because I use this while riding my motorcycle and I know the wind can be treacherous and I dont want them coming loose. I've got less than 100 bucks in my backpack and Its decked out with everything I need to get where I'm going with what I've got. I'm very satisfied in the quality for the price. With a few mods and attachments this has made an awesome backpack that I hope to use for many years. I had a maxpedition slingback but it is kinda small for what I usually tote around and they are quite expensive for new bigger packs so I went with a cheaper option and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I would buy again if needed to honestly. Hope this helped"
4.0,"Was pleasantly surprised as this ring is a great size, good detail and finished well.  Not sure how it will hold up, most likely just for casual use but very nice just the same."
4.0,as described just to high of a price. only bought for grandson bday
4.0,I ordered a pandora bracket charm and was surprised at the way the package was sent. I had always got it sent in a nice box and charm set in a velvet holding. This came in a thin cardboard box folded and charm wrapped in tissue paper. I realized the thin box was the box to wrap it in. The box had a hole in it and isn’t sturdy at all. I love pandora products and am very happy with the charm but just couldn’t believe how it was sent.
4.0,Really pretty shirt. It hangs really nice but is pretty thin. I was hoping for a little thicker of an over shirt. It hangs really nice and is super cute.
4.0,"Laces seem to be working well. Packaging as nice except there was zero directions. Not a major issue, just annoying to have to fiddle with it to determine how it works."
4.0,It’s absolutely adorable and lightweight. The elastic stretches far but it’s very tight.
4.0,"Definitely can tell it's not denim, but how cute and comfortable. Fits me awesome. I'm 5 foot 5 and around 135 pounds."
4.0,They are a Christmas gift so not entirely sure about the fit but looks as described
4.0,"The fit was good, but as you can see from the photo the shirt looks dark blue or navy blue, but upon receipt I received 2 royal blue shirts, I already had 2 from Costco.  When I saw the navy blue on line, I thought great I'll get two of the navy...disappointed the color was not accurately depicted."
4.0,"Super cute! Fits well everywhere on me but the chest, feels like there’s a lot of side boob"
4.0,Great looking product for a young man.
4.0,It’s pretty good. I mean it’s really thick but it works it washes off the body it just can stain carpets
4.0,Good quality jacket for the price. It’s not athletic fit like I hoped but not bad. It has a couple fake pockets but wouldn’t knock it down to 3 stars.
4.0,My boyfriend loved these socks. The only issue I have is the picture fades on the socks when stretched out to wear.
4.0,"This is a cute shirt, the fabric is VERY soft. I love the length, it was long enough that it covered my bum and I was able to wear it with leggings."
4.0,does exactly what I needed it to. holds excess belt loop and keeps it from flapping. easy to put on and adjust.
4.0,"This top seems like it runs really big, but that could be the way it’s supposed to be. I actually like the longer length and the flowy effect that the extra material gives. I got this to wear with jeggings and it looks great. This does seem to wrinkle easily on me so you might have to watch that. Comfortable and feminine; nice top!"
4.0,Love the color and size fits.
4.0,Nicely made very cute.
4.0,"Fits pretty good, the only problem is that the gloves are pretty thin and won't save you when it hits below 0  !! :O"
4.0,I should have seen from the picture that this shirt is see-though. Otherwise it is a nice shirt.
4.0,"As stated the  band is too long, but you can cut it with some scissors and then take a lighter and seal your cut so it won't fray. Decent quality. The doubled band towards the buckle seems useless and adds another piece of metal to get hung up in tight places. I wouldn't buy it again though."
4.0,Beautiful colors in this Maxi dress!
4.0,"I love this product and the only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead if a 5, is because I had to adjust one of the earrings to face the right way. The earrings are gorgeous and detailed, the necklace is a little bit big, but I knew it would be. I love the necklace it looks very beautiful and matches the earring just perfectly!"
4.0,Received compliments. Just the right size for my needs. Color is very nice.
4.0,Really nice product just a little smaller than expected
4.0,"These were thinner than I expected, but I should have paid more attention to the fact that they are glove liners, not gloves. I liked the fact that they are reflective (for walking dogs at night) but what's the point of that if you are wearing them under other gloves? I am still giving them 4 stars because I think they will be useful for night walks when it is not-so-cold, and because they are so thin, they will fit easily under my other gloves when it is cold. They are very comfortable and flexible, like wearing nothing, and the grippy stuff printed on the fingers works well. I am wearing them and typing this comment on a PC keyboard with no problem. My hands are not that large, but the L/XL fits me perfectly. If you have bigger hands, these might not work for you."
4.0,"Got it as a present for my brother in law , he lives in New York  He likes it it's warm perfect for cold weather Nice....So I'm getting another one for my son....Great choice"
4.0,I think they are great with something covering your butt....they are too see through and look too obscene to just wear like jeans. Other than that I love them they are comfy and will wear them with dusters or long blouses.
4.0,Nice for price. Some people thought it was a vest over the shirt. Not the highest material but overall great.
4.0,"Looked awesome on my mom on my sisters wedding. She is 5'1 and it just above her knees, shes 160 and ordered a large."
4.0,Nice strong good quality looks strong colour is a bit off bit that's fine
4.0,I love the colors but I think the top could be elasticized so the leg warmer doesn't slide down.
4.0,These are a great pair of work out shorts. Will most likely buy again.
4.0,I took a star for incorrect size shipping. Sounds lame but I was really looking forward to this purchase and that was disappointing. The pants are really cute! But I purchased them for going home in postpartum in a size up (medium) & they sent me a small. I guess I’ll just take the L and be excited to wear these later on since I don’t have enough time to return and get a new pair in time. I also learned this color (dusky pink marl) is not squat proof “yet”. So make sure to read which ones are more “90% squat proof”.
4.0,I ordered 2.<br />One arrived in good condition and was truly beautiful.<br />One arrived dirty in a pouch with a broken zipper. I sent it back and was refunded promptly.<br />Overall would buy it again.
4.0,"I like the variety of shapes, sizes and themes. These are my first charms so I'm not sure what others are like. But I think it would be better if the piece you insert into the shoe was rubber instead of metal. Be careful putting them in and taking them out because you could ""stretch"" and/or damage the hole in the shoe, esp. around the edge."
4.0,"This was the only skeleton watch I found attractive on Amazon, really love the colors and black band. Wasn't a fan of the blue medal on the hook, I wish it was all in silver."
4.0,"Nice leatherlike fabric, but NOT 100% cotton as stated on listing description.  I have a 30"" waist and usually wear a size 10 or a medium pant. I ordered the large based on the size chart and they fit perfectly. The eladtic waist is forgiving. They are pretty short shorts, but not to short to feel comfortable.  Snowing now, but looking forward to wearing soon."
4.0,"These tanks fit snug.  Originally purchased a large,  as that's the size I typically wear.  Exchanged for an XXL.  Definitely not ""compression"" but still cute."
4.0,"I don’t prefer the top as it is not very padded or very reasonable to workout in, the leggings are basic but comfy. Size fits just right."
4.0,"hard to get on , very tight"
4.0,"Very pretty.  In pictures seller posted on the selling page the interior was light colored and did not have a middle zipper pocket.  Purse I received had medium brown interior and a middle zip pocket.  Might have kept it if it had just been a bit bigger.  Very impressed with the quality, however. Not a light bag either."
4.0,"Followed the size guide and I am very happy with the bras. Very supportive and easy to put on. I love the added shape of the cups- no more uniboob! Zipper is a bit tricky but once i figured it out, it was super easy. I would definitely recommend!"
4.0,a liittle large but with the tape provided it works out well.
4.0,Well made. Nice fit. Coconut buttons. Wish it came in different colors.
4.0,Super warm! A little awkward fitting around the waste.
4.0,I am a petite woman. The dress was too long. My mom had to fix the  length.  The design is nice. I do not recommend for a short woman.
4.0,"I highly recommend the Lian San Progressive Lenses in the 3 pack.  The frame colors are beautiful.  The power of the 3 stages of lense progression is exactly as described.<br />With the following exception, I think the glasses are underpriced and you should buy:<br />The size of the frame is not in the Description.  It says “large “ but what does that mean?  I suggest that the frames should be rectangular and larger in width than they are presently."
4.0,"I like the way this dress fits. It does have a deep v-neck which I’m going to sew up a bit to be able to wear it with a regular bra. Thinner material, going to be great to travel. Order your actual size. I’m 5’0, 129lbs, 36b and it fits me slightly lose which I prefer."
4.0,The purse just arrived yesterday and it is better than expected.  I love the zipper that goes down the sides to allow you to fully open the purse.  This makes finding things in the bottom your purse very easy.  There is lots of room and several zippered compartments to keep you organized.  The vinyl feels and looks very good.  It is stiff so the purse stands up and does not collapse.  I will be using this as my everyday bag and will have to see how it holds up.  For now it looks and feels very well made and sturdy.  I'll do an update later.  I'm giving it 4 stars today because I don't know how it will hold up
4.0,I was hesitant to purchase initially because the reviews were mixed. I ended up purchasing it anyway and it fit just fine! I am 5'4&#34; 190 pounds and I ordered a large. The only issue I had was some of the seams were sewn improperly but nothing that was noticeable.
4.0,I received my earrings and they were beautiful!
4.0,"Nice hat, but a little too big."
4.0,"It fit like it said it would. On the bottoms there isn't much lining in there, so when they get wet they are a little see through, but I just paired the top with a different bottom. All in all I love the suit, the color is great!"
4.0,Super cute the colors weren’t that vibrant but still cute
4.0,"the hoodie is very comfortable, very soft, but runs a bit small."
4.0,After reading many reviews I decided to order up and get a large. I really wish I would have gotten a medium now. It would look great if I was using it as a poncho. Maybe a belt would help make it look less Like a maternity outfit. Fits fine on the shoulders and length is great but dang.... it is very wide! I am 5'2&#34; and weigh about 125lbs. Shirts vary of what I usually buy from large to medium but this time I wish I would have sized down.
4.0,Very cute little summer outfit.
4.0,Love it for crawlers. I used it with my baby for 3 months to protect his knees
4.0,"Perfect size for what I wanted. Straps were perfect also. I have arthritis and can't carry a purse on my shoulders,so this backpack is a perfect size for me to use as a purse. The only bad thing was that it wasn't a mint color,more like a leaf green. But its still super cute and I'd buy it again."
4.0,"I bought this top to wear under my sleeveless top's. I am a ladies xl & I ordered an xl & glad I did.  The top fits snugly like a shape wear piece would & the sleeves are not snug, but not too big, a little long for my short arm's.  I would never wear this as a top on it's own because of the snug fit.  It was a much led expe"
4.0,"This shirt is soft and fits me well. I did not shrink in the wash, nor did the distressed letters fade (which has happened to me with other products).<br /><br />I ordered this shirt for Mother's Day and it worked well for that.  I did think it was a bit expensive for such a simple design, but I was in a rush. If you have time, I would recommend shopping around for other options."
4.0,Está bonito para los niños solo que se descarga muy rápido
4.0,"The material is very soft, with microfleece on the inside, I like it,  the description is a bit misleading, it says cotton/polyester, the tag says 100% polyester, the pull string in the hood looks to be made of cotton, so maybe that is what they are referring to. Only one side has a zipper."
4.0,I really enjoyed the fit and the color was awesome but the bell sleeves caused me to lower the rating.  The rubber on the sleeves was out so the sleeves just hung at my wrist which took away from the complete look of the dress.  And since the sleeves are bell they don't look right just hanging.
4.0,"The actual shape of the dress is not as pictured, or at least mine wasn’t.  It really is more like an A-line than a waisted dress. I’ll just take in the bodice at the waist so it looks like the picture.<br /><br />After a few wears and two washes the fabric is pilling.  It is even worse at sides under the arms.  It makes the black seem faded.  Very disappointing."
4.0,Absolutely love the style of this watch. Adds a flair to my wardrobe and I get tons of comments on it. Can't beat it for the price.
4.0,"Its true to size, the white top isn't see-through which is great since I didn't want to wear a shirt under this. The flowers are not ironed on instead they are just sewed on, which can be bad if you don't wash this inside out."
4.0,Really nice wristband.
4.0,I bought the silver tone model last spring and wore it with my silver jewelry. No problems for six months. The gold tone has been on my wrist for several months. I wish the color more closely matched my 14K jewelry. Otherwise it was a good purchase.
4.0,"I got the ring in size 7, I wish they had half sizes but it's ok. It didn't come in a jewelry box like it claimed it would show up in, as u can see from my photos it came in a plastic baggie. Anyway the band seems 2b pretty durable. The biggest problem I have is the ring that's connecting the charm 2 the ring is very thin. So just b careful wearing this ring for any cleaning, or wearing it 4 a long period of time, chances are it'll twist and break off. Overall it's pretty, and it shipped on time."
4.0,"While it is warm, its not very stylish...but that's OK.  The clasp used to keep the hat on is kind of hard to use, but it does work. For the price, this isn't a bad hat."
4.0,"Buen short, y buen pad, me gustaría que el pad fuera para MTB. El actual viene clasificado para road. Lo pueden ver en en la web de quality cycling pads"
4.0,"This bag is as described. Good quality, the print looks like the photos and it is attractive.  The bag is a little bit bigger than a &#34;weekender&#34; for me. There isn't much structure, so if you don't have the bag filled, the sides droop. I am light packer BUT if you are someone who is a moderate to heavy packer this is a great bag."
4.0,The Faux Wrap at the waist was disappointing to me. I felt like it didn’t match up and looked as though it was sewn incorrectly. Loved the fit and fabric otherwise.
4.0,"The color is very pretty. Fabric is light and airy, will be good for summer. The only slight downfall is that it's a little thinner of a material. I like that it's light because I plan on wearing it in Florida, but was hoping it would be a little thicker so it's not see through, if that makes sense."
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful and the stones are stunning. The blue color is unreal. They don't look super expensive, but the stones are pretty enough that it doesn't matter."
4.0,Pretty good shirt
4.0,This necklace is Gorgeous! It has weight to it. Not too heavy n doesn't look cheap. Delivery was fast and packaging was good. Can't 5 star this yet until I wear it. I can't wait though~it's really pretty n looks like the picture or even better.
4.0,You have to be careful taking it off because it’s fragile and you don’t want to brake it but overall it’s so cute
4.0,"This pendulum is nicely weighted and quite beautiful.  The chain was a little too short, so I replaced it.  It is definitely worth the cost."
4.0,Good product but zip closure of main compartment restricts the space .
4.0,The pendant looks awesome.  Has a nice size to it and stands out.  I would say just replace the chain to something shiny to make it stand out more.
4.0,"I've only just tried them on and I can tell you instantly from just looking at them that they're not going to be waterproof...  Water resistant and quick to dry maybe... But not water proof.<br /><br />That being said... They look awesome and fit great!  They feel comfortable too.  I would say that they would make a great hiking pant because they're breathable would probably do well in wet conditions because they're not likely to get saturated and make you cold.<br /><br />I'm going to keep them, but this wasn't what I was after. I wanted actual waterproof pants or pant covers because I'm an equine vet in the PNW which means frequently working outside in the rain."
4.0,"My son wears size 8, we ordered size 12 because that was all that was available.  It barely fit him around the waist.  The length was appropriate for a 12 year old however.<br />Other than that, good pants, worked well for his Jimmy Neutron cosplay, and the material is good quality."
4.0,"Great shirt. I wear it for work. I suggest buying a size smaller because it runs slightly large. It’s made of quality material, and will definitely last a long time."
4.0,nice color.......awesome fit.... SOLID!!!
4.0,Dress was cute and fabric didn’t look too cheap. It was just too long for my liking.
4.0,Dress is Beautiful but didn't fit well on me
4.0,"Shoes run approx 1 size small as expected for a cheaper brand. they look great on, have a cool 1920's feel to them and are perfect for my daughter to wear on her school's formal day each week. I would recommend them just buy a size up. [[ASIN:B00Q2FY8LO ELLIE 105 SADDLE Womens Black w/ White Oxfords Shoes, Size - 9]]"
4.0,"Like very much. Good size. Gave 4 stars was a issue with one buckle put on wrong way still works. Had a funny smell, washed let air dry no more smell."
4.0,"It can be hard to find gifts that say, ""Nonna"". I was happy to come across this bracelet. It is pretty, sweet and my MIL loved it."
4.0,Liked that the product worked just as described. Held my glasses on my face without shifting during a hike and was comfortable.
4.0,"I ordered a size large but it seems to run slightly smaller than other tanks I've purchased, it's comfy but snug. Feels like it has a bit more than 5% Spandex. It's longer hip length sufficiently covers my full rear. The simple 'down the spine' design is very hip and inspiring.  A great tank for yoga practice!"
4.0,"Really pretty, delicate, wish the chain was a little thicker but overall it is pretty. Very nice for a gift"
4.0,"Ordered a large in fear of being too small. Ended up a little bigger than intended, but It is a beautiful dress. Heavy weight and not sheer at all. Ordered the beige colored one. Would probably buy again in another color."
4.0,"I ordered 2 pink ones and a blue ones. The blue ones are great, but the pink ones turn everything green. They look exactly as they appear on the listing, but the pink ones either have green lens, or a green film because they give everything a green tint. You get used to the green tint after wearing them for a while, but it's really noticeable the first time you put them on each time you wear them."
4.0,Nice links and a good price
4.0,"Beautiful green color!  The design is elegant and unique, got compliments.  The only things I didn't like was it was not shiny enough so made it look kind of cheap.  The earrings were larger than I expected though.  Wish it was gold metal instead, but still cute and beautiful."
4.0,"I like these jeans a lot for the price. They have a good bit of stretch to the which is nice, but may cause them to stretch out a bit with some wear. The zipper and button are somewhat cheap, but for the price I’m fine with it. I like the rips/tears throughout the legs. I think they are fairly decent jeans for the price. I’m 5’8” and usually a size 9 in pants and purchased a large. They fit well."
4.0,"Pretty color and good quality bracelet, it was just too large for my wrist and I wasn't able to really tighten it to fit me at all so I returned it."
4.0,"Very cute top but it feels a little boxy. I have a short torso and the small shirt seems a little long. Especially if you have wider hips you will look bulky on top, since the shirt will stop right above hips. The colors are very pretty and you get what you pay for."
4.0,Extremely thin and delicate. Pretty and silk.
4.0,"I am pleasantly surprised with how cute this is! A tad tight on my bust, but could be because I'm currently nursing. Material is paper-like but just fine!"
4.0,"I love this necklace. Although I haven't worn it yet, it has not changed color. The rhinestone heart is gorgeous and very blingy!"
4.0,Love these pearl cages! They are easy to use and look pretty. My only issue with these is the silver starts to wear after a handful of uses.
4.0,good quality and nice looking.  Exactly as hoped.  Would have liked to have more selection of images to choose from.
4.0,"I am typically a size 4 ordered a small and fits great.  This is a beautiful dress my only complaint is that the lace does not lay flat, I ended up bringing to the seamstress to have it tacked down."
4.0,"Needed pressing. A bit shorter than I like, sleeves extra long. I'll keep it. It's comfortable,  and the print is pretty."
4.0,I like the way they fit can of thin but acceptable for the price..
4.0,"This fits a little bigger than expected. It's workable/wearable, but it's not sexy IMO. The band is also really wide, which I don't think is necessary. Probably a better bra for larger chests."
4.0,"The fit and feel were so comfortable, and no chaffing."
4.0,At first I didn't think that I got the pins to attach it until I went back and looked in the package. They were there but easy to miss if you were assuming they were supposed to come ON the band. Once I figured it out I was happy with it.
4.0,"My girls have always loved dressing-up and now are getting excited about cosplay (can't blame them there). I wasn't sure what to expect with this, considering the price, but I'm pretty satisfied with it and they're practically overjoyed. The material is thin, but it's well made and doesn't look like a cheap costume. It's a favorite of my middle daughter in particular (she's basically taken it over at this point) and it looks cute on her (she pairs it with a long blonde wig to look more like Yomoduki Runa from Kakegurui). The sizing seems about right, but you'll probably still want to go up one size (this is supposed to be oversized). All-in-all, this is great for fans and budget-conscious cosplayers."
4.0,Like the way they look and feels. Use them for a wedding.
4.0,"Very loose fit, but how you’d probably want for a Cape! (5’6” 110lbs) good quality other than one of the ribbons to tie the cape with was sewn in the wrong spot? Was able to cut off and hot glue to correct location but very odd!"
4.0,"These are cheap, accurate, and work just fine. All I needed, so happy with it."
4.0,as title.
4.0,These are great. Pouch is good leg opening and waist are all solid too. All around just a tad tight. If you like a snug fit then that’s great. If not go one size up
4.0,"Looks like a pretty good quality case... It has a rubber part that would fit around you Google Pixel XL 2 and then a plastic part that snaps on the rubber part pretty well. It has a card holder that fits one card comfortably. Although, I've had a similar case like this before that I was able to squeeze in an additional card, so I'm sure it's possible to do so with this case as well (at your own risk, of course).  The only problem I had was that I accidentally ordered the wrong size for my phone (oops!), so I will be returning this one and purchasing the exact same kind in the correct size. Since I wasn't actually able to fit my phone in it and actually use it, I took a star off the review, but I'm confident it would fit and protect the right phone pretty well."
4.0,Cute I purchased the green material is thin.
4.0,"The necklace is good quality; for the pendant, but the chain broke after a week or so. Easy to replace and put back together on any other chain you'd like. Still a great product overall."
4.0,"Good for some who want a supportive, yet minimal insole. The shape is excellent with a deep heel cup and arch support. These insoles are minimalist. For myself, since I am on my feet all day, I would have liked one more layer under the cork for cushioning.  I love sustainably sourced cork as a material, but they were too thin for me. I think some people will love these, and some will want more substance."
4.0,"Ok. So this product came with a slight stain, which I’m assuming happened when s customer retuned it and they didn’t notice. But otherwise it was in really good shape. The stain came right out. I love that this dress is stretchy and flowy. It fits loose but fitted in the bust area. It looks as advertised. I ordered a small and an 5’2” and approximately 135lbs. It fits perfect."
4.0,Fits good as a matter fact it hugs your body once you adjust the strings. FYI the material is not silky it’s a strange type of cotton ish material. It’s the one that gives lint balls after a while. I’ll use it for a running errands  dress I guess.
4.0,Great variety. Smaller than I thought. Not easy to fold into fancy designs because they are so smooth and silky.
4.0,Beautiful but too small. I should get a bigger size.
4.0,So far I really like this😀
4.0,"A little loose especially in the arms and the description says fits small, but I really like it regardless!"
4.0,"I like the shirt, but they do run big."
4.0,"Cute! A little lighter in fabric than I expected, and a little more clingy. I still like it though. Definitely a nice spring dress. I enjoy mine with a crinoline to make the skirt bell out into more of an A-line, but that is a personal preference. Fabric has a decent amount of stretch and breathes pretty well."
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; & 125lbs, the medium is a nice fit but it's definitely a tunic/shirt. I wouldn't wear as a dress unless I was 19 again!"
4.0,It worked for what I needed it for
4.0,"I like it, but little be small for 57 centimeters."
4.0,"I like it, but it is too small. Just returned and ordered the 20 inch."
4.0,Very cute. The bottoms fit great for someone like me who has no butt. The top is too large (I'm 34 A).
4.0,I love this romper. Perfect beach cover up! Got tons of compliments!
4.0,"El reloj venía nuevo, bien empacado con los plásticos protectores. Lamentablemente el anillo de los segundos está desalineado de los marcadores, pero esto es un fallo de Seiko, no del vendedor. Un reloj espectacular."
4.0,"I was disappointed in not being able to find the same hipsters that I liked from Warners.  After a few other brand returns, I am happy with these.  Many others do not have a cotton crotch; this one does.  I typically wear a 6, and these fit, but I'd say they run a tad bit small compared to Warners.  (or else Covid lbs are sneaking in :).  Nice selection of colors. Good elastic."
4.0,"It's large like other reviewers have pointed out, but my husband doesn't mind because he has always put his wallet in his front pocket. He likes the various sections for multiple cards."
4.0,So cute but my 12-month old still kicks them off :(
4.0,"Very warm, not adjustable, but reasonably sized."
4.0,"Cute matching hat and scarf duo that is perfect for cold days.  The yarn is thick and tightly woven, helping to keep the cold hair out.  The colors are vibrant and fun and will work with virtually any color coat, sweater, or whatever outer ware you choose to wear with it."
4.0,I love the feel of this coat. It runs true to size with a lil extra room but I need that. It looks great! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have to wear a sweatshirt under to keep warm. Not a winter coat for sure! Great for fall or late spring
4.0,Nice comfortable feel to the fabric. Feels a bit close around the torso. The pants have to be rolled up at the waist.
4.0,nice piece...i like it
4.0,"I bought this shirt for my husband , for the price i would say its ok . The color is nice , doesnt shrink when you wash , plus you can wear it like a cool summer shirt."
4.0,Love these tights. Very comfortable. High waist is my favorite.
4.0,"I really love the design, But being 5'2 it was a bit too long. It went down to my knees.  A couple of inched shorter and it would have been perfect."
4.0,"All good but the wrist snaps are weak and the straps dangle, so instead of returning them I JP welded the snap in place. Now they are good. Touch screen is perfect , fits well and leather is soft, great for driving. Hope they last without ripping. Will keep you posted."
4.0,"Been using it past 3 weeks when playing tennis. It is stylish, weight-less, very comfortable and perfect for sports and any outdoor activity. Especially like the nose-bridge. The only issue I have is since it is all plastic, hence the light weight, it feels a little flimsy ( not as solid as the other materials). But the quality is definitely there and you can't beat the price. I have 6 pairs of SUNGAIT sunglasses and they are all as good as the pricier designer ones."
4.0,My daughter who is a plus size extra large had to hand it down to my other daughter who is a petite xl.
4.0,They feel good and look good.
4.0,They are nice and well made but the color is much more green than the picture shows.
4.0,Appreciate the quality of these handkerchiefs.
4.0,"Offered to a close, this bracelet is nice.<br /><br />It comes with a nice blue litlle box and arrived on time thanks to Premium delivery.<br /><br />Nothing more to say about this little jewle, I recommand it !<br /><br />♪ I hope this gave you an idea of this product. If yes, then don't hesitate to show it by clicking on &#34;useful&#34; button just below ! ♪"
4.0,It's cute. Could be bigger. Gf likes it
4.0,"I thought I purchased very big to wear multiple HEAVY sweatshirts under, but this coat must run smaller?? Nice softness to it. Not worth hassel of returning."
4.0,"I (Grant's wife) wear a size 9 women's shoe. Bought the recommended size and they fit as expected. The weight is what I wanted... lightweight but not sheer or too thin. Bought them to wear with low boots, they work great."
4.0,"Run small, but feel good."
4.0,"Cute overall. One pair did come mismatched, however."
4.0,"a gift, they liked it."
4.0,The prints are so cute but the fabric is hard .
4.0,Longer than I anticipated but still love the fit
4.0,small medium size is more like small only
4.0,I had ordered the robe as a gift to my mother's birthday but unfortunately the robe had some lose stitches which resulted in small holes. I had emailed the company about the faults in the robe and they were extremely kind enough to send another robe. This robe is extremely soft and so warm.
4.0,"My son loved this...he is totally in love with Zelda. Unfortunately, the emblem wasn't designed for a teen boy (seriously? It's a Zelda game) and it came off within the first week. He still has the emblem and the beanie...just not together anymore."
4.0,"This sash/bow was great quality and great length, however I am not adept at tying a bow properly apparently, b/c I could not make it look like it does in the image, it was very floppy and very loose. Unclear if this was user error, or just not practical given that there is no ""stiffness"" to the product. Maybe with some starch or something it would have kept it's shape but I don't have starch, or the patience."
4.0,Really happy with purchase but I wish the dress was easier to get on and off. The zipper it has is on the side under the arm so you have to pull the dress over your head to get it on and off.
4.0,"The leggings are easy to put in, true to size and very comfortable. They are a little more lightweight than I would have liked for cold weather, but overall a great buy."
4.0,I bought these pants for my daughter and she lives them and surprisingly they look even better in person.<br />Con is they run smaller than stated so buy a size or 2 larger.
4.0,fits very nice and well made!!
4.0,"This is a pretty dress, and my daughter loves it.  The print is pretty, and it will be a great option when summer rolls around again. The fabric is a soft, comfortable knit that drapes well, but it hides nothing and clings to any bulges you may have. It fits maybe a tiny bit smaller than expected, but is (mostly) true to size. If you are between sizes the larger option might work better.  I was disappointed not to find a care tag on the dress anywhere. It looks like cold water wash and line dry to me, but that is just a guess -- and I would prefer not to have to guess."
4.0,I still have it. Cardigans are just not my thing anymore. It was very thin and fitted. It was a little soft. Not really going to warm you. Looks a shade darker than photo.
4.0,Good water shoes I happy wiht it
4.0,Cute spring dress
4.0,"I'm a tall guy. Big feet, calves are pretty fit. I wear 15-16 shoes/boots, depending on the brand. I've never had a '2x' or some relative size shoe, so I didn't know what size of these to order. I did the 2x-3x and the 4x-5x.<br /><br />The 2-3x was snug on my feet. Made my toes pull in. The 4x-5x was a much better fit for my feet. But, the tradeoff is the 2x-3x fit better on my calf. Ultimately, I'd suggest going a larger size up, you can always adjust the calf later (rolling down or whatever) but you can't just make more room for your feet.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad product, just a bad description."
4.0,"The silicone strap is lightweight and sweatproof / waterproof.  The Face size of 25 mm fits well on my Ladies wrist and does not have a high case height (which you tend to bang into things when you are moving around throughout the day).  Only thing that I would change on this particular model is to make the time easier to read by eliminating Yellow numerals and making both the hour hand and the minute hand in a dark, contrasting color.  The light blue hand is hard to read."
4.0,"This is the perfect summer, beachy dress. Its very light weight but not see through! It feels a little stretchy and its nice and flowy."
4.0,Super cute. Love the linen type fabric. Light weight. A lot longer than shown in picture but overall keeping! Cute!
4.0,Glad I ordered a size bigger for the linning. They keep my feet warm and dry. They are more of a high top but for me that's good.
4.0,"The jumper fits very well with lightweight material; however, it's a little short in length. I'm 5'9 and it's about 2 inches short.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice product and I will wear it with some minor alterations. Maybe, have it tailored to a gaucho jumper."
4.0,like  it except the draw string rather flimsy had to replace it
4.0,"Vivitulip Women's Short Sleeve T Shirts Summer Crew Neck Tops Casual Loose Tees with Pocket<br /><br />This shirt runs a size or two small as some other reviewers have mentioned. I'm normally a small or medium, I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs, between an A and B cup. I went with a large and it fits tight across the chest and the shoulders. The scoop neck is very high cut. I like the blue color, and the front pocket, but the fit is definitely off."
4.0,"Will use these on a trip, light weight takes up very little room in luggage."
4.0,"As expected, very lightweight."
4.0,It's a very nice.  I liked the clasp. Thought I would never have any problem with it compared to the magnetic clasp one I lost.  Yesterday I felt it come apart and upon examination saw that it had come unglued inside the clasp.  I was lucky and caught it before I lost it.  I put some super glue on it and pushed it back together.  Seems to be holding.  Just be careful.
4.0,"Bought the 80l, feels good. Does what it's supposed to. Fabric is very thin."
4.0,"Back to back with the college frat. Fringes need some work but hey, it was really cheap."
4.0,"These are pretty comfortable slippers, but I was expecting a little thicker foam. The material is pretty soft and the mesh strap is comfortable. The foam padding is nice and does cushion, but it's just not very thick. The sole is strong and sturdy with a good grip on the bottom. The color is definitely bright and vibrant!"
4.0,Beautifully designed . I am enjoying this guy . Many compliments!
4.0,Very comfortable to wear .
4.0,Very pleased with this top.  Just enough coverage and light as a feather.  I'm 5'1&#34; and it comes to about four inches above the knee on me. Lost a star d/t the color which is a pale green rather than blue.  Otherwise it's flattering and feminine which is just what I was after.
4.0,This is a nice lightweight comfortable casual dress top. I like that it covers the whole rear end yet not too long in the front. I am only 5' tall so the small was a bit too long in back but still looked fine.
4.0,♡ Cute
4.0,This dress is nice.  The sizes run a little large and hopefully the wrinkles will come out.
4.0,"Good: it smells like leather! Mmm. Not so good: none of the pockets are quite big enough for my cell phone so I have to have it tumbling inside with all my stuff. Also, I would have liked the main zipper to be a double-edged meeting in top center for better security. (Hard to buy a purse without holding it first). But the quality is great for the price."
4.0,"I really love the dress, it fit perfect and shows my figure.I gave it 1 star because of the material, I wish it a stretchy cotton."
4.0,This shirt was what I was expecting and is very comfortable.
4.0,"Ordered these for my youngest son.  I ordered the medium size, and although they do fit, I had expected them to be a slightly looser fit.  If you're in between sizes, I recommend getting the larger one, unless you prefer your joggers with a snugger fit.  I've washed and dried them to test for shrinkage, nothing noticeable if they did.  Would recommend these, they aren't a thin material, nor overly thick. Can wear for every season except summer.  My son loves them, and skinny jeans are the &quot;in&quot;  style right now.<br /><br />Although I did receive this product free for review, my reviews will ALWAYS be 100% honest  ! Thank you!"
4.0,This set is so cute and I love the bright color!
4.0,"When I found out how comfortable these are once you get them on (total challenge), I just forget about the swelling which still happens a little due to my excessive sitting or it could be all the standing but I'm pretty sure it's just genetic. My dad has the same problem but never used the tools of today like compression sox (he would have never been able to put them on (total challenge). Compression sox are not a medical item(s) these do not cure anything or help (all that much). But All the false statements they make in order to sell the sox DO. Because laughter is healthy kind of.  It probably does more than these sox do for your health but what I love most of all is all the repetitive space age designs and in EVER COLOUR! Sadly though these don't have much integrity when it comes to the washing machine. I hang dry theses sox otherwise they turn into compression rags. I have a lot of them, in almost every colour.  I have so many compression sox I can't even write a unique review. I need a compression drawer. If it weren't for the price I would by a dozen of them at a time.<br /><br />*Bottom line *<br />comfortable - yes after the struggle of putting them on<br />cheap - only in quality<br />style - current (also seen wearing in circa 1978 Battlestar Galactica series)<br />recommend - NO!  Go see a physician first. Swelling usually mean underlying issues.<br />Reason for not getting 5 stars - oh wow i could list a ton but mostly POOR QUALITY. not a fan!"
4.0,Item was good quality. However I ordered blue but received an oatmeal color. I would have kept it but it was too small. It is not easy for me to find a good fit. I would order again.
4.0,"Nice quality, classic look"
4.0,"If you are looking for a flowy dress like I was, this is not a dress that has that type of movement. I know this may come off as an odd thing to describe, but I have back problems and I am plus size. I found that the dress was rather heavy because of material and how much material that was used to make the dress. No complaints with the design, it fits really well. I want to add a little more about the material; it doesn't breathe well. I'm someone who usually feels its too hot most of the time."
4.0,Fits and wears well. Bow came undone right away
4.0,"I really liked the dress on the hanger and when I saw it online, but when I tried it on it didn’t look as cute. The sleeves where a little more puffy than I thought they would be. It was more sheer than it looks on the product photos. Love the dress and the color just wasn’t for me."
4.0,Encatada con esta compra la talla se adapta al 100% con lo solicitado
4.0,I love squirrels says it all. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the type that is inserted into the charm I received is a bit crooked. It is the first thing I noticed when I opened it up. It isn't a deal breaker and not worth the seller needing to resend a 2nd charm through the return process. But it did get my attention right away.
4.0,Nice ring for family member. They love it!
4.0,I had to trim it down to get it to wear I like it.
4.0,"I purchased these Air Travel Compression Socks, in XL, prior to a very long flight because I often have issues with my feet swelling if sitting for hours on end.  Two of the 3 flights (one way) were 5 1/2 hours each.  The socks performed as described and my feet did not swell nearly as much as they would have without the socks. The socks were not very difficult to put on and were not binding at the top if pulled up to within a 2 finger width below the knee, as recommended with other compression socks.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is these socks are thicker than I prefer and I was a little warm on one of the flights. I do wish they came in a lighter color, but with black pants and black slip-on sneakers, they looked fine."
4.0,Strap is slippery I’m trying to find out how to fix it
4.0,"This dress is really lovely but I ordered a size up and it was way too big. I'm 5'7, 145lbs with a 32d chest.  Everything fit okay but the chest was huge.  Not for women with a small bust."
4.0,"Finally, sunglasses that I can wear over my prescription glasses instead those ugly and heavy pair I'm using. They fit nicely and provide balanced shade; not too dark, or too bright. As far as protection from UV or other harmful radiation, I have no idea, for there is nothing on the glasses themselves to indicate such protection. Amazon product detail page does not provide such information either. So, if you are concerned about that, I don't think this is for you. I did not know about the fact that they do not provide any protection from harmful radiation until I purchased them."
4.0,The belt is a perfect fit for my tiny waisted 6 year old. I got the medium for her sized 32 waist.  There's enough belt for her to grow into so I'm hoping that i won't need to buy her another one for some time. The quality is good but she's only had it for less than a month so I'm not sure how long the quality will last. I'm glad that they have an option to buy 2 in a pack. Overall I'm pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"Good look, fits nice"
4.0,Has a fishy oder
4.0,"It's my daughter loved it, but even with the strap adjuster the top is a bit too loose. Otherwise, it’s perfect. If you buy size down"
4.0,Different blend than the last set I got.
4.0,Love the undies. Fit well and are breathable and durable. Would buy again.
4.0,A little bigger and heavier than expected. A little larger for daily wear but still a beautiful piece. Seems very well made.
4.0,"Love, love, love the comfort of this dress. It is casual enough to wear around the house but can be dressed up enough to wear in public. It is so comfortable. This fabric is nice and soft."
4.0,"This set is incredibility comfortable - and with all of the time at home I get too fully embraced comfort-wear.  I would have preferred version without a hood, as I do not ever seem to have a need. The material feels amazing and breathable. While I consider this mostly at-home comfort-wear; it is appropriate to wear to run those errands."
4.0,These seem to be good quality and the fastener should hold it on. Very cute design. I will update my review after they have been used.
4.0,It is a good quality product but i wont be buying again. It took a long time to ship and it leaves your hand smelling like pennines.
4.0,"I got a small but it’s really big, wish it was smaller."
4.0,Chain is a little flimsy but they sparkle just Like they do in the picture. The earrings are good quality unlike most earrings didn't cause my ears to swell overall a good buy but gonna need to buy a replacement chain at some point
4.0,"Its a great product, and exactly what you see. The only thing is it does run a little small. I got the XL which usually fiesta perfect, and its pretty snug on me. Order a size up."
4.0,Using it for my portable oxygen tank and it softens the weight
4.0,Looks wonderful! Inevitable cameltoe if you wear nothing under it but I think I'm either going to add a liner or something to it to help. The seam runs through the crotch which is why it's that way.
4.0,"I love it! It's super cute, though a little bigger than I envisioned. I bought the one with purple bows, which gives it a nice touch. There is an outside pocket in the back and one on the inside. Took off one star because I think it's over-priced."
4.0,Love the shirt but it does run a little small so order accordingly
4.0,"I wanted something simple to match a few outfits. These are the perfect size, and very sparkly. Great value too."
4.0,"I love the dress, but it was tight in the shoulders.  One size up (XXL) would have worked better for me, I usually wear a 14/16.  I loved the cut and the fabric."
4.0,"Overall, it's a nice jacket. Not quite as slim fitting as pictured, as the sleeves and bottom leave a bit of extra room."
4.0,Nice case ~ would have given 5 stars but the wrist strap is pathetic.
4.0,I originally thought this bag was great quality until I used it the first and the zipper broke.
4.0,After just a couple washings and line drying fabric is already piling.
4.0,"Light weight material which is great for hot days. If it were to get wet, it would dry really easily. The color is nice, a dark Grey. One star off for sizing, it runs slightly small, but it's a little stretchy and will probably loosen up a bit."
4.0,Did turn green but still decently effective
4.0,I used this for work as my inspection bag. It's great! Lots of places to put things.
4.0,Shoulders are more exposed than anticipated
4.0,These were so much better than expected. Bright colors and good detail. Varied colors in pairs made earrings really easy to match with crystal beads. Arrived quickly. Would definitely buy again.
4.0,"Surprisingly good quality. I was suspicious at first and very happy with purchase.<br />Has a bit of weight to it so may be warm if too hot outside, but looks elegant for a garden party bridal shower I am attending."
4.0,Runs large for me...
4.0,The four stars are because the zippers do not close easily.
4.0,Not black but gray
4.0,only for people with Slender faces. I bought them for my coworkers and the ones that had round chunkier faces it didn't fit. Fit me though.
4.0,"For the price point these are not bad glasses.  They are pretty gender neutral and I happen to really like this style.  The frames fit my face and nose nicely, they don't dig into my head or the bridge of my nose.  The shading of the lenses is very pleasant and a covers a good portion of my face.  These do come with a case, but in all honesty I never use cases.  I am the type of person who owns inexpensive sun glasses and tosses them all over.  This have joined the collection of the ones I like, pretty sure they are on my Jeep dash right now."
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful. Color and tailoring. I ordered xl though I usually wear large, thinking my US body would be much bigger than the comparable Chinese size.<br />I found that xl was too big. Momentarily flattering but now I'm facing sending it back for an exchange to large. Do I really have to send it back to China for an exchange? No offense meant, but I have personal experience with sending a package to a friend in China and it took forever for the recipient to get access to it."
4.0,I liked that is was soft
4.0,"This product was great for the price, the material does feel cheap but it is very cute nonetheless! It fit me pretty well although I am small chested (I am 5'5 and 130lbs) . I ended up putting in a request to return this item however, because it didn't really go too well with the boots I bought so that is my fault. The shipment time frame I was given was very vague, it said anywhere from June 20th to July 18th, but it was delivered quickly and ahead of schedule!<br />The underwear/shorts that came with it were extremely small and didn't fit me, I am in good shape and I couldn't get them to stay in place. Plan ahead to find bottoms to go with this if you are considering buying this outfit. These shorts might fit someone who can fit into a size 2 or 3 in jeans. Other than that, no complaints for the price!"
4.0,Nice dress. I like the lace top.
4.0,Asian fit XL fits a small 5'6&#34; American. And should weigh between 100-130 lbs. We had to return because of a hole in the material. They were quick to respond. Nice cotton material. Not thin.
4.0,I ordered size 7 but they fit more like a 7.5 or 8.  Otherwise boots were cute and I plan to order a smaller size.  The pattern was cute and they looked good.
4.0,"The nightgown arrived in a timely manner. The color is vibrant! The material is better than expected. I washed it in hot water and put it in the dryer hoping it would shrink a bit but it didn't. I am very happy with it and will order more, just in the next size down!"
4.0,Color is very nice
4.0,"If you follow their sizin guidelines, it should fit fine. Just be sure to check your measurements against the ones in the description. Good quality material."
4.0,"This tank is a nice shade of red with flowers. I'm a fan of baby doll tops and this one fits in the typical fashion of the style. The material is light weight and cool. The trim around the bottom will ensure that your top doesn't fray. It's a nice, comfy top for spring or summer."
4.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size up (medium, i usually wear a small) but the arm holes are really big. you can see my bra. Bit other than that it's pretty much looks like the product picture and is still cute."
4.0,"When looking at most cheap paper-bag style shorts on amazon, I always think they look super baggy, long, and huge- so I was a bit skeptical when I ordered these (XS). But they actually fit well! If anything, they might be a bit too short simply in comparison to their VERY high waist, but I like short-shorts so it's fine. The material is thick and nice.<br /><br />My only negative thing with them is that, as others have said, the waist tie is simply too short for these shorts to form a proper bow. Oh well, it's still possible, just might not look as nice as the seller's pictures!"
4.0,Absolutely loved this skirt. I used it for a dance event at my college and it made me feel like a cute little cupcake! I would order a size smaller though.
4.0,"I like this dress a lot and it’s great for work, the only thing is I don’t think it’s going to last long- the skirt is becoming faded and pilly and it’s only been 2 months."
4.0,"Super cute and good fabric, a bit big upper top."
4.0,"Just a little smaller than I’d like. Otherwise, I love it!!"
4.0,"I get a pair of Merrill flip-flops ever year. They seem to last long, good arch for your feet and  Great for boating so you don't slip."
4.0,They're really comfortable and look great! My only issue is that they're slightly narrow towards the front of the shoe and only the ankle strap is adjustable. No other issues though!
4.0,"Although somewhat large can fit warm sweater underneath. I love the extra cuff in the sleeves,but they are still not quite long enough. I really like the way the hood snugs around my head in winter wind!!"
4.0,Pretty and daughter loves.
4.0,"Right size, just too heavy. Returned."
4.0,It is working well right now but the real test is what does it look like a year from now.
4.0,"I'm 5'1, 110 pounds and it was just a little too big on me so I had it taken in a bit behind the neck and in the waist but then it fit like a glove! Love this dress, will definitely wear again! I wish it came in an Xs"
4.0,This was delivered very quickly. It is very pretty . I had hoped it would be a little smaller and more delicate looking so I decided to take a chance and order it.  It is exactly  as pictured.  I was a little disappointed  about that but am keeping it anyways.
4.0,"THERE WERE NO BACKS TO THE EARRINGS--THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL AND EYE CATCHING--,MANY COMPLIMENTS --DRESSES UP ANY OCCASSION"
4.0,"My husband likes these ties, I do not.  The style looks dated, something like what my dad (or his dad) would wear. Don't believe that they are machine washable for a moment. Every tie I've ever washed (which got into the washing machine by mistake) was ruined; they became crumpled and shrunken and have the appearance of crepe paper (and I buy expensive ties).  They do feel nice though, smooth and satiny, but who goes around stroking ties?  On second thought, they might look okay with a nice dark suit but alone with a dress shirt is a no-go for me."
4.0,Rubs big and a bit too long...
4.0,Standard bra. Fits as expected. Nice that they have extended size options. Pretty comfortable. A good t-shirt bra.
4.0,Bought for a wrestling fan. Loved it! But it is just a novelty item. Arrived very quickly.
4.0,"My daighter looked beautiful this Christmas in the outfit pair with some cute little red shoes I also purchased off Amazon. Only reason I gave 4 stars was because it came a bit big for a size 2T & I was have to readjust her consistently. I'd buy it again though, no doubt, but I'd know to get 1 size smaller than she is in at that moment!! SUPER CUTE 😍😍😍"
4.0,Received so many complements wearing the red.
4.0,"I love these boots. Once you get them on they fit great, but getting them on is the problem. I had the hardest time getting my foot into the top of the boot is very hard."
4.0,I don't think it worths the price.
4.0,"Automatic Swiss watches require body movement and winding. They are fancy, beautiful pieces of art/jewelry and I love them.<br /><br />This watch however is super light on the wrist and has a perpetual calendar/atomic clock sync. The solar charging function means you don’t have to worry about changing a battery and the atomic sync means you don’t have to worry about changing the date, correct in the date, or correcting the time periodically or monthly.  Being radio controlled means the accuracy of the watch is reliable for perpetuity.<br /><br />I bought this watch and loved it. I tried it on and was very very happy. When I tested the alarm, I realized that after being up a long time and out in the woods, the alarm would probably not wake me. It is not loud. In addition to being low volume, it ceases sounding after 10 seconds. If you try to rely on this to wake up in the morning, it might not work for you.  I believe the battery would require much more energy to make a decent alarm and because of this you might not find a very good alarm function on a solar powered watch anywhere.<br /><br />If you’re not that concerned about the alarm, the rest of the watch is absolutely wonderful and I recommend."
4.0,I normally wear 34 -36 D and with this bra I would need a DD or maybe the size after that. I cnt even wear it cuz the cups are too small. It's a nice bra though!
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my nephew and he's wild about it. It fits well and the dinosaur parts are stiff enough to stand up. It's lighter weight than I was expecting but still well made.
4.0,"Fits well, great quality, washes well! My daughter loves it!"
4.0,"It is not the brilliant snow white it shows, it more like a muted cream. But I guess it is fine."
4.0,"Got this dress in multiple colors, the main white one with the green leaves was too big but the one that was mainly blue with green and white accents fit perfectly. Not sure how that happens but I still like them both!"
4.0,"I bought a size small. I'm 5'4 and 130lbs, 39&#34; hips, 27&#34; waist, 38&#34; bust. I unfortunately do not think this dress works as well for bustier women as the waist of the dress ends up pulled to just below my bra, emphasizing my chest in an not-so-flattering way. Reminiscent of maternity wear.<br />I'm sure this would be much more adorable on a different body type!"
4.0,Had these sent to my brother for Christmas.  No complaints as of yet.  Fun gift idea for your friendly neighborhood metalhead or gothling.
4.0,"Slightly shorter than anticipated, but good fit"
4.0,"The Vest is very durable, fit great..."
4.0,"Very smal lenses and I there's nothing on the packaging that says blue light protection.  Although, the lenses are crystal clear and they're very comfortable.  They do Not have blue light protection"
4.0,I’m 5’ tall and 110lbs  and got the small with the intent to wear a camisole underneath. Worked well. Really thin light material but that’s ok with me. Not disappointed.
4.0,"My first Timex watch band had been purchased back when I purchased the Timex watch back in 1986. It had busted apart back in 2012. I had bought two cheap generic leather bands, the 1st of which busted within a year and the 2nd busted the day I ordered the 16-20MM TIMEX ADJUSTABLE SILVER AND GOLD TONE DEPLOYMENT BUCKLE STAINLESS STEEL BAND. It is much easier to put on and take off than a leather wrist band that is buckled to wear. It was easy to adjust to fit snuggly upon my left-handed wrist and has been warn each and everyday since. My first watch band was very similar to this one! Thank you!"
4.0,Because the neck of the boot is so long it's kind of hard to put on and unless you buy two sizes up don't try to put it on with socks. It will probably be a little easier if there was a zipper on the back or the side. I wear size 11 my toes aren't squished but it's definitely a little snug in the front but I'm sure that'll loosen up in time but other than that I love love love them I got the tan pair the black pair and these cute grey ones! happy boot shopping!
4.0,Very nice for the price. I am picky about animal prints and this is a decent one.<br />Super cute on.
4.0,Is what very cute but the chain on the back broke the first day I wore it. Very delicate and cute but not worth the price.
4.0,This would have received five stars if item fit. I ordered XXL which is my size but it looks like it wouldn't fit a large rather than a plus-size gal. If you wear anything larger than a 16 do not purchase. Material is very nice and soft and item is made very well just wish it fit.
4.0,Few beads loose..but for the price I can fix and still like the jewewlry !!!  I can seal the rest. Actually very pretty:)
4.0,So pretty! 😍😍 My daughter was a vision of perfection in her &#34; wave dress&#34; as she calls it
4.0,Overall good quality for a halloween costume!
4.0,1/2 size too small but they are cute.
4.0,It was a gift to my son and he loves it.
4.0,"This is an ok dress.<br />I ordered red and it is more of the tomato red color.<br />Very bright and rich color that creates a lot of mood.<br />I would have given this dress a 5 star rating, but the skirt of my dress was slightly longer on the left side.<br />It does wrinkle.<br /><br />I am 5'5'' 144 lb, 36DD/E. My measurements are 39.8 (101cm)/ 34 (87cm)/ 39.8 (101cm)<br />I ordered Small, it was a little loose on me and felt more like an M.<br /><br />For the price, I decided to keep the dress.<br />It is a very comfy material and is perfect for me to wear at the house.<br />And it has a nice access for the breastfeeding too :)"
4.0,Very long but the waist fit perfectly. Worth the buy will get in another color. May have them tailored.
4.0,"great hat, love the color and clamp, BUT. the words aren't exactly aligned with the middle. its not noticeable at a glance, but its clear after inspection... pretty cool though"
4.0,Really loved this bracelet but after a week one of the center pieces fell off and three weeks after that the chain broke!
4.0,The coat runs extremely small. The style is amazing I wished It had worked  out.  I normally wear an Xl but based on the reviews I ordered  the XXL. Unfortunately  I had to  return  it.
4.0,"I bought these in a medium. Wish they were sold separately because the top was on the looser side. Still not bad for fit and comfort. The mediums were still snug fitting, but moveable if that makes sense. I would like to order more of this set in other colors. The olive green is beautiful however!"
4.0,So soft and very cute! Worth it!
4.0,Definitely gives boots that deep conditioning that it needs.
4.0,Overall a good watch for the price. The light is a little weak.
4.0,"Perfect in ALMOST every way! The one problem is that after consistently wearing it, the chain will start to break. Very sad😭"
4.0,"I bought this for a night out on our vacation in Mexico. I got more compliments on it than I ever expected. One downfall is the area at the top where your arms go is a bit large, and it gaped at the top. I just took two safety pins and bunched up the top a bit and pinned it to the neck part. It is a bit see through, but it is SO CUTE and airy. Definitely going to order more colors."
4.0,"Thick, really cute. Love the print. By the end of a 12 hour shift starts to fall down but stays put much better than other brands I have. Like that they are more like socks than hose."
4.0,"Super soft and comfy! Literally purchased to wear to bed. 4’11”, 95lbs - normally wear an XS petite. Wanted a baggy fit, so I ordered a small and medium - honestly could have gone with a large, but they didn’t have large in the color I wanted. The arms run long, but the bottom band sinches a bit. Again, my goal was to have a loose night sweatshirt, so I returned the small, and ordered another medium so I could have two. It comes with a dumb label on the pocket, but it’s pretty easy to remove. Just cut the white stitches keeping the patch on, and the rest peels off. I also cut out the string because I sort of hate the strings in hoodies for some reason. Now it’s just a plain, solid black, cozy hoodie - perfect."
4.0,"My legs cramp less at the end of a shift, less swelling. Very helpful!"
4.0,There is no lace in the back which is a little odd. But overall it is very nice and not see through.
4.0,"I wear a size 10/12 and wanted to have this color right away so I ordered the medium. It fits extremely well; however, to obtained the desired fit/oversized look, I should have waited and purchased the size large. I plan to wear the yellow as a tee shirt or with a pair of leggings or shorts because it fits like a glove."
4.0,"These were the cheapest pair that I could find. Surprisingly, they are fairly thick and very comfy. I wear them very often and bought another pair for my pregnant wife"
4.0,"need super human strength to get them on, once on they worked"
4.0,"comfortable, true to size"
4.0,Doesn't truly fit oversized sunglasses but good for mid sized ones.
4.0,I would have given this 5 stars but I had to go and find a way to make it tighter around my neck because it was so loose. They need to make it a tighter fit.
4.0,"My measurements fell into the large option so that is what I ordered. It fits 87% perfectly...if I was only 5'4"" then it would fit 100% perfectly. As it is I am 5'10"", so the flare outs to accommodate the hips are about 5 inches to high up. I know my way around a sewing machine so this is easily fixed and once it is this dress will be perfect. If you are tall and do not possess this particular skill I would be wary that the dress may not fit quite like you want it to."
4.0,Granddaughter loves this hoodie. Just wishes the ears stood up as shown in the picture.
4.0,I love these rings. They look just like the picture. They bend and easily fit. Very comfortable around my toes. Only thing is that they don't really fit my big toe like the picture. The pictures on the product image is being heavily photoshopped.
4.0,Nice item but not quite what I was looking for so returned it
4.0,"Not as much memory foam as I would like in them, but they are comfy.  The rubber sole is great for indoor/outdoor use"
4.0,"Subtle design, comfortable fabric, infinity scarf for Hanukkah. Will see how it holds up with hand-washing. Like having holiday themed clothing."
4.0,It’s a really pretty color and helps hid my big gut.
4.0,I’m 5’9 so this shirt is slightly short. It wrinkles easy from ironed out well. Thick material and well made
4.0,"I bought this ring on a whim to wear esp. with some other black accessories (watches, pens) so that these other items are complemented. The ring is perfectly suited for this task. My only reservation is that my wife thinks it is somehow inappropriate to wear instead of my more conventional wedding ring. I kind of see her point; hard to explain. In any case it is everything it advertises to be, and is simply a solidly constructed and scratch resistant so far as I can see. Good buy at the @40 dollar price point."
4.0,Looks and feels very nice.<br />Unfortunately I had to send it back because the chest area was very tight; I'm a 36DD. Should fit perfectly for women below that size.
4.0,"Although the fit was snug ,I liked the sweater a lot so so I decided to keep"
4.0,very nice I get many compliments
4.0,I had been suffering from plantars fascitis for over a year. Walking long distance was very painful. But adding these to my shoes and being careful not to go barefoot around the house have significantly reduced my day to day pain.
4.0,"Nice looking pants.  Run small in the waist size, about one size smaller.  I use 32 waist on most pants, but this one was too tight.  Legs are a little wide.  Overall, I like the pants, but will return."
4.0,Love it keeps me cool under this hot nasty weather.
4.0,"Love this dress!!<br />Perfect length, very comfortable looks more expensive than it is.<br /><br />I bought 2 sizes up an XL. Fits fine. I think a large might have been too snug as I wear a medium. Wore it with a slip underneath."
4.0,"Good quality with the rubber pads and leather edges. Last a long time, unlike the cotton pads that wear out and get dirty."
4.0,"I was worried that the quality of this was going to be horrible, but I bought it for my son and he didn’t care as long as it was Among Us. He’s 4’7” and husky at around 105 lbs. I was pleasantly surprised, though. It washed well and wasn’t terrible quality overall.  At the end of the day, my son loves it and that’s all that matters."
4.0,"If you are a med but really close to large ...you should get small....My weight is 159 and I am 5 &#34;3&#34;, Other then my boob, its to small"
4.0,These are pretty but bigger and heavier than expected. Not for everyday wear for me.
4.0,"I like it a lot, nice and warm. The Vinyl looks of good quality too!"
4.0,"Nice product to hold your AirPods in. Genuine leather on the outside and a plastic insert of some sort in on the inside. Has a loop on the outside to hang out maybe to a book bag or keychain. There’s a cut out hole on the bottom for your charging port. Overall it’s nice but the one problem I had was getting the AirPods out of the case, its a little hard because you think you’re gonna break your AirPod lid.<br />NOTE : To get AirPods out open lid fully and it makes the AirPods case lift up inside of the leather and you can pull it out easier."
4.0,Arrived quickly and was very easy to replace.  Had a nice kit to change the band and has a nice feel to it.
4.0,I was afraid dress would be thin and poorly made.  This dress is well made with inner lining. Beautiful ❤️
4.0,"Good looking keychain, but the sword slides out of the sheath easily."
4.0,"Love it! My favorite jacket to wear. It keeps me nice an warm, fits well and it looks great!"
4.0,It's  a good product but too small for me...credit cards  slots are too small...
4.0,"I bought two pairs of these, one in black and one in a pattern. They're both very soft and comfortable -- probably the nicest feel of any of the millions of joggers I've tried. I bought my normal size, and the black pair fits about how I would have expected, although they're a little roomy through the thighs and a little shorter than I'd like (both very abnormal for me). The patterned pair feels about a size too big, but I actually ended up preferring them. They're my go-to for lounging around the house or running errands."
4.0,I love the fit and very cute.  But it has a bad smell.
4.0,Better quality than I thought! Looks like the images shown.  Packaged well and arrived on time. Just smaller than expected.
4.0,Not sure if it’s because I’m a body builder and it was small in my shoulders and back or it’s just made a little small there. Everywhere else fit  perfect.<br />Company hid my comment
4.0,Cloth used : good<br />Cutting : good<br />Craftsmanship : good
4.0,"boyfriend loves em! very cute but he says they get caught on things easily, had them for a couple months now and they’re holding up well, seem pretty good quality, pick your poison i guess"
4.0,But I was also no upset with quality for the price either.
4.0,Good useful purchase. Will be even better when cool weather warrants long sleeves.
4.0,A pretty dress but didn't like the way it looked on me.
4.0,"the dress itself is quality fabric and print, my only issues are nitpicks on fit.<br />i’m 5”11, 36DDD, usually size 10-12, and i bought a large. it’s the tiniest bit snug on my torso but it has a bit of awkward extra fabric that hangs out at the neck and in the skirt (maybe the skirt would be fixed if i bought the underskirt)<br />the price is fair so i’m keeping the product despite its imperfections, but i suggest you do your research before buying."
4.0,"Size runs a little smaller, but that's just because I don't like mine to fit as tight"
4.0,"Only reason for 4 stars is because I thought I was buying a grey watch band but it’s more of a tope tan color. Other than that it’s great, and I ended up liking the color more than the color I initially wanted, but it’s the principle of the thing."
4.0,I like the necklace I ordered.the only problem was is the image on the inside was mounted wrong so there's a small white line on the top besides that it's very nice
4.0,"the dress is beautiful. I normally wear btwn a 18-20. Im a 40D. I got the 2x. I will have to tailer the top area.  5'2, dress fits at my knee."
4.0,"I like the style and the sequin pocket is beautiful. It is pretty true to size, but I wish the material were a little softer. Overall, a good purchase!"
4.0,Not bad for a cheap pair of nice-looking earrings
4.0,"The shoulders are a bit over-padded in my opinion. Otherwise, nice jacket."
4.0,"It is so nice and warm, only has a strong smell as technical oil . I wach but still smell."
4.0,"Nice, but material slides a lot"
4.0,Love it.  Already wore it to pool party!
4.0,"This is my first purchase of this style so I have nothing to compare it to, however, I know what my expectations were and it mostly met them. The material is soft and stretchy enough to sit over my nose without sagging or restriction. But the material does not hold a stretch. I’d love to be able to stretch the neck area out to fit more loosely but it won’t. Other reviewers have complained that the edges are raw, and that’s true, but they are clean edges. A finished edge would bulk the material up and make it uncomfortable. I’m satisfied."
4.0,"I love the feel of this robe, it's so very comfortable! My only downside is that it didn't come with the belt. Otherwise I love it!"
4.0,"Great, just what I needed. Relived the heel pain"
4.0,for round one of a bikini competition for mardi gras... a little big but comfortable
4.0,"This is the only item I can wear, because one size fits all. I am a size 16 and most of my clothes from Amazon fit like a size 12. Anyway, love this product."
4.0,"Perfect to wear on plane ride during these trying times.  Felt safer than with just a mask.  Only issue.....plane was chilly, breathing area warm so got fogged up.  But I wore for protection so worked well for that.  Fast delivery.  Few people stopped me and asked where I got it.  O"
4.0,"The boots are very nice, but they run a bit small. But they have an extra sole for the heel in case the original ones fall. Nice detail."
4.0,I bought this for a friend and she loved it. It's exactly as pictured and is really cute.
4.0,It's kinda bigger then expected
4.0,Ordered for a Mr & Mrs Smith costume but Halloween party got canceled so I returned it. I tried it on & it fit ok
4.0,"Beautiful nose ring. 4 stars because it’s a little difficult to put in. But once I maneuvered it right, I had no problems. Snug fit, hugs the nostril. Which I like."
4.0,"I love this! Fits great, comfy fabric, and thicker than I thought it was going to be. I went with my regular size with is XL and it still fits oversized. You definitely don't need to size up at all unless you're wanting it extremely loose. I do wish it was a bit longer in length, because when you left your arms it raises up a bit. Not a big deal though!"
4.0,This terry cloth turban is just as pictured.  Good quality and fits my needs very well.
4.0,"I have had the RST tractech evo pants, jacket, and boots for about a year and with zero problems, so it just made sense to get the matching gloves, as well. My only fear living in the United States is that the sizing might be off and I would have to return them. That was not the case, though, as the sizing was spot-on for my size 11 hands. Shipping speed was amazing, too, as I received them in 3 or 4 days.<br />As for the actual review, on both gloves, the pinky finger is sewn to the ring finger (for safety during a fall), though there is still plenty of mobility there. This does not affect the use of the gloves, though, nor the lever feel. The only complaint I have with gloves is that there is a plastic slider on the palms (near the edge of the palms away from the thumbs), which would be great in a fall, but which does affect the feel of the grip and slightly restricts my fingers when reaching for the levers. I'm hoping the gloves fingertips will stretch some over time after perspiration and further use. That brings me to another small point: the gloves have little to no ventilation, so I expect them to be pretty warm in the summer time heat.<br />I'll leave this review on a good note: the build quality and degree of protection offered on the gloves is impressive, actually a tad overkill, like my other RST gear...and well worth the money, IMO. I would definitely purchase them again."
4.0,runs small.oder a size up. but otherwise these are adorable shoes.
4.0,Not as big  as I expected and wanted  but nice glasses. Not &#34;oversized &#34;  at all.
4.0,"This necklace is lovely, but cheaply made. I have no problem with this given the great price! It isn't as dainty as I thought it would be, but I actually like that it is more solid looking. The gold and silver is also just wonderful! I will likely buy a few more of these as gifts. :)"
4.0,Love this fast shipping thank you
4.0,"I really wanted to keep this dress, but it was too small for me in the bust. I ordered a Large, the biggest size they had, and it fit great everywhere but the bust. I'm a 36DD. Super cute though. If an XL comes out, I might buy it."
4.0,"I purchased these purely for UV protection while boating. They do that well. I ordered them to my proper size and they fit really tight. I wish I had ordered a size up for comfort. I like them, but they are definitely smaller than sized."
4.0,Was cute and fit well but just wasn’t it. Ordered a M.
4.0,"I wish these were a little deeper in the net so when I caught a miller, I could turn it and capture it in the fold. I can sometimes, but there is only about 1 to 2 inches to trap against the rim and bottom of net."
4.0,bought it for a size 10 but it is very baggy.  She will be able to wear it for a couple of years maybe
4.0,"I bought this ring because over the years I have put on weight and can't wear my real wedding ring. I don't want to resize my ring so this was the perfect option! I like that this is a lifetime product. I like the price point. The fit is good. I wish it was offered in more colors. It does tend to catch on certain surfaces like fabric, but it is still a great option for those that want to show their commitment."
4.0,"The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is that we found the sleeves to be disproportionately long to the body. But it's the cutest top, washed very nicely, and is comfy. What more can one want in a toddler top? I love this top."
4.0,"love the dainty ness of it , just needs to fit the ear lobe better"
4.0,"I'm not really into wearing bracelets, but thought I'd give this one a try. I do like the magnetic clasp. It's different, and easily put on, or taken off. It's sturdy, but my first impression was that it looked cheap. It's well packaged for gifting, and if you're into bracelets, this one is another addition to your collection."
4.0,"Very nice sweater, could be longer."
4.0,"I'm usually a size medium but I ordered a large. It's huge! It kind of looks like a hybrid of an oversized sweater and a tunic. If I ordered it again I'd get a regular medium (and even then it might be too big, lol) but what can I say? I'm lazy and this is a cute &#34;swunic.&#34; I put a belt around my waist right where the white stripes start and it looks much better that way. The sleeves are quite long but I like my clothes to fit loose so I don't really mind. It seems like a good quality knit fabric. When I'm lounging around the house I'll wear it loose with leggings, and if I want to wear it out I'll just add the belt."
4.0,I believe I purchased a small in this for my daughter. I wear it now because it’s very long on her. I’m 5’1 and normally wear a l-XL. Would absolutely buy it again though
4.0,Nice ring. Well crafted
4.0,"Good quality but I’m 5’2’’, 127 pounds, 34B and wear usually small, but this dress was really too small. Overalls, just take one size up. The dress was expected."
4.0,Very nice. Works as described.
4.0,"Got a few other COOFANDY sweaters, and this is the only one that's just so slightly big in the waist. The others are more European slim. I really like COOFANDY's offerings though, lots of different styles at good value. I'm going for that Irish pub bit, and they have a whole wardrobe for that look."
4.0,The suit is funny but it would be better if the whole suit had lights. The front of the jacket is the only part of the suit that lights up.
4.0,"I got these as a potential GymShark dupe. While I still love my GymShark leggings more, these are pretty comparable for 1/3 of the price. Definitely recommend for good workout gear on a budget!"
4.0,"Very cute, but they didn't fit, too small."
4.0,I loved the color and was impressed by the quality. My only wish is that it were slightly longer in the torso- being big busted means that things with fitted waists ride up a little more than I would like but that's a very common issue.
4.0,IT was broken when I unwrapped the package it was all placed in one bag where it was balled up
4.0,"These earrings I like a lot,the price was excellent,when I received them was extremely small,they arrived ontime,I'm giving them away as a gify"
4.0,Used for a party. Very bright and fun to dance with.  We like to mix up the party favors from time-to-time.  I
4.0,"Love the look and feel. The quality isn't what you'd get for a $100+ mesh bracelet, but it's definitely good. The clasp leaves a bit to be desired (hence the one start reduction). It feels cheap, especially compared to the heftiness of the rest of the bracelet. Because there are no removable links, a few more micro adjustments on the clasp would have been ideal. Fortunately, I was able to use a Dremel to cut it to fit my wrist (if you do this, cut from where it attaches to the clasp, now where it connects to the watch). I put this on my Seiko SKX007 with plongeur hands mod and it looks fantastic."
4.0,"I like the Shirt; however, It RUNS SMALL and I couldn't return it due to the cost of sending it back. It would have cost me more to send it back then I actually purchasing price which is really a disappointment. I tried to contact the seller and to no AVAIL so as far as doing another purchase with this company, it will NOT happen AGAIN!!!. I feel I just wasted money. Although I do like the style of the shirt, the material is very thin, and a few buttons fall off with trying on the shirt. Overall, I like the shirt but I don't like the return policy."
4.0,Comfy top and great for casual wear.
4.0,Perfect i love them. 4 stars because i am not sure how sturdy they are. I am worried that they will become unwoven or whatever the term is. As i continue to wear them i see the edges are beginning to fray. Really cool looking and comfortable though.
4.0,"My melons were screaming if you heavy on the top be mindful , they don’t fall out but they do squish ya girls I ordered a large .. the bottoms are great slightly high waisted but overall a good bathing suit"
4.0,Pants are real cute shirts a little small
4.0,"Great little Ash Ketchum costume! Black pants and a white shirt completed this perfectly.<br />The only thing we had to adjust was the finger length of the gloves. They weren't seamed, so 10 little snips with the scissors fixed the problem easily. Hat was sturdy, shirt a little snug but was fine as it doesnt button down all the way. Perfect for halloween!"
4.0,Stays up but too tight on me to talk without it going into mouth... Needs to be looser.
4.0,"This dress is so cute on!  I am 5’5” and this dress runs long. However, I love the flattering look of it.  It tapers near the hemline giving a nice silhouette to a plain looking dress.  I added a cute necklace and chic earrings and received many compliments.  Don’t sleep on this one."
4.0,"Item as described, cute socks, semi soft, semi durable."
4.0,"This is a very good, basic watch for telling time and date. The body is light weight and easy to set up.  I would have given it a ten rating but the display is a little small.  For the money it is a great buy."
4.0,dries quickly and light weight fabric
4.0,Could have used a few more butterflys for strength.
4.0,The pants are a little shorter than expected and otherwise are perfect.  Very comfortable!!
4.0,Nice and pretty as the picture - fine quality. But a bit short and yet wide. My daughter finds it distracting when swimming
4.0,"Haven't got mine in,but looks pretty legit to me"
4.0,"Color,quality of fur and stitching"
4.0,Quick and easy to installed to watch
4.0,It is very nice!!! It looks really good !! I am happy with my purchase!!  But it took forever to get it.
4.0,"Well made bag. High quality canvas. Seems like it should last a long time. Love the print, size, and the shape. My only wish is that it had another pocket or two. That being said, I'd buy another one without hesitation."
4.0,"The elastic in the waste band isn't tacked down, otherwise Good"
4.0,"Looked great for my event, velvet is very forgiving to my body shape. However! When I came home to shower, I had black stains everywhere the dress touched. Probably should've washed it before wearing, but I ran out of time. Had a thorough exfoliation to clear my skin of the ink."
4.0,"Love this!! It comes from China so I was a little skeptical being a big woman. But they asked for my measurements and made it fit like a glove. The neck line is not as shown, it's a high neck line, but the dress still fits wonderfully and flows like a dream. I will absolutely buy from them again. Just give yourself 2 months to get the dress."
4.0,Quick shipping and she loves it
4.0,"I bought an extra large after reading the reviews, I would usually wear small/medium it fits ok except that the button on the arm doesn't button can't reach to button it's a bit small in that area."
4.0,Just like what's pictured! The only reason I dropped to 4 stars is one or two tapes are peeling. :(
4.0,"I bought this to use as a swimsuit cover up, and it works perfectly. I'm 65, so a good cover up is required!  I typically wear a size 12 in clothes, but I ordered an XL so that it would be roomy, and would not cling to my suit. I did wash it before I wore it because it did have a bit of an odor (not horrible like others have said, but it did have an odor) I lined dry to prevent shrinkage, and it turned out great! The fabric is soft, and not super clingy. The pockets, are a good and bad thing. They are nice to have, but they do hit right on the hips. Personally, I see this as a very causal dress. One that I would only wear to the beach or backyard BBQ, but that's just my opinion."
4.0,I really like the coverage and the true brief fit.  My only complaint is that the leg opening could have been a little tighter so it wouldn't ride up or gape open.
4.0,Wife didn't think it was funny lol
4.0,Its cute but it shows its over the shoulder and not the collar is way higher. I like the style though. I love that the pants are really long.
4.0,Fit as expected size 8 for 9 yr old boy
4.0,"The leotard material is nice and thick, high quality for a great price. The sizing is a bit odd. It fits perfect everywhere but the leg holes. The leg holes seem stretched and create gaps. We just wear underwear under the leotard to fix keep things covered"
4.0,Love this dress!!!<br />Wore to a funeral was perfected. I'm busty the size was great. I think i will order again in a different color.
4.0,"I really like this sweatshirt.  It seems to be made well and is the right weight.  Unfortunately, it was too small.  I guess I should have listened to the other reviews and ordered the next size.  I'm returning it but ordering the bigger size."
4.0,LOVE it kinda on the small side but great quality shirt
4.0,"I love the fit and ""feel"" of this garment!"
4.0,"Received my dress quickly...<br />It doesn't look like the one the model is wearing, looks similar and it does not fall off your shoulders however the fabric is thick and soft not cheap looking... The price is awesome & I usually wear it at home since it's a comfy dress!"
4.0,"The pendant came quickly and was in excellent condition.  The only complaint I have is that it's a bit smaller than I imagined it to be, but still glad with the purchase."
4.0,Was nice and for a good price
4.0,"This Is a BEA-U-TI-FUL TOP!! The Silver and Black design is Perfect! Its a whole vibe by itself!  The Picture Does this Top no justice!<br />HOWEVER, it Runs Very Small and has No Give whatsoever.<br />I usually wear a medium top. But I purchased a Large based on the reviews.<br />I can barely put it on.<br /><br />Im 5'4"" 180 pounds 38 DD Chest.<br />(I attached a picture of myself so you can see my frame and make a better judgment for yourself as to what size you may need to purchase)<br />***the top I'm wearing in this picture isn't the top I'm reviewing***"
4.0,"Arrived quickly. Item as described. Easy to put on and off. One of them broke off where stem meets the head, otherwise nice earrings."
4.0,"Bought this for my grandson, it came right on time. I was excited to give it to him, but he didn't like the hair, it was to itchy for him. I thought it was fantastic, but he's the one who has to wear it."
4.0,"Socks remains put but top portion of socks can still be shown, as noted."
4.0,"was so sure the largest size XXL was going to be too small for my 46"" bust - was pleasantly surprised that it just fit.  the cute flutter-sleeves make alot of difference in the fit - no pulling at the back and shoulders when I move my arms.  seems to be made well, could find no flaws.  the lace is really pretty and does have stretch, but the trim all the way around does not.  love this deep, rich red color with white tank and black pants."
4.0,These dresses are so easy to wear and I get a lot of compliments on the fit!
4.0,Looks a little thin.  Might not be rugged e nough?  But length is perfect.  Color is good.
4.0,"For reference, I am 140 pounds and 5’1. I have 2 children, so I have a pouch to hide my cookies if ya know what I mean. I am typically between a large and a medium, but I went with a large in hopes that I would not look like a busted can of biscuits. This was a good choice. I carry most of my weight in my stomach. Overall, the bathing suit fits pretty good. I am a little nervous about the top because the included pads were in some weird places, but they are able to be adjusted to fit better. It does seem to come a little low on the side without a strap, but I am blessed in the chest as a 36 DD so that could be it. The bottoms are nice and high rise with good coverage on the back. I moved the tie on the bottoms to the side in hopes to not accent my belly area. The pattern is adorable though! Posting a bathing suit picture is a bit intimidating at my age, so I hope this review helps!"
4.0,I really love the quality.
4.0,I really like the fit and its super soft and comfortable!!! I don’t like the lines on the thighs but its fine! Has pockets which is nice.<br />Fit perfect
4.0,"usually I wear XL , this is L  and fits me good, so this dress is big. But Absolutely beautifull"
4.0,Love the fact that they have great sizes. The only thing that i would recommend is that when you wash them take the straps off as they tend to fall off and or become unconnected.
4.0,"The pendent is awesome, the chain itself sucks though"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3a5343d3fe2de321363079e21f81a883]] Well I guess I'm not a chiffon person.  I don't like the feel of the blouse. In the video, I try to show you how it feels by the way it sounds when you rub it. I like the pretty white trim though. Size large fits  great. I'm 5'9"" 170 lbs and wear size 12."
4.0,I wanted more of the larger ones.
4.0,"For the most part, it fits like it should, but it is tight around the shoulders. Decent value for the money. Fabric is light which is great for spring/summer. Glad I didn't order a large size though, or it would have been too big around the waist."
4.0,My husband LOVES this shirt!  He wears it all the time!  Comfortable and makes him proud!
4.0,"I have glasses from voogue me and zenni, they don't fit well in these cases, but some of my other glasses do fit in.  the case is VERY soft and sturdy"
4.0,"For reference, I am 5'7"" 165 lbs 34d, typically medium shirt and size 10 bottom. I got the medium.  It fits fine but is tighter around the elastic part of the waist. Not so much that its leaving marks, but tight enough to be uncomfortable and I felt like I kept readjusting it. If I were to buy again, I would size up for a little bit of a looser fit with the elastic waist."
4.0,Gave it to my son for Christmas.  So far he really has enjoyed it.  Seems to be a lot of bells and whistles on it that we haven't really explored yet.
4.0,"I used these as gift bags for my daughters first birthday, and tie dyed them.  The canvas part is great: sturdy and looks good- the straps however are super cheap plasticky material- a different shade and didn't even hold the paint (can be seen in pic behind the fan)"
4.0,"This shirt is cute and my daughter loves it. It washes well, and fits as expected. I haven't noticed any shrinking or color fading after several washes. It did take a little longer than we would have liked to arrive, but once it came my daughter was happy."
4.0,"The glass looks pretty nice but the gold tone metal is less than I expected.  I bought this for a gift, so hoping it will hold up to being worn. It feels quite delicate.  It is hard to judge from a picture on the internet, but after seeing it in person, I chose to go ahead and give it as a gift as I had originally intended."
4.0,Beautiful piece... however necklace turned dark after one night at a wedding. The pendant and earrings were still good for a few more wears.
4.0,Loved the style and pattern but the size fit more like a XS then a small so I had to return it for a medium. Hoping it fits well when it arrives tomorrow!
4.0,Bought it for my wife and it fitted as expected.<br />Material is nice and soft.<br />Recommend getting a size as close as possible. Don't go bigger.
4.0,In my opinion the clarity is more important than the color.  I ordered two pairs and had to send one pair back because it was too heavily included to show any sparkle.  I think the pair I kept is worth the money I paid for them.
4.0,The color was a little closer to red than the cranberry color pictured. I ordered a large based on the size chart however a medium would have fit just fine.
4.0,"Very cute bag! It’s a good size and good quality for the price. However, upon arrival it smelt HORRIBLE!!!! Major chemical smell. It’s aired out a bit and isn’t as strong now (I’ve had it for about a week) but the smell still kind of lingers. Hoping it goes away completely eventually."
4.0,"Very light weight which what I was looking for. They were comfortable to wear, but just a little longer then I'm used to. Good buy for the money"
4.0,I ordered these because we were going on a flight and wanted to be comfortable. Spirit changes their rules and these were not allowed as mask but they are overall comfortable and breathable. Took awhile a star because I can blow out a candle with them.
4.0,As cute as I thought it would be! Bow shown just came as a strip of fabric but that's what I expected after reading the reviews. I just tied it around her waist as a little belt.
4.0,"It's slightly different than the picture. Fits light an American Apparel strappy dress.  Less of a flared bottom, as shown in picture"
4.0,"I like this hat as it covers my scalp and face as expected.  I was disappointed as the interior colors were not as presented.  In the picture, the interior is red, blue and greenish.  My hat was pink with jewel tones.  It is not my monitor display, as the hat I received matches the interior of their blue hat. I would have preferred the hat in the photo."
4.0,"I'll admit it...I'm a gadget freak.  I love gadgets, cables, chargers, etc...and I like taking them with me on the go.  I commute via train in Chicago and every day I've got 2 phones, 1 tablet a laptop and all of their assorted accessories with me in my messenger bag.  In the past, I would have all of the cables bundled with velcro ties and just tossed in my bag along with wall chargers, external battery packs and such.  The Grid-It hasn't been a game-changer, but it does help keep me sort of organized.  Here's the rundown:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-if used correctly, does help keep me from losing small items like flash drives in the depths of my bag<br />-the rubberized elastic bands seem to be holding up well.  They stretch enough to get larger items squeezed under but snap back into their original shape when emptied.<br />-I haven't really ever used the zippered pocket on the back or the loop for hanging it, but they both seem pretty durable<br />-the internal &#34;backing board&#34; is pretty durable and it seems like it will hold up well in the long run.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-the configuration of the weave of straps seems pretty random.  It makes finding the &#34;perfect spot&#34; for things somewhat difficult.  Not really a deal-killer, but it offends my obsessive-compulsive side a tiny bit.  For instance, I would like all of my cables to be in the same area and more or less aligned, but due to the placement of the &#34;small&#34; loops, it's not really possible.<br />-Due to the somewhat random configuration, in those instances where I take almost everything out, it's difficult to get everything back where it was without having taken a photo of it fully loaded (ok, maybe that's just me, but I still think it's a valid concern).<br /><br />I get that the random setup could help in some cases, but for me, a more ordered system might work better.  Sill, it warrants 4 stars based on it's well-executed construction."
4.0,"Undecided. Fits well. Flattering. Not sure about how well it will hold up....Also, maybe a bit to sexy/revealing for a family vacation? Would wear it on a tropical island....not so much at the local pool."
4.0,My daughter was happy when this umbrella arrived. She used it already the first time it rained. It comes with a little bag but it's a bit hard to put back in once it's opened. One of the metal connectors came apart the first time it was used but I was able to put it back in. Cute umbrella for the price and quick shipping.
4.0,Very delicate and adorable. A bit too lightweight for my taste.  Still enjoy it.
4.0,Got these for my mother in law and she loved them. I wish they gave the option to get an entire set in one color.
4.0,"VERY cute dress. Looks exactly like the picture, definitely size down though"
4.0,"Love the bracelets & for the price I paid makes me love them that much more. Dressy or casual, it doesn't matter with these bracelets....."
4.0,"This casual dress is very soft & stretchy - it can accommodate varying bust/hip sizes. I ordered the XL: I'm 5'10"" and around 150lbs. I could have ordered a size down and gotten the Large, but it's ok because I'm never sure about foreign made clothing. I'd rather have it be a little loose than too tight! I like the army green color, and asymmetrical ruching on the hip is very unique. The button details are nice, but like some others have mentioned I could have done without them. (However, it is cute, even if it makes the dress look like pajamas.) The only flaw I could find is the material is very thin - it may not be very durable. Overall it's a decent casual dress, although I do believe you can find better elsewhere for the price. I give it 4 out of 5 stars"
4.0,Muy largo pero bonito
4.0,"It fits tighter kind of tight, hoping to stretch it out. Your be great for kids or teenagers, but for a woman's head it is snug."
4.0,"Smaller thank I Thought. In the picture it looks like a shall, but it was more like a scarf. But a very cute scarf :P"
4.0,These are really cute on my feet. However there is little arch support and my feet tend to slide to the front of the shoe. I have to wear inserts which is ok. But wearing them for more than 2 or 3 hours will kill me I'm sure.
4.0,"So comfy !! I ordered a large ,it fit nice.<br />I’m only 5’4 it went below the knee .<br />Love it , I’m getting another ."
4.0,Love the bracelet. Be perfect for my grandmother for Christmas.
4.0,Fits well. Soft fabric. Happy that it’s washable. Super cute.
4.0,I like the way it fits real well
4.0,Cute and comfortable but starts to rust pretty quickly
4.0,Beautiful dress - great price. Just a little to snug.. ordered larger size and it wasn’t as flattering. 😕 (it’s me not the dress) very cute
4.0,"Purchased this dress for my daughter's high school Christmas choral concert. She loves it and looks beautiful in the color. However, it is a bit short. It's cut on a bias which doesn't really show in the stock picture because of the placement of the scarf in the model's hand. My daughter is 5'4&#34; and most of her height is in her legs. (Full disclosure, I'm completely jealous of her fabulous legs! We should all be so lucky!) However, at 15 I'm not super thrilled with that much of her thigh showing, especially at a school function. Luckily, she was on the risers with others in front of her. Perhaps with leggings this may provide a more modest look if that is of concern. If not, GO FOR IT! Let those gorgeous gams be shown!"
4.0,"Seems very durable. I like the size and material. The lock is hard to get on. But once it is, it seems very secure. Will be taking this on vacation next week."
4.0,I am busty so I ordered to accommodate and it fits a little large. We have a pool and hot tub do I kept in case a guest needs a suit
4.0,the clip is a little delicate.  It isn't great for my padded visors but works well
4.0,"I really like the feel of this set. Since I got it, my family has been high jacking it. My son took the ear muffs.<br /><br />The muffs have a nice furry feel on the inside and is wind resistant on the outside. Very nice for people who are sensitive to wind getting in your ears like me.<br /><br />The scarf has two sides. It has a knitted side and a furry side. My Husband tried to take it, but I told him that it was a woman's scarf so he left it alone. Anything with a soft cozy feel is right down his alley. Honestly, a man could wear it with no problem but I really like the scarf out of everything I got. It does a good job of protecting your neck from the wind without all the bulk. Sometimes, I just wear the neck piece just because.<br /><br />The knitted hood is nice. Has a great feel to it. I would however, wear this hood under something a little thicker if you plan on wearing it in the wind and snow. Or adding the ear muffs because you will need them. Wind travels straight through this hood. It is otherwise very warm and comfy.<br /><br />The gloves are knitted pretty well. I was able to text while wearing them. If you plan to wear them outside, I would def. pair them under a heavier set of gloves."
4.0,I was laughing before my husband even put the suit on. It looks just like the photo.
4.0,"Like the size,  durability and over the shoulder design."
4.0,"The dress fit perfectly! No need to order a size up or down! It is, however, super long on my 5' 4&#34; frame. No real surprise there since everything is long on me- my mom can sew and can remedy the length. I ordered the black and white dress, and noticed that the skirt had a bit of a sheen in the black, but it's actually the built in satin slip! I like the way it gives a shimmer to the skirt and also keeps the dress from being see through. The button around the neck was hard for me to do while wearing the dress, but the top as a lot of stretch and I am able to get it on buttoned. I saw that other reviews commented on the sewing- mine looked fine all around. I will update after repeated wear and washing.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,They seem to have a hard time snapping into place. But I got it. The red started to fade after 2 weeks. It still looks good...but not as vibrant. I guess I understand as it's printed on the band. I really do like this band.
4.0,I have this product 4 stars because it was not long enough. It fit like a shirt. It just barely covered my but. I suggest that you order a size large if you wanted to wear this as s dress. I am 140 lbs and I'm on the short / slender side. If you are around 5'4 I suggest you order a large in this item. But over all great great product.
4.0,Bought these for my daughters and they lived then so much I had to buy for myself as well! 4 stars only because the ones I bought for myself had quite a few strings hanging which I cut off otherwise a Great product.
4.0,Good quality for price. Tangles while wearing easily. Would purchase again
4.0,Writing on bottom is a little yellow discolored on one sock but they fit good and material is thick.
4.0,Love the dress but it really does run LARGE! Downsize at least one size...
4.0,"I usually wear a size 6 but had to order a size up and got an 8. Dress came as pictured. Dress is long, will probably have to be hemmed no matter what size you are. Love the blush color and price."
4.0,"These would likely have 5 stars, but they haven't a clue about sizing.  I usually wear a 9.5 (US), sometimes a 9 in shoes that I don't intend to wear socks in.  That's how these seem to fit, maybe a little smaller.  Sizing seems to be entirely determined by the manufacturer anyway,  (I wear a 10.5 (US) in one top brand.).<br />Getting past the sizing, they feel great.  Little more than basic flat, zero drop, soles which seem to help my knees, with simple, good looking uppers.  The round toes leave plenty of &#34;wiggle room&#34;.  Haven't had them long enough to know about durability, but if they can be screwed up before their time, it'll happen to me."
4.0,"But the sizing chart seems to be correct for my size. This is a pretty, sexy, evening wear type dress. You could also go to clubs in this dress. It is very nice and can be dressed up even more with just a touch of jewelry. This is a nice looking lbd"
4.0,Was going to give these as a gift. Changed my mind.
4.0,Haven't had long and it's starting to rip and tear apart.
4.0,"Perfect for my petite build. I was very pleased because it fit my arms and waist perfectly. The quality is there and also the bling action. I would have given 5 stars but the zipper is a little cheap but mostly because the button holes are too small for the button. I am 5 feet tall and 100 lbs. I ordered a small and it fits wonderfully. I love the hood too. It really works and never falls off. Love this jacket. It took a while to get because it came a long way, but worth the wait. I love this jacket. It's great for cool California weather."
4.0,"I love the look of this dress, but definitely size down.  I am an xs/s depending on the dress.  I went with a small since they do not offer xs.  I probably would have needed an xxs for a perfect fit, but with a jean jacket it will be fine."
4.0,"I found the dress to be more flattering in person! The fabric is nice, though not too heavy. It seems to be a nice weight for summertime, especially where I live as the humidity can be an issue. I would recommend neutral undergarments since the white part does come down to the hips on the sides.  At 5'6&#34; the length was quite nice. I ordered the Large and it fits a curvy 8-10 nicely. It might work well for a 12 as well, if not too curvy. The dress does not come down as low on me as the pictures on the product page show.  The way the straps crisscross in the back is really cute but they are almost too long in the back with the way my body is shaped, but it's easy enough to adjust by pulling down.<br />This product was provided to me at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased review. I rely on reviews for many of my own purchases on Amazon and will review them to the best of my ability."
4.0,I was in search of a pair but didn't want to pay a high amount in stores. I came across these and decided to give them a try. They arrived faster then expected. In my opinion they were a little small. I felt like I could of went up a size to have more coverage. Other wise they stick great and hold well. I haven't worn them out so I'm not sure how well they stay on after wearing for a certain amount of time. I would order them again.
4.0,The smell is overwhelming.
4.0,The style was very cute. I usually wear a large and it fit a little snug on top. But will wear it.
4.0,"Very comfortable and sexy yoga pants, the only thing is they are a bit see through for the gym but very nice to go out for a walk or a run."
4.0,"The look and comfort is there, but feels so light and chintzy. Worth exactly what u pay for, no more, no less.<br />3.5 stars rounded up to 4."
4.0,"These are the best feeling ponte pants. I just wish they fit. I'm 6ft tall and they were still too long and bunching in the crotch. The waist was also too big, even though this should of been my size. I was sad that the smaller sizes were gone and I couldn't order another pair. This material felt so good."
4.0,"As I have ventured into the world of smart watches while navigating significant and disparate environmental and metal allergies. My major goal was finding a 100% titanium clasp.<br /><br />I think this company could do great if they just sold titanium clasps in various sizes. with a tool to make the process easier. In looking for titanium clasps. I could only find titanium alloy. I am allergic to titanium alloy. I have not had a chance to wear this band yet, so my skin barometer is not yet verified that this is not titanium alloy, but it looks and feels like titanium to me. I will update if my skin reports differently.<br /><br />the price for the band and clasp is about what you'd pay for a clasp on its own, but I didn't really need the band. The leather is nice enough stamped genuine leather, decently supple, and an attractive red. not high end but classic and tight in style.<br /><br />If you are purchasing to move the clasp to another band, make sure to check the taper on your band. most bands taper about 2 mm from the lugs to the clasp but that's not standard."
4.0,"I've only had these shorts for a few weeks, but I've worn them a few times already. They are comfortable and fit as I expected them to. They actually have four pockets - two pockets on the side and two smaller zipper pockets in the back. The design on the side of the shorts isn't as pronounced as it looks in the picture, but it is still a good stylish element on the shorts."
4.0,The shirt fits good and is true to size. It is shorter than I thought it would be.
4.0,Walking and biking outdoors in the cold
4.0,"Very pretty earring. I found them at a shop, so I bought two at the same time, one for each ear. It does take a *lot* of patience to put in because you have to thread it through the first earring hole, then your ear, and then the second earring hole, then screw on a tiny ball to close it, but I managed to put them in my ears, without the use of a mirror, in a truck on the way home.<br /><br />The effect is very pretty, and I have found that I actually can sleep in them because they lay flat against my ear, and I sleep on my side.<br /><br />Pro tip- Make sure you know what gauge your piercing is, the bar is larger than standard piercing."
4.0,It has a nice stretch it's really nice I like the colors that I chose and it's really easy to install overall great I want to get an other colors
4.0,Not quite as sturdy as they look
4.0,Not kids size. Fits me.
4.0,Cute seems to fit well
4.0,One size does not fit all but they will fit a good range of sizes.  Very small and very large will not enjoy.  They could stay up a bit better but they did a good job on a long day.
4.0,"Overall this belt is great BUT try and release it ,took me 15 minutes to work the extremely  small release lever and under pressure forget it. would have been a five star except for this poor feature"
4.0,Watch is really cute. but the band could be a little longer.
4.0,This product is definitely lightweight and is not warm for winter wear without a coat over it. But it is comfortable and a good fit.
4.0,"It's comfy, I bought the large but it was slightly too big. I'm okay with it because the medium might be too snug. Love the length."
4.0,"Fit loose but like them, child 16 mo weighs 18lbs"
4.0,Beautiful pendant but chain is not sterling silver. I had an allergic reaction and had to replace. Still would recommend.
4.0,"They're a bit pricy.  My daughter likes them because they fit her round head and are dark.  Polarized to cut glare, and a simple style."
4.0,"The product I received was of fairly good quality.  I'm more used to ties that are thicker in width but it did fairly well.  I had quite some difficulty tying a windsor knot with it due to it's length. However, this is to be said for any tie.  If you tie 4 in a hand knots, go for it.  I was a little disappointed in the packaging as they just simply folded it over, and when it is mailed, you get some creases in the tie when you recieve it.  However, they come out eventually.  Everyone should own a white tie.  Just don't wear it with a black shirt only!"
4.0,bought this dress for a bachelorette party and received many compliments!
4.0,"Cute shirt, fabric is sorta thick. Shirt is designed to be roomy, I would say it's true to size but if you're between sizes order the smaller size. Very comfortable."
4.0,Valuable purchase because of the price and amount of items. The colors are vibrant and the straps are a decent length. My only complaint is that these caps and durags aren't as soft as I expected them to be! Maybe they'll soften after a few washes
4.0,"This hat fit really well and served its purpose. The material was like felt so that was different, but a nice hat nonetheless. Would buy again."
4.0,Just as described. Took a long time to get them
4.0,"Great product, my jewelry hasn't shinned so much in years. So happy I invested in this."
4.0,Has a soft light fleece interior.  Will be perfect for cold weather
4.0,The shirt is spot on for Caps uniform in CA:WS and looks amazing<br />The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because it's a bit small for an XL and where it has to stretch out it gets white/sheer
4.0,"The overall fit is good, but the stripes on the sleeves do not stretch. It's a minor thing but I have bigger forearms so I notice it."
4.0,"Actually very pleased... it’s one of those necklaces you find on a end-cap at a CVS BUT really nice. The chain looks kinda cheapy, but if u had a nice sliver chain it would look A LOT BETTER.  Overall very pleased. 4 stars is because of Amazon it’s self Not the product...  I would absolutely buy items from them again ."
4.0,the material is very well and soft. the stitching is well done. i recommend buying a size up just in case it runs small on you. it’s obviously not a real champion hoodie but i still love it
4.0,The color or much lighter than the picture but it is a pretty dress and it fits nice.
4.0,"Easy to read, very accurate, elapsed time bezel works smoothly. Great informal, everyday watch<br /> The only &#34;con&#34; is its weight. Given its size and stainless steel construction, it's pretty chunky. However, I have slightly smaller than average wrists and it works fine for me. This is my second watch of this design. The first was stolen and I replaced it with the exact same model. That should tell you something."
4.0,"I like this spinner a lot. Very smooth. Fine for an overnight trip, and if you are a guy probably even more days : )<br /><br />The USB is a gimmick though. The port & cables charge too slowly to be effective. I'd rather just put my own cables in the bag, and stick it out from the zipper -- or make a whole though the handle nook to route the cable. I should have known luggage makers are not tech companies.<br /><br />I used it on a couple of Delta flights and fit under the seat comfortably. But your experience may be different depending on the airline and / or airplane.<br /><br />But regardless, it is a good underseater, and so far sturdy."
4.0,i really liked them except one of the pieces that go on the nose was broken but it didn't make a difference.  over all i really like them and would recommend!!
4.0,"Material feels silky, wasn't what I expected but looks good. Fits nice and feels comfortable due to the material."
4.0,"Pretty but very very very delicate. Almost immediately, the weave was disfigured in the course of 20 min. playing with a three-year-old. The kiddo still loves it."
4.0,"I just got my necklace today took a little longer then expected, the necklace  is beautiful. It feels very cheap and I am hard on jewelry so I hope it lasts"
4.0,"After reading the first review that it was 10 of the same repeated I wasnt sure if I wanted to order it but when I got mine there were only a few repeats. Some of them you cant see what they are. I got a total of 4 palm trees, a church, hands praying, &lt;3 my mom, mother in law, bottle of coke, dolphin, 2 x king and 1 queen playing cards, pikes peak (race course), 2 white SUV's, 2 motorcycles, I &lt;3 my mercedes, arizona, an airplane, an indian guy dancing, a cactus, a double piece that is 2 kids playing basketball, dora the explorer, patrick from spongebob, clown, blue the dog (kids show), 1ST place ribbon, precious moments, 2 peanuts characters, 2 soccer mom, bitch, house work sucks, a softball, air force mom, navy, surf with a surf board, navy brat with a flag, napa calif, softball mom, dots candy with a little dot hanging from it, a red high heel, sweetheart with a heart hanging from it, dog face (looks like a shih tzu), ballet shoes, 2 sugar daddy, wine bottle with grapes and a glass, hat with a bow, grey cat face, 2 royal bitch, a horse jumping over a fence, a canary, 2 elephants, an alligator, penguin, black horse, 2 cityscapes, a white cat face, a unicorn head, I &lt;3 knitting, a pic of a rotweiler, be mine &lt;3, &lt;3 grandpa, just married with 2 rings, a coffee cup, a black cat on a sparkly blue background, white palm tree and moon on blue background, aunt, spring break on beach, a mai tai, a red pick up, maui, indiana hoosier, uncle sam hat, baby on manger, cupid, xmas stocking, louisiana, santa, new york 9-01, white house, senior, i &lt;3 my uncles, horse drawn carriage, college bound, grad hat, &lt;3 my collie, violin, gymnast, colombia flag, rocking horse, college girl.. there were 4 unidentifiable ones also. All in all, not bad for $13 considering they are about $5-12 each. Im making bracelets for my bridal party so this was a really nice mix. I might order another batch to see if they are different. All good quality, one was kinda scuffued up is all."
4.0,"they are ok, not recommended for very bright sun while driving. Its more of a casual wear. The color is see through. i like them.<br /><br />---Update---<br /><br />Someone broke into my car and stole these. So i guess they are pretty good, good enough for someone to steal them haha."
4.0,Really handy and protective
4.0,"Good fit, really sparkly, good heel height."
4.0,"This product is aesthetically pleasing, but truthfully is not very warm. I recommend wearing heavy layers underneath for when it gets below 50°. Also, the inner liner runs very small and short, so I recommend ordering larger than normal so that it fits better. The outer liner fit okay as a large (which I initially ordered, but returned to order an XL through another seller) but even as an XL it runs small. I could use a 2XL for the inner liner. This is more of a complaint on Drake’s end than the person shipping my product though."
4.0,"Great product material is ok, seems little shorter then picture but very flattering"
4.0,"This is an otrhopedic sandal, and the arch support is very good. I walk very comfortably with them"
4.0,These are cute and true to size. My 4-year-old loves them. We haven't had them for very long so don't know how they hold up yet.
4.0,cute but a little big one their sizes
4.0,Product as described.  Actually better than I expected.  It did break but was easily fixed
4.0,"Pants are cut very large, order a size smaller for best fit. Excellent quality fabric and workmanship, though."
4.0,"Had to return because it was too large , color was as pictured and well made. Awaiting smaller size ;)"
4.0,"This cross was very pretty & dainty, but smaller & lighter weight than I expected.  I returned it because I was afraid my 9-year-old granddaughter would break the thin chain& lose it."
4.0,The only reason I held it to 4 stars instead of 5 is just a design thing. I would like it much better if there were slots on the inside for a couple more cards. Otherwise it is very well made.
4.0,"Fits I mean fits. Should have ordered up one size, but my son likes the."
4.0,"Good quality, but runs big. We could have ordered a size or even two down."
4.0,"My daughter has been in tap for 10 years now (Since 3 yrs old) and her foot has grown to bigger than mine now! I had to return the 9 1/2 because it was too small. She is in a normal shoe 9. I did get the 10 and they just fit her. I dont know if the tap runs small? Or is my daughters feet just still growing???<br />Other than that, they are comfy and and a good par of taps that I hope last her a couple of years!"
4.0,"Looks good, but the post is a little &#34;tight&#34;, as in the ball is practically touching the back of the stones.  I was able to move it back a bit, but I'm not sure if it will break or not... we'll see.  It does look really good with her belly button shape, though :)"
4.0,Cute summer dress  colors are faded not bright
4.0,This strap is comfortable and held my sunglasses secure. The strap looks good and feels good.
4.0,Comfortable and sexy. I like it but feels a little smaller than expected
4.0,"The dress is not exactly as pictured, though it is similar. It is not a ribbed cotton dress like I expected, but instead, it is made of a soft cotton and polyester blend. It is not transparent. I am 5'7&#34; and 120 lbs and I ordered a Large based on my measurements, but it fits too loosely. I imagine if I had ordered my usual size Small, it would have fit perfectly. I would say to order true to size. It would be perfect to wear on a night out, but as it does not fit me to my liking, I plan to wear this as a casual dress with some sneakers."
4.0,"So far it seems like it's exactly what I wanted.  My other Snoopy backpack broke a strap, so I really wanted a new one.  I haven't been anywhere since it first arrived, but I'm sure it will work just fine.  I put it on my back, and it's comfortable.  I'm a huge Peanuts fan, so I like the design of it."
4.0,I'm happy with my shoes they came really fast the only problem is one of my black shoes kind of look dirty but I'm happy
4.0,Definitely order 2 sizes smaller. Has a few small scuffs but nothing worth returning 8$ shoes.
4.0,"These are great quality. The only thing is that the Calvin Klein logo on the heal wears out really quickly, but that's not a big deal."
4.0,"This jacket is perfect for what I needed in warm areas!!  I like a lot!  Colors are great.<br /><br />After using for several times I notice the color was being erased.  The material was balling, lttle shreds if material was pulling.<br /><br />Other than that I liked it.<br /><br />Not one to last!!"
4.0,"Cute, chain twists & turns and I had to constantly fix it."
4.0,This dress fits a bit weird. It's not suited for everybody. You must have a curvier shape to pull off something like this. But the material is excellent quality.
4.0,Super comfy and good quality but the lines hit me in funny places. I wanted to love it but it is just not flattering on me.
4.0,They came as expected and were rather quite lovely! And they ended up being quite great quality for the amount I paid. Went above and beyond my expectations!
4.0,These were bought for my husband who uses them when snow blowing. He said they are very comfortable to wear and block the glare of sun on snow quite well. They are not the same as a premium brand but they are a good quality Google for $12. Perfect for the occasional user.
4.0,Nice tie but doesn't feel silky
4.0,its great and its too big for me BUT it will shrink with wash and i can tuck it in
4.0,Nice inexpensive driving glasses.
4.0,"I bought these because while riding on dirt I was 'sucked into a barbed wire fence.  i needed something more robust than jeans.The package the pants arrived in said they were 44 inch I needed 46.  I e-mailed the vendor, they contacted me right away.  It seems that I got the correct size.  However I did not get the correct size based on the size listed inside the lining.  The pants do have a liner that ends at about knee height.  The pants fit in a boy's short waisted manner, not a U.S. adult male..  They ride downwards in spite of tightening my belt.  I like the small pocket on the right.  I like the color..  Maybe if I run into a small rill on a dirt road and slap the barbed wire fence, I won't hurt as much.  It was a bloody walk home."
4.0,Adorable dress!!
4.0,very satisfied soft material fits nice.
4.0,"For $9.99, this is a great deal. The outfit is cute and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the cost. The skirt and top are stretchy and true to size. My daughter loved it."
4.0,The picture shows a marbled look and this is solid green but still nice!
4.0,"very shiny and intricate chain design, sometimes the dragon heads will turn over facing down on my wrist but just flip it im rather skinny, and if you have semi hairy wrist it may tug occasionally, besides that im totally digging this dragon , make sure you know what your wrist size is im like around 7 in and i have about a finger maybe of free space."
4.0,"Very nice ,i always like belle poque dress its classy and elegant the color always do justice .but i hope they add length to their dress next time .after all everything is ...just wow."
4.0,Flattering dress. I’m 5’8 medium build and the medium was a little tight.
4.0,"While the many thousands of fluffy bunny Pagan books have their place as introductory material for those just emerging from the stupor of imported religions forced upon their ancestors many hundreds of years ago, there comes a time when you have to delve deeper and get to the core of native European religion.<br />Varg's books can help you do that, although I wish they would be longer."
4.0,"Love that my dog and I are fully visible at night. Good fit for the human vest. The dog vest runs really small. I have a 65 pound pit mix and we ordered the largest size which just fits her. If you have a dog larger than that, I don't think it'll work. My only complaint is that the Velcro is starting to break down and not work so well."
4.0,"Love these shorts, but thought I bought a different pair than what I got. Still cute"
4.0,Received a lot of compliments. Looks as expected.
4.0,Satisfied with this product...
4.0,Beautiful dress but not true to size unless you like very short dresess
4.0,"It's a cute necklace, but the chain looks weird. It looks like a gumball machine chain. However, the pendant is nicely made. This came beautifully packaged in a nice gift box. Would purchase again."
4.0,"looked good but order a half size up if you can. Had to return it, too tight."
4.0,Great bracelet like the color and helps my wrist pain.
4.0,Great bag- lightweight - soft- lots of room for purse items-
4.0,"These are really good quality, but they could be a little smaller."
4.0,too small for the neck chain I had to buy an extension.
4.0,"Great fit, liked wearing it during the summer."
4.0,I like these they are very thin and can break easily
4.0,"These are beautiful little earrings!! They're smaller than I expected (maybe I didn't see the measurements). Absolutely beautiful, fun earrings. Worth it!!"
4.0,I love how easy and unique this dress is! My only negative point on the dress is that the pattern is personally too bold for me but... I am still going to wear it. Very figure flattering and the material is soft and wrinkle free which makes it a perfect pack and travel dress. I included pics for reference. I'm 5'0 and about 95 lbs. I got an XS and its perfect. Not too tight at all. I think this will be a good &#34;going out for a nice dinner&#34; aka date night dress for me.
4.0,My daughter is a puppy Lover and fell in love with this apron. It is super cute and well made.
4.0,This is a very pretty band and fits my MK Bradshaw but the pins do not stay when you remove the band. I change my bands a couple times a week and when I change this band out I end up dropping at least 1 of the pins. I wish I didnt have to worry about it everytime I changed the band and be so very careful.
4.0,Shoulders are to boxy
4.0,I like that they fit tight to grip things
4.0,Large fits like a medium. To tight for me.
4.0,Nice jacket very comfy just not a thick as I thought It would be
4.0,Works well.  Follow directions carefully.  Make sure your mask fits snuggly around your nose.
4.0,It's a lovely dress. My waist is 33 n hips is 46 I ordered the 2xl because my arms n thighs are big. But am xl would have fit perfect still.  So waist area is just a little big. But I love it. I'm 5.6ft n it touches grown with flats so with a heels will be great
4.0,For that reason I had to return.
4.0,Cute but hat is lighter color.
4.0,"The scarves are well made, soft, and they will make very nice gifts."
4.0,Me gusto el color y el estilo.
4.0,To thin the fabric.
4.0,Too small will buy a new one
4.0,"I love the color of this Tory Burch handbag, but it was crushed so I'm not sure I'm going to keep it.  I have a cream colored one just like this I bought in the outlet store, and it doesn't look like that.  So, I'm debating whether to keep it.  I don't want to carry a purse that's not the shape it's supposed to be.  $399 plus tax is too much to spend for a misshapen purse.  It must have been stored with stuff on top of it and it made it FLAT"
4.0,The material should be different.
4.0,Relatively cheap. Warm and comfy. I like the rubber soles.
4.0,It's a good corset with nice solid metal frame just a little long
4.0,"I'm 145 pounds its fit me, but I don't really love it"
4.0,"The material on this shirt was just what I expected and it looks exactly like the picture. It does run small. I'm 5'3 120lbs and I bought a large. I could even go XL because I expect it to shrink and a larger size would give it a more relaxed look. The construction is decent for a Chinese product and it arrived within 10 days. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it!"
4.0,There was not anything I disliked about this shrug.  I am older and like sleeves down to elbows.  It is very feminine.  Will be great with sleeveless dresses
4.0,I love this little jacket/sweater. First I thought when I opened the package I might have to send it back because of how thin it is. When I tried it on I was amazed at how nice it looked on and that I would be wearing it for sure on casual work day the next day. It looks great with jeans! Oh and by the way I got plenty compliments on it !
4.0,I feel warm with this Hooded Jacket on. The size does not fit me as expected but i did not know which size to order. Good Product. I think other people should try this product at least once.
4.0,The costume was great and great quality. It was easy to clean after a party and fairly good investment for future costume parties. The jewelry was cheap and simple. We lost one of the small fake diamonds in the earrings.
4.0,"I ordered this in large, since it was Asian sizing (I'm 5'9 and usually wear a medium or 6/8 in U.S. styles). However, it was still pretty short, length-wise, on me. However it's an adorable shirt and it looks good tucked in or over a slightly longer tank, so I'm happy with the purchase. If you want this oversized, or to wear like the model's picture, I would recommend going up at least 2 sizes."
4.0,The design on the front is a bit faded but cute.
4.0,Fun gift for the price.  She loved them
4.0,Purchased as a gift. The pendant is stunning. You will need to plan on replacing the chain however.
4.0,"My husband likes it pretty well,  kinda stiff to wear, but still happy with overall product.  Good buy, reasonable price"
4.0,"Their cute, but it's a birthday present"
4.0,the chain was a little longer then expected but still adorable purse accent! love Betsey Johnson!!
4.0,Item is as shown
4.0,Was disappointed the socks were so snug on my legs.  Had to return them.
4.0,Nice.. seems well made
4.0,It comes folded so it has creases. It’s actually a soft floppy hat and doesn’t look quite like the photo. It will work for the price. Can’t complain for $7
4.0,"Beautiful color. Fits great. A little long for me, but I just tie a side and looks great. Great material. Washes nicely."
4.0,"Daughter needed a dress for a wedding themed off of Barbados and per colors bride (zilla) addressed everyone were to wear, My 21 yr old daughter was having no luck spending left and right on some ugly, uncomfortable gowns. So, I got on here and found this light weathered dress that had the colors and worked w?her youthfulness. She was flying out in 3 days and we had dress here in 2 amazing day and all worked out great.<br /> Since the wedding my daughter actually returned and bought a couple more for this hot AZ weather and they are beautiful and extremely reasonable, thank you for your timely manner :-)"
4.0,"These shorts work great for yoga, but I prefer to wear my own compression under shorts instead of utilizing a built in liner.  The liner in these shorts is similar to a brief style of underwear which I'm not a fan of.  I ended up just cutting out the liner and am perfectly happy with the shorts now.  The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because I had to cut the liner out.  If I could purchase these same shorts without a liner I would give that pair a 5 star rating."
4.0,They are beautiful but the way the packaging is they came bent.
4.0,It of corse works best in bright sunlight. I’ve had models with more power in the fan but they all eventuallly break and this is as close to that one as I can get.
4.0,"Size up and it’s nice, a bit cheaply made material but cute with a cardigan. Everyone compliments it."
4.0,"I suggest ordering a size up for extra length, very short!!"
4.0,"You need to remember that this is not a typical hoodie that we are used to. This is T-Shirt hoodie. That is, it is light and thin just like t-shirt, except it is designed as hoodie. Sometimes, my regular hoodie is thick during hot summer days, so you need something light, and this fits the bill. It is comfortable to wear, though it may be on a smaller side. So if you like to wear it loose, then order one size bigger. Other than that, this is a great choice if you are looking for a t-shirt hoodie! Recommended!"
4.0,Good quality nice shipping does run big
4.0,Very thin material only real downfall to this.
4.0,The dress is very soft and comfortable for the price. I was a little more shear than I had hoped but it is white so I should have known. It is very comfortable for wearing on hot days.
4.0,"the shirt material is rough for sleepwear, but I love this set! quirky and cute"
4.0,"These are good and comfortable,but the laces slip. Will be buying different laces for these."
4.0,get large if you have 11+ size in men's and a fairly large toe
4.0,"I actually like the hat.  My ears may be a bit too big so my lobe feels ""bunched"" up in there.  Other than that, fits well on my head, definitely is warm enough."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, 130 lbs and ordered a medium. Though big in the waist, I'm glad I went with this size has I couldn't wear anything shorter! But a cute dress!!"
4.0,"A bit smaller than I expected, but nice."
4.0,Little flimsy but looks great. Just be gentle and take care of to get long use out of it.
4.0,"Good sweater, I would buy again if it cost a little less but over all really good and cozy"
4.0,"I like this charm, it is pretty. I live in an area with an amazing snow mountain, this reflects upon my 11 years of looking at this amazing glaciar, covered with snow all year round."
4.0,"My wife is a huge Harry Potter fan, so anything Harry Potter is a hit with her. Its nice quality, looks really cool, and its subtle enough that you won't look like a dork.  The only complaint she had was that the clasp is a bit of a pain. Not that there is a problem with it, its just tricky without an extra set of hands.  But otherwise, its really cool."
4.0,I got this for my daughter for Valentines days. She is only 6 so I didn't want to spend a ton since I know she is young and will most likely break or lose it in a short matter of time. This was perfect for her. She was thrilled when she got it and she asks to wear it on a regular basis. I love that she can wear it to school and I don't have to be worried if she takes it off and loses it since I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it. It is a little long on her but if she doesn't break or lose it she will grow into it. Its not a high quality necklace and would be prefect for younger children.
4.0,"Very pretty - I pair them with the smaller size bar earrings, or wear them alone."
4.0,My husband bought this sliver piece along with several other things ..I love the earrings.. the crystal heart is beautiful .. I love the length .. they arrived way before expected ..the negative is the actual.. post with rubber backing .. when looking at the picture we thought they were more fish hook type earrings .. I am afraid the rubber pieces will get lost .. then what ..it the earring meant to thread into the ear past the post> this is the first pair I have owned like this .. I wore them with the rubber backing they were comfortable.. and OH so beautiful ..
4.0,"I purchased this purse for my mother as a gift. She likes it very much and has found the quality, size and color to be exceptional."
4.0,"I'll admit it; I'm not a small guy.  Not HUGE, but certainly need to lose a few pounds.  I own several pairs of similar pants from Columbia.  I tried these, and overall, I like them.  Plenty of pockets, which is important for hiking.  We always drive somewhere to hike, and I hate to risk losing my keys.  Plenty of places to hide them here.  They are very fast drying; I spilled a coke on them the other day, and I was dry in literally just a few minutes.<br /><br />My only item of note on the negative side is that the legs are tighter.  Not so that they are uncomfortable, but of course, with Columbia, it's the incredible lightness and ease of movement I like.  I am sometimes aware of these pants being a bit tight, especially when climbing or taking a steep step.  It's minor, but if, by chance, you perhaps find Columbia pants already a bit tight, I'd have to say to avoid these.  HOWEVER, if you're small and looking for something a smidge snugger than Columbia, these might just fit the bill!"
4.0,The size is smaller them expected. Tiny.
4.0,"Just got these in the mail today. I bought it as brand new but why do they look used? You can see that in the photo, the sole looks a little worn out. It is true to size and I did “try” it for a second. Seems pretty comfy. The only reason why it’s not a 5 star is the sole."
4.0,To thin not worth the price I basically paid for the nike logo
4.0,"I love the pattern and design of this dress! It is a little small in the chest area though. I usually wear a size Large, but had to get an XL for this dress and it still felt just slightly constricting."
4.0,Purchased 2X because that is what I normally wear but way too small. Great coat so I gave it to my Mom.
4.0,"Only reason it's not a 5 star is because the sizes are a little wierd. I've returned 2 and expecting my third, if it doesn't fit I'll be adjusting star rating to 1. Order 2 sizes bigger than you normally wear."
4.0,"These are quite comfy for my long rise. I have a large waist for my proportions (apple shape) and it fits comfortably.  The hips/upper legs are a little wide for me, but that's true of most jeans in my size.  The fabric is a nice thin stretch that still has some structure to it; very nice for summer."
4.0,"Ordered a large/extra large and it's way to big, I feel like in swimming in it. If you buy this, definitely order a size down, you may think it wont fit but it will."
4.0,"Such a cute dress but super thin. Reminds me of something you’d get at F21. Wear some spandex under it, and you should be good!"
4.0,Runs small mostly around the chest and sleeves but feeels nice
4.0,"It is stretchy. What i didn't like about it is the hood. It has to be worn all the way, kid may be sweaty and too warm."
4.0,"I love because it's adjustable, I'm interested in ordering more on an array of colors"
4.0,These are okay for the price. Look smart and once they'd adjusted to my feet they were comfortable to wear. Only problem for me is that the straps are loose on my feet and so my feet move around a bit.
4.0,Nice but it looks more like a man's than a women's.  Chain is extremely long.
4.0,"The glasses are very convenient and compact. The prescription seems to be accurate. They do tend to loosen up quickly, making them slide on my face."
4.0,Very happy with the necklace but it broke already.
4.0,"Purchased to be worn in the woods (get dirty) and airsoft.  Works well, warm and fits good.  The drawstrings for the hood are not good.  They are external from the jacket and will have direct touch with your cheeks/around your chin.  I found this awkward and uncomfortable.  I like the pockets, material and warmth of the coat."
4.0,Were bigger than my husband expected but I still think they look amazing on him.
4.0,"Nice purse, but would have liked it a little bigger. The overall design was worth the price."
4.0,"It was too small for me.  I loved the material,style and color."
4.0,"It's a nice wrap dress and just as I expected. I am wearing it now. because it is a sunny day. It's a comfortable and lightweight material. Doesn't broken after washed several times I'm never sweating in it. I'm 5'2'',100lbs, and usually wear a 8 or 10, So I ordered a small, it is fit me. Highly recommend"
4.0,Bought this hat for a Halloween party. It was able to fit on a size 8 head pretty comfortably.
4.0,Used for every day wear it is comfortable in light it’s A little big but it’s OK not tight
4.0,"Cool product, Great price.<br />I bought these for my grand daughters to do light painting photography.<br />Fun times.  They worked great.<br />Thanks, Amazon."
4.0,Well designed and quality construction. This is a tough bag
4.0,"The fabric seems thick enough for swimming and strong enough that the bikini won't just rip off me. The top is a little tight, but not too bad. I'll more than likely still wear it. The butt is VERY cheeky. I was not expecting that. And prob will have to wear different bottoms because it may be seen inappropriate to wear with two kids by my side. I think it's a super cute bikini otherwise !<br /><br />DISCLAIMER I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW"
4.0,Nice pin that will get a reaction if people get close enough to see the details.  It would be better if it was about 50% bigger.
4.0,good quality for $.
4.0,"Nice shoe, runs small order up!"
4.0,I love the glasses themselves. They do seem to be a little stretched out regarding the arms which I am not able to tighten.
4.0,The lenses are a little small but I expected that.  They work great and love the metal case.  Am guessing the clip won't hold up long but so far its fine.
4.0,"Beautiful, only it is a bit too big and heavy for me until my cartilage piercing is completely healed. My ears are sensitive and take a long time to heal"
4.0,"The fabric is delightful, flows nice and falls nicely on the body. The fit was a bit large for a person that is 5’5” with an athletic build (muscular). The top is great fit at the neck and arms (nice bouncy stretchy material) but much more loose/tapered towards the bottom than anticipated; regardless this is going to be a summer fav. Arrived on time, as described and of great quality."
4.0,"They do seem to give some benefit in being more ready for sleep after using the computer late at night. I just wouldn't mind something a bit less chunky, but I guess they are made to last! Also I guess the large size is to really block out peripheral blue light."
4.0,Cute Mask! My 8 year old Daughter loves it! Only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is I wish it was adjustable so it wasn’t so tight on her face other then that it is super cute and very soft fabric.
4.0,Love them all I really don’t need a satin pillow case anymore however they can be a little too tight if you wear them too long so I end up taking it off during the night at times.
4.0,"Nice glasses, case is too small. Received on time.  Mph"
4.0,I ordered a medium and they are a very snug. I'm 5'1 & 110lbs. And they are very itchy & some of the sequences are falling off. But over it's exactly like the movie. I wish I would've ordered a large. I would recommend ordering I size up. They are so pretty though.
4.0,Fits good but I assumed it was 100% cotton and this was not the case but still a good fit and quality.
4.0,Small but cute. It was a great gift for that person who you didn't think would be a the Christmas party
4.0,"Good value lightweight jogging shorts with a smooth (not fleeced) interior.  2 side slit pockets with contrasting heather gray piping and matching V-OGUE Outdoor equipment logo on left bottom of leg.  As far as length, they hit at the top of my knee.  For those interested, 2 inch waistband and 8 inch inseam, total length 20 inches.<br /><br />SIZING!  These are Asian sizing!  I am a 31-32 inch waist, &#34;medium&#34; by most US standards, XL by Asian standards from previous experience.  These are cut small.  I ordered the XXL size since I wanted the Navy color (and XL was not available), and I'm glad I did.  Bumping up that additional size makes them fit correctly.  There is an elastic waistband and cord drawstring, making it easier to size down the waist if needed, and I feel that the other proportions would be a bit tight for activities if I went smaller.<br /><br />Why did I debit 1 star?  In addition to the sizing, the description states &#34;cotton&#34;.  I expected a material similar to the similarly priced Russell Athletic shorts (that I like), but these are a blend, I'm assuming a polyester by the feel and the way that they drape/ hang, but can't say for sure as the tag is clipped off and there is no other material content tag or care instructions.  The lining in the pockets is nylon acetate I believe.  I have a cheap suit with similar material in the pockets.  With no care tag, I took a chance and threw them in the washing machine on &#34;warm&#34; as I normally would.  There was no detrimental fading of the color and they did not fall apart.  I did notice that the nylon pocket lining did fray where it attaches to the exterior gray piping (single stitched at this point as opposed to the rest of the sides that have a more stable stitch.)  Experience tells me that this will lead to separation in the future with subsequent washings.  With the longer life of synthetic blends, I wish they had chosen a better material for the pocket lining.<br /><br />*I have received this item at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,"The negative, it took a long time to get here but as I wasn't in a hurry it wasn't a problem for me, however if your in a hurry be aware it could take some time.<br /><br />The positive The fabric is nice and the fit was good for me at 34&#34;.  The quality is good for the price, the pouch has a nice amount of room and stretch but not to much however I could see where the fit might feel a bit loose for anyone that likes a snug fit.<br /><br />I will be getting more in the future."
4.0,"Probably another half star, it's good quality , provides a lot of bang for your buck. I must add that if the diameter of your wrist is above average then band may be a little small. Other than that I like it a lot, it's very unique, and I like the old school winding."
4.0,Love it.  Wear it all the time.  Would have preferred if there was a cap sleeve lining.
4.0,"Good product, runs a bit short."
4.0,"Generally like it, but expected the cloth to be a little heavier.  Also, would have preferred availability in one size smaller."
4.0,"Great colors,  durable. Just one earring  had a clasp issue."
4.0,"I was really impressed with these. They came in a black jewelry bag, so that was a nice bonus. The blue is probably my favorite, but the gold stud looks the best on me according to my roommates."
4.0,I got small hand and it fit great.  The price is good and I love the color.
4.0,The dress and pattern is very pretty. The fabric is thin. I would not say it looks cheap because it doesn't but it's not the highest quality. I would purchase more.
4.0,"I would normally spend $120 to $150+ for a pair of name brand glasses and get several years out of them before getting new ones. I came across these in an exploratory search for new sunglasses on Amazon. I gave them a shot based on the positive reviews and price point. My expectations we low but after wearing them for a few months, I'm sold. They look exactly as they did when I opened the box, even after getting tossed around a bit and getting dropped a few times. I will definitely buy these again."
4.0,Great fit and handsome shirt. The material is not really soft but comfortable enough.
4.0,Love the color. Had a few holes near pockets. Could be better material. Used htv on these.
4.0,This is such a cool 👓 i will be posting photos soon👌
4.0,"Scarf is cute, it snags a lot. After wearing the first time I had thread pulling off already. Good price."
4.0,Weird fabric. BUT ADORABLE!
4.0,"This dress is a great value for the money and is certain to become a summer favorite.  I'll wear it a few times to go out on warm summer evenings, and it will become a favorite beach dress or summer around the home casual.  The top is super stretchy, and the (attached) skirt weighs it down a bit, so if you are on the fence about size, choose the smaller size."
4.0,Nice material but is very small.I ordered one size up based on the comments but it still fits  a bit too fitted.
4.0,The dye lot is different in the ribbon of the onezie and the shorts but otherwise is adorable
4.0,"I'm 125lbs, C cup and usually wear a small but this Medium was way small on me on top. The pants were fine but the jacket is made small for sure. I ended up putting wider frog closures on it and making it work since any larger size would not fit in other places. It's good quality for the money though."
4.0,Bought the dress since it was on sale but I was surprised at how comfortable and cute it was. It was a bit loose in the chest area and it had to be adjusted but other than that I loved it.
4.0,"Overall it’s great. Sound is good not great, but more than what I need. It’s a little tight, wish they had multiple sizes. It’s a beanie so I wouldn’t recommend wearing it while working out unless you plan on constantly washing it."
4.0,Fits great except it’s a little too long for me but that is a problems I run into a lot. I like the dress though.
4.0,"I love sunglasses and go through a lot of pairs because I am always seeming to leave them in the wrong purse or car or someone else borrows them! I try to have a pair in each car, each purse and in the house. I purchased these extra large Aviator style glasses with metal frames because they are polarized and look good on men or women. I chose the silver frames with violet lenses and they have an attractive look. They look good on me and even better on my son and husband who have bigger heads! Lol The lenses are darker than I usually get but I prefer them this way after trying them out on a very sunny day that I decided to take them on a drive. The lenses most definitely cut down on glare although I obviously can't measure that it's the 99% they claim. They filter out UVA and UVB rays  while keeping a stylishly fashionable look. They are definitely worth the price point and I am happy that I purchased this pair.<br />***I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion in this review. The discount does not influence my truthfulness in any way."
4.0,The buckle is a little big but the belt is  great hubby loves it
4.0,"Perfect, I've already purchased several of these Watches, same make same model and for the price, they cannot be beat, good weight heavy and that's great for retailing them, I'm  getting three 3 times my purchase price, plus this model is all over the place, selling on Amazon for and from$27.99 $37.95 $99.99 interesting. Even the Stainless steel band is comfortable and does not pull out my jsir"
4.0,Ready to wear
4.0,"Pleased with everything except the belt is slightly wider than a pair of my trousers, quality is excellent."
4.0,Husband is picky. Don’t think anything would ever make him happy. However the belt does what it needs to do.
4.0,This is a very nice little organizer wallet. I carry it around on my wrist by the strap often too. The only thing that could be better is it's hard to zip if I try to cram my phone (S7 Edge) in there. Just a smidge more width would be awesome. If you want to put this inside of a purse you'll need a larger purse. My typical handbags can't quite fit it. Also the zipper is a bit loose. It slowly zips down with a lot of jostling. But I just clip the zipper into the wrist strap and it can't go anywhere.
4.0,The purple boot is beautiful and perfect color.  The only problem is that they are tight around ankles.  Hope they will stretch in time.
4.0,"Tunic is great. It was gift for my sisters B-day and she loves it. Fits well, too.<br />My My estimated delivery date was the very end of October - November 11.  It arrived in 2 or 3 days after ordering. I almost didn't order because I didn't was to wait 1 1/2 months."
4.0,I have other down mitts that are way more expensive and way better but for the price these things are pretty awesome..the elastic cuff at the base of your hand and the drawstring at the very bottom are nice little touches .. these things are super lightweight and packed down to nothing these things can easily go in your bag or in your jacket pocket and you won't even know they're there.. the other down mittens I have are four times more expensive.. like I said for the price these things are awesome
4.0,Purchase for my teenage daughter. She loved top found shorts to be a bit baggy.
4.0,Good size. Like the elastic holders on the inside
4.0,"No support so best for those who like being barefoot.  Easy care in washer and dryer but construction on one of the 3 pairs fell apart early on.  I wear a 8.5W-9 shoe and the Large was perfect.  I have enjoyed how easy these are.  After washing they just tuck into the pj drawer :)  The price point is a little high, I think.  I will probably reorder these or something similar when the time comes."
4.0,"Got a hole in the knee the first time out. I’m giving a good rating because they seem well made and fit great. Docking one star for the lack of reenforced knees and elbows. I mean, we didn’t buy our kids full body rainsuits because they like to sit quietly in the rain. I was able to patch the hole reasonably well with some gorilla tape and expect to get quite a bit more use out of them."
4.0,"The cut of this shirt is perfect. Slim but not so skinny it hugs my every feature. Loved it, then it shrunk in the wash. Still fits nicely around but sleeves are too short."
4.0,Liked the feel of it and  it goes with almost any color of pants perfectly. Excellent for fall and Springtime .
4.0,"Appears to be well made. The detail is wonderful, and is packaged as a very nice gift."
4.0,Its a nice bucle for the most part. Looks a bit rougher then the photo makes it out to be. But all in all good for the cost
4.0,"The belt is as tough as it looks. It take a a bit to figure out how to fasten it: I hadn't seen a belt that worked like this one before. It's pretty wide: depending on the size of your belt loops, you may have a problem threading it through them. It fits snugly for most of my pants but is too wide for a couple of them. It's probably not a belt you'd want to wear nearly all the time for nearly all occasions."
4.0,"This is a very comfortable skirt.  Zipper is in the back, side pockets are great for small items, but not a phone.  The jean material is comfortable, not too tight but stretches to hug.  I came back looking and . . . :-("
4.0,"My dress came quickly and it fit well and I was able to wear it for Mother’s Day. The only thing I didn’t like was the faint odor of the material. But now that it’s been washed, the odor is gone and I enjoy wearing it frequently."
4.0,Fit as expected. Good quality
4.0,They are see through and baggy in the front area. The line in the back doesn’t scrunch well
4.0,"Well I guess it is Mario but it is not the ones in the item description. Shame as I prefer the ones I ordered to the ones I got.<br />These slipper are great for the short winter season we get each year. Easy for kids to put on, grippy soles, easy to wash and easy to pack for a vacation."
4.0,I bought this for my fiance for Valentines Day. He loved it but the length of the arms were a little short for him. I would suggest buying one size up
4.0,I loved it however it was too small for my hands. I gifted it to my daughter and she loves it!
4.0,Color is gorgeous!
4.0,"EXCELLENT AND ALL OPERATING, GREETINGS FROM VENEZUELA"
4.0,Not well made for the cost
4.0,Just received. This sweatshirt is so cute
4.0,LOVE how thin these are!
4.0,This skirt looks super cute and flattering on. Def. on the shorter side but not uncomfortably short. Material is lacking.
4.0,I didn't think I was going to like it when I saw it in the package but once I put it on I was in love. Fabric fell nice on my body.  No complaints as of yet.  I'll update if my mind changes when I actually wear it out.
4.0,Chulisimo. Llegó en perfectas condiciones
4.0,"This is nice, but very small/narrow. I have a wide wrist and wore this with another rose gold bracelet, tried to &#34;layer&#34; it. My teen daughter likes it, so I'm going to keep it for both of us to use. Otherwise, I might have returned."
4.0,Had a few problems with it coming in broke but the seller got in touch with me and fixed everything so I would definitely recommend this.
4.0,"These are super plush and comfy although a little on the loose side.  I'm worried that once I break these in, they will be too stretched out.  I don't like falling out of my shoes so happy but hesitant about how long I&#34;ll be happy."
4.0,Arrived a day early which is a plus! But what i don't like is the bands don't stay on very well. Other than that its worth the pay
4.0,"I purchased this crossbody bag because sometimes you just don't feel like wearing a large bag. I wanted to be able to just throw something on and not have to worry about holding my kids hand on one side and trying to keep my bag on my shoulder on the other. This bag is very cute. Large enough for a phone, lip gloss, MK jet-set large ID holder and small set of keys."
4.0,"Is tight, is wool, it washed well. I use it to keep warm when running in the winter. I still manage to get air through it. I think these would be safer to use than face mask made of polyester and I’m not sure why more people don’t do that. Not that any facemask can do much to keep out a virus. If you can smell perfume, or smell anything, you obviously cannot keep out a virus. Most people are more worried about catching A virus than giving one so this doesn’t make sense."
4.0,"Wife is 5ft,5, 34dd bust and normally wears medium. Medium was too big in the shoulders and shirt left no gap in the middle for lace up. Sending back and ording small size."
4.0,As pictured and described.
4.0,"Comfortable and soft, just a tad too short for what I'd like but will be keeping it."
4.0,"These are really cute over-the-knee boots at a very reasonable price. They fit true to size and the heel height is approximately 5.25 inches. A little odd that the shaft of the boot has no structure, putting them on is more like putting on tall socks than like putting on shoes. They also don’t stay up very well when walking do to this unstructured design and tend to fall down a lot which is annoying, the ties don’t do much to hold them up. But the design does make them lighter weight and easier to pack than most other boots. They were delivered in a surprisingly small package. I’m giving them a four star rating though, mostly because they are really pretty and for such a low price."
4.0,"The skirt is so cute, but it runs a little small. I wear size 10/Medium in all skirts and pants. I had to move up to a large in this particular one.  I may be the ""make""."
4.0,a god price for nice warm hat .
4.0,This product fit perfectly
4.0,"little short for pant, good for skirt"
4.0,"These pants are so comfy and soft. The waist band is not what I expected though. It comes all the way up to right under my bra, and it’s not like a compression waist band. But overall I like them."
4.0,"I really like this watch. It's attractive, matches everything and doesn't look ridiculously large on my wrist. My only complaint is that the buckle loops didn't hold up well and are starting to fray and look a little ragged after a couple months of wear. Great buy though!!"
4.0,Ordered a size up and this is still a little small. I am busty and that’s definitely a hazard of the job. Probably lovely on petite women.
4.0,"This is a really comfortable sleep shirt.  I would have given 5*s but there is no label, no care instructions, and nothing on the product that verifies it is 100% cotton as advertised.  I washed warm and light heat drying and it seems to have held its shape and size."
4.0,Nice bangle with a sturdy clasp!
4.0,"I still like it but will make some alterations to it, i'm not too fun of the white puff ball's on the side of the top and the under slip can be seen with every step,  so that will get cut and re-hemmed to look more presentable"
4.0,"It arrived on time, but the condition wasn't the prettiest. It looked like the packaging was almost melted. However, the set was fine, no issues. The wrist run a little small, and I ordered up. My skinny 2 1/2 year old usually wears 2T, but got a 3T. He loves the PJ's and refuses to take them off. The only additional downside is the fading/cracking of print, but that's to be expected with constant wearing and PJ'S in general; just wish it lasted longer than 2 washes."
4.0,It's a little square fitting and the ends slightly roll up but feels great and looks good.
4.0,"Really cute shoes! The description says the shoes run large and to order a half size down, which is very true - the shoes run really large. I ordered a half size smaller (5.5) than what I would normally wear (6) and they were still way too big. Sent those back and ordered a size 5 and am happy with them!"
4.0,"Just received the wallet today, looks and feels wonderful, however it does not have a separate coin section, this is must for me.  Additionally, the credit card slots are a tad small and I struggled to place and retrieve my credit cards. I will return.<br /><br />Update, will keep the wallet, there is one zipper section which they refer to as coin section."
4.0,"Love this dress. It fits well overall and I got lots of compliments. It could have used one more button at the top, a little too low cut for me. I used a brooch to close it up a little more. Also, buttonholes not very well constructed."
4.0,Great quality and not thin like most tank tops.
4.0,"These are very comfortable hiking shorts. The waist is part elastic so they are flexible while hiking and climbing. The material is stretchable, also making the shorts comfortable for hiking steep hills and rock scrambling. They did shrink after washing and drying. The fit went from loose to snug, but still fit ok. They have plenty of pockets for phone, key, etc. They have two zipper pockets, great to keep things secure."
4.0,Customer service very helpful and necklace is beautiful.
4.0,I bought the navy blue floppy model and the shield attached fine for me.  It can get a little warm but a nice alternative to a mask ( still recommend keeping social distancing).  I get tons of compliments on it when wearing around town
4.0,"Nice for the price. But all wrinkle when I received. I gave it away,  packaging was poor."
4.0,"Ugly color, but a nice work shirt."
4.0,"Not too bad. Tight; meant to be used for compression after all. Does what it's supposed to do well. However, it could get about translucent when stretched a lot (eg. knee area when doing squats). I wear this over shorts so I'm not too worried about my butt showing."
4.0,I love the design and fit! The bustier is tricky to put on and it would have been easier if someone helps. I wore it to a 80's party with jeans and flats Madonna style!<br />Materials are good quality! I'm 5&#34;2 w bra size 34 B and waist 27&#34; the medium worked ! Small was too small for me!
4.0,"They're bicycle shoes, not bedroom slippers. They are comfortable and work in the clips. That's the best you can expect."
4.0,Come with a nice surprise headband
4.0,This product is longer than I expected so I had to cut it to fit into my wallet.  My fault I guess.  But it is durable and sturdy even after cutting one of the envelopes off.
4.0,"These are decent socks.  Well made and comfortable.  Not sure what size they were supposed to be as there was no size listed and no size given on the package.  FYI they are a woman's size 9 (at least that is what my daughter wears and these fit her very well).  My issue is with the odd saying. ""hany with my dogs""  either I don't understand or know slang (a very real possibility) or the meant to say ""hang with my dogs""  either way it is kinda odd.  Being socks I guess it really isn't important what they say but more that they are comfortable and these socks are indeed very comfy."
4.0,If you work in the summer sun all day these bad boys will do there job protecting your eyes. Real bamboo frame looks very sexy. Only problem being the tiny screws at the hing come out overtime not worry they come with a ting screw driver.
4.0,"I would say these are good value for money considering it works out to be about 2+ USD per tie. However on closer inspection the material is thin and some creases do show up on the tie when it is removed from its packaging. On the whole it is still a usable tie - as chances are, your colleagues and clients won't be able to notice the material of your tie."
4.0,I was really reluctant in buying this dress after reading the reviews. Per the reviews several girls who were much smaller than me ordered a XL. I wear an XL and sometimes 2X but I decided to give it a try because I really liked the sunflower print. I tried the dress on and it fits perfectly. My arms are pretty big so I could not fit the sleeves but I was able to detach pretty quickly with just a little pull. I have not worn this dress yet but it the perfect light material for a hot summer day. I will post a picture when I wear.
4.0,"Asian sizes don't convert to US sizes very well. Make sure you go bigger when ordering. I have a set of black bottoms that I use in place of the bottoms in this bathing suit so I just switch out when I feel like it. My problem area is my belly, so I have to order large enough to accommodate my belly but small enough for my tush. Shopping for a bathing suit is a nightmare for me, so I am grateful I have gotten lucky so far!"
4.0,"Painful legs, feet and ankles. Thank you and bless you"
4.0,These shoes are very comfortable. Definitely a deal with the price paid. The stitching around the top of the shoe was a little off
4.0,"The pants are a good material, but I would get a size up from normal. There is no give, so it was kind tight. I'm 5'9 and I got a large"
4.0,"What I find distressing is that I have only worn this sweater twice and the right sleeve is unraveling.  I will mend the sweater myself, but this should not have happened.  The sweater is thick, comfortable and warm.  I was attracted to having a sweater to keep me warm and have my cellphone handy.  The sweater will be an access to any wardrobe.  Be careful if you give as as a gift  and the same thing happens to you it<br />will be very  embarrassing.  I had intended to give as a Christmas gift but kept it for myself.😉"
4.0,I took the suggestions of other reviewers and ordered a size up.  My daughter is normally a 10.5-11 in kids and I ordered a 12.  They fit perfect.  They are very pretty.  Happy with the purchase!
4.0,wish the shorts fit better top was a little big but i weeved in a clear elastic band around the top and it stays up great
4.0,I got a 2xl not wanting to worry about shrinking and well it looks like a large so it definitely runs small
4.0,Runs a little small so order one size up. But my daughter loves them
4.0,Not very good combination of colors. Good for money
4.0,Very light and comfortable! The case smells like glue even almost a year later.
4.0,Run small for big guys
4.0,My son is very happy with the sandals and they look very nice.
4.0,As you can see in the pic there is little fuzzies that collect on this easily. Otherwise i love it and it is very comfortable. It is a little hard to install.
4.0,"I have a good number of backpacks in my household and I have different uses for each. Some of them I use for vacation travel. Others are good for taking hikes through the woods. But one style of backpack I was lacking is one made for business use and this need convinced me to get the Leather Architect Men’s 100 Percent Leather Backpack.<br /><br />This backpack is, indeed, made from genuine leather and it smells like leather, the way this material should. It does look cool and gets attention because, well, you just don’t see many leather backpacks. The fact that it is leather makes it good for those times when you want to present a professional look and would rather not carry a briefcase or laptop bag.<br /><br />With the design, I find it sufficient but it could be better. Take the pockets as an example. There are two small, pouch style pockets and a zipper pocket on the inside. The zipper pocket is good for holding, say, your wallet and it does zip shut to keep belongings secure. The two open pouch style pockets on the inside have limited use, however. I don’t have many things small enough to fit inside these and they do not seal shut.<br /><br />Another small issue on the inside is the lack of greater division. One simple improvement would be to have a divider of some sort to split the pack into more compartments. And while I don’t use this backpack for my laptop, it would be good if there were additional straps to hold a backpack in place.<br /><br />This backpack is referred to as a men’s backpack and I’m not entirely sure why because, at least to me, it seems rather feminine in design and appearance. Anyone can use it, really, and so far, my wife has used it more than me. The outside straps make it comfortable to wear on your shoulders and the handle on top works when you want to carry it as a bag. As I said, it does look and smell nice and it’s certainly good enough to recommend. Better interior design would increase my rating to five stars but as it stands, it is still worthy of four stars and a recommendation."
4.0,"Love the look and feel of this swimsuit, I bought it only for the top as I already have bottoms but the top was some what BIG! It fits but the cups are big and the fit around my chest could be smaller. Haven't worn it in the water, bought it for my daughters birthday party in a couple weeks. But I still love it.<br /><br />Update: decided to return for smaller size. But its prime so returns are free!"
4.0,LOVE THE PRINT!<br />Quality not as good as other brands. Waistband is narrow and tight.
4.0,Very nice.  I’ve worn it everyday for the last month and it hasn’t tarnished. Does constantly turn upside down. But for the price not too bad.
4.0,A little too big on the just area
4.0,i dont like that it isnt as described in the title. This is a box chain not a ball chain and it isnt white gold or 925 silver. in the photo look at the clasp. See the separation? Real jewelry doesn't do that.
4.0,Comfortable and breathable. They do run big.
4.0,"I like this a lot, I have had many compliments but I had to put clear polish on the backside because it gives me a sore where it comes in contact with my skin."
4.0,This is so cute! It is a cheaper material so I wore a slip underneath so it wasn't see through! It's worth it for the price.
4.0,"Great fit! Keeps my boys in place with no ride up in the nether region. Could use a fly though, so as to make relieving a bit more easier. I wear a 32 waist and ordered the medium."
4.0,It is an adorable jumpsuit. If my granddaughter were a little bit bigger the jumpsuit would fit her nicely. She is smaller than average.
4.0,"A better more formal looking buckle would make it more useful, but it sheds water well. I use it kayaking with hybrid shorts so I can attend meetings afterward."
4.0,"I like this dress a lot. it was a bit bigger than expected but I worked it, lol."
4.0,Good but not for price
4.0,"It was prettier in person, also a extra bonus with gift card and gift bag."
4.0,Well made canvas bag. I would have made it 5⭐️ But my 13.3&#34; pc fits just a little too snugly. Needs to be a little roomer.
4.0,"Works okay, the ones at the gym world work just as fine in my opinion.  I notice they do slide a bit..."
4.0,"Los estoy usando, pero no fueron de mi total agrado. Voy a seguir usándolo para ver qué beneficio resulta. Se me hizo de muy baja calidad en el material."
4.0,"Not really tote. This handbag look bit small but I like nice name and genuine leather, though. So I kept it. 😍👌😘"
4.0,Fit is decent however arm holes are a tad more spandex than necessary creating more hug to the arm and not as flattering of a fit. I still like it tho! Just make sure you are expecting a spandex/stretchy blend and not just cotton
4.0,"Feels substantial (weight/feel) and it operates well.  Good idea, and good execution.  And it helps your FICO (credit score) by disposing of active cards!  I believe it is worth trying."
4.0,"I like it but the instructions are poor. Can someone tell me how to set the correct day of the week? If I had instructions, I would like it very much."
4.0,Very cute dress. Fits as expected. Good price.
4.0,So far it looks like a good value.
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; about 140lbs and typically wear a size 8-10 in jeans so I purchased a medium. The skirt fits a bit loosely around my waist and hips and the material does have a nice amount of stretch. If I were to purchase again, I would go for a smaller size, but this is going to be perfect for Halloween. The material is very nice and the zipper is of decent quality. This is the second skirt I have purchased from this seller and I have yet to be disappointed."
4.0,I bought this shirt for my wife and she said it was comfortable. After a couple of washes she said it hasn't shrunk.
4.0,"I bought this shirt in a size large and it was bigger on me, but looked great for photos as Mahito! The material is quite comfortable but is definitely more suited for warmer weather, especially with the open left sleeve design. My only gripe with the shirt is that the inside lining is white which sticks out slightly in photos. Otherwise, the shirt is great!"
4.0,Haven’t taken it out the packaging to wear yet I just hope after a few wears that the clear band don’t turn yellow because of sweat or if I apply lotion/body oil before wear
4.0,I'm happy I got them.
4.0,"Beautiful color , true to size ."
4.0,They fit.  Have not had the chance to ride with them yet.
4.0,Nice casual shirt to go out with friends for drinks or dinner. I like how it has the pockets in the front. It fits nicely and it is very stylish. I usually wash it first before I wear my clothing. I thought it came out fitting better after the wash. Since there's cotton in the fabric expect some shrinkage after you wash it.
4.0,"I bought a TON of shape wear to see which worked the best. These were the only ones that gave me a cute bubble butt instead of flattening my entire mid-section like a granny. Overall these gave me the prettiest silhouette!<br /><br />Con: the crotch area is like a half inch wide! It’s like a g string in the front and I’m afraid of .. (whatever the opposite of camel toe is….side seepage?) This is the only part that’s not comfortable.<br /><br />That being said, these are still the best ones. They’re not too tight, they look natural, and they completely eliminated my muffin top. I wish they widened the crotch area to an adult size vag but will still keep them!"
4.0,"Camouflage prints are one of my most favorite designs, but I ultimately gave these pants 4 stars due to the sizing running large and because the drawstrings are way too long. Not being baggy would’ve been perfect, but I still like these jogger sweatpants."
4.0,the only issue i found was that the sleeve length is a bit short. I'm 6' 4&#34;  and the sleeves are about 2 inches too short. other than that its a good light coat. ill just find some fabric to sew on and make it longer.
4.0,"I wear these hiking and really like them...especially the extra padding in the heel.  The only issue is that they are quite snug.  I wish they were a bit larger.  I wear an 8.5 sneaker or 9 hiking boot.  They fit my daughter great, she's a size 7 boot."
4.0,"Would be nice if it had a loop in the neck to hang it up easier, but not a huge deal. The material feels nice, has held up well for being used two or three times a week for the last six months"
4.0,The turtle necks were both as expected but neither have a tag in them so it’s hard to tell which side is the front or back.
4.0,Theses were fun and easy to wear
4.0,"The fabric was a nice quality, thicker than I expected.  I am a solid medium but I ordered this in a large and it just fit.  Overall— good quality for a good price. I purchased this to wear to  golf on  days when it’s a little chilly."
4.0,I didn’t expect these to be as nice as they are!!!  My sisters are going to love the earrings I plan on making them.
4.0,"The shoe itself is amazing! Good quality shoes, but the cat faces on front- they aren’t the best. One of them fell off, and no matter what I use (I’ve tried double sided tape, regular tape, and hot glue) it won’t get back on. The other is also cheaply taped on, but it hasn’t fallen off. The are very thick so I’m not sure if I will be able to sew them to the shoe. For the price, they are a pretty good buy if you know how to get the cat face back on!"
4.0,Back pockets are way off.<br />Bit snug on waist.
4.0,Comfy pjs. Shirt is shorter than pictured.
4.0,"Cute earrings for the price.  If the light hits them just right, the cubes sparkle.  The pearl dangles freely, which is good.  The only down side is that the &#34;gold&#34; has a pinkish tone and, in my opinion, could never pass as real gold.  For those who are wondering, they are just short of an inch long (7/8&#34;), and the round top part is 3/8&#34; across.  I have not worn them yet, so I can't speak to whether or not they irritate my ears."
4.0,Cute style just to baggy for me.
4.0,"I wear size medium, but it runs little small through the chest."
4.0,Not perfect but good value for the money.
4.0,"The item is well made, and my iPhone 6 Plus fits inside. I don't like the way the card slots are situated. They are inside of a pocket, and it is difficult to find which card I want, because I cannot see them. . I also don't like that there isn't a special place for your driver's license, so I just put mine in one of the slots for credit cards. I wish it had a place for it with clear plastic over it so you can see it without removing it. I am going to keep it, mostly because my phone fits in it,"
4.0,"I thought these were cushiony but they made my toes too tight in shoes so I decided to cut a good chunk off the end to make it like a 3/4 insole. It didn't work. When I walk, I can feel the ridge because they are so thick. So I can't use them anymore. Good luck, these are thick!"
4.0,These are super cute and looked adorable on my daughter but should probably be avoided for babies with bigger heads as the material is scratchy and leaves indentations.
4.0,I got this for my sister's wedding. I ordered a size up and it fits really well. The fabric for the bodice is different than the skirt but I'm going to wear a belt which will help with that.
4.0,Make sure you use their measurements. My son has rectangular shaped glasses and they measured slightly under their size small. They were true to size and the best most comfortable we've tried yet. Wish we had gotten the mirrored lens. They are better for sports and glare from water when fishing. The next best we found were Brims clip ons. They clip to any size baseball cap & are adjustable.
4.0,Read a few other reviews that said product ran big in size. I was nervous ordering 0-3 bc LO is 5 weeks and growing fast!! But when arrived it looks more to be a 3-6 m which I am happy for since it's a deer seasons coming quick gift for my husband!!!
4.0,Works well for a smooth appearance under leggings.
4.0,My son loves these. Good quality and fit. He's thin and it is usually difficult to find pants that fit him correctly.
4.0,These are gorgeous however they arrived defective but seller was very kind and is sending me a new pair.
4.0,"Everything is great quality, I gave a 4 star because bow tie isn't attached it came safety pinned to the outfit!"
4.0,"This is a decent nylon wrist band.<br />Overall, the quality is quite amazing for the price. The wristband does seem a bit thin, but this should not be an issue with durability. I did notice that the end of the wristband is melted to keep the edges from fraying. I have not had an issue with this coming undone, however it does worry me a bit. Regardless, for the price, this wristband is nice to add some variation to your wrist watches.<br /><br />Note: I originally bought this hoping they would fit my Moto 360 gen 1. However, the nylon band is slightly too thick to function correctly."
4.0,"It's made cheaply, although that's to expect for the price. I'll probably have to get a new chain for it. Still cute though :)"
4.0,"Cute hat and bathing suit, my only complaint is...I wish it had a string to tie under the chin so it wouldn't fall off my lo head"
4.0,"Great product, (as is typical with AC underwear) however if you have larger thighs the openings will take some time to adjust"
4.0,"I was amazed at how these actually work.  I have a prescription for glasses but don't want them so I figured I would give these a try.  These could put eye doctors out of business.  I would get two pairs though because they do break rather easily especially the knobs to adjust the focus.  These things are really good and saved me from having to go out and spend $500 on prescription glasses I wouldn't wear anyways.  The Amber tint actually helps you night driving vision and while they aren't great looking, they get the job done.<br /><br />They really need to improve the adjustment knobs and maybe the design of the glasses into different styles.  I already broke this pair and guess I will have to just order another one or two.  That's the only reason this isn't 6 stars because they work remarkably well."
4.0,The material is perfect for working out or every day wear. It is a little small unless you like a tight fit. I would go up a size for movement
4.0,"This top was beautiful and i was so sad to have to send it back.  I sized up for a more flowy fit but it still didn't fit right.  it's a very straight cut, so even though it fit in the bust, it was way too tight in the hips.  it doesn't stretch, so there was no way I could wear it"
4.0,seams split but it makes a good decoration
4.0,I like this product for some of the good reasons. First it is very light. Secondly it is smooth. The quality of the product is worthy. And I like the elastic part in the button which keeps your cloth attached to your body.
4.0,"Very warm, but they slide down constantly when worn. I constantly have to pull them up and adjust them."
4.0,"lovely dress, i bought mine in heather charcoal and it's fabric is so soft"
4.0,Bought this for a summer wedding in hopes I could easily breastfeed in it and it was perfect! Very lightweight and easy to discreetly feed in. 4 stars because the fabric is a little see through.
4.0,Very nice slippers. They were a little stiff at first but broke in quickly. Super comfortable and not too hot like many slippers.
4.0,I was happy with my purchase
4.0,The eye part was bent when I got it so part of it sticks to your eye. If your wear lashes it’s very uncomfortable. The lettering is nice and clear but on a couple of them you can’t see what the bottom say because it is stitched up. That sucks!
4.0,Great looking costume but sized a bit small for an adult male across shoulders. Fit adult female true to size. Great quality and an excellent price!
4.0,"They are beautiful, but a little heavy for me.  Only wear them a short period of time but have gotten compliments on them"
4.0,"It fits like a bathing suit, what else can I say? I do love the retro style of these because I'm into the pin up era and I love that kind of style. It is a little tight around my stomach, but I never really lost the pregnancy weight around there after having my daughter. The bra part of it is way too small though (I'm a 38DD-DDD, depending on the bra). And it doesn't support my boobs. I ended up buying a NuMe bra for more support. But I really do love the suit."
4.0,It scratches easily but other than that it’s great
4.0,"LINEN DOESNOT STRETCH.  I DID GET IT ON.  I REALY LIKE IT BECAUSE I KNOW THE LOOK, THE STYLE.  VERY EUROPEAN... WILL WEAR WITH MY DENIM JACKET AND LOW HEEL OR BOOTIE  (I DONT LIKE TO SEE MYSELF COMING...SO I WILL ORDER SOMETHING ELSE, ALSO I AM A SEAMTRESS AND I COULDNOT MAKE THIS FOR THIS PIECE)  ALSO I  AM BIGGER THAN YOUR LARGE IN THIS FABRIC....BUT IT FITS GREAT...I AM 5'4<br /><br />WILL ORDER A DRESS NEXT<br />THANKS,<br />COWOJO"
4.0,This stud is the perfect size if you are looking for something small and the curved post does keep the stud securely in your nose. I also like that it is easy to clean with a quick wipe with alcohol. This was a great purchase for the price.
4.0,Beautiful little cross body bag but just a bit bigger than I thought.
4.0,The dress itself is great albeit the difference between size S & M is fairly (too) large around the chest.
4.0,"Got the light beige set and it is a great material and looks very nice! It is a little see through for me atleast, I ordered XL because I carry a lot of junk in my trunk but I gave 4 stars because I wish the top was a L and the bottoms were XL but no mix n match option for sizing is 👎🏽"
4.0,Looks good. It's obviously shinier in the picture than what you get in real life. Hope it shines and lasts long enough
4.0,Looks a little different in person but high quality.  I can see spaces between the pearls and was great is they were bigger than I thought and I LIVED that.  I love them
4.0,Will take on vacation with me
4.0,I purchased a pair for myself and my sister.  The leather feels really nice  The lining is soft.  My sister has really long nails and was very happy that the fingers were long enough to accommodate her nails.
4.0,"They are very cute.  I don't see them lasting a long time, but none if this stuff ever does.  I am sure it will make it through the holiday weekend."
4.0,Cute but a little cheaply made period stretches out really easily
4.0,This dress is an easy summer choice you could dress up or down in summer but it’s too long.  It would be great if they offered a petite option for women like myself who are 5 feet 4 inches tall.  Love that it has pockets and the material is very soft.
4.0,This dress has some problems but I still love it. It is soooo comfortable. Everyone I work with asked me where I got it and wanted to get their own! Now for the problems... It is a little clingy because of the material and shows things I don't want ppl to see. The elastic waist is also not stitched very well so the elastic is literally sitting on my skin in places and if it gets wet at all it leaves weird water marks. I don't expect that it will last long.
4.0,The dress is beautiful and I love the fact that the material stretches with you. It fit a little more snug than I expected. Because of the stretch material still looks great! A very good buy.
4.0,Bought these for a 6 year old who wears size 12.5. They are easily 1- 1.5 sizes too big and they are wide.  She loved them did not want to let them go so I will be exchanging them.  The quality is very nice but be warned the sizes run large.
4.0,"I bought this for my ring bearer who is not quite 4 yet (ordered a 4T). The length of the jacket and pants are a little long and the jacket is kind of boxy, but he is such a skinny kid. It will do and hopefully he will grow into it more over the next 5 months. The quality is nice enough. I'm not sure if it would stand the test of time if worn a lot, but will definitely work for this. The shirt does seem a tad thin.. but that is easily replaced. Overall, very pleased."
4.0,I really like this watch and bought a 2nd one. The problem i have had with both watches is the 2 bands that hold the strap down keep sliding away and the strap is not secured and flaps. Otherwise I would give 5 stars.
4.0,Beautiful swimsuit but it is not made for short waisted women.  I'm 5'1 and it was way too long.
4.0,It's ok. Not as big as I would like but worth the money...
4.0,"Awesome pack of affordable tie clips. I've gotten many compliments about them. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but I would love to have seen a different shade or two. They all look the same after a while."
4.0,"I don't know how they got this model to look cute and fashionable in these shorts. These are very blouse, generously cut and fitting shorts due to the gathered elastic waist band. The pockets (4 of them) are all quite shallow. The fabric is a mid-weight cotton blend. By mid-weight, read heavier, thicker and not stretchy. You probably won't miss not having stretch because the style of the shorts ae so blouse! To me, these seem like pull-on ""mom shorts."" I still gave them 4 stars because they really aren't that bad. The fabric is comfortable. I don't like tight clothing and these shorts are breezy! I just don't think they are particularly flattering. I will wear them for hanging around my home on the weekends."
4.0,"I treated myself for a near life event.  I wanted a chronograph that wasn't too, too.  I like the near white face and the tachymeter."
4.0,"Love the dress, but it does seem like a lot of material.  I can take it in a little on the sides.  Very comfortable overall and  breathable cotton.  It shipped quickly too!"
4.0,bonito traje de baño
4.0,"Very comfortable!  Love the material & overall fit, just didn't like the length. Was a bit too long for me even with heels!"
4.0,Great design and wonderful material but order a size up.
4.0,"My wife's review - Decent fit, a little snug around the waist (so creates a bit of a muffin top - I'm 5'5&#34; and 135 lbs).  When the sun hits them they have a gold shimmer to them (black color).  To get them to &#34;stay up&#34; I usually put on lotion when I know I'm going to wear them.  They've been through the washer and coolest setting on the dryer several times and have held up well."
4.0,It was great a bit cheap but very nice.
4.0,"Super cute , cheap material but really cute"
4.0,Great quality and good looking product.  The only reason I gave it 4 star is because the selling price is a dollar higher than the OEM recommended retail price on the product tag?
4.0,Es de alta calidad
4.0,Not much cushion and it felt like you are walking on the ground
4.0,I love the dress everything fit right I felt sexy in it n got a lot to compliments. The material was soft n flexible not too tight just perfect. The only thing I would like them th work on is that fact that everything showed for underneath. I wore black undies but the print of everything still showed. I think maybe it the colour I bought apricot pink that made every showed but still love it.  Yes I would but other colours in it.
4.0,"Cute shirt, but just a little snug/"
4.0,Very comfortable. Great quality. Received quickly
4.0,I thought the material was thicker but it is thin almost see thru but it is nice still
4.0,"the belt its not attached, you have to sew it"
4.0,"Although the shamrocks were a little smaller than I expected, these glasses are super cute and playful."
4.0,Nice bra but not a running bra. Very comfortable and soft for around the house.  (38c)
4.0,Size down. Bought as a gift for my son and it’s a little big. The legs poof out which make them look a little funny. Overall they’re fine for what we’re using them for but I wouldn’t buy them as a gift for anyone else.
4.0,The product looks like a crdit card and very well made does not bend. The writing is very small but its a nice item.
4.0,"The pictures don't do justice to this skirt. It's so beautiful. Luckily the smaller size that I intended to order was unavailable at the time of my purchase because it would have been way too small. My child wears a 2T/3T bottom, and the size large (5-8 years) fits perfectly and maybe just a little snug.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this skirt. I probably could've ordered one size bigger but I like the fit.
4.0,I just received these bands and love them but there is a bit of an issue I have with them … look at photo you will see they stick out on the sides … guess I ordered the wrong ones … I have a series 6 (I think) … I still love the colors
4.0,Nice shirt but it ran a little small. My son wears 3x and it was a little snug but 3x was the largest size
4.0,pretty buying another to make set lol.
4.0,Super cute and well fitted!!  Back strap tire after first wear though
4.0,Ladies vest 5 not 4 buttons and the extenders go on backwards.
4.0,loved it was sexy and perfect fit
4.0,"Very cute! Slightly see through which I guess I should have expected, nice light breathable material. Flower is harder to see through than the black part so I'll have to manipulate it so people can't see parts of my swim suit I don't like."
4.0,"this necklace had some weight to it, if you like skulls, i however returned it caquse after I bought it I changed my mind about wearing a skull necklace, maybe for halloween but not for everyday wear"
4.0,Definitely worth the money. They are pretty sturdy but I recommend getting a  size larger.
4.0,Bought the dress to just though on over my swimsuit after swim with my sons. Works and fits great. Love having pockets.
4.0,Excelentes!
4.0,"At first it seemed too small but thanks to all the differnet pockets you can put a great deal into it, and it still looks small and cute. So very handy and ladylike."
4.0,Very elegant. Nice material
4.0,These are great kids love them and they are much cheaper than you can find in the store.  They don't last all that long and the elastic part that wraps your finger comes off all the time however for the price I don't mind. I would buy again!
4.0,If I had paid more I would have expected more padding. But it works as expected. Mine weren't broken. Followed the instructions I saw on QVC for the name brand type. They're fine. Fit in my coat pocket and no hat hair.
4.0,"Six Piece Turquoise Ring Set comes in their own unique style, and designs, sizes.<br />You can actually wear them on different fingers, and a couple you can wear on your first joint of your finger.<br />Just give you example of how the rings would fit ,my ring finger is a size 9 and only a couple of the Rings do fit the others do not.<br />When I tried putting on one of the rings it snapped a part instantly, I wasn't expecting that at all, and kinda disappointed. That's why I'm only giving them 4 star's.<br />I hope you find this information helpful in your buying decision. I received this product for a discount in a exchange of my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I love it! Great value for $9. The crystals have different colors in them depending on the light and viewing angle: gold, brown, copper. I wear it on the same arm as my brown watch. They look great together. The metal color is a medium brown....I'd call is maple. Bracelet width is about 3 mm. Would work well in a stack as well. Give it a try."
4.0,"The description for the Picaso purple scarf says 'light purple'.  Yep, it's more like lavendar and lilac, with yellow counter color, black outlines for the artwork.  Very little red, very little blue.  So the picture is way too dark, and shows more blue than is in the scarf.<br /><br />Another difference:  the material.  Scarf is striped with satin and some sheer material.  The sheer material is threadbare, but attractive.  Almost like fabric backing (very visible weave), but soft.<br /><br />Even so, it's cute.  You can drape it over your front and cover your front with it.  Thus you could tuck it under your jacket, making a 'collar' out of the part of the scarf which is by your neck, with the rest of the scarf crossed over your bodice.  Or, just wear it like an open scarf, a looped tie, etc.  It is sized as stated in the product description.<br /><br />The Brown version is also not like the picture, much lighter and more beigey.  What appears as slate blue in the picture, is really a bluegrey.  The flat green is reasonably accurate, but again much lighter than the picture shows.  So again, its colors don't fit what I thought I was getting, but I'm not unhappy.  Else, the 'brown' version is made of the same material as for the 'purple'.<br /><br />For both, the artwork is only one way.  So if you wear either scarf in full and in front, one of the 'men' in the Picasso style is upside-down, and the other is right-side up.  You can't make the scarf show them both, right-side up.<br /><br />Scarves were folded small in shipping (tyvek wrapper by USPS), but they were not wrinkled.  So could be worn the same day."
4.0,"after reading the reviews i decided to order an L, Its a little loose and i probably could have gone with a medium, but its not a bad fit for an everyday kind of wear. if i planned on using it for working out/running i would definatly need a medium to keep the a bit more secure."
4.0,"Very nice shirt. We ordered up a size thinking he could grow into it, since he’s a fast growin. 9th grader and the shirt ended up fitting like a glove. He’ll outgrow it too fast.  We’re debating on returning it. He likes it so much and they’re sold out of the size he needs, so we might keep it anyways. Nicely made."
4.0,"Lovely and thick, it's adorable. I did go for the large , I wish there was an extra large as it's very form fitting (as pictured), so I think it might be best to size up. I typically wear a M/10 but I'm large breasted so I sized up."
4.0,The quality is good and it feels like this hat will last a long time. My only disappointment with it is that the top kind of bulges on the sides when on my head. I'm not sure if maybe it's meant to be pulled down further or maybe is for a larger head size but it is just a random annoyance to me. Nice stitching and always happy to rock the Mushroomhead logo!
4.0,Cute dress. Kind of thin
4.0,Really cute and comfy. Runs small get a sizer bigger.
4.0,I love how these Jean's feel. They're not heavy they're light. They are high waisted which is what I wanted. The only reason i took off a star is because i ordered the next size up which is recommended in the description but it's too big around my waist
4.0,"The packing cubes are nice and will help with packing for business travel.  The only gripe I had was in the packaging for shipment.  They were all in what looked like an old, discolored plastic bag that had holes in it (like it was up against a heater or something).  Really bad presentation, but at least the cubes themselves didn't appear damaged."
4.0,"Nice shirt, pretty decent quality, looks nice, but the only thing one of the letters in Logo on the back of the shirt was kinda faded but other than that good product."
4.0,"Love the top, bottoms too small. Looking for another substitute for bottom so can still wear top."
4.0,This belt it’s nice for the price I’t didn’t have a stamp like the original coach but looks nice
4.0,"Beautiful dress, jest bigger than the table Measure recommends"
4.0,Durable visor
4.0,Super cute fit in the belly but the arms and under the belly was a little to big.
4.0,Purchased for a photo shoot<br />5'5&#34; and 165lbs.... purchased a medium and it was perfect. The shirt was sexy! Gave 4 stars because garment was thin and stitching could have been better but overall a nice outfit
4.0,"Good poduct, fas delivery"
4.0,I should have ordered a size up. The shorts fit well but the top was too snug around my bust. I will probably still use it to lounge around the house or for bed. The material is different than what I expected but not bad at all.
4.0,"soft and comfy, slightly fitting but still fits well"
4.0,"I ordered these earrings because they resemble a similar style by a popular Luxury Designer. These earrings are a very close dupe and look great! I'm used to this style, so had no issues putting them on. They're very lightweight and comfortable. My lobes are very sensitive and I had no ill reaction to the metal.<br /> -<br />*Thanks for reading my review. I hope it helps make your decision easier*"
4.0,"Good quality, but runs large. All three sizes I bought were one to two sizes bigger than the kids normal shoes (with same size as listed)!"
4.0,"Comfortable and well fitting, soft fabric"
4.0,"I bought these dress as a prime day deal in my normal size and it was too big. I am 5'1, 110lbs and bought an XS. It was too big around and way too long. I read some other reviews saying that it shrinks so I thought I'd take a chance and it did! It now looks great with wedges (still too long for flats) and fits much better around. I will say the tie is weird since it's not real and could probably be removed but I do love the style and pattern so I will keep wearing it!"
4.0,Love the feel of the material.  Makes me feel pretty.
4.0,"Agree with others.  This has a well made feel, fits as epected and is a great value."
4.0,Darling shoes! My granddaughter loves them and wont wear anything else.
4.0,I wanted and ordered clear. I got tinted sun glasses. I kept them anyway. They are not UV protected so I have to be careful when wearing them.
4.0,"I have searched high and low for some form of back pack organization. This allows me to keep all my cords untangled and separated and I can find something I am looking for right away. Love it... but, it does seem like the elastic cords are losing some of their shape. I suppose that comes with use."
4.0,"Very impressed with the look, fit, and presence of this hoodie. The only thing that could use a revision is the stitching."
4.0,I love the idea but once it was advised to wear masks with a filter this gaiter wasn't effective but I love it as a headband.
4.0,I like it... affordable and easy to wear. Very light!
4.0,"The color and fit were beautiful, but the cup size AWFUL. TRUE TO SIZE. I'm a size 12, and ordered a size up to see, it was way too big. I ordered the correct size, but the cups did NOT fit, and I'm a 36D! They're made for like H size."
4.0,Love this! Looks exactly like picture only thing I must add is the fact that it looks a bit tilted when actually hung but other than that it's a great way to store jewelry
4.0,"Cute dress, fit like expected and the price was unbelievable!!"
4.0,Have to give to my sister. Item to small. Has some stretch but not alot. So make sure you go a size up. Overall nice dress. I give 4 stars because the dress is well made.
4.0,"Gloves are nice, but the finger tips don’t work on my phone when I try to text.  The primary reason for purchasing.  Overall a good pair of leather gloves."
4.0,My 12 yr old loves these and perfect for school.
4.0,Fits nicely and washes well. Plus it hangs at a nice spot to cover top of leggings.
4.0,"My last doppelganger of this hoodie lasted me 3 years and I wore it whenever the weather deemed fit. Finally faded, shrunk and with a ripped pocket, my cheap behind decided to grab a new one. Glad I did. This thing is to me what a comfy set of PJs might be to someone else. With summer approaching I'll have to hang it up and show off my fat belly but I look forward to our many days together when fall arrives again. Def worth the price and fits a bit baggy at first but after a few washes(and dries, which I'm avoiding at all costs cos I love it a little loose on me) it should fit a tad snugger on you."
4.0,"Too shining, but good quality"
4.0,"Very cute for Halloween costume, good quality fast shipping. If you are height challenged, I am 5'4"", these are super long.  Wasn't a problem though, I just cut off from the toe and stitched across to fit better, or I suppose you can just tuck the extra under your foot."
4.0,It’s a good replica but several differences compared to the actual jersey depicted in the movie.
4.0,"These sunglasses are really cool. I went for a walk at night and wore the night vision glasses.  I could see so clear. It was helpfull for me because usually it's hard to see cars coming at night.  The sunglasses for during the day was great.  I wore them in the car and loved them ! Some times my sun visor doesn't work quite well, it actually sucks.  The glasses really helped keep the sun out of my face.  It comes with a really nice case which is not made cheap at all. Looks like a long lasting case. There is a string to hook the glasses onto. The only reason I knocked it down a star is because of the fitting.  I'm a woman.  The glasses feel like they were totally made for a man. I can still wear them.  They're just a little big.  Would be a great gift."
4.0,"This is a very good commuter or foul weather cycling jacket. However, it can get a little steamy if riding hard on mild days."
4.0,"You have to actually cut the band to adjust it. Therefore you only get one size and can't go back. Other than that, it's working great."
4.0,"I have started doing rock painting as a hobby and I have been having to use my reading glasses to do detail work.  I kept taking off the glasses, setting them down and leaving them by the sink (washing brushes) or on the table (painted rocks) or out on the patio (varnishing rocks).  I got this set to keep my glasses on me while I paint.  The multi colored chain is adorable and the beads are very small.  The black chain has bigger black balls and a couple huge ones that are right in the front.  I do not like the black because of the huge beads.  I love the multi colored ones so I am 50% happy with the set but 100% happy with the one that I like."
4.0,I like the design but it can be a little tight but it can be adjusted
4.0,"Super cute dress but very short. Mainly in the front. And I’m 5’3 so if you’re taller, definitely wear shorts underneath. Also the arms are pretty tight. I have broad shoulders so it’s expected. I got an XL, I’m 5’3 and 210 lbs."
4.0,This fit too long/loosely - I am petite so it's always a gamble when ordering online but this just didn't give the look I was hoping for
4.0,"I have received multiple compliments wearing this dress! It's beautiful and I feel good wearing it.  The fabric is soft, true to the color shown, and washes up well. The fabric is a little thin, and I had to wear a full slip under it. However, the thin fabric could make it more versatile for wearing in warmer seasons.  It's comfortable and has pockets, what more could thia woman ask for?!"
4.0,Absolutely love the feel of it!!!  I did order the XXL which fit me well☺️. I'm a size 13 with DDD
4.0,For the price couldn't beat them and they comfy. Not super warm even with all the wool lining soles of shoe are to thin maybe.
4.0,love these socks.  would order again from vendor
4.0,My daughter said she like it so I quest it's ok
4.0,"Great product, came in a timely fashion. Will buy again. 😁"
4.0,Bought this dress for a trip to Keeneland for the horse races. Liked the fact that it was a bit longer than other Belle Poque dresses I have ordered. Fit is a bit snug in the bust but the dress works well for an &#34;hour glass&#34; figure. I am 5'5&#34; and weigh approximately 165; I normally wear a size 12 in a dress and I ordered this in a large. The material gives and is very lightweight so the dress would be perfect for a summer wedding. Only negative was that the belt looked a little cheap even though it is the same fabric.
4.0,"The dress is pretty well made.  It looks just like the picture. It fit fine except the top. The top of the bodice is too long. There’s probably 3 extra inches at the top where the bodice meets the neck. You would have to be a giraffe neck for it to fit correctly. On the other customers’ pictures, I’m not noticing the extra material except one. So I think mine was just made wrong. I had to have it altered before I could wear it. Other than that, it’s very pretty."
4.0,It's really cute. Because the material is a bit heavier than I expected it is Just a bit small around the arms and neck but doable. Everyone thinks it's adorable though.
4.0,Best Totes umbrella I ever had.
4.0,"This is not a cotton tank, kind of that silky soft material. It is a happy medium between a ladies fit and a unisex fit. I like that the arm holes are not super low!"
4.0,good product that what i want!
4.0,Looks great and fits great as well.  My man wears a large in most brands and this fit him perfectly in a large.  But the texture is a little rough. Definitely not what you would want against your skin. We got this shirt for a photo session so thankfully he won't be wearing it long.
4.0,A very beautiful dress. The chest buttons are not over lapping fabric so I recommend wearing some type of tank top or bralet underneath. Fabric is quite thin and cheap. But overall a good dress for the summer
4.0,"Stretchy material, fits to the body (a bit snug), good craftsmanship, but overall I like the shirt."
4.0,really nice shirt! love working out in it
4.0,The product is a good product. The colors are beautiful. The only Bad thing I found with this product is they are slightly harder to get in if you don't know what you're doing.
4.0,I love the color. The only issue is the top doesn’t have a strong support at the waste. It could use some type of underwire. I’m afraid If I do any serious swimming I could lose it. I’m a 34DD so I NEED the support. I ordered a large to be safe although I’m a medium. It fits fine except for the lack of support. Also the bra pads are kind of weird. I may remove them as I’m not sure they are necessary or able to give me the support I need.
4.0,Yes I enjoy the bands very much!
4.0,Son loves them he is a sneaker head and this is a must.
4.0,It was for my daughter.  We received it on time. She looked great in it.
4.0,"It was too large in certain areas,  too tight around 1 arm and had frills sticking out throughout the dress.  Rated a 4 because it was a beautiful dress"
4.0,Cool necklace can't beat the price
4.0,"Right off, I was impressed by the fabric. My husband said, &#34;That's a good one.&#34; I agreed--the weight (unlike too thin, flimsy t-shirt-material) exudes quality. It's soft, solid.<br /><br />I was cautioned by reviewers that it runs a couple size smaller. I was planning on a long night shirt, so I ordered XXL, for a loose fit (normally I would wear L). As others have noted, this is a very form-fitting, and they were right. It looks flattering as a dress, curvy and sexy, but I would have wanted a tad looser for a night shirt.<br /><br />Mine was intact with the rhinestones, and the Paris/Eiffel design was gorgeous! Ooh la la! Super cute.<br /><br />Then I realized that, on the top against the white, were two brownish smudges (makeup?). Quality inspection (preparing shipping) was disapponting. If I were to wear as a dress (instead of sleepwear), I would have returned it.<br /><br />Overall, though, I am pleased with this."
4.0,I sized up a size for this dress based on other reviews and I'm glad I did. The dress was a little large that way but it was more comfortable that way since this dress will show your flaws in the tummy and hip areas. The only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is because it seemed to get caught on everything and you can see the thread pulled up so easily on the silkish material.
4.0,"The item had a small hole in one of the pockets, but overall a good item"
4.0,"The shoes have nice soft materials and it looks really nice.<br />comfortable to wear but don't the durability yet as I haven't worn it for too often.<br />The heel of shoes have only a 1/8"" thick rubber bottom and may get worn out quick. If they put in a 1/4"" thick bottom , then it would be great."
4.0,"I got this shirt for my daughter to wear. She thought it was perfect for wearing to D&D night.  When I opened the package, I thought the neck was going to be way too big. But, then I realized that it has a drawstring for making the neck smaller. Even so, it easily falls off the neck, so you have to get it cinched just right. Overall, it's a pretty shirt. It's fairly thin, so you'll want to wear an undershirt with it. You can wear it cinched at the waist or loose."
4.0,"A portion of the chain that was holding the hummingbird onto the larger circular, fell off."
4.0,These shoes are very cute and fit as expected. I’m usually between a size 6.5 and 7 and the 7 fits well. They are definitely made for more narrow feet. I love that you just zip them up the back- it makes them so easy to get on and off. They are not the most comfortable which is why I knocked off a star. They don’t have much support at all and the part that goes between your toes is stiff. I still recommend them though and will still wear them.
4.0,Very pretty and dainty. Would have given 4 stars but the ring attaching it to the necklace is large and makes it a bit odd.
4.0,Super cute but changes color quick
4.0,"I am 14, and love pocket watches. I was looking for a good one to buy that wasn't too expensive . . . Then I found this! It keeps great time, you have to wind it, but I think it's better than having to buy new batteries. It is very easy to set, wind, and use. I only have one problem with it (which is why I didn't give this 5 stars): When it came in the mail, the wooden box display had a long crack across the back of the top; I was a bit let down from that. But otherwise, the watch was in great condition, and so was the knife; they both work great! This a great buy, and the crack in the box was probably just a shipping error. This is a very nice watch, and definitely worth what you're paying."
4.0,"Bought these for our daughter’s birthday, she loved them, I do wish they came in a box or on a card display."
4.0,"Was comfortable until it gave me a camel toe. Also since it’s synthetic and a light color, when you sweat you can kinda see the wet marks."
4.0,"they came way sooner than i expected and look amazing, although they do start turning pink around the edges after too many wears. still, the bigger ones are adjustable and both the bigger and smaller rings are strong for looking so delicate."
4.0,These pants were great for a ten day BWCA trip into the wilderness. They dry fast and are very comfortable. They fit a little small in the knees so if I was sitting I had to hike them up to have some room to bend my knee and due to the way they fit I tore some stitching out in the crotch trying to step over a log. They did stretch a little bit over  extensive use and fit better after that. I had no thorns go through them and the zippers all held up well. I am tempted to buy another pair of these because I'll surely get use out of them.
4.0,Very good product looks Very well done. The the only thing I didn't like was the fake blood on the mouth and when it arrived it had a chemical smell to it from being wrapped up in plastic during shipment.
4.0,I am 5’4 and 130 lbs and Honestly it was a great cosplay. Although a little piece of the shorts (I hold dot) fell off when I put it on. I think the quality could have been a little better and the gold part of the hat was bent. I really like this cosplay.
4.0,Cute piece size is to large and I wear a size 10.
4.0,The soles coming out every time and my kids are not happy with it
4.0,"It's really thin, but the style is alright."
4.0,Pretty costume jewelry type airings. They are surprisingly very lightweight and they do come with both the rubber/plastic holders as well as metal ones.<br /><br />For the price I would say that they’re definitely worth it and I hope they hold up. They’re not too big and they’re not too small they’re definitely a lovely statement piece.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
4.0,Somewhat shorter at the knees height than what advertised
4.0,"Okay, I really really like this. Its comfy and lightweight but a big BUT be very careful washing it! I washed it with colors on a color mode in my washer and the ink died splotches all over my clothes. I had<br />To throw the entire load out. Wash alone!"
4.0,"Not the best quality for play, but it makes for a beautiful Christmas photo! The top of the dress was a bit big, it kinda hung off my daughter’s shoulders, but it was still very pretty on her. The bow was hot glued on the dress, and fell off almost immediately after I got it out of the package. We just pinned it back on."
4.0,Holds and fits everything perfect. Lightweight and compact. Love it !
4.0,Love there hats  just beautiful
4.0,Great shirts but I bought medium size and they were too tight for a friend who literally weighs 88 pounds.
4.0,I love this sweater! The only critique I have is that it is not as long as it is in the photo and if you wear any jewelry like bracelets or necklaces be very careful because the sweater snags on everything and pulls all the threads . So whenever I wear the sweater now I just don't wear any necklace or bracelet. But besides that this is really cute and colorful.
4.0,I really like this prop but the only flaw is that the mouthpiece falls easily. It’s easily fixed with super glue.
4.0,Very cute with leggings!
4.0,"I purchased the mask that said ""Vote"" on it.  The mask looked nice and had vibrant colors.  It fit fine.  The fabric was not as breathable as I would have liked."
4.0,Very nice slippers. Comfortable and soft. Would buy agaub3
4.0,"Younger kids cannot use track shoes with spikes in our area.  My 7year old used these to run sprints and filed events on gravel and clay tracks.  The cleats help up well, provided good support, and I am pleased with the fit.  Do not recommend walking on concrete to and from events because the nubs will wear out."
4.0,Very sturdy.  Wish it had a strap for the hand on the right side.
4.0,john deere hat arrived as expected and fits just great
4.0,"The material is thin, and almost see-through. I bought it for an event, but it ended up being too cold out to wear, so I returned it."
4.0,This mask is super cute but large. I couldn’t wear it and show the logo properly.
4.0,"Worked great for a 3 week trip to Asia, kept all my stuff organized and compressed"
4.0,Super cute pattern but the shirt is cropped.Might work for some kids but my daughter was uncomfortable because if the length. She is 5’4z Quality seemed OK. Not super soft but they still look comfortable. Had to return because of the length of the shirt.
4.0,"the ring setting is gorgeous.. but it has ""AMAZON"" written inside.. that totally blews the deal of...<br />we bouthg this ring for my brother in law girlfriend and that really put him down.. it was a great deal, but felt so bad when we saw the inscription inside....<br /><br />Oh well.."
4.0,Very cute shoe but it does run quite small in my opinion.
4.0,Nice shirt and excellent Color!!
4.0,nice robe for the price and very pretty.
4.0,"A-okay, but a bit thin, more than I expected but they are fine."
4.0,Shoes worn as part of a costume only
4.0,"This might be well suited to a large man or a person with a long face.  The color is beautiful and the material is kind of interesting - it's not just a soft cotton but it's not a scratchy polyester either, it's like a soft nylon/polyester/rayon type material.  The adjustable ear loops are great.  However, despite the fact that I'm a very large woman, this mask is a little too big for me.  I can roll down the side with the nose crimp and then use it, but otherwise it's so long in front it hits my eyelashes!  Overall well made and nice material, but oddly enough wish it was a little smaller."
4.0,"Love it, it is a little heavy but it's simple and nice."
4.0,I've been using this purse every day since I ordered it. It is big enough to hold everything I carry around with me and still have room for more. I especially love the different handles that give me options for how I want to carry it around. My only complaint is that some of the pockets have torn and can't be used anymore.
4.0,It is an awesome scarf. I bought the pink but it is orange. It is for a Christmas gift. I ordered the grey one. She loves grey.
4.0,I love this.. i gave it 4 stars because it was missing a green jewel when i got it
4.0,My wife loved the look and fit but thought it would get too itchy when trying to dance at a concert. Had to send back.
4.0,"Super soft, great quality and the color is exactly as pictured.  It fits as expected but is on the bigger side so if you are between sizes you can go with the smaller size.  I have it 4 stars because the zipper is plastic but it works great...just wish it had a metal zipper."
4.0,I like it. It suits my sister more than me. She loved it so I have given it to her. Wear it with a dress or top.
4.0,"I purchased the soundbot beanie as a present for myself for Christmas and I am fairly pleased with it. The sound quality is good and the ease of use really pretty great. Also, the connectivity to other Bluetooth devices is great too. My only complaint is the size. I'm 6'4&#34; and the beanie barely fits me. It is stretched to the limit when I wear it, and if my head were a centimeter bigger it would be too uncomfortable to wear. Still, I wish it were bigger anyway so I could be more comfortable."
4.0,"really pretty, but a little loose fit"
4.0,Great dress. Perfect fit.
4.0,"I love this wallet, cute, fits in most purses or can be carried alone. I made the mistake of keeping receipts in it for too long and the inner layer ripped a little bit. Still using although it is ripped"
4.0,"A gift for my 14 yo, He liked them but would have rather had the silver style."
4.0,"I love it, I’m glad I came upon this product, the material is wonderful and keeps me warm, thank you."
4.0,"It needs to be packaged better;  it was pretty crushed;  we had to spritz it with water and steam it.<br />Good look,  for the money."
4.0,Not as wide as I thought but it works!
4.0,I got the white case with feathers for my mothers 640 and she's has it for less than 2 months since use and the little piece that has the magnet is coming apart. It is creating a line where it folds and cutting itself loose. Too bad because this is a very pretty case
4.0,"So cute!  The item description says it's for short torso person. I am 5' and have short torso, it is a bit long."
4.0,Pretty little jewels
4.0,"These keep my hands really warm (almost too warm) even in negative temps. Downside, though, is the fit. They don't go far enough up the wrists so they always feel kind of awkward (like sagging your jeans). Also, the fingertips are way too long. I have to take them off in order to use my hands, defeating the purpose of wearing gloves. I can't use tools or pick things up or use my touchscreen with these. Great for keeping hands warm only if you don't plan on actually using your hands."
4.0,"I like them very much, and when I put them on they looks beautiful. I'm happy with my purchase and will recommend to others."
4.0,The fit is not too good but they are we'll made it look great I recommend it
4.0,"These are cute, fit exactly as expected and will be worn a lot."
4.0,"Very cute and item is exactly as described, however, the original packaging was opened and taped up when it was delivered."
4.0,It's cute but low quality. I dying expect it up hold up well.
4.0,"For $15 or so that I paid for the hat I can't complain.  At a distance it looks fine but up close you can see the ends of the threads and thread ends.  I don't normally wear hats but I'm assuming that a more expensive had would have better workmanship.  Again, for $15 it looks fine and seems to be of decent quality.  It did however arrived crushed so I looked online and was able to steam the creases out, thankfully."
4.0,I would give 5 stars but it's a bit too long everything else it's just right.
4.0,Comfortable and not ugly.
4.0,Likes this hat. I am a tour guide in New Orleans and bought it for my day time tours. It in flexible enough to fold and put in my bag.
4.0,Nice the baby's love it
4.0,"Nice quality, colour and fits really great."
4.0,"Pros: This is a nice-looking basic loafer. The materials are all man-made, but they did a nice job on the artificial leather look and it could easily pass for real leather until you touch it. The overall construction of the shoe seems to be good and I didn't notice any flaws or defects.<br /><br />Cons: The shoe runs quite narrow and a little bit long. I got a size up from what my son normally wears, thinking he would grow into it, but when it arrived we found it was just barely wide enough for him to wear right now, and it was also over an inch too long. So I would say unless your feet are very narrow, order a size up if you want to be able to put it on without squeezing your toes. If your feet ARE very narrow and you find that most shoes are too wide, this one might fit perfectly. The other con is that while the exterior materials and construction look very nice, the interior lining of the shoe looks and feels rather cheap, so I don't expect it to last more than 6-12 months before wearing some holes into the lining.<br /><br />Final thoughts: A good basic dress shoe that is best-suited to someone with very narrow feet."
4.0,I havnt opened them to see if the chain was real or anything. I bought these as a gift for two of my formers but other than that they look so cute!
4.0,Good comfortable dress
4.0,These overalls are SUPER ADORABLE!! I am 5&#34;1' 128 lbs and I ordered the size small. The length is perfect but they were just a little tight. Kind of wish I had ordered the medium and just rolled the legs up a bit more. So if you're between sizes it's probably best to size up. But they are nice quality and I still love them and wear them
4.0,"Nice glasses,  my son loves them,  only issue I have with them is when they are on my 2 year old son, the glasses stick too far back and hit the car seat causing them to sit away from his face.  as he grows that wont be an issue.  Giving it 4 stars because they are great glasses for the price,  but due to price they are cheap.  Would buy again, a solid product that was everything I expected,  cheap cost,  cheap price,  no worries if they break or get lose."
4.0,"I absolutely love these earrings. Not too big,  it too small. Great price!"
4.0,It's worth it I really liked it :) ...necklace is super short tho :/
4.0,"My first impression was: well, this dress look really cheap. However, once I tried it on, changed my mind. I think it looks really good, the problem is that I'm 5'10&#34; and wanted a really long dress that could cover my feet. So I'll have to return it."
4.0,So this item is very cute except that it's total Baywatch style and goes all the way up almost to your waist for the hip cutouts. I paired this with high-waisted jeans and I had to keep on adjusting because you could see where it was coming up to my waist that was showing my skin which look really awkward.  Other than that it fit perfectly fine it wasn't too tight I just wish that it didn't come up so high on the hips.
4.0,comfy and non-binding. I sleep in this too. :-)
4.0,The tie bar was smaller than I imagined it would be but I like it.
4.0,"I ordered the larger size, as suggested, and it fits fine."
4.0,"Arrived a litte earlier than I expected. Super cool! It's a big bag, but the option to zip up the sides definitely helps.  The inside seems a little weak for the material, time will tell. LOVE the overall bag."
4.0,Product as expected. However the delivery time was longer than stated.
4.0,Nice classic style and at a great price.  I can't wait to get my prescription lenses in them.
4.0,"I love this skirt! Material doesn’t feel cheap, burgundy color is dark and rich, length is more like a mini skirt. The skirt almost fit as expected but it is a tad snug from the waist so spanx to the rescue! For reference I’m 5’3 and 115 lbs. I’d buy again."
4.0,"Definitely runs small, but a beautiful glove. I'd go up a full size."
4.0,This was part of my son's Finn costume for Halloween.  Perfect color.  Perfect fit.
4.0,"These were almost perfect.<br /><br />They are very thick and warm. They also came with a long string attaching them to fish through your sleeves.<br /><br />Unfortunately the string quickly broke, and they are on the small side. I normally purchase size small adult or large youth in mittens. I would categorize these as a youth large before washing, and a medium after.<br /><br />While tight, they are still worth the cost."
4.0,"Cute but runs small.  I'm 5'7"" and medium were too short for my torso."
4.0,Soft and durable.
4.0,I am going to hem it a bit but the fit is great. I'm only 5'2 1/2&#34;
4.0,"Favorite belly ring. Very cute and you can always see it. Only bad part is the bar is short because the bottom beads threading is so deep. It was only irritating when my piercing was still healing, now that it's healed there's no problem at all."
4.0,Great to wear for workouts & leisure.
4.0,"Fits as expected, looks really cute and made well.  It probably would have stayed cleaner if it wasn't so fluffy, son liked it when we baked cookies."
4.0,"I wear a size 8 to a size 8 1/4 fitted New Era hat for comparison. I have a big dome, and these glasses fit very nice! The materials do feel a bit on the cheaper side, but if you take care of your stuff they should hold up nicely. Have thought about buying second pair."
4.0,Looks like a good watch for $20 ....<br /><br />the bracelet looks and feels cheap .<br /><br />But hey ..it's cheap priced too .
4.0,not very stretchy - i would recommend ordering the next size up because there's not a lot of give.  But still very comfortable.
4.0,Hat fits well thought the material would have been thicker but still satisfied
4.0,It works like it should and it smooths my back out but after about an hour it begins to get a bit uncomfortable but I just deal with it because it serves it's purpose .
4.0,These compression socks were comfortable and I loved the fun styles!
4.0,Love the dress! She wore it to Disney for a VIP Star Wars Tour! Everyone was in love! The only issue I feel is the color! The vibrant orange. black and grays faded in the wash! It is still very wearable just not as bright and fun!
4.0,Bought size 3-6months and it is right on my 1 1/2month old.. he is not a huge baby either
4.0,"Love these glasses! Gave it 4 stars only because quality isn't perfect! But for price, THEY ARE AWESOME! I get so many compliments in pictures, they give a super sleek look to your outfit!"
4.0,The boots are stylish and comfortable.
4.0,The fit was small. For a 2X.
4.0,"This dress is really nice. It appears to be well made of good materials. I am 5'7&#34;, 34c, 150lbs, a large fell probably 2 inches below my knees and there is a little extra room. I can pull it over my head with out unzipping it. I carry my weight around my hips and love handles, probably could have gotten a medium because there is a little stretch in the fabric. True color, the light blue is really pretty. The only down side is that it is hand wash/hang dry only, or recommended dry clean."
4.0,Sweater material and color is very nice. I am 5'5&#34; and about 160 lbs and ordered the XL. It fits nice open with a light shirt underneath but I have not washed it and hope it doesn't shrink.
4.0,They're nice for the price!
4.0,"Very pretty but not the size I was looking for, so I'm returning them."
4.0,"hilarious.  8 y/o son says it's too itchy, so idk how much use he'll actually get out of it<br />took FOREVER to get"
4.0,"The goggles fit well, no seeping of water into the eyes. There is no fogging and you can see clearly under water. Happy with the purchase"
4.0,It would nice if they were all black or no reds and a tiny longer but they are super comfortable and made of cotton. I can't wear polyester.
4.0,"It's an alright shirt that fit pretty well originally but after one wash and dry (cold water and low heat) it became noticeably smaller. Otherwise, pretty standard cotton shirt. Comfortable but not the softest shirt in your closet."
4.0,"I love this bracelet! It was exactly what I was looking for! My wrist is just a little more than 6 inches and it fits perfectly, not too tight but not too loose. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that the silver is rubbing off, I guess that’s to be expected for the cost and if you wear it everyday like I do. I was just hoping it would have lasted a little longer, I’m still wearing it for now though!"
4.0,"This belt fit perfectly!<br />And looks great.<br /><br />Although, it has a gold buckle, so when i got it the gold had rubbed on the white of the belt some and left a mark.<br />It did wipe right off though!"
4.0,"Living in WI, I experience some pretty cold winter days. This balaclava is lightweight and keeps my nose and neck warm. It does not cover my forehead though, so I still need to wear a headband or hat when it's in the -10's or below, as it was this past week. The drawstring doesn't snug it very tightly around the face. It's more convenient and comfortable than wrapping a scarf around my face, but I wish it had a flap that came down over the forehead. I may look into sewing one in myself."
4.0,"Fit as expected but I do wish it were a little longer. The style and cut is very flattering however. It is cute, either layed or by itself. I love the color!"
4.0,Fabric a little rough but flows nice and softened after was. Great summer dress.
4.0,It's a very cute hat and stylish - the only unfortunate thing for me is I just do not look good in hats no matter how cute they are!
4.0,"Honestly does not look like the picture at all. The bra part is padded and the cups for the breasts are absolutely HUGE. Fortunately the padding is removable and it made it a little easier to wear. However, definitely not the same product as advertised. The bottom lace is different and the cups are more rounded than in the photo. It looks ok on me but definitely would need fashion tape to hold the excess cup near my armpit down"
4.0,"With the$, but gets dirty easily; it is white. But, it is challenging to clean off the dirt."
4.0,I purchased several as gifts but all of them would not open. I thought I needed to have the clasp replaced. I had to take them to the jeweler and he said the rhodium they put on them dried them shut. He fixed them with pliers nothing else.
4.0,"Lightweight, good looking..."
4.0,Very comfortable and the quality seems to be good.
4.0,Fits great and looks so cute! It is very thin material though
4.0,"They were to small for me, gave them to a friend,she loves them"
4.0,This shirt is so cute. It's very soft and good quality for the price. It does however run VERY small. I figured it would so I ordered a large but it fits like a small. I'll still wear it but it's not as loose as I was hoping.
4.0,"I ordered this months ago, so I can't remember how long it took to ship. I think it was a day or two late? In any case, it fit well and it looks cute. However, I mostly wear it on my wrist like a wristband. If I do wear it on my neck, sometimes I noticed an itchy feeling and a part of my neck goes red from the irritation. Still, it's cute!"
4.0,"I wore this with my bat costume. It was cute, but it was a little too narrow and occluded my vision so I didn’t wear it the whole day. I wish the eye holes were a little larger. Quality is pretty good."
4.0,This hat was purchased for a trip to the beach and held up very well. Provided good coverage from the sun and fit comfortably.
4.0,"It was a cute dress, but the bottom part unraveled pretty easily and it was a little shorter than I expected. But overall, I liked it!"
4.0,I was hoping the bottom one come up higher to the waist but it didnt. The top fits bigger and the bottom fits fine. Its a cute bathing suit and color though.
4.0,"Enjoyed it, had a couple stray strands which are no big deal. Very pretty."
4.0,"I like it a lot, but I thought it would be slightly larger than it is. It's a cute everyday bag, and I love the ones that come with it, but they don't quite fit once you put your items in them. It's possible that I carry more than the average person, due to my health issues, so for the average person, this bag would be perfect.<br /><br />The colors are bright and happy, and I've received several compliments while using it."
4.0,"It’s a cute skirt. Jersey material. Elastic waist as advertised. But whew child. I’m 4’9” and curvy, with hips and booty. You can see how short it is. Wear at your own risk."
4.0,This fit as expected and it is extremely soft. It also kept me insanely warm which was great because I ordered it when it was freezing cold outside. The only thing I didn't like about this is that it shed terribly. I wore it for a day and when I took it off all these little white fuzzies got everywhere. I don't know where they are coming from but when I put it on and then take it off they just appear (it happens every time).
4.0,"The wallet is cute and colorful.  I like that it's made from fabric so there's no chance of fake leather flaking off from heavy use.  The card slots are tight, but I've been able to get my laminated cards like my driver's license in with no problem.  Lots of pockets for the other things like business cards that won't fit in the slots.  I have my checkbook in the wallet as well. I've had it for about a week and no problems with the zipper or construction."
4.0,"Been wearing this ring for months and it is still hanging in there! No wear and tear, not turning my finger green or anything. Only problem I have is sometimes the top corner will snag something."
4.0,"Would have been 5 stars but I was sent the incorrect size. Otherwise it’s a nice hoodie, washes well, not meant for sub zero weather tho."
4.0,"Looks well made, nice light material. Maybe slightly smaller than I’d like around the rib cage."
4.0,"At this price point, these are surprisingly nice house slippers with the added plus of a sole that allows one to trek outside as well.  The product sizing is small, so order a size up... I'm a 9.5 - 10 for most footwear, and these &#34;size 10-11&#34; are a bit short; my heel reaches the very outer limit of the sole of these slippers, the small &#34;lip&#34; at the back of these, which is supposed to hold them against your heel, ends up under my heel not behind it.  For anyone with a true US Size 10-11, these would be too small in length.  Otherwise, the width and toe-room is fine for me.  The &#34;memory foam&#34; cushion at first is great, but it flattens out very quickly (within the first time wearing for an hour, for me,) but they remain comfy enough.<br /><br />The product pictures are truly representative of what you get, which is nice; they truly look like the photos.  The style truly is clog or mule, they are a shade of brown as same as the photos, and a faux-suede soft fabric as shown. (but the material is still thick enough that though it's soft, it's rigid enough that it holds its shape with or without a foot in it.)<br /><br />They surprisingly, to me, arrived in a shoe box (well, corrugated cardboard shoe box, but still surprising,) with an oddly swanky logo printed on it.  These ain't high-end, so the attempt at luxe packaging was a surprise, but not an unwelcome one... plus the box is a cardboard which is recyclable.  ok!<br /><br />The rubber sole definitely is worthy of wearing outside; it's surprisingly thick, fairly rigid but not overly so, with a tread that provides a decent grip. I suspect the sole will outlive the faux-suede upper if exposed to too much outside time.<br /><br />I'm happy enough, especially with the price, that I suggest buying them (well, other than the sizing... but if your feet ain't too big, go for it!)"
4.0,This white watch is designed with class and simplicity. The watch dial doesn’t have numbers but gold lines to indicate where the numbers should be in the first place. I love watches but I would prefer numerical numbers to indicate the time. The watch band is stylish but white which could mean it gets dirty quickly than a black band.
4.0,"I am a big fan of every piece in this set. However, the glitter ones sometimes have their caps on crooked, so the glitter spills out. The hardware starts to tarnish fairly quick. They come in matching pairs."
4.0,Gorgeous and my bfs favorite dress on me
4.0,My hubby is a big guy and it fit him perfect..legnth and width super satisfied.. Its been dried and didn't shrink!!
4.0,This bralette is cute but runs small. The top of the lace will need to be anchored down with needle and thread. I am a fit 34D and usually where a medium to small in most bralettes but this one I will need to return for a large. Too much side boob. For reference I am 5’7 137 pounds 27 inch waist 34D breast size. I ordered the medium but like I said I will be returning for a large. Or different item all together.
4.0,They run a little on the small side but extremely warm fuzzy great for the winter:-).  😊😊😊<br />Not as tall as I was expecting. I definitely recommend them.
4.0,I ordered as a gift for a friend who is tiny. She claims she's a small but these looked like a medium to me. I didn't try them on and she hasn't said they don't fit so I hope it did!
4.0,"For the price, I'm very happy with this purchase. The cross-top is adorable, and the bottoms are cut &#34;cheekily&#34; which means that they only cover about half of my butt, but they are very flattering. The material isn't super high quality - for example, the circular pads in the bikini top are quite stiff and sometimes stick out at odd angles unless I position them just right - but because there's so little material, I don't really think a more expensive bikini would be nicer. Size up for sure! I usually wear an 8-10, and I bought the XL, which is a tiny bit too small. Definitely go up at least two sizes, otherwise the bikini bottoms won't even fit over your hips. But overall, it's a great suit for the price and is really darn cute."
4.0,"We love playing 13 Dead End Drive. It is similar to Clue, so if you are a fan of that, then you will most certainly like 13 Dead End Drive! Lots of traps and loads of fun. Who will inherit the fortune?!"
4.0,Works good to keep from showing the world more of you than appropriate. They need to work on the tape cover though ..can be hard to get it off.
4.0,The size was good but these are narrow. That happened to work out for my petite baby. They are stretchy so they might work for average babies. Probably not babies on the higher end of the curve though. The colors are accurate. They did pill within one wash but not too badly.
4.0,"Beautiful ring, could have been a bit thicker so that it stands out more."
4.0,"Cute tunics.. I just feel that it does run a little big.. Normally wear from XL to L but since i seen some reviews that said run a bit big i order L and they fit fine.. Still a bit loose but ok.<br /><br />Another thing i ordered in Taupe and Wine and they came from different brands, soo there was a slight difference in fitting. The Taupe one was a little bigger."
4.0,easy to use in jewelry making.
4.0,"Seems to be a bit snug, should have ordered a size larger, but I love the dress..."
4.0,This material is thiner than I would like but not shear. Also the light color on the end looks nothing like the picture and has a gross looking undertone to it. Wouldn’t order again.
4.0,They're very comfortable and good quality
4.0,Pendant larger than expected
4.0,"Really cute. Well made.  I agree with the other reviewers about the built in shelf bra.  My daughter did not like it so we cut it out.  Seems weird to have in a child's leotard.  I gave it four stars because we had to cut out the shelf bra.  Otherwise it is a really cute, unique style and good fit."
4.0,"Overall, this is a very cute hoodie dress. Nice length and forms nicely to the body. I ordered the size XL-true to size.<br /><br />The fabric is a bit weird. I never bought a dress or item of clothing made with this type of fabric. It reminds me of a fleece blanket...i have velvet couch pillow cases with the same feeling fabric...i wasn't expecting that. Very very warm dress. Great for fall and winter."
4.0,The headbands seem to be a nice quality but - just like almost all companies - they're just slightly too small and give me a headache. I took a chance buying them but I guess I can still wear them to wash my face.
4.0,Purchased as gift for my granddaughter and she loves it. This was a birthday hit that still has me getting rewards. Well made and a great color. Very happy here
4.0,"I bought an XXL like I have with other products from this company but this fit smaller. I'm 5'4"" 230 lbs. This fit but it was a snug fit and I wanted something a bit looser. Too bad it doesn't come any bigger because it was super cute."
4.0,"These are really nice i must admit, but sometimes i have trouble with one of the plugs and getting the back to screw on, for example after taking them out and cleaning my lobes. Other than that though they’re really cool."
4.0,"I am always apprehensive about fleece. Some are just warm on the skin and others are cooler to feel.<br /><br />These arrived today, and I wasn't daunted by the label for Asian sizing. I cut that bad boy right out as I am wearing them just as I intended and didn't want that scratching my every move.<br /><br />These are great! For the price I don't feel bad about getting them messy working in the yard, going to the hardware store, a walk with the dogs, or much more.<br /><br />I am a huskier guy and packed on some Pandemic Pounds along with the COVID CALORIES and these fit great on some big beefy thighs when I climb a ladder or scaffold.  In the summer heat if I were wearing much under them I imagine it getting pretty swampy."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I love the flow the fit is a TINY bit loose but since I wanted a flowy dress it's fine for me. However, the dress is long! I am 5'4' and its just above the knee. I really wanted something shorter for summer so I will be cutting this dress and sewing the hem. I feel like a shorter length for this dress will give it a more vibrant LBD feel."
4.0,"I like it so far. The sleeves were just a little too short, but I also have long arms.. Otherwise I love it."
4.0,Definitely costume jewelry quality but it's so sparkly that it's hard not to love it.  I'm a solid size 9 and this fits a tad loosely though.
4.0,Such a cute costume for my ramen-loving granddaughter!  It was so easy to put on at school and wear all evening!
4.0,Pretty realistic feathers!
4.0,"Dress is super cute for price, however, because of the open back if you have a thin child id say size down. My daughter is in 3t so thats what i purchased , but because the open back feature the arms fall down because shes thin & doesn't hold it up . Ordered it for her picture day monday so im just going to attach something in back to hold it up ! Overall good purchase ."
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; and yo-yo between 140 and 150lbs. I bought these to bum around the house, and for that, they're great. They're also good undershirts. I wouldn't be comfortable wearing alone in public, but that's my own hangup and not the top's fault."
4.0,Very festive and well priced
4.0,"Love this. Perfect length. Material is a little thinner than I expected, but good cover up for spring."
4.0,A little small but super comfortable
4.0,Love these things
4.0,"I think this skirt would fit a size 2 to a size 8. I generally wear a size 10 or 12 and it was too small for me. But, I had purchased it for my daughter who is 5'4&#34; and about 103lbs. She usually wears a size 0. It is too large on her.  But, it has elastic in the back.  So, I can easily take that in for her so she can wear it up higher (rather than at her hips as shown in the photos).  Despite the sizing issues, this is a really well made skirt.  As stated before, it has elastic at the back of the waist. It also has a side zipper.  The length falls to about mid-calf on a 5'4&#34; person. The fabric is quite thick and sturdy with a texture to it. It is lined with a black lining fabric.  The lining only goes down about 10&#34;.  So, it doesn't do a whole lot. I am posting a photo of this as well.  The seams are sewing well and the overall look is very cute!  My daughter loves it!"
4.0,I like them... They serve the purpose I got them for.
4.0,"very cute, lightweight and nicely made."
4.0,Very cute and classy charms for my crocs. The only problem I had is about 4 of the charms was broken.
4.0,"Have this in the Black/Pink Floral and Blue Colorful Floral.  Both are great but I LOVE the Blue Colorful Floral print.  I wish you could mix and match the sizing for the bottom and the top.  The top fit me OK but the bottoms were a little big.  The padding on the top was a little weird to me - not quite a push up but thicker than a non padded top - but it didn't look terrible.  For those of you who want coverage or are self-conscious wearing a revealing two-piece, this is the way to go. It is comfy and would be flattering on anyone."
4.0,Arrived on time but were much thinner than expected.
4.0,I wear a size 12 so I ordered a 13 and they fit just fine. The memory foam is not that thick but just enough for walking around the house. And they are very warm! Great product but just be sure to order up!
4.0,could not beat the price! wear it often
4.0,"This bodysuit won't squeeze you into a smaller size.  If you have a big belly, this won't hide it.  But if you want something comfortable which will smooth out your back fat and love handles so you look nice in a dress, this is the thing.  The crotch slit is the perfect size for easy urinating, too."
4.0,"Will purchase again . Purchased for my daughter, she loves the color and for"
4.0,small sizes
4.0,"I like this shirt just fine, it's not really made for my larger midsection body type, and it doesn't quite hang as low at that photo (might be because I'm a larger body type) But I still like the shirt and as I lose weight i'm excited to see it fit better :)"
4.0,"These shorts are a great value in that you get two pairs!  They are great for running or use at the gym because they are moisture wicking and quick drying.  I like that both pockets have a zipper closure to keep your valuables in place while on your run.  They don’t have any inner lining which is perfect as I like to use compression shorts under my gym shorts.  I ordered size small, and the fit was ok - inseam was fine, but overall length seems a little longer than shorts from other manufacturers.  There was a defect in one of the shorts that I got -  it has a rip in the waistband."
4.0,"Jacket is nice. Seems to be made good, but it is still a little small from what the measurements said."
4.0,The knot came undone but nice otherwise !!
4.0,Love these crazy socks! Best price but REALLLLLY slow shipping .<br />Slow boat from China.....
4.0,The only reason I am taking away a star is how long it took to finally make it here.<br />I ordered these on July 19th for a birthday party and they finally made it to me on the 5th of August. They are exactly as advertised
4.0,"This dress looks absolutely amazing, Beautiful, the craftsmanship is great and the fit is perfect!! Love it!! The only negative is that I lost about 8 fringes just walking around, but the beading,etc is beautiful! Definitely recommend!"
4.0,can see how to drive at night now!
4.0,it work fine
4.0,"Hoy use el vestido y me quedo un poquitico largo, debí pedirlo en una talla más pequeña, pero igual me encantó, se ve hermoso puesto."
4.0,Dress material is ok. A great dress for the price
4.0,It's very sheer
4.0,They're ok for the price. Would be great if you could adjust size as they're too large for my 2 month old baby.
4.0,Lovely fabric and nice fit.
4.0,"My stats 5' 6.5&quot;, 133lbs. I wear small in tops and bottoms, but have semi broad shoulders.  I bought the size small in this and it fits great!! Its not skintight which I like, because I got it for a wedding. Like others have said it shows bra outline on the back but im not too concerned about it. It actually goes to the floor which is AMAZING! and also what I was most concerned about. I took a star off for the material.  A little shiny and thin. Feels cheap, but honestly doesn't look it. I got it when the price dipped, so im really pleased with it!"
4.0,"These yoga pants are made with a thick material with sturdy seams.  They provide great tummy control.  Washed up nicely with no shrinking.  However, the run small.  I would definitely recommend going down a size.  If you don't want tight fit, then go down two."
4.0,"I normally wear an xs-xxs so the small fit me perfectly. The only thing I wasn't fond of is the way the chest area fit. I have average size boobs (32 D) but had to tape myself in so that i wasn't exposed throughout the night. Overall pretty happy with the dress, especially for the price!"
4.0,It was a really cute dress but did not fit in the chest area. So I returned
4.0,"I love prop replicas and this series, so I immediately purchased this. I like the design, and the chain is the perfect length for me. My one problem is that the gemstone isn't as bright red as pictured. It is a much darker red."
4.0,It was a very cute necklace and bracelet. The excess string was rather long.
4.0,I got this to attach it with my mobile case and use it for my BT earphones. I searched a lot for something this small and weightless but everything was too big for my purpose. It would have been good if there are other patterns. I used it for a couple of weeks but it looks it’s holding up well till now. My complaint is that it’s too overpriced.
4.0,I love it!  Super rare clothes online or offline fit me nicely. Only down fall is that it's a little thin not see through cause I ordered in black. I'm super busty and fits well around that area too. True to size. Gonna buy more colors soon. Must have
4.0,Cute but bigger than I expected.
4.0,It's made a little different than what the picture shows. Good swimsuit though. Super cute and comfy!
4.0,"Nice design and fabric.  I'm a small woman, so I wish there were a way to shorten it."
4.0,loved it  wish it was alittle bigger in the bust
4.0,very elegant.  you can dress it up or dress it down with jeans.  Great material too clings to places you want and those you don't. Happy purchase.
4.0,Love Tov clothing however this dress is really long and I will have to get altered. Other than that it’s a great dress.
4.0,"I love this watch band however, could come with directions, we struggles to make the band smaller and the original tool that came with it actually broke in the process."
4.0,"Ordered this for my grandson who has delicate ears due to multiple ear infections as an pre-toddler.  He was quite happy to have them, wear them, and even started to get bold and take them off for short periods of time while we were on our annual &#34;train watch day&#34;.  THANK YOU!"
4.0,Shows nipple
4.0,Love how thick these leggings are  perfect for winter with a sweater.
4.0,"The most item fits great, it’s soft, I live in the desert. I need this product to keep the sun off of me as I garden and tend to my animals."
4.0,"I'm giving these 4 stars simply because they were smaller than I had hoped for. However with that said I've already lost 15lbs, so maybe the next 10lbs they will fit. Gives me something to work towards. ;-)"
4.0,love the glasses.  Just wished that I didn't have high cheek bones.
4.0,"A bit big, should have gotten a size smaller. I'm on adidas size 9.5"
4.0,"These are nice if you are looking for thinner socks.  My shoe size is 7M and the smaller size fits fine. The socks are smooth rather than soft. The elastic at the top is a bit tight but will hopefully relax. I prefer soft, thick socks and thought that was what I would receive. I will still wear them though."
4.0,"This sweater is interesting - I love the design and the way it feels. The material is very light and soft. It's perfect for the spring or fall.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it has two holes on the bottom part (see pic). I love it so much, I plan to have it fixed by a tailor. I definitely recommend this sweater and hopefully others won't encounter the quality control issue."
4.0,"This is a nice vest. But I agree with most buyers.  This runs small.  I ordered an XXL and it's still too small, I will keep it (not worth the return), but I'll wear it open.  The collar is a bit high for my liking so I'll try to fold it down.  It is also short.  It worked for me because I'm only 5'1"" but if you're tall or have a long torso might not work.  I only paid $13.99 so I'll keep it."
4.0,"This ring is pretty much exactly as pictured and appears to be sterling silver, although I can’t find a 925 stamp on it. It took a long time to arrive. I would say the aquamarine color is more like blue topaz color, but still pretty and sparkly. The vine design of the ring means it easily can catch on fabrics - especially sweaters. But for the price, it’s definitely worth it."
4.0,"Great hat, great price."
4.0,Material was a little too gauzy and rough for my taste. Otherwise it was exactly as pictured and pretty cute on. True to size and I got a small.
4.0,Super cute and comfy but really long. I just bunched it more in the waste area where it’s already bunched a little. Still looks cute.
4.0,Cute bag- big enough for my 13 inch laptop and lots of files. The color is a lot darker than shown in the picture. I would describe it as more of a denim blue than purple. Overall a good bag for the price.
4.0,Gentleman like
4.0,good qualitfy
4.0,"Another great Baleaf product.  I'm 6'3&#34; 220lbs and normally wear an XL in tee shirts.  I needed an undershirt for playing basketball and ordered this in a L.  Fits nice and tight, without being so tight that its hard to breath. Knocked 1 star off because the cutoff sleeves are a little tight around my armpit."
4.0,"Great item, it does run large. I ordered a 3xl. I'm 6'1&#34; 250 lbs. and it's big. Going to order a 2xl. soon. It is well made."
4.0,"Top fits true to size, bottoms are WAY small. Only bought for the top, though - so I was okay with it."
4.0,"Ordered as a replacement band for a plastic band for my husband. We both thought it would last longer.<br />It seems well built, he likes how it looks. Taking extra links out seemed to be rather painless..."
4.0,"I wear a women’s size 11. These socks are very comfortable. They are thicker than my other no-show socks. They have silicone strips on the interior heel to keep them on. The socks stay on my feet while wearing my shoes, but when walking around with no shoes on, the heal tends to slip off."
4.0,"I love this bracelet. I have had for almost a year. I love the way it looks, feels and wears. There is only 1 problem and it was partially my fault(I think). The clasp is held my a magnet. after wear it came off and once it comes off it is never the same. I am going to contact the Goodman company to get it fixed because I love it soo much and I would not do this for jewelry. but the bracelet is that nice worth repairing"
4.0,"This is a really cute necklace and I get a lot of compliments on it. Normally, I don't like butterflies, but this one looks all the right kinds of vintage and works well with the clothes I wear."
4.0,Good coat delivered on time. Fits as expected. Warm but light.
4.0,Love the Ajox seamless line. I could do without the under butt perforation detail. Size Small or Medium Fit me but Size Small stayed up on my hips the best where the medium would slowly creep down. Measurements are 5”4 122 lbs 33-29-36. I usually wear 4/6 or a 27 in Jeans.<br />Overall these are one of my favorite affordable leggings!
4.0,Cute outfit. Not the best quality though.
4.0,"I LOVE IT!!!! not much of a bra for big chested women, more like a support and push up for your the bra you already wear and great design for chest piece . Over all I bought a XL I'm at 36 C and it's still small for my actual cup size but straps fit perfect !"
4.0,these were perfect for the superbowl party but some did not come off of the paper. the ones that did were so pretty and stayed on for days.
4.0,Huge light weight hoodie material zips up to the most comfortable cape ever great for sporting events over a heavy sweatshirt. So I look like a 6’3 little red robinhood who cares I look cool comfortable and shall a shall trendy
4.0,These jeans are nice. The material is very soft. My size is 30 . Perfect fit in the waist but the length was too long for my height. I'm 5ft. I had some taking in and cutting off to do. So I lost the step hem at the bottom. That's one of the reason why I bought it. Besides that it's a very nice and comfortable jeans
4.0,"I usually wear a 10 but these were too small with my winter socks.  I ordered an 11, and they fit perfectly."
4.0,"Even though I sent these shoes back, they fit great with awesome support. The problem was that the buckle on the side touched my skin. When metal touches my skin I break out, so I had to send them back."
4.0,"He appears to look bigger online, but he's small.  Very nice detailed work."
4.0,Super cute! I was worried about sizing since a lot of people had issues with the bra being too tight. I got a large and I'm a 34C and a size small or medium in tops. Although I have seen reviews saying a large may be too small for B cups but it probably depends on band size also. I could have potentially got a medium if I wanted the fit to be a little tighter like a sports bra. No issues with riding up or anything with a size large. Only issue is that the back closure is like a bathing suit. There's a loop that slides onto a hook (not like a normal bra) and I'm afraid it'll slip off when wearing it. I plan on just sewing it closed and pulling it over my head. Really like that foam cups in this bralette which I didn't expect so nipple coverage and support isn't an issue for me.
4.0,Good product fits as expected. Length is alittle bit of a concern. My son is 5'11 he wears a 32 but going on the reviews we bought a size up 33. Good fit I'm glad we did that but length is somewhat a concern. He might not be able to fit length wise in a couple months.
4.0,It was a little long and the back isnt very flattering because it's like a tshirt but just with the arms cut off. Cute casual shirt
4.0,I ordered a medium and it fits well (US size 8-10).  The decorative buttons on the front at the top just didn't look right and were not well centered.  I removed them and I am much happier with the dress.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift and the recipient loved it.  When it first arrived I was a little disappointed when I saw it in the box as I thought it looked cheap and chintzy in the box as compared to the nice picture on Amazon.  However, after she took it out of the box and put it on her wrist, it looked amazing again.  I'm not sure how that happened, but it honestly did.  Overall, a good purchase."
4.0,I like them a lot. They are super cute and I get lots of complements on them.
4.0,"Headband is the perfect size for my forehead (others @ stores were too big), the mask material is stretchy and has a silky feel which is great but too big for my face - the part above the nose kept falling down and it was loose around the chin/neck area, so I had to alter it and add elastic so it would stay up. Overall satisfied with my purchase because of the price"
4.0,"Robe feels soft and warm, I got a lg. I'm 5'10 170. It's not as long as pics show it's mod calf.sleves could be longer but not bad..i wish I would have got xl."
4.0,No surprises - just like it looks
4.0,I should have read product description. Was not expecting nylon rather than cotton material.
4.0,This fit way small and was a bit thinner than expected
4.0,Kinda cheap but do the job
4.0,"I mainly use my tights for water sports. So that means I have to get a smaller size because when wet, compression loosens up a tad more.<br /><br />I received a pair for Christmas this year. I have tried many different brands, and thus far, Virus is still the best out of all of them. Virus, however, isn't very affordable to own several pairs, so that is why I have tried different brands. I have seen several reviews stating that these are similar to the Dr Skin ones, but that's only on parts of the tights, like mid thigh and down.<br /><br />These particular tights, come with a drawstring, as well as some tight of rubber material on the waistband to help stay on.<br />The stitching from the waist to mid thigh is triple stitched and the cutting forms over the great trochanter and upper femur snugly. My knees do get frequent rubbing, these seem to give some protection to that.<br /><br />I'm 5""6', 163lbs, with 8% bodyfat at the time of this review.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because I can't fit a Small onto my waist, but I can with a Medium. But once I'm in a Medium, the cuffs at the ankles are too loose."
4.0,Cute shirt..just too small..
4.0,"Amazon listed it under April Birthstone Necklace, has very small diamond chips and the Topaz, for December.  But is very nice overall for the moeny and for our 8 year old grand-daughter...in any event"
4.0,Got them for my son to wear for a 90's party that his friends were going to. He likes them but only thing I saw wrong with them is that they were just a little bit short. Didn't fully go around his ears but still wearable.
4.0,"2mm to small, it is a lot of pinching, on an adult arm.<br />Look great, and made eyes turn."
4.0,Good but I was expecting two not one plug.
4.0,Bought these for my mother. Fit as expected.
4.0,"This short sleeve white v-neck is thin, not quite see through if you wear a nude bra, but I could see the top of my black pants through the material. Laid next to another long sleeve white shirt this one actually looks tinted a very light purple, which you would never tell unless its held against another white. The fit is good, material hugs the belly a bit more than I'd like, but will be wearing with cardigans. I am 5'2"" and 140 lbs and I bought a medium. Overall, may be priced a bit high for quality  of product. I would probably buy another of higher quality, not sure this will hold up very long."
4.0,"I'm 5'3 and 140lbs.  I ordered a med and fit good.  A bit long, I may have been able to do a small.  Super cute and really comfy.  Not see through and stays up when working out.  I would buy again"
4.0,nice pair of slippers.  I got them as a gift for my Dad.  He likes them
4.0,These are cool (my husband even agreed). Got them to go with a necklace; they DO pair up quite as well as hoped.
4.0,Not what I expected. But it is still nice. Price perfect. Arrived when it said it would. I would recommend.
4.0,This product was exactly what my son needed for a fashion show. A bit smaller than what we thought but otherwise perfect!  They still worked.
4.0,Fits great in the breast area but to big around. But still over all great bathing suite.
4.0,"My wife finds this bra to be very comfortable. Normally she takes out the padding but this one wears a little larger so she left the padding in.<br /><br />The construction seems fine, as long as the elastic at the bottom holds up. Only time will tell about that, but so far, so good. Wife is happy with the bra."
4.0,The glasses are nice but are not that sturdy. Can easily bend and break. I still love them. Would recommend to anyone.
4.0,I love it.<br />The material is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. Lightweight perfect for hot summer days. The price was fair for the dress. Personally I like bright colors so I didn’t think the colors were too bright. I understand for others might look brighter. The length was perfect for my 5’3 height. I wouldn’t expect more for the price.
4.0,There OK for the money
4.0,Cute. Great high low tie fit. Bought 2 more !
4.0,Fit was on the mark and my daughter said they were comfortable
4.0,"I absolutely love this top, it’s really cute in my opinion and flattering. However I got the suggested size for me which is usually a medium, however I feel like I would’ve been more comfortable in a large, due to the fact that the sleeves are mesh I would want them a little longer and not so tight to my arm. Which was an error on my part I only realize this after I had ordered And I wouldn’t of had time to send it back for the proper size. Not a dealbreaker because I plan on wearing it anyways. Something to consider when you are purchasing, I would definitely recommend this top. Just size up one."
4.0,"Edit* she likes them but they are a little too big so she cut back on wearing them.  Now I see why, they are only 3 months old and already falling apart.  Sole is coming off.<br /><br />I was worried because one shoe is visibly smaller than the other.  The stitching is also off so you see holes with nothing and crooked stitching next to it.  However, my daughter has sensory difficulties and loves these shoes.  It was the only kitty boots I could find in her size to replace her old ones she loves.  She wears them all the time, never complains they hurt her or anything.bothering her.  So far they are holding up thankfully because we have been getting several days of snow already, which is crazy!"
4.0,"I like it,but I am upset that I ordered a large for  it. I could had  been  fine with a medium. I am 5'1&#34; and weight 145lbs. I though getting a large  would help me in case if I needed to wear a sweater  under it. =[ its  no good, fits a  bit  large even with a sweater under."
4.0,Shipping was fast and nato strap was well made.
4.0,I normally take a size 12 or 14 and always buy suits one to two sizes bigger.  I got a size 16 and it fit perfectly. The only thing that I didn't like was the bra inserts.  They were kind of chintzy but can be removed.
4.0,Love Wonder Woman watch great quality.
4.0,"First thought when opening, material is cheaper feeling/looking than expected.. but once one it’s truly beautiful. Wore in Santorini, received a lot of complaints."
4.0,"Extremely authentic looking hair piece.  Looks just like Daisy's from The Great Gatsby!  I couldn't figure out how to secure in my hair since it's heavy.  It's stunning in person and unfortunately, I'm completely clueless about how to style my hair.  For the next event, I will pay to have someone incorporate this piece into my hairstyle.  It is so beautiful!!"
4.0,I like the set the quality looks good also and they were very affordable I will post more after my trip lets see if they hold up. lol
4.0,Very nice for the price! Long enough to come below a crew neckline.
4.0,"Bought this to attend a comic con with my 14 year old son, who went as Fat Thor. We had a blast and where a huge hit! Costume does run small. I bought a large but should have sized up. It zips up in the back so have someone ladies who can assist if you need to use the restroom lol. Luckily for me cosplayers are always nice enough to assist. It made really well and I had a ton of people wanting to stop me and take photos! Worth the money!"
4.0,Big on the sleeves but good length
4.0,Watch meet my expectations
4.0,The sleeves fit a bit large but the back is really pretty and it is very good material.
4.0,I ordered this in a Large for my boyfriend. I saw that it was unisex and decieed that a large would work because he is thin. This shirt is tiny. The large is tight on me. If you are ordering for a male i would say to size up 2-3 sizes. Lovely shirt though
4.0,"This top fits great! I love it. It's a great length as I am 5'4"" and I got a small.<br />My only complaint is that although I wash it in cold water and hang it dry the fabric is starting to nap. And it the fabric has a chemical smell to it that doesn't go away after washing."
4.0,Missing size stamp or logo inside shirt .
4.0,Great quality ... But a bit large
4.0,"So far, so good m!  I wore it or the first time today and I love the colors...as advertised!"
4.0,"Its a belt, good quality"
4.0,I’m really happy with this! The material is super soft and comfortable. It’s a compression shirt so it runs small- I’m normally a woman Medium/Large pending the fit- I order this in a Men’s Large and it’s perfect. It did take a long time to ship.
4.0,My husband loves the sweatshirt...it fits great
4.0,"The large size is really tight on me, I normally wear a large so I ordered  a large and the zipper flew down while working out! Lol luckily I workout at home! Hoping to lose some weight so it'll fit better, it's comfortable for sure!"
4.0,Great watch! I've had it for a year and it's done me well! Only downside is the backlight barely works. It doesn't light up the whole screen and it isn't very bright.
4.0,"The belt works surprisingly well so far. The box was really small for what I was expecting of a plus-size belt. The material of the belt itself is stretchy and strong, and it looks like it stays in the buckle. The buckle itself is plastic and looks like pieces of it may be weak after some time, but at this point I'm pleasantly surprised by the belt."
4.0,"This is an attractive bracelet that will fit an array of wrist sizes, the elements are cute and fit nicely in the design of the bracelet. All in all it's a great piece to have around. I would only say it shouldn't be worn in the pool or shower."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:89ac748d6a09a3cb7c48ae16b1dd782f]] It is exactly how I pictured it, I am 4’10” and 127 lbs and have this big tummy that never seems to want to get slim after I gave birth and have my c section.<br />So I always try to hide it and always buy a size larger.<br />So basically, I bought a Large size.<br />And it hides my fat in my middle section but I can get away with a medium and wear those spandex type things to hide my fats and have it much flattering, I just don't like them coz it feels too inconvenient for me.<br />According to the measurement I am a medium but I don’t like the medium size.<br />So all my clothes are bigger, but this blouse will fit as expected if you order according to your measurements.<br />The material of this shirt is cotton I think.<br />It is soft but not too soft and they don’t really wrinkle.<br />I don’t own an iron so I’m basically a wash and wear type.<br />After I washed it, I folded it and put it in my dresser and there’s no wrinkle.<br />I think it is good for a casual wear, I don’t see myself wearing it for formal or even business casual, maybe because there’s a hood in it so it makes it a casual attire.<br /><br />*Disclaimer : I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. This does not alter my opinion in anyways."
4.0,"For a one size fits all, it is kind of small. i'm 5'4 at 130 lbs and it was slightly tight and fit awkward in the front. I still kept it and figured i'd make it work. I love the colors and design; it looks like the picture."
4.0,can't beat for price  nice quality  runs just a little large  buy true size
4.0,"Very nice, my wife likes them. I put 4 stars as they are bigger than expected. They are 100% good though don;t get me wrong, but not exactly what I wanted. Fast service, good delivery and overall good for the price."
4.0,"Things I like:<br />-Great mirror finish that I've been looking for<br />-These are darker than other glasses I've used, and that took a bit of getting used to, but I like it<br />-They are comfortable and can be adjusted / gently bent to wrap and fit better<br />-They come with a great soft bag and a soft case like you'd expect for a high dollar pair of sunglasses<br /><br />Thing I don't like:<br />-The hinges aren't spring loaded the way I prefer. If they were, these would be perfect!"
4.0,Wish the strap was thicker but great price for these bags
4.0,"I love how this top looks and feels, I was expecting it to be a little more covering, however, I don’t mind that I have a little under boob showing. I would have given this five stars if it were a little larger. Definitely size up if you wear larger than a B cup and plan on wearing this with no support. I’m 5’10 /160lbs/ 36C for reference, ordered size L"
4.0,This is a nice and comfortable dress.
4.0,Runs a bit smaller than the usual low rise HP's.
4.0,Love it so much and it is water resistant like it says. Dries super quick and it is very soft.
4.0,"i bought this as an accessory for my angel costume this year. works well and ties the costume together. I'm not sure i would wear it any other time. the gold is a little cheep looking, but who knows.....i'll have to change my mind if it works with another outfit! :) the fit is nice as well. i have a 27&#34; waist and it is not too tight or too loose."
4.0,"Not really lovely, but goofy.  If you are looking for lovely, keep looking.  I happen to like goofy so I am keeping them"
4.0,Nice jacket. I bought the XS (my normal size) and it's a little tight in the chest (I'm a 32C) and the sleeves are too short (I'm 5'5&#34;). I'll definitely need to iron it as well... but overall I really like it!
4.0,"For reference I bought a size medium, at 135 lbs 5”2 , bra size 32 DD . Smaller waist bigger hips & this fit almost perfect. I had to<br />Remove padding from top to fit , it does the job , it fits so nice . Bottoms are cheeky ( not a thong thank goodness) they are a bit snug but I do have a bigger butt. If you’re about average in the booty area this suit should fit you . If you’d like , you can size up for a looser fit ; the top should still be able to fit. Buy this . It’s so good , made me feel so confident"
4.0,Fit well but haven't tried them in the water yet.
4.0,"Nice gifts for my daughter and wife. I didn't give it 5 stars because the mirror is glued to the cover without any frame, leaving a very sharp piece of glass exposed. I suppose this wouldn't be too much of a concern if used carefully, but my suspicion is that &#34;Murphy&#34; may live in there. In any case the leather is nice and it accommodates the lipsticks used by both ladies. Hard to find but pretty good value. Made in China (of course)."
4.0,"I really like this bracelet, it looks like a combination of earth styles I like, very earth centered and yet strong with metal. This was picked out my teenage daughter and she really likes it too. Neither one of us is a fan of the clasp on it though. I admit, it is easier to put on by oneself than some of them are but we still wish it was a bit different.<br /><br /> I was given this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Cute! And portable
4.0,Simple cute once you adjust the  straps.
4.0,I thought they would be small but they are really nice for what they are to be used for.  Good size a d pretty angels.
4.0,A little too loose for me.
4.0,"I thought the scarf would be longer. It's pretty short, I can't wrap it around my neck without looking ridiculous"
4.0,Fits adult. Does not fit toddler. Flowers arrived a little smushed.
4.0,Happy. Perfect size and wanted an outside pocket for phone.
4.0,I wear a size 8.5 and these ran small. I keep having to pull them up during pilates. FrustratIng. I wish I hadn’t washed both pairs now because I would be returning one pair.
4.0,"I'm a 36E and unfortunately the fabric/laces didn't hold up for the bra-less look. Still, a pretty top if you aren't in need of tons of extra support."
4.0,It’s better then a bra but it don’t put ur boobs up like Advertised doesn’t hurt to remove other then that it’s ok
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; 170lbs with a bigger chest and longer torso.  Overall, the shirt fit relatively well, but an XL may be better (I ordered the Large). The top had some stretch to it and would look great with dress pants or dress skirt."
4.0,looked at the size chart and it said to buy size 31 wear a 32 waist. Just fits. As long as i don't gain weight these will be a pair of shorts in high rotation.
4.0,Keeps u warm
4.0,"This Band it’s cute, bigger than the Picture. Would look better on a Thick Wrist"
4.0,"Great packable dress! Love the fabric; didn’t wrinkle even when it was scrunched up in my luggage. Great length. Sized down from large to a med and it fit fine. Wore it with a yellow floral chiffon scarf, so could throw that over my shoulders when the evening got chilly. Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because there weren’t pockets."
4.0,Bought it to help as an anti glare while working on the computer all day. Works great. Beats spending a ton on anti glare screens.
4.0,"Not as supportive as I would like especially if you're blessed more in the chest area but still does the job. Great material, love how it feels. Looks cute in person/wear."
4.0,chain too small
4.0,"It stays on my head all night however I wish the inside was lined with Satin. However, I don’t regret my purchase."
4.0,"smelled strongly of some kind of cleaning product, but went away after letting air out for a day or so.  Was great for my IT crowd halloween costume!"
4.0,Bought these for my husband and he wears them a lot when going out for drives. He said they’re a bit tight on his face but not uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The style is cute and flattering.
4.0,Love the dress but too small in the top :(
4.0,This hat is definitely cozy and warm! I haven't used it yet with the mask portion but love this hat nonetheless!! The color beige goes with all my coats!
4.0,Received Good Comments
4.0,Beautiful skirt. Fits perfect love the wide belt.
4.0,"The material is nice, not too tight and perfect for yoga."
4.0,"the search is off! no more digging in my big a** purses for a tiny chap stick. con, lid secure flap is small. pro, can hold other items like spare key, lip glosses, a variety of small crap. con, I'm a slight germaphobe and think keys are generally bacteria havens, so putting my lips on something that has been where my keys have been, well...gross. pro, cool designs."
4.0,"Ordered a size small band.  Band fit like a medium.  No way to adjust this band, which I bought knowing this.  It was so loose that I had to push it half way up my forearm to keep it in place.  Nice quality band though, arrived before scheduled."
4.0,One pair had a small hole in the crotch where the seams weren't quite joined.  These are a lot thicker than I thought they would be so great in a cool climate.
4.0,Started rusting pretty quick.  With in 2 months of use it has become dark grey and bronze... Still looks good though
4.0,The necklace is nice- fair for the price.  Packaging is not as stated. It came in a cheap clear plastic bag with none of what was listed in the description. Looks cheap if you are giving it as a gift.
4.0,These earrings are beautiful and made a great gift.  I wish the packaging had been nicer.<br />Mom was thrilled with them.
4.0,"These are nice glasses to have. I actually purchased these for my husband, but got the side-eye. He immediately told me that they were not men's glasses. I'm not sure how they would look on a man, because he never put them on. Lol They looked to be women's glasses to me, so I decided to keep them for myself.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my testing purposes. All views expressed in this review are based on my experience with this product, and mine alone."
4.0,"good quality material, nice colors"
4.0,"Nice product, I would purchase again"
4.0,This dress wasn’t as long as I thought it would be
4.0,"This watch is so beautiful, but I have a very small wrist and it fits really big on me"
4.0,"I absolutely love the bag...way better than I expected. The color is beautiful, like a honey or golden brown and its soft but still sturdy enough that it doesn't sag. My only complaint is with one of the inside pockets. The pockets are topped with a leather strip and on the small pocket, the stitching was missed so it's loose on that pocket. Not a deal breaker. Otherwise, is perfect. Love it so much I ordered the matching wallet."
4.0,These are super cute! I’m a tall girl 5’8 160 lbs & I ordered a medium & a large. Ive only received the medium so far & the elastic at the top of the is a bit snug so I’m sure the large will be perfect. Overall a good buy & long enough for tall girls!
4.0,"I love it! Great style and the skirt lovely. Gave a four because I need to buy shorts to wear below it, it's too short."
4.0,"Decent quality, color is a little more bright red then deep red as pictured... and the length is a hair short for my preference. But for the price I’m happy with it"
4.0,Good quality but a little dull / not as shine as expected
4.0,"Great suit. Top does not fit perfect across chest (small size 4, 5’8 athletic build with A chest)"
4.0,"Ordered the maroonish color. Love it. So cute and comfy. It's not that thick, but i've gotten a lot of compliments on it. It's a girly style and easy to throw over leggings. Would recommend for casual top."
4.0,Super cute T-shirt but  the leopard print trees are very orange in color
4.0,These are very pretty. They are beautiful but very tiny!!
4.0,These pajamas are sooo soft!  I bought them for my daughter for CHRISTmas and I like them so much that I'm going to purchase another pair for myself.<br />They seem to be well made so hopefully they will last a long time And the color is true to what was advertised.  We got the dark purple color and they have been washed about 4-5 times and haven't faded at all.<br />They do run small so order a size up. My daughter is 5'1&#34; and weighs about 120 and I ordered a medium but had to return it cause it was too small. I got her a large and even those are not as loose as she likes.  The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because of the size problem.
4.0,Very comfortable but I should have gotten a large
4.0,"Cute, but too big, especially the leg warmers. I decided to fold on top and bottom to make them work. Not the best quality but worked for a few nights.<br />My girl is 4 months and I ordered 3-6."
4.0,"I really like huge watch this is what is it having 3 time zone which you can set the time as you wish, very stylish and quiet heavy, genuine leather bracelet in all it is beautiful.Please buy it I truly recommend it"
4.0,I like it.  It's real stylist. It's a bit tiny for adults I think it would fit teens better.<br /><br />The torqouise pendant is beautiful
4.0,"Well. It doesnt work. My dad loved it but we just cant get it working. I will be seeing what we can do.<br /><br />EDIT: Great customer service and the replacement was amazing! It just sucks the first one was bad,"
4.0,The strap is pretty however a little too small for my shoulders. I bought some extra links to make the length a little longer.  Held up the dress well.
4.0,These are lovely and the class seem quite tight my only criticism is that they hang in such a way that the gem faces down.
4.0,It is a pretty nice bracelet for the weekends or as a casual evening.
4.0,"I'm 5'0 so I ordered a small.. still was a bit larger than I expected. However, I wore this for SantaCon and I was EXTREMELY comfortable and warm. Plus, now I have a great onesie to wear around the house!"
4.0,Good pants for the money. Comfy and lightweight. Definitely would purchase again! Fits pretty true to size I wear a 4 in lulu and I bought the small I am 5”5 145.
4.0,Very warm nice hat. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the Velcro piece wasn’t super secure and after one use some threads came loose in it. However the Velcro wasn’t necessary for me personally
4.0,"Fits nicely, a little loose or maybe I'm just used to the tightness of jeans. Not at pleated as the picture shows and the material is... different lol. Overall, cute skirt, can't wait to find a top to go with it."
4.0,"the top was a bit complicated to put on but i got, looks great , awesome support on the breast, the bottom looks a little funny. material is great and sturdy"
4.0,"Our 5 yr old just started doing chores around the house so we got this for him to keep his money in.<br />it is made very well and is sturdy.<br />I only wish it was a little bit larger.  But otherwise, we are really happy with it."
4.0,"The hat is nice, not real flimsy.  But it is HUGE!  Definitely not a women's hat and was even big on my husband who normally wears a size large hat.  Not sure if I got a different hat than some of the reviewers but this straw hat with the black band was way too big.  Had to return."
4.0,"I  received these pants a lot quicker then what they projected, they are incredibly comfortable and fit perfectly .<br />I am 6'1 and I squish them up at the bottom a bit so it looks and feels right ,they are very light which is great for summer<br />I have actually had them on for two or so days."
4.0,"Do a lot of fishing and like to keep my legs covered from bug bites.  These let me do it in style, and I look quite the charmer at the same time."
4.0,"GREAT dress for the price!! Thick material, super cute style. It's just a bit short for me, which I expected after reading the other reviews on here. But I'm 5'10 so i'm used to it. Going to wear it for my sorority's recruitment in the fall."
4.0,"Good fit, slips a little but protects my feet from some of the not so clean gym floors or mats. Barefoot is still best. Update: this company kindly sent me a free pair! I do mention this product to my students and for the toe shy folks it encourag s them to come to class. You'd be surprised how many people state that bare feet in public is a phobia!"
4.0,Also looks sharp. Great price. Love this swimsuit!
4.0,They came packaged well but several were all wrinkled in the package. I have had a time getting them to lay flat. They are very pretty yet smaller than I thought they would be. Overall I like them and can not wait to use them as wings for my homemade fairies.
4.0,"The stones are pretty big, but it looks really good!<br />I have received many compliments when wearing this necklace."
4.0,"I bought a size up, and was happy I did. It is a beautiful piece, with sleeves, and longer skirt than others, which I was looking for."
4.0,"it's really pretty and has a nice sparkle, although the smallest it comes in is 6 so i was hoping swarovski ran small cuz i wear a 5 in regular rings, but it is still a little too big, but once summer comes it will fit better. it is smaller, as in band thinness, than i thought though, but i should have been aware that rings always appear so much smaller than the zoomed in pictures of them."
4.0,It’s cute.  Giving as a day gift to a long time NKOTB fan.
4.0,Nice quality and looks
4.0,"Super warm and trendy. The grey is a little lighter in person, but still nice. They are very warm which is a plus and at the right setting of sensitivity to touch on your phone, work as intended. The only reason I didn't give them the 5 stars is that I got several pulls on the weaving fabric rather quickly. The tiniest tug to the fabric and it pulls. Typically warm gloves like this are reserved for shoveling snow or being outside for long periods of time, and the fabric caught to the shovel handle a few times and each time I had a new pull."
4.0,"I loved the fit of this dress and the material was very comfortable.  It also had pockets and was not see-through.  The only thing that I disliked is that the stripes did not line-up correctly throughout the dress. This bothers me and I would eventually not wear the dress.  I returned it and received my refund quickly.  If the uneven stripes does not bother you, I would recommend this dress."
4.0,I also bought the plan purple and they are the exact same color???
4.0,"I purchased these multifocus glasses as a spare work pair for when I forget my prescription glasses. I read multiple reviews which influenced my decision to purchase these over foster grant multifocus glasses. These multifocus glasses are in fact better than cheap &#34;readers&#34; however I was not blown away with them ( I have several cheap pairs of readers). The lenses have minimal distortion which I appreciate. They are very good for reading small print such as prescription labels. They are good for reading further away such as a computer screen. And they are ok for longer distances such as up a hallway - this is where I am disappointed because some distortion is noted. Overall a good looking pair (I purchased red), metal spring armed frames, plastic lenses with lower half of lenses held in with clear string . The lenses scratched the first week - boooo. The lenses seem thick to me and I feel a distraction when reading - I feel/see a white line at the bottom of the lenses. My prescription lenses have the same string thing on the bottom of the lenses and I barely notice it. I would recommend these for close and intermediate - I dislike the distance portion and tend to remove them for that."
4.0,"I adore these! Not the best quality of material but for the price, don’t think you can beat it!"
4.0,I like the band and it fits well.  One issue is that if something gets on it you can’t just wipe it off.  Stains easily.
4.0,"Lovely, comfortable, durable, warm.... beware pet owners... hair magnets. Hope they would make these in microfiber!"
4.0,"two came broken but I only needed two so I'm not upset, but worried about the pin's longevity now"
4.0,Could not find these slippers in any local store and the online store for Dearfoams were quite a bit higher priced.
4.0,Super stretchy but the fit is a little bit on the larger size
4.0,Like them but some of them pop in and slide over I don’t like them they keep falling out I lost 2 the first day I wore them
4.0,Perfect fit for my girlfriend. Used twice so far and feels very comfortable. A little too expensive for the packing and material. Taking off a point for value. Product itself is great.
4.0,"Super cute! Fits small, but I am 5 foot and 160 pounds so would probably fit others better. The waistband came with a small hole where it missed stitching but I was able to fix it easily just by sewing by hand."
4.0,"I’m really pleased with this cardigan. It’s lightweight and very soft. There’s just the right amount of stretch where it’s very comfortable having the sleeves pulled up, no tightness but they stay put.<br />I am 5’3”, 218# and I bought a large. I wash gentle and hang to dry, as the tag actually says to dry clean, which is laughable for a $10 sweater!!<br />The sleeve length is great and not baggy, I like the cut of the sweater, it sort of curves over the bust area. It hangs great and looks good dressed up or down.<br />I am little disappointed that the colors aren’t quite as muted as shown. They are very bold and vibrant. Not bad, but I wanted a more pale coral, and it’s almost like neon, that’s why I removed a star, otherwise it would have been 5 for sure. I typically wear an Xl/XXL and was able to comfortably wear a large, so be aware before ordering, check the size chart because it was accurate."
4.0,"I love this little pouch.  The only advancement I would make is with the zipper.  The zipper pull feels like it could break with a strong tug, besides that, it does what it's supposed to.  It held my phone, a Midori passport size traveler's notebook, keys and a small wallet.  This is great if you don't want to take a big bag with you to run a few errands, or if you're going for a night out on the town."
4.0,"Nice top! I have been wearing it to Zumba class and looking better than all the other ladies! It does attract pet hair like a mutha', so if you have a husky, you've been warned. Drapes nicely over the body and highlights the shoulders while skimming over problem areas."
4.0,I love it.. a little mis proportioned though
4.0,Really cute in person. Unfortunately too big for me which made it look awkward. Gave it to my sister.
4.0,"No leaks, good goggles. but the attached ear plugs are difficult to wear with swimcap"
4.0,Very pretty dress.  The fabric is very light but the construction is so that it doesn't cling to those areas that you are trying to hide.  I have 2 of them in different colors.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the quality is nice but not top notch.  But is just what I was looking for.  I haven't washed one yet so I'm not sure how it will hold I'm.  I take good care of these type items so I'm sure there won't be a problem.  Some people think you can throw everything into the washer & dryer & expect it to look great.
4.0,I really loved the dress & material. It fit really well. The only problem I had was the top kept shifting.
4.0,"I got this romper as something that I could sleep in, and then wear to the donut shop, corner store, or just to lounge around the house in without looking like I'm hanging out in my pajamas still.<br /><br />It works perfectly for this. The material is stretchy and soft so it's comfortable enough to sleep in, but it's cute enough to wear out of the house.<br /><br />Works perfectly for the purpose I chose for it, and I couldn't be happier. :)<br /><br />I am 5'7"" tall and 130 lbs and I ordered a medium."
4.0,"This is just what I wanted! Not too heavy, not too lightweight. Excellent for the price!"
4.0,"These were advertised as &#34;Polarized which they are NOT however, they were only $9.95, and they are light weight and comfortable!"
4.0,"This dress is very nice and decent quality. I purchased it in green and the color is as shown. I I probably would've been better off with a medium as I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 135 but the small still looks nice nonetheless. Luckily, the material has a good amount of stretch."
4.0,Look great.  Very narrow.
4.0,"Bought a size larger around the body. Squeezes the breasts a little closer together than I expected, but otherwise looks good."
4.0,I own several of these dresses. They are very comfortable however I had to return this need to get it in larger size. They wash really nice and hold up very well.
4.0,Was super pretty. Made an amazing gift!
4.0,"I ordered this necklace for a friend as a gift, I think she will love it. she works in a office and loves costume jewelry..it very versatile and can be worn with anything from a blouse to a sweater. I made a good choice. I got this piece of jewelry at a real discount for my honest review.. i forsee her getting plenty of wear out of it.  Thank you!"
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty and worked for what I used them for (Halloween costume). They were a little heavy for my loves, but I am used to smaller earrings. If you are used to large earrings, you'll be fine."
4.0,These are great for the price but limited in functionality. They are clip ons only so you cannot flip them if you wanted a quick transition between shades and glasses. The container is also a little flimsy and difficult to close. Sometimes it does not close all the way.
4.0,"I thought this was a really nice dress for the money. It's well made and looks beautiful on. My daughter is very fair so I ordered the champagne color and it suited her perfectly. I'm only giving this four stars because the sizing was off for me. I ordered the 4-5 years and it was almost too tight on my 40&#34;, 40 lb. daughter. We probably won't get many more wears out of it."
4.0,Something funny happens to the black ink when washed - not faded but it takes on a white residue or something and I can't get it out.  Weird.  Comfy jeans though.  Might try in a blue wash.
4.0,Loved this jacket. Fit true to size.
4.0,"For the price, this was a steal. I bought these bands as I was worried my press-on Fitbit band would not be secure enough. I also wanted the flexibility to choose different colors to go with certain outfits. However, the material used to house the pebble was much thinner than the original band, to the point that placing the pebble in the housing would cause the black pebble color to show through the band. In addition, placing the band around my wrist led to the sides of the housing bowing out. Finally, the material has a very strong and unpleasant odor. I have never dealt with silicon products having such a strong odor and was surprised that no one has mentioned it. Perhaps mine was part of a bad batch.<br />I have yet to wear one around for the entire day, as ultimately I was fearful for the safety of my pebble.<br />EDIT:<br />Customer service was very quick to respond to my concerns, and we talked over possible options. Ultimately, I will be returning my Fitbit Flex in favor of the Alta (I have written reviews for both of these items), and so I will also return these items.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Extremely helpful customer service<br />Many colors<br />Secure design<br /><br />CONS:<br />Thin material<br />Odor"
4.0,I got the black and white striped. It definitely does not look like the pictures but I like it. The tie is a little difficult to figure out but it makes it very versatile. I bought this for a beach cover up and can't wait to wear it!
4.0,"I don’t know if it was my fault or yours. I received a size small instead of large. I need a size large. I gave the small to a child, and the original person had no fifty."
4.0,"Very nice Clutch, the price and the expedited shipping made it worthwhile."
4.0,"I liked the pants, wear them for our outdoor winter soccer.  Only issue is the tag said to hand wash."
4.0,Cute and made pretty well!
4.0,This is a well made heavy duty sweatshirt. It definately runs big. I bought it for my brother for Christmas and he loved it.
4.0,Very comfortable.  Fits true to size. Can see through it (I wear a tank under mine)
4.0,"At first when I received the glasses, I didn't like the look however I grew to like them. They fit good and are comfortable."
4.0,Tshirt material. Great for a nice day but not for anything fancy
4.0,Great color. Fits well.
4.0,"Lights work when hands turn and work good, fit is good."
4.0,"I did as suggested and ordered a larger size and it is slightly small, but fits and closes"
4.0,Decent little knife. At this price point it is a steal. Some minor issues with the wooden scales very minimal. If the grind was uniform I’d give it a 5 star. It’s just barely off center. My husband has a huge knife collection but he doesn’t like to beat on his expensive knives. I got him this little knife so he can abuse it. It will definitely hold up and it will definitely do. Couldn’t be more pleased.
4.0,it is too thick I feel so hot wearing it
4.0,"LOVE this bag. The only reason why I can't give it 5 stats is because the shoulder strap ripped right off the bag after just a few days of use. Otherwise, it's the cutest and has SO much room!"
4.0,GREAT for people with full and/or curly hair that pull there hair up. Ordered two more in a different color.
4.0,"These rings are super cute and simple - easy to throw on and have your hands be ""dressed up."" One ring came slightly unattached at the ""seam,"" but it does not bother me, nor does it get in the way of anything. Shipping time was great, and price was great. I love the two chain-like rings! I am sure these rings will tarnish quickly, but I always take off my rings when I am washing my hands to be sure that the rings don't tarnish before they need to."
4.0,"Its perfect, But one ended up getting messed up in the inside. It just kept Twisting when i was trying to tighten it."
4.0,This was a gift. She liked it.
4.0,It’s pretty good allowing you to size perfectly for your wrist. However it does loosen over time but not enough to impact anything.<br />The annoying part is while the mesh appears to be smooth and does feel smooth to the touch it does often catch on various clothing and blankets causing threads to be pulled out.
4.0,"Shirt is so cute, only issue is the sleeves are a little short and I have short arms."
4.0,Love this bag - love the look and the fact that I can choose between over the shoulder or cross body.  The only problem I find is that the center zippered pocket on the inside gets in the way of fitting larger items into the bag which is why I bought the &#34;tote&#34; in the first place.  Still a great bag...
4.0,"Bought one, when I saw how beautiful it was, I bought another one just like it, so I would have one in case something. happened to the other one. That's just how much I like this blouse. I wish there were more colors."
4.0,I love my blingy band.  My friends thinks it's a new watch they where surprise that it was my Fitbit Versa.
4.0,"I really wanted to love these but personally I think they are just okay. It may be because the color is outside my norm. They aren’t see through but I do feel like they show divot and roll. The open design has torn or deformed. They fit tts. For reference I’m 160lbs, 5’3 and athletically built and a medium fits well."
4.0,"This product was a little nicer than I expected it to be. Material is heavy duty, looks good on my hands. Fits nicer than I expected them to, They do fit really snug but I have pretty good control with them. The fingers are long so your fingers don't reach the ends. Uses good quality Velcro to strap around the wrists. I would have given 5 stars but the stitching holding the Velcro on broke when I was pulling very hard on them. Probably my fault and I was able to stitch them back together again."
4.0,"Second pair,Fits perfect."
4.0,Looks best with an antique bronze chain.
4.0,Material doesn't breathe it makes me sweat
4.0,"They make noise when you first get them.  After a couple hours of wiggling, they are silent. My high school student uses these in class to focus."
4.0,I have massive booty and legs so the shorts are a tiny bit small but can wear. love the comfort of the top
4.0,My 4 year old granddaughter loved it !  The quality is good I had my husband shortened the chain because it was way to long for a 4 yr old.  For the  reasonable price I am happy with my purchase.
4.0,Cute but belt was poor quality
4.0,Super cute! But one set broke when I tied it on. I will see if I could return just that pair. I will be using them often. Very cute!
4.0,"Very pretty dress, I wore a thick black belt around the waist because I didn't like the elastic, made my breasts look bigger than they are, overall nice dress, received a lot of compliments"
4.0,Adorable bathing suit. Definitely flattering. Will edit for comfort soon as bought for upcoming trip. I gave 4 stars because you can see the white sewn seam from inside along the strap around the front armpit area.
4.0,I wear them a lot and they are in great shape. They sparkle and are easy to clean.
4.0,This does NOT say Leo...it is as shown & says 'Lo'. I bought this for a friend & had to return because of this.
4.0,"It looks nice.  I've only worn it a couple of times, so I can't comment on its durability."
4.0,Super cute but too expensive! Plus if you want your look to look like the ones in the picture  you have to buy 2 pair. I was so disappointed.
4.0,"I like the fabric of this  Neck Gaiters Bandana Mask, soft, breathable, lightweight. I would be more than happy if I found this kind of bandana that exist not just ""one size fits all"" but at least three different sizes (S, L, XL)"
4.0,Stylish and cute. Delivery time was lengthy and unexpected. Delayed and arrived well after promise date. Runs very small however was too cute made it work
4.0,NIce.
4.0,The studs are very nive and big but it looks silver. It doesn't look like its gold plated but besides that iys beautiful
4.0,Son muy pequeños para los anteojos de mi hija de 6 años
4.0,Love the color but did not like the materal was too thin.
4.0,"We had to send hats back several times to get one that fit.  We first tried several different styles in a 7 3/8 and they fit fine, except my husband didn't like the style.  Then we tried the TWC6 and he loved the style but the 7 3/8 was too small, so was the 7 1/2.  We finally ordered it in a 7 5/8 and it is just right.  Looks great and well made.  I gave it 4 stars because it was a hassle to keep returning hats, not to mention the return shipping charges (we are Prime customers)."
4.0,"Very cheaply made but the material is very soft and feels great on my skin. They're a bit long (my hight is 5'.5"") very c9mfortable to sleep in"
4.0,Looks good with pink mini skirt
4.0,"Very thin, you get what you pay for.  I think this will snag very easily so you may only get a few wears out of it, unless you are really careful!"
4.0,Cute shirt but runs a little small
4.0,"Pay close attention to the sizing chart! These are definitely Asian sizes. I am a 5 ft 4 in woman, weigh about 145 pounds and the XL (US M) just barely fits. The shorts are definitely too tight, although the pants are fine. Also, different material than I was expecting, maybe I just didn't read the description well enough. I was expecting more silk/satiny and instead it's a heavy linen type fabric. Cute though! It will definitely work for my school's pajama day.  ~Cassandra"
4.0,"Really nice romper, very soft and doesn't have a chemical smell.<br />I recommend this product for all Stich fan."
4.0,Bought one of these now I own them in all colors. Great lightweight option! Sheer so be expected to wear something under it.. also the cuffs on the sleeves were way too big so it was hard to push the ends up past my elbows. Otherwise great bang for your buck!
4.0,"They're beautiful and great quality. A little heavy, but a great statement piece"
4.0,"I wanted a camisole that would hide my neckline when wearing a little bit lower of a top or dress, these cami’s do the job but have already torn in a few places along the hem at the lace.<br />I’ve only worn them once."
4.0,"The fabric is soft, comfortable, and great for warm nights. Overall it fit as expected but the pj legs were super long. I like my sleepwear oversized, however the extremely long leg length requires me to roll the bottoms so I can walk without tripping."
4.0,"These pants are really really tight, and very very thin. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not the tiniest person alive but I'm also not fat but these pants are definitely not flattering. The material is cool and flexible, they are really comfortable but they show every little divot and roll.<br />As a base layer, underneath a pair of shorts or even sweats in cold weather, these are perfect.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Great warm socks
4.0,They need adjustments with the sizes. The blouse fit but the pants were abit tight and shorter for being pants and for it being for a toddler they are off on measurements
4.0,Cute style and nice light fabric for summer wear.
4.0,"These are fine for what they are--cheap, thin, kids' fireman hats. But I was disappointed since some of the answered questions said they fit adult heads; they do not. Of the 12, only 2 of the adults who wore them (as part of a fireman's brigade group costume) could actually get them to somewhat go on their heads. Everyone else kind of put the hat on top of their heads (but their heads weren't actually in the hats, if that makes sense)."
4.0,Somewhat comfortable
4.0,"It serves it's purpose, but the band is stiff and mildly uncomfortable."
4.0,I think these are really great sports bras for the price.  I don't like the padding but there is a place on the side that you can take it out if you want.  I would purchase these sports bras again.
4.0,"Soft and warm and nicely made.  It is a loose cotton knit so it gives some warmth but is not super warm.  It does ""shed"" lots of little flecks of cotton lint when you wear it.  So if you wear with dark colors, expect to need to have a lint roller.  The model in the picture looks like she is drowning in the sweater but I figured she was a tiny person.  This sweater is very large for its size and there is plenty of room to move or to wrap the sweater around you. Unless you want to look like the model, I suggest getting a size down."
4.0,"Very good quality for the price.  Fit is great all around (sleeve length, chest, waist, overall length).  My only complain is the neck size, but most hoodies are snug on my there.  I just made a small cut down the middle to open it up a bit.  Still looks good and much more comfortable.  The color is a good strong navy color.  Haven't needed the wicking function as much but from the feel of it and other wicking fabrics, I am sure it will work just fine.  A good hoody for winter outside wear or lounging around."
4.0,"I ordered an XL.  My ""natural"" size is really Large.  But most clothing items I have purchased from Amazon tend to run smaller then U.S. items.  However, even though it is a little large, it fits and looks good.  Material is of high quality and very heavy.  I have worn it a couple of times around the house, and it definitely keeps me warm, regardless of the room I am in.  It looks and feels ""luxurious"", but it has one rather serious flaw.  If you look at the picture closely, you can see that the button holes are not stitched properly, and loose thread ends are showing on all the holes.  I am going to get the holes stitched to avoid threads pulling out from the sweater body.  Other then that flaw, it is a very nice sweater.  It appears, that on this sweater, a sewing ""step"" was missed that would have finished the button holes correctly."
4.0,It Will Go With So many different Colors.
4.0,"Love the feel of material, soft! A little  snug around hips."
4.0,Great for traveling due to is compact shape not for everyday use because it’s not the most sturdy product. The top sun shade is pretty much useless.
4.0,Not super tight compression; look cheaper than I like but u get what u pay for
4.0,Love the material. Slightly big.
4.0,"This is a very good cap but I just wish it would have been made of slightly heavier denim. Fin and finish is fine and one major plus is the length of the cap in back. It's long, unlike many that remind me of a beanie. Overall, it's a reasonable buy and recommended."
4.0,Love this chain. They could of done better with the gold plating it faded very fast. Overall satisfied. Will be ordering another because it faded so quickly.
4.0,Its a little thin in some places and didnt have the shape u was looking for. I would say it makes a good tunic to pair with gym leggings to work out but not a top for going out. More lounge/gym quality. The color is true and the fit is very loose so you could probably size down. I'm a 36/38C and the Med had room on me.
4.0,thanks practical
4.0,"Pretty dress, cheaply made but you get what you pay. It runs large so size down! Very comfortable"
4.0,"It's a little small for my wife, but she was able to add an extender piece to it."
4.0,"I started listening to meditations, particularly at night before bed, and just wanted something that was sleep friendly and cordless.  So far I've had no problems with this beanie/hat and bluetooth pairing.  The distance is reasonable (from a bedroom down a hallway to a bathroom), and it seems to pair with more than one device without having to re-enter the pairing mode.  I almost didn't get it because some reviews complained about the &#34;difficulty&#34; of having to unzip a little pocket to charge it, but I don't think it's a big deal at all.<br /><br />Honestly, I have no idea how long the charge lasts because I haven't used it consecutively for enough time for it to run out.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the material is kind of rough."
4.0,"These are pretty great. Nice material, good tummy control while still being comfortable and smooth. Don't buy the grey pair that is listed with these, though, they are NOT the same style as the black ones and not nearly as good."
4.0,"Beautiful fit. Love that they make a L length. I really like these breeches -- the fabric is nice and comfortable, they don't pull or tug in the saddle, and they wash really well. I wash and dry every week and have had them for a year, and they still look new. My only complaint is that the calf is too tight. I don't have particularly large calves but they pinch and are uncomfortable there. However, I have yet to find another pair of breeches that satisfy both aesthetics and comfort, so I have these in several colors. I am 5'8&#34;, 130lbs, small waist & fuller hip. 26L fits great and 28L was too large/gaped at the waist. R length was much too short. If you're between sizes, I suggest sizing down."
4.0,I like the top but it could have been a couple of inches longer for me. It hits right at the hip and that’s not good if your hips tend to be wide anyway.
4.0,These are sweet and subtle. I wear them in my second hole ear piercing. They are mostly white w just a hint of pink and bale blue.
4.0,"Cute, casual, and comfortable. I wear it pretty much every day. The gold from the band has slightly more red in it than my watch but it’s not super noticeable. I’ve had it for about a month now and there are some subtle, cosmetic signs of wear but it’s nothing drastic."
4.0,could have stood to be a little loser fitting.
4.0,Cute colors. Easier to snap on than the original band. I just wish the purple wasn't the same shade as the one that came with.
4.0,a little snug but the fit ok overall
4.0,"I like the color options and the rugged design of this watch band. It seems very durable. My only complaint is that It’ll probably get kinda dirty, but that’s on my end. My hope is that it cleans up well."
4.0,I like the feel f the shirt but it is a little on the big side and a little long.
4.0,It was warm and soft and comfortable
4.0,"Ok, but very tight fitting. Need to have larger size, one size DON’T fit most!!!"
4.0,"Don't dry it! I'm 5'4&#34; (fairly short) and the dress is borderline too short for me to wear after drying it. Otherwise, very cute dress."
4.0,"Good support but even though the fabric is better than most leggings I've bought, they're still kind of see through in my booty area. Maybe I should have ordered one size up but I'm mostly happy with the fit otherwise."
4.0,a little small and could have a picture of the Falls.
4.0,"I absolutely love these earrings! They are small, not that heavy, and really cute! I get a lot of complements on these!<br />I am not giving it 5 stars only because the Starbucks logo is just a sticker placed on the earring, and the picture didn't give me that impression."
4.0,"I ordered a size 9 , I normally wear a 8 1/2 in heels. I love these shoes and I love the way they fit. I walked around the house in them and they seem comfortable , hopefully the feel that way when I wear them all day. Cute color(grapefruit) & it looks just like the picture ! I def recommend this sexy shoe"
4.0,"Really cute and fits well.  Just a little too long for my taste, so I hemmed it and its absolutely perfect!"
4.0,Really nice set of dangling earrings. Comfortable to wear and very easy to put on. Would make a really nice gift as well. The one pair that I had alittle trouble with is the one that is just a simple singular strand of silver... Had a hard time keeping this pair in because there's no backing that fits so it seemed to slip a bit... So be careful with this one. Have got compliments on all 4 pairs. Happy with them and think it was a good deal
4.0,"Decent quality, nice product"
4.0,but such a good look
4.0,Very good product. I used for party decorations and it was excellent
4.0,Small stain on collar but other than that it is great!
4.0,Purchased for a co-worker's birthday for an upcoming beach vacation. It's lightweight and fold flat for easy packing. Big enough to include a beach towel- no problem. It has a small interior pocket but would be a lot better if it was a larger/deeper pocket that would fasten closed- zipper or Velcro. I would gladly pay a few dollars more for a useful zipper pocket.
4.0,"The style & color is very nice. They are very light in weight, plastic! The case & authenticity card was included."
4.0,Cute!  Using as pull chain on my preschooler’s backpack. Not sure how long it will hold up.
4.0,"I did not realize the size, but I thought it was a bit too big."
4.0,"These are hella soft and super cute. I got the navy and the color is super like vibrant and it’s wonderful. The only issue is that the waist is too big :( like everything else fits fantastically but it’s just loose at the waist. But it might just be a me problem, I typically have this issue. But I would def recommend them"
4.0,Someone what loose fitting but still a good dress for work.
4.0,Husband said slightly musty odor
4.0,"I love Darn Tough Socks.  As far as I am concerned these are the best brand of socks money can buy.<br /><br />The Hiker socks and Athletic socks are different in terms of sizing.  I'll agree that the hiker socks also can run a little small.  At US-11, the Hiker socks can be a little snug, but are still comfortable.  I buy size Large.  They do shrink a little at first wash.<br /><br />These Athletic socks were just too darn small.  You should order a size up from where you normally buy socks, and that is especially true for the Athletic socks.  I should have bought XL.<br /><br />I'll buy again, but will upsize."
4.0,"Nice shirts. I got a medium so it’s a bit looser fit, but that is what I wanted. I am 5’5 and 150 lbs."
4.0,"I really appreciate it, however it's quite large, so I've decided to give it to a friend as a Christmas present."
4.0,"Nice bag for traveling, could be just a little bigger, once you put your wallet and cell phone in it there is no room for anything else the material does not give or stretch."
4.0,The colors are true to the photos. The leopard scarf is longer and fuller than the zebra one. Definitely like the leopard scarf better :3
4.0,"Super cute style. Made nice. Does not fit as snug as in the picture and a polyester blend, so will not shrink."
4.0,"Con's - Only $20 of each bag purchased goes to the charity, the bag is made in sweatshops in China, it isn't made from organic materials, and after Simon bought the ""FEED"" top for Alex on Real Housewives, I can't help but be reminded of their odd relationship every time I spot the tote.<br /><br />Despite this, if you're in the market for a tote bag, I still think it's a good pick. $20 is enough to feed a child in school for one year and rocking this bag spreads awareness of the United Nations World Food Program. Plus, it's cute and functional.<br /><br />I understand people's qualms with this bag. Buying a fashionable tote shouldn't be your only charitable contribution to the world. If you really want to help people as much as possible, give money straight to a charity and buy a $4 canvas bag.  I'm a firm believer that anonymous donations are the way to go. It is truly a selfless act.<br /><br />Speaking for myself (and I'm sure a few of you out there), there are a lot of things I spend more money on than necessary and don't give that money to charity. At least this bag does more than most."
4.0,A little to big but my son loves it.
4.0,Much smaller then we had hoped. He was so happy but only could wear it twice before it wasn’t a good fit
4.0,With 5 kids teacher gifts add up quick. I love that I found these as a pack at a good price! I do wish they had a little something extra but they are nice still.
4.0,"I liked the way it felt, but the seams on the one I received was frayed. Probably a simple machine error. Will buy again."
4.0,"The best was cute, very soft, and puffy.  Color was as shown.  My body type didn’t work for this vest."
4.0,Happy with this beanie fits perfect keeps my head warm
4.0,Great yoga socks for the money.
4.0,This t shirt was awesome but I had to give away because was to small. I got a 2x which is what I normally wear but fit like an XL. Super cute though
4.0,Love the pockets. I am 5'11&#34; and it hits above my ankles. It is large on me. I am inbetween sizes (L and XL) I bought the XL and  its a little big on me. I could of gone down a size. But I think its true to the size of what you purchase.
4.0,"These are very comfortable and soft. I wear a size 10 Wide shoes and these fit fine. They do shed a lot, and don't stay in place sometime. I would probable order them again tho."
4.0,"it's really soft and the width is great.<br />If you read other comments, you may have seen mentions of &#34;the paper-plate effect&#34; from the inserts... it's real and kind of obnoxious.<br />but they're easy to remove and replace with inserts you may have in bras you don't use anymore or newly bought inserts.<br />hmmm, actually, i bet they'd be Awesome with cutlets... aw yeah!"
4.0,This fits really well. It’s pretty long and could be worn as a dress or a long shirt. I really like the back. It looks super cute when wearing it.
4.0,Nice belt buckle.would recommend.
4.0,LIKE THE MATERIAL.  GOOD QUALITY.
4.0,"Very good quality, good-looking, as advertised.  Have only had it for a week or so, but it fits well (one size larger than your usual size) and appears designed for good strength and durability.  I'm quite satisfied."
4.0,"The rhinestone belt has a nice sparkle. The chair, however, is too long for a small frame."
4.0,"It's a classic, good-looking digital watch.  Just don't order if you have a large wrist - it won't fit.  I have a regular sized/normal wrist for a 5' 10"" guy and it just barely fits.  The functionality is as expected  - works well with the limtied functions available and if you want a good looking/retro inexpensive watch that is light and durable you are in luck.  I'm really glad I ordered it."
4.0,"This hoodie is incredibly soft and warm.  Its more cozy & comfortable than I had hoped, and the sizing is just as expected.  My only complaint is that the angle of the zipper isn't as drastic as it is in the picture.  In person it just looks like the hoodie is twisted a bit."
4.0,GREAT GIFTS!!
4.0,the lines aren't straight on the waist but cute light weight and perfect for a Summer in Phoenix. I plan on living in this.
4.0,"I knew in advance that it wasn't real cashmere, but the fabric was thin and cheap. HOWEVER, I love it. It's perfect in every way. Probably won't wash well."
4.0,la tela del producto es buena
4.0,I'm glad I ordered a large.  I normally wear a small/medium.  If you want it fitted get your normal size.  You want it a little loose and fit like a normal hoodie then I recommend sizing up.  Very cute.  I wear it quite often bc it's one of my favorite sweaters.  Good quality too.
4.0,Wore these once and there is a hole  Not sewing together well.
4.0,It’s soooo soft!! I absolutely love this sweater. the colors are beautiful (i got the orange brown and cream) I haven’t washed it yet so hopefully it washes easy
4.0,Very cute. Runs a little big. Material is pretty good. Not too cheap.
4.0,Medium fit me (female)and large fit my partner (male)
4.0,"Jacket looks OK but to small,if your a medium I would order a large,if your a large I would order an XX large."
4.0,Great graphic design on the face mask and very comfortable. The only thing that made me not give it 5 stars is the material is very thin and I'm worried it's going to stretch out fast. I think this is meant for only hot weather climates which is good. Very light weight and soft on your face.
4.0,"runs a little small, fabric a little scratchy"
4.0,"Fits very true to size. Hits mid hip as pictured for my wife who is tall. Color was slightly different- a bit more of a pastel pink, but that could be due to phone/computer screen. Still a great color and happy with the purchase. Pairs well with white<br />Or denim."
4.0,Good glasses for the price.  A lot sturdier than other similar glasses I have purchased.
4.0,Cute ....... package not opened yet
4.0,Good quality!!<br />But my daughter is size 6 and I bought size 9-10 and fit so well😳
4.0,"the belt is very nice, color is rich and has the feel and stiffness of a leather belt.  Size is a small issue as it is more of a 36&#34; belt rather than the 36 - 38&#34; it is advertised at.  so if you are closer to a 38, you should go one size up."
4.0,"Quality-wise, this thing is very good. The only real negative I have on it is the color description is really not accurate. I suppose ""gray"" can mean a lot of things, but I thought it would actually be more gray than this. The actual color I would describe as a very light tan with some grayish tones? Otherwise though, an excellent buy."
4.0,"Somewhat too big, especially on the heel.  They slip off still unless you intentionally put more stress on the heel part of the sock.  I do this by folding the toe side of the sock under my feet as I slip on my shoe."
4.0,This came with no instructions so had to figure out how to put it together.  Not as loud as I thought it would be and the key ring fell apart so I had to replace it.
4.0,A little loose but stays on and it’s cute
4.0,"They're very nice. I got compliments. the only problem is I have little hands, so the fingers in the gloves were too long. That couldn't be helped since they are one size fits all."
4.0,"Pretty dress, but made for young girls with more of a straight figure."
4.0,"This design and the made of the mask is the best when you add in the face shield or eye protection, it is one of the best of all mask in the market."
4.0,I was so excited to receive this shirt in green and when it arrived it was blue. I’m pretty disappointed but it’s still cute so I’m keeping it
4.0,"5' 8"", 220 lbs. Bought 2X.<br /><br />This a nice piece, but it is not a dress! It's more of a long shirt. Nevertheless, I pair it with fitted pants/leggings and it looks great! Made of sturdy, ribbed material."
4.0,Nice shirt and good quality but runs very long.  Good thing my grandson is very tall otherwise it would probably go down to his knees.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress., and I love the cut of it. I bought it to wear to a friend's wedding.<br /><br />Fit:<br />I purchased a medium. I have a 36 in. bust and I could probably fit into a small, but I have big arms so I sized up. The medium fits perfectly on my arms (not snug or pulling on the fabric). I have a small waist but big hips, so it's a bit big on my waist, but my hips make it flare a bit too much, making me look even bigger in the hips. So, the fit isn't exactly perfect for me, but I think it's designed for a more proportionate person. I still love the dress."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:407b62ce98e14cf6b109f6c4d3d376c1]] I usually am a size 4 in ring size and I order a size 5 but as you can see in video they fit perfectly, I gave 4 stars because I don't think is true to size. I should gone 2 size up from what I usually wear to be comfortable"
4.0,"These aren't bad. They are comfortable, but run a little small."
4.0,"Used these straps while traveling overseas. I'm always fearful of my luggage popping open or a zipper breaking and my underwear ending up all over the tarmac. Also this makes it easy to spot your luggage when it is on the carousel. Went to Germany and back with no issues and also to Hawaii, and multiple trips with in the lower 48. Well made."
4.0,I'm glad that it fits. Ordering online is a gamble. I'm pleased. Lays on me the way I like. It's not too bad on the thickness that was something I was worried about but it's cool for my liking
4.0,Its a slight tighter fit than I like
4.0,"Great Sandels a little stiff right out the box,  but after a couple of days they form to your feat and soften up!  Very comfortable!  Best bag for the buck!!!"
4.0,Other than the size being extremely small. The skiry itself was super cute and good quality. Definitely recommend just buy a size bigger.
4.0,"The included ear piece and nose piece caught my eyes, but the glass suction did not hold up long enough to prevent water leak. Could work for children though."
4.0,"I purchased the 1PC Vintage Flower Crystal Bubble Bib choker in the Green (#2). I purchased several of these necklaces on Amazon as stocking stuffers (for this price they simply cannot be beat!). A couple of things to note, it looks significantly more expensive than the ~$8 i paid for it, if i saw this exact same necklace in a boutique in the US, my best bet it would be between $25-$30. The necklace comes in those ugly long plastic bags which makes it seem cheaper but i took it out and put in a little jewelry box with some ribbon and it instantly became a chic present i'd be willing to give any of my trendy girlfriends. The picture makes the necklace look more turquoise than green (as the description states) but when it definitely looks more like a light lime green in person (think key lime pie green). Still very pretty but that was the main reason i took off 1 star. it just wasn't what i was expecting from the photo. the stones are textured (rather than smooth) which makes them look like a nicer quality. This particular one i gave away as a gift but kept several from this same store for myself because they were so beautiful. I've worn them several times for 10-12 hours at a time and they don't leave my neck green or itchy or anything of the sort."
4.0,Love my new purse. Just the way I imagine it would be.
4.0,I choose this rating because traveled from the United States to Afghanistan.  I need a silver pair of Cufflinks to match my Grey outfits.
4.0,"Very confortable nice, quality  and good price l like it."
4.0,"LOVE THEM BUT LOST THEM THE 2ND TIME I WORE THEM, THEY FLEW OFF MY HEAD WHEN I WAS RIDING IN THE BOAT."
4.0,Need to get a bigger cup size to fit better
4.0,I love the product they do not hurt my ears and my ears don't turn green but one pare was broke other then that just perfect
4.0,The hats are adorable but the gloves were too large.  A lace set wrist length would have been cuter with this set.
4.0,It's just very cool. I don't know how long the clock will last but I like that you can put a picture in it.
4.0,Items fits small. Order a size bigger than your normal.
4.0,They are bigger than I thought don't lay real close to the top of your nose so will snag alot but they are very pretty to wear out just not on a daily & the rings are perfect.
4.0,Love this product. Not too long. Not heavy. Very thin however so be careful around things that can snag it. Color is just as in the picture
4.0,This is a nice little gadget for the purse. This purse and handbag light is great. It has a soft but bright glow and it's lightweight. Hook it to the inside of your purse and it lights up the interior. It is motion activated so it doesn't stay on constantly. This has really come in handy for me.
4.0,I gave these earrings to my daughter for Christmas.  They arrived in a timely manner and were as pictured.  She really liked them but did mention they were a little heavy. All in all we were satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,"Very pretty, looks exactly like picture, and arrived earlier that expected.<br />But, in some parts it's a wee bit defected. Like the metal in melted slightly.<br />Other than that it's great. I get tons of compliments on it.<br />Also, its very fragile,so it break easily."
4.0,"Works ok but very loud can't stay in the bedroom.<br />Updated review Jan 03, 2017<br />I added two more stars for the service this company provided. The customer service rep contacted me and was apologetic and offer to send me a new winder. Unfortunately I declined the offer since I am from Canada and it would be to much of a hassle to cross the boarder the 2nd time to pick up. She was nice enough to offer a partial refund for the purchase and I am satisfy with that. I am a light sleeper so the winder is currently sitting in my closet room. It's working fine my watches are current and it's nice to have the extra storages for my earrings"
4.0,"I like the lighter, graduated color on these. Compared to other bifocal sunglasses, I find it easier to read with these because the tint is much lighter in the reading portion of the glass.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that of the three pair I ordered originally, all came with scratches on the lenses. I think the ""complimentary lanyard"" that they include in the package, which has metal parts, is scratching the lenses during shipment.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Good: I ordered a fourth pair, which did NOT include a lanyard, and consequently was scratch-free.<br /><br />Not as good: I keep one pair in a car that is often parked outside in a very hot environment. One lens became crazed after a year or so. However, these work so well that I'm happy to treat them as disposable and regularly replace them via a new Amazon purchase."
4.0,"I love the look and feel of this hat. It is well-made with quality materials. However, I wasn't too keen on the fit. I typically wear a size 7 in a fitted hat (small-medium) but thought this hat fit a bit smaller than it should. It wasn't actually tight on my head, but something about the cut or style made the had look a bit dwarfed on my size 7 head. Was sad to have to return it."
4.0,"i love this dress but i was expecting it the be the bright electric blue that was pictured ( and what looks like most others received ) I bought this dress to go with some other accessories that are the electric blue. It's okay because I know how to dye clothes I just dye it to be my electric blue. as far as everything else, the fit is great!! the sizing is practically perfect, and for those who don't know, the seams ARE suppose to be raised on the outside. The smooth side is the INSIDE of the dress. It's very soft and comfortable as well."
4.0,"These are good quality socks. The packaging was a little over done in my opinion - very classy, but unnecessarily fancy. I would rather have bare-bones packaging and a lower price. That said, the color is perfect, and the quality is very good."
4.0,"I wish they came in half size, but over all they still work, good arch"
4.0,I truly like my outfit. I wear them for pj's.
4.0,I am very satisfied with the product for its quality and price I recommend the seller
4.0,"My daughter picked this out for my wife as a present and while we love it and that it’s a locket, we wish it has a necklace that came with it. I guess I didn’t look/read hard enough, I just assumed that it should come with at least a standard size necklace. But it is very pretty and my fighter (5) was thrilled at her choice for her mom! :)"
4.0,I like the length and not tight around the middle. Will see how it washes an wears.
4.0,"These are really thin which is great for keeping cool, but they roll up at the bottom when I move around. Full disclosure, I’m a bit fluffy but I bought the suggested size and they still roll up. I wouldn’t buy them again, but they are ok."
4.0,Hubby enjoys them! He calls them his fishing glasses because he states that he can visually see better when looking out in to the water.
4.0,"This dress fits as I expected it to, I wear a size 16 and bought a size XL. It's loose and flowy on me and an appropriate length, about lower thigh area (I'm 5'5&#34;). The only comment I have would be that the stitching can be a little bit itchy at first. I got used to it after a while of wearing it but be aware in case you are sensitive to things like that. All in all I'm happy with the purchase and I like the way the dress looks on me."
4.0,"The helmet is nice , I have one complaint and that is the chin strap is not very long and I don't have a Jay Leno chin . It is a nice looking helmet and feels good ."
4.0,Really wish the extendable visor would slide completely in to conceal the silver part. Both sides show about half inch of the silver area. I'd rate a 5 star if that part didn't show.<br /><br />I like that the extendable part of the visor glides easily & smoothly. Really good for beach days also.
4.0,"Fit as expected!! Didn’t realize the crotch was open from tummy all the way back to my back, but I’d say that was a pleasant surprise! The top doesn’t like to stay in place and if you’re busty at all you’re gonna pop out, and there’s not really any support, but it’s really cute and sexy still!! Completely sheer, and a brighter color than what’s in the picture. And as far as lingerie goes, it’s pretty comfy, even when you’ve got everything hanging out"
4.0,"I ordered a size up, and it fit great! The hearts are super cute"
4.0,"Was looking for a sheer, cheap sock... This fits the bill...  They are not fitted for left or right, but have a generic shape that should fit either foot.  The socks sizing is pretty spot on..."
4.0,"Very cute and good quality. Nice addition to my collection of earrings, versatile enough to wear with casual or more formal."
4.0,My son is very pleased with his new robe!
4.0,Lightweight. The light is dim.
4.0,"This is a cute suit if you have the body for it.  It is higher cut than I anticipated, so it's not flattering around my hip area. There is a good amount of coverage in butt area.  The suit seems to be well made. I like the mesh straps and detailing, which makes it look a bit sexy.  It doesn't pull on your neck, which I find in some one-piece suits."
4.0,"Honestly I really like these pants. The waist is perfect for someone even 3 times my size but the issue that came up was that the legs aren't quite as long as you'd expect so they ended up a bit high-water compared to what I hoped for. As a 6'4&#34; person I can't complain too much about that so I only docked one star, I just expected better since my leg length is a 34 and the description claims the length of these at 42."
4.0,Color was more orange than red.  Shirt runs small.
4.0,"Terrible strong factory odor  once  removed from package but overall GREAT shirt.  I wear an 16-18 pants so I ordered the 8x/US 18 and its perfect.  I have 4 of these shirts  now and I love them so much!  Great length although a tiny bit longer would be nice,  great fit in the shoulders,  arms, chest, and waist (I'm not very top heavy).  I will purchase more in the future."
4.0,Sturdy chain for most pendants.  Just wish it came with a claw clasp.
4.0,"Love this necklace, lightweight, but don't put a lot of wear and tear with this necklace it is economically friendly ."
4.0,Good quality shorts but the large fit like XXL.
4.0,It's very cute but the length is really short for my taste. I am just 5.2 and yet I feel that way - guess will be a problem for someone taller.
4.0,"The slipper is wonderful  and fits well.  My foot is narrow and I need the extra insole to tighten the fit.  The slipper is 10 1/2, but the insoles provided with them are 8 1/2.  Since I don't have an insole stretcher, I used the ones from my previous slipper.  Fits very well now.  I would hope that oversight is rare."
4.0,"Runs somewhat small, fits great on shoulders and chest but a little too snug on the waist"
4.0,This dress is an amazing deal! I was shocked by the high quality for the price. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that's it seems to run a bit large. I ordered a small and its fairly loose for a small.
4.0,"It is a nice dress, a bit longer than what I expected based on the pictures. The material is thin enough that I will likely have to get a slip to go underneath it."
4.0,These earrings are exactly described by the seller. This earring can be left in the ear for sleeping or showering.  They are very light and have a nice diamond cut.
4.0,Material on the inside was wanting to slide up my arms. Outside material is pretty just as pictured
4.0,I love the wallet but the zipper keeps getting off track.
4.0,"Beautiful fine shoe but it runs too small, I bought a 4 for my son but it did not fit. Good thing that I have a smaller nephew who can use it but I will have to buy a 5 for my son and I don't see the same kind available in 5 :-("
4.0,"I like these joggers well enough, and I’m thrilled to have some that are short enough for me, but dang, they’re form fitting. I think I would prefer something that isn’t quite so clingy, but I think I can pull it off. The fabric is nice, not too thick, not too thin, and the pockets are nice and deep. My entire large iPhone fits in there just fine. I’m right at the cusp between a M and L, I think, as the waist is almost loose on me, but as you can see, the legs are a bit fitted, but I definitely have big legs, so that’s probably why. In jeans I’m a size 8 or 29 in Levi’s, if that helps with sizing info for anyone else. I think I’ll probably wear these as lounge pants around the house more than anything else, but they’re definitely cute and comfy, and most importantly, short enough for me. It’s so hard to find things that are short enough when you’re 5’1”, so of course I snapped these up. They’re definitely a bit too thin for winter wear, or if you’re going to, have a base layer pair of leggings underneath, but I think they’ll be ideal for the rest of the year. I do admit that I feel a bit self conscious going out in them since they’re quite fitted, but I shouldn’t, as I wear jeans that are just as snug, if not more so. I guess I feel like jeans hide more of my flaws than these do, but I also don’t feel like these are featuring my flaws, or they would have been returned immediately. All in all, I’d recommend them to my fellow petite women, but know that if you’re pear shaped and have thicker legs like me, they’re gonna be snug."
4.0,They fit very well and the support is just where i needed to relieve my pain that after 1 1/2 months of continual use has eliminated it completely. Thank you very much!!
4.0,"This dress is a bit unusual, but comes in a pretty print. The sizing seems off, with a larger bust/shoulder and sleeve portion and tighter in the stomach area. Its made from a stretchy jersey and I ordered a size up, but I didn't like how tight it was across my stomach. I'm a 20/22 with a large bust, so I think it would be large for anyone, and I was surprised as these are usually where I have an issue with it being too small. Overall its nice, but a bit of a jumble in how it fits."
4.0,"I've never ordered sleeves before, I have a lot of full sleeve compression shirts, I wear a Large in those, so I figured a large would be fine. Should have measured my arms. Bit snug with the elastic band, which full sleeve compression shirts do not have. Popped a few stitches, when I pulled them off from the bottom. You definitely want to pull them off from the top. Will have to fix those before using them. The fabric is nice and I like the print a lot. Would buy again, just in a bigger size."
4.0,I didnt receive the 6mm backing so I had to send it back since it was too long. Pretty earring though.
4.0,"The suit was great except that I followed the sizing guide and the pants were way too big at the waist. I was able to find substitute pants, but I was really unhappy they didn't fit after I took my son's measurements. Quality fine for the price. Arrived well packed with not even a wrinkle."
4.0,Its a costume piece so what more can you expect. Returned them because i didnt end up needing them for Halloween. Feathers looked great but little piece kept falling of from just unpacking them. Oddly they feel better than the ones they sell at costume stores.
4.0,loved the skirt and it fit well I am a 6/8 and the bottom fit really well.  the band was comfortable the under short was a tad big but not noticeable with the skirt.  If I would have done a smaller size the band of the skirt would have been too tight.  The top was way way way too large though.  like unbelievable large. smh
4.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; and 135 lbs, 36C bust---generally a solid USA size 6, trending towards an 8.  I bought this in a medium, and it is just the right length but too large everywhere else (in bust and waist).  The dress is well-made, but I don't like the look of the shorter skirt under longer dress (would have preferred if it were lined all the way down), so rather than take the chance on trading for a size small (which might be too short or too tight) I am just returning it and not reordering.  A medium would fit a busty size 8 or a size 10."
4.0,Great for work comfortable
4.0,It's the cutest hat but was wrinkled when I received it.  I tried to wet it down a bit but it wouldn't reshape. Next I'll try soaking in water for a while. I want it to fit right!
4.0,"This was more lightweight than I expected. But true to color and size, ties up nicely and a little dressy."
4.0,"Runs a little big, but SUPER CUTE!  Daughter loves it!"
4.0,"They are comfortable but they are very thin and one of them ripped at the seem the first time I put them on.<br /><br />Update:  Now that I have had a couple pairs for a while I really like these socks.  They are tight, they take a bit of finesse to get them on without ripping them.  I can wear them for 2-3 days before they stretch out and slide down, wash them and they are good as new."
4.0,"Very pretty, but runs big."
4.0,"These inserts have a solid plastic layer from heel to toe. Very thin padding layer. It’s a good value compared to the $50 ones sold at REI, but slightly less comfortable. Due to the full-length plastic layer, they are a bit tough to cut to size."
4.0,Length is little short
4.0,Working perfectly
4.0,"Ok. The top is rounded,so it will not sit level, upside down- but will do the job. thank you for the prompt service"
4.0,many compliments when I wore this dress. I looked good.
4.0,Softness of material
4.0,"This costume is true to size and is really cute.  It's just very see-through and short so I had to buy some biker shorts to go underneath.  Other than that, very happy with it."
4.0,Love it a little awkwardly cut but still wear it all the time
4.0,Well made and nice material. Just wish it came with the white undershirt!
4.0,"Good ties, colors true, built to last."
4.0,Wore it to complete a khaleesi outfit for Halloween. Worked out great!
4.0,I like them. Got them for the polarization and the wrap around.
4.0,The beads was smaller than I wanted but still good
4.0,"Very nice.  Arrived much sooner than the estimated date.I have a rather large head so hat does not slouch on me, but still fits and looks nice. Has a pile lining that should be very warm."
4.0,Just as described! Loved!
4.0,"It's prettier in person! Very nicely made, and has just the right amount of weight to it. So for the price, it's worth getting."
4.0,The graphics are well done and the fit is good on this zip sweatshirt. The fabric is adequate but not high quality. For the price I’d expect better material. Lightweight and soft … overall I like it.
4.0,"These sweatshirts are comfy, THICK, roomy but not too baggy and really well made. I am 5'9"" so I wish they were just 1"" longer in the sleeves but that's just a problem I've learned to deal with in women's clothing. I have ordered 3 so far."
4.0,I just wish the clip on the back could be shorter for skinny ties.
4.0,"Beautiful band, a little more flimsy than I had anticipated. This band had an easy snap on/off attachment, overall a lightweight sturdy band."
4.0,The ones on the middle finger in the picture are about the same size so they don't line up quite like that but they're super cute and I love them
4.0,"I like them a lot, simple yet elegant"
4.0,"As with the other, very nice. I like these type of hats."
4.0,"Nice,fits very soft and good quality"
4.0,"is an ok little hat, it was purchased for my husband and he liked it ok.  It fix well and of course anything on him  looks awesome.  Would give it 41/2 stars.  the dogs loved it as they chewed it up.  Yes, we would recommend the hat.  Helen E French is writing this not Richard"
4.0,Love the looks and it's larger than some others. These make more room in my purse than a standard eyeglasses case since I carry sun and regular glasses.  The only thing I wish were different is the interior is the back side of the outside (not lined like some other's I've bought) and is a little rougher than I'd like for my expensive prescriptions glasses.
4.0,Decent shoe for the price
4.0,"Great product. Sturdy and works well. A little difficult to put through the top shirt button hole, but no more difficult than usual for trying to fasten the top button. I've used them on a few shirts that the collar was just a little too small. So I do not use them on a regular basis, but when I have used them, they have worked perfectly well. They stretch well as advertised and they have not broken yet so I have no complaints and would recommend it to whoever needs them."
4.0,"Beautiful, but fits smaller than expected"
4.0,"The dress fit as expected. I was worried how low cut the v-neck was going to be but it is just right. I went with the size ""L"". I am 5'6"" and usually wear a size 12 pants. The material is nice with a little give to it and not too thin. I love the length and the pockets too!"
4.0,Beauitful dress
4.0,I’m very happy with my no show socks.  They stay on my feet like they’re supposed to so I’m not adjusting them throughout the day.  I also like how discreet they are when wearing them.  Thank you.
4.0,A little big bigger than what I expect. Kind of heavy. The earing back did not hold well. I need to find a pair of disk earing back for it.
4.0,"This bag is a little smaller than I'd hoped, forcing me to pack it carefully when the 4 of us are going to the pool, we ARE able to take only the one bag and not be overly worried about wet toys, towels, etc.  One of the other parents at the baby pool even asked where I'd gotten mine since he'd like to upgrade to something similar!  All in all, I'm mostly pleased with this bag."
4.0,"I love The Haunted Mansion so this is a perfect band for me! It’s so pretty and stays on great. It also doesn’t make my arm get sweaty like some others. I did take a star off because on the part with the clip the purple coloring was not on all the way-it looked faded. Overall, it didn’t take away from the band so I still love it!"
4.0,"These clips are great for helping keep up with mask. The clips are a little hard to get on the ear loops, but once there, they stay. Serve the intended purpose well."
4.0,"Only giving 4 stars because it was missing 2 rhinestones, I still love it!"
4.0,Got this for my 9 year old to wear when she plays soccer and it's great! Stays in her hair which is thick and silky!<br />Holds her bangs back out of her face!! She loves it!
4.0,to heavy..
4.0,"Beautiful, but the chain is a bit small for men- clasp could be bigger too."
4.0,"They're very comfortable to walk in. The round front toe part makes my feet look somewhat smaller. The strap is not the kind you can un-button, it's sewed on. So you have to squeeze your feet in when you wear them. They're cute overall."
4.0,Tighter fit than expected.
4.0,Very cute! My daughter is obsessed with them. The quality is ok. A bit over priced for the quality.
4.0,Absolutely love this cute ring but isn’t always great for every day wear because the horns get caught on everything. Doesn’t stab my fingers but when horns get caught it can be a pain to get unhooked. Horns and helmet are very durable but the band can get bent out of shape semi-easily. All in all a great ring though and I love it.
4.0,Material looks cheap close up but very pretty otherwise
4.0,I thought it would be a lower cut but I guess it’s not terrible. I wanted it low because I breast feed but it has stretch to it so it still works. I’m also pregnant so it’s nice to have something fit as I grow and then shrink again. It’s too long for me. I’m 5’3” but I don’t mind I just tie it. I’m planning on putting on a belt or shirt top to make it more flattering cause by itself.not so much...
4.0,"So cute. I bought a medium. I’m 5,6” 145lbs. Hopefully it doesn’t shrink because it fits perfectly."
4.0,Bigger than i expected but still beautiful. I use it as a key chain with all my others and its beautiful.
4.0,"Perfect! Stretches to fit all kinds of bodys. Care full of you have a &#34;fuller&#34; butt, it might be a bit shorter. Looks great!"
4.0,"I ordered this dress in a XL for a party, unfortunately I had to return.  I like this dress fit well in the chest area, fit right above the knee, but didn't like the way it fit in the hip area.  I returned the dress, but will reorder in a larger size, (hopefully I will have better luck) for another event later this year."
4.0,"The locket is everything the description says it is, however it came on a SILVER chain, not the black one I had been expecting.  It did however come with 12 tiny birthstones!"
4.0,"Great! It’s a bit longer then I had anticipated, but it holds a lot of things that a shorter one would not."
4.0,I love the material and the fit. The neckline is a little too low for me especially when I wear it to work but nothing a cami won’t fix. It’s super stretchy and I like the addition of the pockets. Perfect length just passed the knees. The color of the fabric in the photos is bright and vibrant but the actual fabric on the dress is more muted.
4.0,"The item description says ""waterproof"" but when the pants arrived, the label says, ""water resistant"".  We need waterproof pants, not water resistant.  Aside from the discrepancy, the pants appear to be nice quality."
4.0,"This product does make the Crocs look like new. There does not seem to be very much of it, so I don't know how long it lasts."
4.0,Slightly shorter on me but I'm tall! otherwise i love this dress and am considering ordering more :) also all my girlfriends have asked for one too!
4.0,Feels like a much higher quality watch than it is. Wrist band is slightly inflexible but it's a great casual watch and very attractive looking.
4.0,I like them overall<br />I’m 5’8 and long legs and torso<br />175lbs (Ugh)<br />Fit well do pull them up during day but over for better than XL Stevie old Navy (i fall between l and xl in those)<br />Definitely wash cold no dryer<br />Great fit would recommend
4.0,They're a little heavy but beautiful!
4.0,I like the style and colors. I was told to order my size but its to big so I quests this product runs big. I haven't worn them yet because they are a little to big
4.0,nice get alot of comps
4.0,Very good quality<br />Recieved in avtimely manor
4.0,"I bought this for a trip and didn't want to worry about losing it, will see how it lasts."
4.0,I really liked this crop top. The size does seem to run small though. Love the stretch and it provides the perfect amount of coverage.  My issue was the thickness of the fabric.  It's almost a sweater-knit type fabric which made it way too hot to layer with in the summer months.
4.0,"So soft, so nice."
4.0,"5 1” 115lbs 33/34 chest, Small fits appropriately snug.  The waistband stitch on the inside has plastic fibers that cause itching. Some of the pieces are small and easily pull out and as far as I can tell, have no bearing on the integrity of the stitching.  So why is it there, I don’t yet know. Same clear plastic tread used on name tag at the neck.<br />Some of the seams have half the amount of fabric overlap (arms), so this could be the issue of ‘one season’ or not lasting as some have mentioned.<br />I’m giving 3 stars and will edit my review once I’ve had a chance to wash the dress.  I plan to use a delicate short cold water cycle.  I use the dryer a few minutes on low and hang dry the rest of the way (in general).<br /><br />UPDATE:  So while the stitching could have been better, I have to say I love the design, fit, & color (green & aqua botanical leaves on black) I intend on hand washing, so the stitching shouldn’t be an issue for me.  A front loader would be better than a top loader washing machine.  The Tag says Do NOT tumble dry.  The fabric says 100% Polyester so I don’t know why it can’t be put in the dryer on delicate, but I probably won’t chance it, because it may fade the vibrant color or rough up the fabric.  Just guessing."
4.0,"I am very impressed with the vivid colors, they are all very complimentary. They aren't  stretchy at all, so kinda appear lose or too large, but as form fitting as I'd likely"
4.0,"Given as a gift, Looks as described, my niece loves it and says it doesn't catch on her clothes like others."
4.0,"This is a very nice open front cardigan. Fits very well and is soft and comfortable. My only issue is, it’s not slub Jersey knit. Slub Jersey knit is a lightweight t-shirt material. This is more of a lightweight sweater material, which is not what I was going for. I’ll be keeping it anyway because it’s looks great, is very comfortable, and good quality."
4.0,"this shirt was really pretty and it fit well, it’s just see- through."
4.0,Cute and fit good. Only downside is one is starting to come apart at the seam. Not sure if my daughter pulled too tight and it just came off. Not that noticeable.
4.0,It doesn’t fit exactly how I’d expect for a “custom fitting” shirt.
4.0,Very cute Kind of different material But I like it
4.0,"They are a bit smaller than my other set of lace low cut socks (different brand). I'm a 8W. Also, they aren't quite no show, and one pair slipped a bit on a longer walk.  I just got them, so I'm not sure about the longevity yet."
4.0,"Although these sunglasses are very cute, the mirrored  lense is too intense, also, this style frame does not look good on me"
4.0,"According to the picture the color looked to be darker. When I received it the color was just the right shade for my taste.  The outside of the bag is well made and does have a lot of room. Was very disappointed in the lining. Made of a composite  cloth and plastic, it sounds lite the rustling of a plastic grocery bag if things shift on the inside. Hard on bags, will be interesting to see how long it lasts."
4.0,"These earrings are very cute. VERY lightweight. Maybe too lightweight. One of my stars were bent, but I just bent it back into shape. They are very long.  They actually hit my collarbone when on. I'd say there 5-5 1/2 inches. I might have to remove one of the stars. Glad I bought them"
4.0,Not a flattering fit if you're curvy
4.0,It is nice fabric and nicely made but a bit narrow in body and hips and a bit costly. Sadly Will have to return
4.0,"Very good quality. Shipping was excellent, dress arrived in time to wear for wedding. It is very much like the picture. A little difficult to zip as the zipper snagged several times. Otherwise, you can't beat the price."
4.0,Very cute. Fits big. And material is not comfy.
4.0,Fit was pretty true if not a tab bit small. They took a couple of days to break in but overall are very comfortable. Had to get used to the flat bottom and not have a heel. The arch support is ok.
4.0,"Good quality, came fast but the size wasn't perfect and the smaller size for sure is gonna be small."
4.0,"Works good! It is very tight, for my 8 month old it didnt bother her the tightness but for my 5 year old he found it to tight to wear for a long time. It fits me but was also squeezing to tight but the noise defiantly is lower so at least it helps protect my babys ears. I would recommend this more for a baby then an older child."
4.0,"Arrived very fast, it's soft and cute - purchased it for an 8 year old - my only only only issue with it is the zippers - although all of the zippers slid smoothly, the side zippers did open in the middle a couple of times"
4.0,I tried for a color most nearly matching my granddaughter's college colors. She thought the socks were great. A lot of tyhe girls are wearing socks like these.
4.0,Ordered a size larger because I was nervous it would be too small but it fits great and has extra room to move now!  They are killer! Light material and comfy to wear all day. Shipping took a while but it was so worth it! Purchasing additional colors!
4.0,somewhat small but beautiful
4.0,Nice quality-comfortable
4.0,Cute shirt that fits well. The stars are more pronounced in person. I think the fabric might be slightly shiny. Still nice!
4.0,Very pretty dress in person.  So comfortable and flowy.  You might wanna wear something underneath because its material is kind of thin.
4.0,My child doesnot take off his glasses as much
4.0,The only complain is that one of the clip's rubber/soft plastic fell off after a few months.
4.0,Really like it but it gets a little tangled when m<br />not wearing it
4.0,"Purchased for my daughter.  Other than the sizing, which I accounted for based on the reviews, it fit as as I hoped it would. She's norally wears a medium in adult clothes so I purchased this is an adult large which fit her perfectly. It has lost some of its coloring and stitching at the fin area has popped loose during the 1st use.  It's nothing a little mending won't fix but don't expect it to last through numerous uses/swims."
4.0,Very cute glasses and I feel hottt! The reason I give it a 4 star is because they are a bit loose and it pulls on my hair but overall great:)
4.0,"Shirt made in the maximum allowable values for each size of standard table sizes, so for some buyers it makes sense to buy one size down. Otherwise it's a good product at a very competitive price."
4.0,Got these for my daughter. Her and her friends have so much fun changing them out and trying new styles.
4.0,Nice band came with multiple springs only things is it is difficult to get on Besides that I have no complaints
4.0,"I am around 160 lbs and a 36D and bought a large. I felt as though the large was a bit too big, and the material is quite stretchy, so I think that a medium would have worked, but when I would sit down in the large, by entire butt was sitting on the seat (the dress is quite short). The dress is also quite thick, so it would be better for nighttime or whenever it is a bit chilly. All in all, it is a nice dress, perfect for fancy occasions."
4.0,Beautiful colors!! Bright pink and blue w a little white and it stands out with a tan. The bottoms are adjustable w the side ties and the top is a tad on the small side but manageable. Material is decent definitely not high end but super cute for the price point!  See pic
4.0,The product is exactly as pictured. It did get dirty quickly as I do use it on a daily basis.
4.0,These cleats look sweet and I really want to order them but i don't know what the sizes are or if they only have one size. so if any one can tell me as soon as possible that'd be great! I wear an 11 or 11.5 by the way..
4.0,"I'm always interested in wearing shorts that I can sleep in and work out. These ""crinkle"" shorts are more on the workout side, but despite some reservations I was able to sleep in them just fine.<br /><br />That said, these shorts are really suited for sweating while working out, which I'm not particularly fond of. It's not quite as stretchy as I like, but was still comfortable enough to sleep in. The pocket is pointless (I've learned this the hard way, do NOT put a phone in your pocket while running!) but I appreciate the effort anyway."
4.0,The band is a good quality product but it’s not as wide as the original band. If you like you’re band wide then this might be a problem. Other then that I would recommend it.
4.0,"Comfy, soft, and light. Really cute. Long enough to were as a dress. Im 4'11."
4.0,"They fit!!<br />Finally a winter boot that is wide enough for me, and I have tried a lot of top brands.  I wear a 9 wide and these boots fit right out of the box and I can even wear thick socks.  They are also very warm...I wore them one day in below zero temperatures.  I didn't give them a five star because I don't know how well they will hold up yet.  Very pleased so far!"
4.0,"Decent quality for costume. Took a while to ship, but arrived well before quoted time. Be sure to order well before Halloween/con, etc, just to allow it time to ship, since I think the seller also gets overloaded with other costume orders. Good experience and I am pretty pleased with the sweater. There are no tags, and it is clearly costumy, but it will work well for my purposes"
4.0,"Cute pattern, material is kind of heavy for high temperature days, doesn't breathe well. I like the dress though, and the fit is fine."
4.0,"This is a nice pant/skirt set and I love the material and the fact that it has pockets. My one gripe is I really wish the skirt was shorter or maybe had more of a flare because it looks kinda dull just hanging over top of pants and you can very much tell that the leggins are pants and not tights or something.<br />I would say this is a good set if you enjoy going to church or other ""conservative"" places and you want to be warmer than you would in tights/pantyhose...this is great for that and the material is nice for colder weather wear.<br />Edit to add that I am 5'4 and the skirt goes past my knees so maybe if a woman were taller the skirt would be a better length."
4.0,It was alright .the metal cage that holds the pearl tarnished quick69
4.0,This is a great dress for the price. The only problem was the straps on the shoulder I just couldn’t get it to sit right on me
4.0,"Slightly too small but some minor adjustment made them work. I measured my baby's foot to 4.25 inches, the description says the small size is 4.33 inches, since 4.25 is smaller than 4.33 it should fit, right? I guess not. Maybe the 4.33 inch measurement is the outside of the shoe, not the inside measurement. Since we needed them for a wedding that weekend we cut off the bow, cut a slit down the middle to the toe, and sewed the bow over the slit. Still tight but gave enough room for her foot to fit. Seller needs to clarify sizing measurements, is the shoe size inside or outside dimensions?"
4.0,"So cute, just bummed it was a little small."
4.0,I liked it. Had I not received it as part of the vine program would I have kept it? Probably not. The color gold just seems a little off and it tangles a little easier than I’d like. But if someone gave it to me as a gift I wouldn’t have been disappointed or hated it. It’s just not everything I hoped it would be.
4.0,Delicate and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. It’s also made of another metal so i hope it doesn’t tarnish or chip.
4.0,I like this dress. It is stretchy and clings inall the right places!
4.0,"I ordered burgundy, got it before the scheduled date. It’s cute but not burgundy, more red. It does sparkle though. I was going to keep it myself but decided to give it to a friend who likes bright colors like that. It is cute though."
4.0,Shirt runs small. I would order 1 size up. I typically wear a Large and had to reorder in an XL. I do wash it in cold water and air dry.
4.0,"This is a comfortable and amply sized flannel robe.  Would not be ankle length on anyone over about 5'10"" though."
4.0,Cute. Not as shiny as the pic.
4.0,excellent for everyday or athletic wear.
4.0,"I'm 5""8"", 165-170lbs, & wear 34DD. I debated purchasing a large or medium, but opted for large. I'm glad I did! Large fits my chest just right. Wouldn't have had room in the medium size. plenty of room in waist. You could wear this while pregnant! Dress hits right above ankles. Plan on buying another color. My only complaint is that the slit comes half way down."
4.0,The quality seems great. The sizing is a little large so if you have a small kiddo these will be loose.
4.0,i'm knocking one star of this because the blue and the pink are lighter than i expected them to be they're still pretty though and the 5 fits perfectly
4.0,"Bought these for an 80's party I was throwing for a friend and they were GREAT! Kids loved them, adults loved them, and they glowed really brightly.  They don't necessarily glow for a long time, but they are nice for a short time (few hours at most)."
4.0,The sleeve and breast area was bigger than expected. Over ALL the dress is nice!
4.0,Not as thick and sturdy as Croc's brand but it's a great variety for a low cost!
4.0,Was too short for me though.
4.0,"I do not like the shiny material.  It is comfortable, fits well, good color"
4.0,"I like the pattern, but it was made little size smaller. I gave it to my son instead."
4.0,"I always shop for reasonably priced garment with good quality and a touch of street style... After going through my pregnancy and postpartum recovery, I absolutely has fallen in love with the maternity clothes, and am looking for clothes with the same qualities ever since: stretchy yet body hugging, soft but not see through neutral colored clothes that can be wear both indoors and outdoors when I have to take the baby to run errands etc. I love this dress mainly for its comfortability and I adore the color grey. I am 5'3 and 140lb, and this dress fits as expected."
4.0,Nice overall. But size was too large.
4.0,Look very stylish.
4.0,Not the sturdiest pair of cotten gloves but fine for my purposes of wearing them to parties and church.
4.0,"Used size chart.  Wanted compression.  Size chart showed should be between XXL and XXXL. Since XXL was the largest shown I ordered it.  Received my shirts as expected put one on and it did not have the compression I was expecting.  Upon checking the size is XXXL.  They are nice shirts for under or outer wear, but will have to get XL for the compression I want."
4.0,Very pretty and comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that it sometimes gets caught on clothes and falls off so I'm worried about losing it.
4.0,Not soft material I thought bet very cute
4.0,Not the highest quality material. Very comfortable. Worth the price.
4.0,"Working as I was expecting when I bought these shoes, worth the price"
4.0,"CUTE PANTS, BUT ZIPPER/CROTCH AREA FITS REALLY WEIRD"
4.0,Arm band for my iPhone watch is great. Just wish they were a bit longer.
4.0,I love the look but very thin. I thought it would have been a thicket knit.
4.0,They turn long way better once you put it on. Also the price is really good. Great deal
4.0,"Nice leather hat, great price."
4.0,Great product but runs small request a size up
4.0,This dress is so comfortable and cute my only issue is that the color faded a little after I washed it.
4.0,Really good like it a lot.
4.0,"Love the color, the same as in picture. Nice material. Good thing I ordered small. I usually wear medium. 5'4"" 127 lbs. It is loose (tummy area) and has many pleats front and back. Goes very well with leggings or skinny jeans. Only reason I gave four stars is it does not give the illusion of slimness like some tunics."
4.0,The stitching on the couch starts to get all weird and fray after washing
4.0,"Perfect for my intended usage - shower sandals at the gym.  They are lightweight and don't absorb any water, which is useful when storing the in your gym bag after getting dressed."
4.0,Just a little shorter than I thought they would be but OK.  They are sexy and fun but they don't stay up well... gotta keep pulling them up.
4.0,"Watch has a nice gray dial. Blue silicone strap is nice and soft, also looks great with a white silicone, or tan leather strap.  NOTE: it's a 43-44mm diameter case (without crown), not 35mm as listed in description."
4.0,Very nice. Only complaint is that my daughter complains of the weight.  They are pretty heavy.
4.0,"It fits perfectly but packaging was a bit sloppy, other than that it was fine"
4.0,"Had to take this in 3-4 inches as my measurements are a bit on the small side (30&#34; x 23&#34; 33&#34;). Wish it came with a nice thigh high slit, but that was easy enough to put in myself. Fabric is warm and hugs the body well. May or may not need tape depending on your bust size. Definitely sexy."
4.0,"I really liked the dusky pink color! Thought this was be a good easy breezy dress for quarantine season. I can lounge in it at home and run out in it for errands or curbside pick up! The cuffed sleeves unroll a bit and the edges are raw so that's a bit eh but if you iron them down, its a quick fix. Overall happy with it! Ordered a medium and it ran a little large but I like the loose fit!"
4.0,"Fits really well, good quality thick material. Lovely for the office"
4.0,"This is a good quality silicone ring. It is comfortable with the relief molded into the inside of the ring. I found that to be the very reason I quit wearing the ring as well. I'm a nurse and with repeated handwashing and sanitizing there was a build-up of soap/sanitizer that doesn't really get rinsed out that well, also the relief molding is another area for transient bacteria to accumulate. I wnt back to my plain old gold wedding band..."
4.0,"Somewhat small, made nicely !"
4.0,The style is beautiful but not comfortable especially if you’re on your feet for long periods of time. Seems to be very cheaply made. I had a similar style from the same brand but these do not fit as well and as comfortable as the ones I have.
4.0,Pro: lightweight just like I wanted. Gives me a good option for runs on days in the 40s.<br /><br />Con: pretty tight on my big head
4.0,I bought this as a gift for Mother's day to give to my wife.  I was concerned about how fine the level of detail would be for the price and more importantly for the lack of being able to examine the piece before purchase.  My fears were for nothing.  The level of detail in the carving is excellent and the filigree is nice as well.  Shipping was a little slower than I would have liked from time of order to actual ship date.
4.0,Was looking for entry level shoes these are very good will consider for league play
4.0,"The panties are form fitting very much in the shape wear mold but once on they are comfortable even in Texas heat. I was able to wash them on regular cycle and machine dry on low heat. They seem well made, better than the budget brands I normally wear. I purchased them as the material they are made of was highly rated for durability and comfort."
4.0,"I love that they're soft and grippy, I also love the feel on my feet, and that says something since I normally don't like the feel of anything between my toes.  Fortunately I purchased the large 8.5 - 11.. I'm an 8.5 and they fit a bit snug in the toes (and I have very narrow feet).  I can't imagine a size 11 foot in them.  I'm only afraid they might shrink after washing.  Other than that... beautifully packaged and arrive quickly, I love that they're made from bamboo!"
4.0,That it wasn't a cotton tshirt!  You oriental makers don't know Women s sizes in USA.
4.0,Item was fine
4.0,"Quality, good looking watch. The band is not much to be desired though, but is functionable. I will be replacing the band, so that wans't too big of a deal."
4.0,Very stylish with the ribbon waistband but order size up!
4.0,This dress is so pretty in and is so comfy! Wearing it while pregnant then will wear it after as well I get so many compliments on it
4.0,"Gorgeous boot! Havanna/ dk brown is a nice neutral color. Comfortable right out of the box, but these run a little big. Ordered an my normal size 8 but need to exchanging for a 7.5<br />They arrived pretty quick, so I can hardly wait for the  correct size.<br />Great partners:<br />AMAZON / SHOE STATION"
4.0,"Cute little dress, but a bit too large to flatter my 5'4&#34; and 110lb frame. I still give it 4 stars but I will be returning."
4.0,High quality I just didn’t read the description- this is only sold by piece so when I ordered some for my cousin I was surprised to only get one.
4.0,As a Ghibli fan this is amazing to have a face mask with a very noticeable character/quote. What I didn't like was the fact the fabric is silky. It does its job and has a pocket for a filter. It is a snug fit so if you have a larger face this will not work. It would be a little more comfortable if it was just slightly larger. Overall I like it and wear it on occasions. Due to the silky fabric and just a little too small/snug that is why I give it a 4 out of 5.
4.0,Very nice looking watch. Couldn't give 5 stars because a pin fell out and &#34;broke&#34; the watch band temporarily before I replaced the pin.
4.0,"The quality seems nice and the shorts fit, but the straps are way too short. I know that it runs small, so I ordered I size up. My daughter usually wears 4/5 and we ordered a 6 and the straps are too short to go over her shoulders and button. I'll have to look for strap extenders somewhere because they don't have any larger pink ones in stock. These don't work so well for someone who is tall and thin. It is really cute, but they could have put one more hole in the straps to make them more adjustable and it would have worked out great."
4.0,"I wear a size 8-10, so I bought a  size large in case I wanted to wear a sweater under the coat.  It was very tight.  I returned the large and got an extra large.  The XL is a little tight in the chest, but I am keeping it.  The coat is very warm and stylish."
4.0,The fit was as expected! I love this shirt and I am going to order in a different color as well
4.0,"I really love this top as it makes a great style statement with white jeggings and blue boots.  My only complaint is that the colors are not like the picture.  What appears to be a salmon/peachy color, is a definite red in person.  I don't love red.  Still, the top is comfortable with a more flattering fit than the picture portrays.  The upper arm is fitted, not blousy as it looks in the picture.  Note that I'm pretty tall, and I wore a 2.5 inch heel, and this still swept the floor behind me.  If you're short, you might have a little trouble with the length."
4.0,"I usually wear a small, but I trusted the reviews and got a medium... which fits well. It’s a stiff material, but I expect it to soften after a few washes.<br />The armpits of the shirt are super low, but I like it with a sports bra underneath.<br />Shipping was longer than I anticipated."
4.0,"Cheap price, top designer look and feel."
4.0,"Love the dress I’m 5’ so it’s a little past my knees and small chested so I had to tighten the straps a lot and make sure it stays closed, I probably should’ve gone a size down but it’s super comfortable and was very nice for what I bought it for and the pockets hold my phone and keys so no purse needed"
4.0,These were just what I needed for a SEQUIN event.  I'm 5'3 180 with booty and hips.  I got an XL.  Great stretch in the material.  The only negative for me was the sequin in the inner thigh area LOL 😖
4.0,Lenses pop out easily and they barely fit over my glasses but fast delivery and good for price.
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars because I love the size and tree design - however, having to remove the chain in order to open the locket is slightly inconvenient."
4.0,"This pajama set is so pretty. The material is soft to sleep in. My only problem is the top to the shorty set is a bit tight. The shorts fit fine and the warmer set fits perfect. I would order again, but in a larger size."
4.0,Color not as prominent as pictured but still nice keeping it!!
4.0,Runs small but they were great to work with as I have already received a replacement .
4.0,"Very nice watch. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it is just a little bit big. I have small wrists, and it turns when I put it on the last notch. So I just wear it with the face on the bottom of my wrist. Improvisation works!"
4.0,"Fit as expected, but they are see through."
4.0,"Fits true to size on size chart. Skirt bottom is super flattering for people that hate their thighs. Cup size is a bit small, I wear a DD and my cleavage is a bit much, but its manageable."
4.0,The earrings were lovely.  I did expect the color to look like the picture. A richer purple hue.
4.0,Super cute and great price.  I ordered the red/multi colored set.  The red is more of an orange but not too bad.  The only thing I don’t like it the back of the ball is gold and not beaded.
4.0,This case is great and the kickstand is a nice touch. The armband itself is a bit annoying for me after securing it but it holds up well in a 5k run.
4.0,nice quality but a little tight
4.0,"This is a very lovely bracelet and has an abstract look to it.  It is classy and goes with mostly everything, especially sterling silver earrings that are simple and in good taste.  I recommend purchasing this bracelet.  I did not give it five stars because at first it was hard to put on but I found that when you turn the bracelet around, it goes on very easily and is lovely!"
4.0,"I already had a Michigan gym bag by Logo and I expected this one to be the same (at a lower price than the M-Den).  It arrived on time and in the original packaging but when I started exploring its features, I found that the zippered compartment with the block M on the side didn't have as many pockets as the on I already had.  Also, the luggage handle slip-over was a strap instead of a sleeve but that's a minor issue that really doesn't affect functionality that much.  Overall, I like the product and it works well as an overnight bag."
4.0,Nice and loose fitting
4.0,It's very pretty. Use on myself.
4.0,"Works perfect feels, a little sub quality compared to higher priced watches, but overall a great value for the money and it looks great."
4.0,Perfect size for all size.
4.0,Very nice charms and I will purchase again
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress and the fit is perfect. My gripe is that the dress felt pretty thin, like it needed an extra layer to prevent it from being see-through.  Also...the neck part is awkward. It just didn’t look right on me. I felt like I was trying to cover my thyroid gland, or something. I returned this item."
4.0,"These are a nice light-weight top for working out. Perfect for around 60 degree weather. Anything cooler- you’ll need a light jacket or use it for layering. Has a tight fit so if you like your tops looser, I’d order a size up."
4.0,"I purchased this wig through lightinthebox.com and as the other reviewers have mentioned the photo, at least the one on the site, was misleading. The blue is a darker very, very vibrate blue and the brown is more like black at least indoors. This is not a wig to be worn by someone who is a first time wig wearer unless you've got courage. I say this because people will stare and look at you. Despite this, I've gotten compliments on the color and people asking how I got my hair that way.<br /><br />I have a large circumference head so the size was perfect for me and it's one of my favorite wigs despite how many I own. I do recommend you sew in clips on the ear tabs to make it stay more firmly in place though."
4.0,Love the shirt. It’s comfortable and is great for traveling (no wrinkles). The fit is larger than expected so go down at least one size
4.0,"I really like this dress! It's good quality, but the fabric is more dressy than what I was looking for. This would be a cute baby doll dress for a date night out, but not for every day wear. It fit large. I usually wear a medium/large and the medium was too big on me. So size down!"
4.0,Ripped within 2 weeks.
4.0,"What an awesome key chain, however, every now and then the arms need to be pulled to tighten back up the top knot."
4.0,"Amazing jacket and fit.  I sized up due to previous reviews and wanted my ""girls"" to fit comfortably.  Does the job in making you sweat but the smell hits you when you take it out of the bag.  I should have probably rinsed/washed it off before wearing but I didn't.  The smell went away during my workout but it also left a smell on my body after removing it.  Took a shower immediately and the smell went away.  Perhaps washing/rinsing it off before using is best to get past the smell but the product is great."
4.0,"The ""Innolite Cross Necklace For Men"" arrives in a plain cardboard box. Inside the box is the necklace in a clear plastic bag on a paper board.<br /><br />I would of been more impressed if the necklace had arrived in a nice white jewelry box. I'm all about the presentation of an item.<br /><br />The cross necklace doesn't look exactly like the ad picture.<br /><br />The chain is actually Black in color & not  Silver colored. The chain is also not exactly 24 inches long as stated, when I measured it was around a quarter of an inch off in length.<br /><br />The cross is smaller then I expected in size. All of the ""Lord's Prayer"" is there (just like in the ad picture). The letter ""H"" (in the word ""Heaven"" & the ""T"" (in the word ""Temptation"") are not even with the rest of the letters / words. They are off. It is very noticeable close up. (You can see this in my pictures)<br /><br />The necklace is supposedly made of 316L stainless steel and has a lobster clasp.<br /><br />In my experience stainless steel jewelry has a little weight / heft to it and this necklace really didn't.<br /><br />For under $10, it's a decent item."
4.0,"The good things first: the material is great, it's thick, warm, and they fit kind of like scrub bottoms (I'm in healthcare, so can confirm~). That said, I don't like the length of the crotch part (too long) relative to the lenght/tightness of the pant legs, which are actually perfect imo. I wish these had a slightly shorter crotch length, then they would be perfect! But that's ok. If you roll them down once (e.g. as pictured), then the length starts feeling shorter, but the crotch length is better. :)"
4.0,"These were ordered as a gift for my brother.  They took forever to ship to me, but I think that was the post office.  They look great.  I hope he loves them"
4.0,Keeps my hands warm for recess duty. Wish they were a bit thicker but still nice to have.
4.0,"Light material, comfortable<br />Looks great over a bathing suit"
4.0,More of a cotton  material than expected.
4.0,"Plenty of room in this, lol. I was hoping it fit like another one I bought . Hmmm maybe I could sew up the sides and make it work. For $10 I'll try something or gift it. I believe it was free returns though so you cant lose. It's pretty sheer."
4.0,"I like the fact that you can wear it with the cross body chain, or can use it as a clutch."
4.0,"Great pants, my husband loves them!"
4.0,"First impressions when tried on weren’t very good. At first it seemed like a very strange material and unflattering for my body type. However when tried on a second time with shoes and accessories it seems like it can work for me. I am 5’8, 200lb, with not a whole lot going on in the bust. I got an XL and it fits well. PLove that the waist can be sinched and the pockets! A little see through, but overall a nice dress for the price."
4.0,"This is a good belt for the price, but was a little awkward to wear. It comes in the package completely flat, so you have to bend/shape it around your body yourself<br /><br />Do this carefully! Make sure you're rounding it and not folding it or else you'll get a weird edge/point in the middle of the belt.<br /><br />The back is black eleastic wiyh a 2 snap closure. The elastic on the back is not very strong. I have a 27 in waist and the belt was too big so I had to pull the elastic tighter (overlapping the snaps) and secure with two safety pins underneath. Once it was on you couldn't tell but it was a pretty annoying process.<br /><br />That said, once I had it all worked out it looked great! I got a ton of compliments. Not a bad purchase for the price."
4.0,"They are cute, but ididnt buy them"
4.0,pretty.  pendant a good size
4.0,Love them. They stretch so I would buy a smaller size.
4.0,Decent dress!! A little thin but otherwise it's nice. I'm 38C and 135lbs. I bought a L and it fits perfect.
4.0,"It's a very nice bracelet, but had to bend the bar because it was too rigid and would not fall nicely on the wrist.  Outside of that, it's a very nice bracelet, but again, the chain hanging from the bracelet is too long."
4.0,My granddaughter had to show me how it worked
4.0,This dress is cute. I don't  like the fabric they used for the white part. It's too stiff and doesn't fall nicely. If they would change that it would get 5 stars.
4.0,"Great shirt, however a bit too small. I am usually a size small, but this was tight in the chest area for me"
4.0,Nice looking slippers.
4.0,"I'm petite, veery short (5ft tall) and thin. These fit well, snug enough to stay up on my calves when walking, but stretchy enough to stretch up higher above my knee if I wanted/needed (and probably stretchy enough to fit someone with larger calves than mine). I ordered the light gray and dark brown. The gray is a very light gray, and the brown is darker and less green than shown in the photos. But both are very nice. SUPER soft, comfortable, thick, and warm. I'm happy with my purchase, especially for the price!"
4.0,"Bought it as XL and fits like a medium to large in US sizes.<br />Like the feel and fit and can be very confortable.<br /><br />Lost a star because of shipping fail, item never shipped but after talking to representative they sent it right away.<br /><br />If you buy remember to buy big and confirm that the order has shipped. You will love it."
4.0,"What stands out to me first about this bag is the high quality of the fabric and construction of the it.  This seems to be a durable and rugged bag.  The straps are solidly put together and do not seem prone to detaching from the bag.  It has a zipper on the outside pocket and three on the inside that provide some security for items.  It provides a large space to put stuff, and you can leave it unzipped and then fold the top over and latch it closed to prevent items from falling out.  I can imagine myriad uses for it; however, it might not suit everyone.<br /><br />The top description of the item describes it being able to hold a 15' laptop; while, in the details it says it can hold a 13'inch laptop.  I think the 15' inch claim is a mistake, because the only way that can happen is if the top is unsecure which makes it unsafe to carry it.  A 13' inch laptop or iPad can fit with the top latch secure; however, the bag does not provide much, if any, padded protection for a computer.<br /><br />If it seems like this bag appeals to you from the descriptions and pictures, I think will you be pleased with it when you receive it and use it.  I don't think this is the best way to go for a bag to carry your laptop, though."
4.0,"I wish it was 2 inches longer so it bunches up even more in the back, but it does look good. and it does slouch in the back which is awesome. Got girls giving me the double look checking me out. Got guys sizing me up, wishing they had the confidence to pull this off."
4.0,Very pretty earring. It looks expensive but the price is very affordable.  I felt like I got a bargain when the earring arrived because it looks like good quality.  I would recommend anyone to buy this.
4.0,I like the shirt but the French tuck is stupid looking and it would be nice to be able to see what the shirt looks like without it being hidden in someone's pants.
4.0,Fits bracelet nicely
4.0,I absolutely love this skirt!!
4.0,It will take time to get used to the jewelry as well as time to use them.
4.0,"Perfect for simple friend ship bracelet. only complaint is the gold rubs off and makes it a pink color. but just like any other bracelet that’s cheap, the product might run off. this is normal in cheap jewelry. other than that great bracelet, and my friend really liked it!!"
4.0,The green material isn’t as nice as the charcoal—and it’s both a larger size AND shorter. Makes no sense. I should’ve returned ‘em. Still...they’re pretty cute.
4.0,Nice to own when needed
4.0,"Was so glad I ordered this dress. It fits nice, and the material is thick enough whereby a slip is not needed.<br />I am a regular size 10, 40 dd (chest), and pretty curvaceous; so I ordered the L - Great fit!!"
4.0,Runs really small<br /> Cute shirt. Like the style
4.0,"I really like these boots.  Great size, great style, great comfort.  My little was wearing them daily for a month, due to easy use and comfort.  The down side....they smell, wow, I mean strong smell that needed a week to manage.  The handles also broke off on the inside of both boots.  Neither issue was a deal breaker, for the price, I would buy again.  👍"
4.0,Good quality. Nice size for keychain. Fun gift!
4.0,"Not bad, sticks out further than expected, visibly synthetic, but cute nonetheless."
4.0,Purchased 2 sized bigger as reviews recommended.  High quality.  Just wish it was not as plunging.  Otherwise great support.
4.0,Cute. Summer/spring style
4.0,I wish the nylon strand is a little stronger and thicker. After a week of wearing the bracelet it is now loose and the nylon end just pop.<br />I own a handful of stretch bracelets with heavy crystals but it took months and months before it became very stretchy.
4.0,"The shirt looks great on.  I wanted a more baggy look but the shirt was a bit too clingy - showing all of my rolls (wink, wink)."
4.0,"This was amazing! got so many compliments BUTTTT this is very very very very very small. I wear a small in everything, and these ripped because they were so tight. Loved them but can't wear them again because they were WAYYYY to small."
4.0,"These would be absolutely perfect if they were just a little longer in length to hang down further when your glasses aren't on.  Other than that, perfect product."
4.0,"I got this to go with that funny color we all love that some say is blue and others say is purple? You know what I mean I'm sure! Well, it isn't that color at all. It is a very purple - pink set. That little hint of purple-blue....no. Not at all. Much more ofa rose-purple with dashes of pale pink. So be warned.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a wonderful set. Very nice quality and beautiful. I kept mine because I love the sets from this seller. So I have to get something to match it...poor me!"
4.0,"...One of the lower buttons broke the first time I wore them.  :-(  Pity.  Legs are long, but that's my curse, and not a problem with the pants--I'm short and stocky.  LOL  The waist was just the right size, but the thighs were oddly tight and the knees were also insanely tight.  These were supposed to be slender fit, I know, but pencil-leg wasn't in the description, and many had reviewed these as true to size.<br /><br />My legs aren't weird shapes, so the strange sizing in the mid-leg was baffling.  I do have arthritis and my knees can swell up, and sometimes they swell a LOT, so that might be the issue, there, and again, not a flaw in the pant, but even still, the legs are a little too slender, I think.  Not a problem I can't fix, however.  I do make clothing, and having had to cut off (nope, not returning the jeans, heh) a good portion off the cuffs, I can use them as gussets to expand the areas that need opening up.<br /><br />Construction on the pants, other than the one faulty button, is excellent.  They're tough and beautiful.  I can replace the button easily, fix the knee problem and enjoy the pants for years to come."
4.0,"I love the sweater but was disappointed that the XL was a little small. I normally wear a 16 or an XL, so an XXL would have been perfect. Since this was shipped from the UK I don't think it's worth sending back. I'll make it work as the crochet will stretch. Overall, a very cute sweater!"
4.0,"Really cute and fast shipping! I like that it's tiny, looks great."
4.0,When the product arrived I picked it up to try it on and one side came unattached. I fixed itvwithout an issue. But honestly it is beautiful and would still purchase again.
4.0,"I loved the dress, but I am giving 4 starts because the zip is not good quality. However, their customer service is awesome and they did a price adjustment for the zipper complaint as I did not have enough time to replacement."
4.0,"This product doesn't arrive in a black velvet bracelet box. But rather in a small white shipping box,with a small piece of red tissue paper, an invoice,and a small black drawstring bag for storage. The chain of the bracelet is pretty thick and feels sturdy. It measures about (chain length) 7 & 1/8 inches. This piece features a toggle closure. Which is also where the heart shaped charm hangs from. The charm itself measures around one inch in length, and about 7/8's of an inch wide. Visually about the size of a quarter. The words are printed clearly, and has a generous placement of rhinestones surrounding them. It's comfortable to wear, and easy to put on without assistance. Which is a plus for any piece of jewelry. I was however disappointed that the charm is one sided. It makes the bracelet seem a little more juvenile. And of cheaper quality. As I had originally ordered this piece to give to my sister. It seems more of a perfect gift for someone ages 11-17. Although cute, a 3D heart would've in my opinion, made all the difference. Great gift for under twenty dollars. If you do decide to give it as a gift, no matter the age you may want to pre open and place it in a nice box. To give it more of an elegant appeal. Plus you wouldn't want them to see the invoice/ receipt now would ? I recieved this product at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased review."
4.0,"I loved the look of this suit but it was unbelievably small. I usually wear a size 4 and I couldn't even get the suit (size S) up past my knees. Definitely size up, way up."
4.0,"I got this to wear after swimming at the Y, but I wore it to work yesterday with leggings and sneakers, received compliments on my ""style"".  I got the 3x, I am 5'7"" with DD and a tummy. This hit me just below my knees, and the white in the middle surround by the darker color gave it a bit of shape on it even with my potbelly lol  The pockets are great. I wish they made it without the hood, but it is lightweight enough not to feel bulky back there. I am going to buy two more colors, since I have the grey already."
4.0,Color is teal not green
4.0,"They are real gold; I wear them nonstop and have no itching or irritation. The pair I got is a dark purple, very pretty. I only wish they were larger."
4.0,I’ve always wanted a wallet like this one and I am very happy with it. The one thing I was expecting was a little more room to fit my phone inside. Before purchasing I read that you could fit a phone in and that is what I expected but it was a tight fit. I do have an iPhone so maybe it needed to be a newer model but I am still pleased with it!
4.0,Fast delivery good price super cute
4.0,The stones looked really good
4.0,"Bought it for my husband, he said it is somewhat small"
4.0,"Not as dense as pictured or expected, but still nice."
4.0,"Love it, but I wish I got a small and I am usually a medium...kept it anyway, cute for hanging out:)"
4.0,Great dashiki!! Nice design. No one else around here has one!
4.0,Overall a good dress for the price. It is made primarily of polyester so it clings and is hot after a while wearing it. But overall flattering on a pear shape.
4.0,"I like the designs and the artwork. The silver color is rather dark and stays that way, although the necklace does clean up a bit with a silver cleaning cloth."
4.0,Fit great and looks great!
4.0,"I am 5'4&#34;, 112lbs, and 34A bra size. I liked the fit but I just didn't do it for me. The quality is nice."
4.0,"Reminder, this only comes as a single gauntlet. the leather is thin but flexible and the straps are a little finicky, but the gauntlets are quality for your money"
4.0,Its lose but beautiful dress
4.0,"This product is absolutely beautiful and very soft! However, it is a little big for our daughter"
4.0,This pants my wife use them a lot and after months of use they still look very good. the quality is very strong and the color has staid the same like the first day. the side pocket is cool but for small phones and not a big one because it will bother.
4.0,cheap but they work. you get what you pay for. They were for ring bearers and will do the job just fine
4.0,"it fits fine, as expected, but for some reason just not a great look on me.  i can't decide what it is, maybe the crew neck or the position of the heart, but  it just feels and seems like it looks a little bit not perfect.  it could also be the fabric - it's really quite thin, super soft, but a little thin.  i might have actually liked this better in another color that's more forgiving than the thinner white.  i really like the heart graphic - it's super cute and i know i am making it sound worse than it is - it's a really cute t-shirt.  i do actually like it - i just think i would like it in a darker color."
4.0,"These are nice to have the pockets and they wash quite well. Slightly shorter than we needed for a 6'1"" guy."
4.0,Decent fit and nice price
4.0,"A good quality product. Good leather, good thickness, comfortable and appears durable. The only small negative was the color. The product was allegedly brown, but there was a strong red/maroonish tint to the band; the original color was ok but not exactly what I wanted. I applied a brown stain (furniture scratch remover) to the band and now it is a most satisfactory walnut color. Would buy it again w/out hesitation."
4.0,"Does what it needs to do. The side supports on each side of the cummerbund are a bit taller and more supportive than others I have used, which helps keep the cummerbund flatter on your midriff (especially if your curves out a bit!."
4.0,"This handbag is okay if you don't like more than one pocket on the inside of the handbag. There's four zippers on this handbag, I had to tighten three of the four, so they wouldn't pull off when unzipping them. Otherwise, it's been okay. I'm still using it as this time."
4.0,"Very pretty top.  Just didn't realize how sheer it would be.  Wanted the wine but it's not wine, it's full red.  Blazing red.  Pretty if you wanted red."
4.0,"It looks like it does in the picture. My only complaint is that the clasp is super low quality. It works, but you have to manually close it because it's so cheap haha. I guess you get what you pay for. I debated between three and four stars for this, but since it's so inexpensive, and the clasp does technically work (with a little help) I figured I'd go ahead and give it four stars. After all it IS a super sweet necklace for relatively cheap."
4.0,Well build and good quality materials
4.0,The material was not as soft as I was looking for.
4.0,"Once I got the shirt, I didn’t love the colors."
4.0,Looks good it is not lined so lightweight. Would have given more stars but I should have checked was looking for more of a fleece lined hat.
4.0,"Cute and fits well, love the pockets"
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for a person with a very small wist, who has trouble finding brackets that fit. It worked out perfectly."
4.0,"This skirt is absolutely adorable. The color is perfect for what I'll be using it for. I originally thought that the straps would annoy me, but they're super comfortable and stretchy, which means a lot to someone with a large bust (G's)!<br /><br />However, I do have to drop down one star because, as some of the previous reviews have pointed out, the actual stitching on the garment is horrendous. It doesn't show on the right side of the skirt (much - some uneven stitching), but it's pretty clear that whoever sews these doesn't have a clue on how to properly thread their machines. Either that, or they don't know how to reinforce the ends of each stitch! Nonetheless, the pieces don't seem to be loose or ripping anytime soon, so I'm still more than happy with this purchase."
4.0,Perfect fit everything i was expecting.
4.0,"Pretty dress and great weight. The red is really a fire orange. But great dress. Walked around NOLA in it all day and turned heads! 😜I am a size 14 and ordered the XL. It wasn't big it was actually a little snug across my chest and I'm not big busted, but it didn't look inappropriate. I would order it again."
4.0,"I love the dress, except it's really shear.  I tried a half slip with it, but it needs a full slip.  I'm returning for a darker solid color.<br />The fabric is soft and it fits true to size.  The print is very sharp and vibrant, not muted at all.<br />I'm 5'8"" (my height is in my torso) and it comes JUST below my knee."
4.0,good quality watch for the price!
4.0,"I liked the gloves, my hand feel better. One glove tore the second day"
4.0,"Unfortunately this is hard to wear with my hair down, since it gets easily caught."
4.0,I liked the designs even better in person
4.0,Christmas gift.  Sister really liked this hast.  Very stylish.
4.0,"I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The goggles work well, although I have no need for the nose plugs it seems to be pretty durable for someone that might use them."
4.0,"Purchased for a photo shoot. The model that wore the piece didn't really like it. It was a little bigger than expected, but it was in perfect working order. When photographing the headshots we had to rebalance the dangling pieces to keep them organized and centered, but it is an attractive necklace. I will order more if the need arises."
4.0,Very well made. I gave as a gift.
4.0,Love it . It is big!
4.0,"Shorter and tighter than typical American swimming trunks, but I really like them.  I will use they at my house and if we travel abroad.  Look great on without being too tight like others like this."
4.0,"These socks are great for me. They are thicker than most compression socks, they feel like good cotton socks not thin elastic socks  I like them"
4.0,"Ok first off the pendant is beautiful. I love it. Second the package was open when i took it outta my mail box. Idk if it was just bad packaging or if someone tried to steal it while it was shipping. But the necklace and its package was fine, just the outer envelope had a rip/slah/tear in the side big enough that the necklace package could have fallen out. But it did arrive safe and as described."
4.0,Could of been bigger.
4.0,Works great for all the small cards of the wallet. I only wish that there were more insert windows provided.
4.0,"These black things to hold the ring in place do not last long, but ring is still cute and wearable"
4.0,"I got one dead on arrival, and a few more have button problem, and about 2 get flicker on and off as u shake but, fantastic for the price. I would give this 4.5/5 Stars if they let me. These r very bright LED I wouldn't give these to kids that tend to point things at people eyes."
4.0,"Warm, well made. A little shorter than expected. Also would have liked if it was lined."
4.0,The boots is cute.  It does run big and wide.
4.0,"Love this dress. Material is thick and hot under the Caribbean sun, but it's worth it. Fit's perfect. Love the pockets. Not a fan that it needs to be hand washed, but we get over that. Love it"
4.0,"I was very skeptical about buying these, just because I have an grossly enormous head and I didn't want a cheap pair that were too small. I got the black and gold mirrored and I couldn't be more happy. They fit perfect. They are plastic and by no means feel like $150 shades but you can't beat the price and they are great to wear around. Definitely would recommend these to anyone who wants a cool pair of wayfarers and doesn't want to pay the ray ban price."
4.0,Perfect except for the seam is very visible and hard to hide.
4.0,I love this dress! Super light flowy fabric. it fits well once i altered it to me. I got a larger size to i could fit it to myself. its so comfortable. I sewed the buttons down so they didn't stretch open and it looks great! the only downside is that the belt is really flimsy. i put it with one of my other belts and its works though.  I highly recommend.
4.0,Me quedo mas chico y corto de lo que esperaba
4.0,This wallet came sooner than estimated delivery date.... It looks just like the picture! I love the color + that it's slim....
4.0,"Awesome socks, not for general use.  These require a special audience"
4.0,I all around love this. The only con is that I'm short and it's a bit long. But that's still ok. It hides my gut and thighs very well.
4.0,pants were small but the top is adorable!  I would give 5 stars but due to the pants fitting more like a 2 t
4.0,"Comfortable, nice material but order 1 size smaller."
4.0,The straps are a little big and there is a lump in the padding of the bra(unnoticeable with a shirt on) but other than that it's amazing for the price
4.0,Excelent look only the screw of the wrist band was tighten wrong and the screw wont come out for any future changes of wrist band.
4.0,"I ordered  a size up, but it still didn't fit.  It is a beautiful swim suit with a vibrant color.  The suit is well made and in a quality fabric."
4.0,"I bought those glasses after seeing a lot of transparent glasses, it was a nice idea at first, but now I will not recommend them because the tint changes over time ( I have them for 1 year now) and become brown/yellow. It still subtle and I guess that people don't see the differences but I see it.<br /><br />The Celine glasses itself are well built and if you don't mind the changes of color, it is a good buy!"
4.0,Cool glasses but I have a fat head so they don't look cool on my big head. If you have a small face or a skinny head these are for you
4.0,some people might say I have a big head but hats would prove them wrong - just can't seem to find one that fits me well even though they stretch and this is the same for me and I do like it and will keep it but don't love it
4.0,As described just a bit smaller than I needed.
4.0,Overall liked the shoes but the top edge a little to stiff which rubbed against my skin.
4.0,"Love the quality, fit and comfort of these Fitbit bands!"
4.0,"Despite having broad shoulders, the shoulder seems are off my shoulders (like in the picture). For women with smaller shoulder or sloping shoulder, they will certainly be well below the edge.<br /><br />That said, the shirt is a relaxed fit and the fabric is very comfortable. Great shirt to relax in. It stretches well, so if you want a closer fit you could probably get away with one size down."
4.0,My daughter looked beautiful in it it was exactly what she wanted
4.0,Very pretty but cheap quality but it’s a great price I loved them!
4.0,One of the buttons fell off as I opened it.
4.0,"Lots of features, easy to set up. My other stainless watches are more high end, so i tried to swap the stainless strap for a leather or nylon one but I could see too much skin between the watch dial and the strap."
4.0,"Super cute! They smell when they first arrive, but the smell of baby feet soon takes over the chemical smell. They're so cute and we get a lot of compliments."
4.0,"These glasses look great, but they are extremely fun seeing light weight. I ordered another pair, so I definitely like them. But just don’t expect some heavy weight sunglasses."
4.0,I love it on...it was a little work putting it on over me head. I got it down. It's good quality so it wasnt stretchy.
4.0,"for the price this is hard to beat. I was looking for something with rose quartz and agate, and this happened to have both. it seems very sturdily made and of good quality. It is adjustable, but definitely made for larger wrists, as it is very loose on mine. If i could've gotten it a bit smaller that would've been nice, but as it is it is a very nice piece. I hope to wear it for a long time."
4.0,These fit well and wash and machine dry well without losing shape.  Unfortunately I did deduct a star due to very thick and uncomfortable seams at the waist.  Seams dig into the flesh and become annoying.
4.0,"Me entusiasmó la idea de un limpiador de joyas sin químicos.  No se si será por los componentes, pero mis joyas de plata, que fueron las que limpié, no quedaron con el brillo que le han dado otros limpiadores.  Están un poco opacas para lo que yo esperaba."
4.0,I wish it were just a bit bigger to hold my cash envelope system.  I LOVE the color!
4.0,Love the style but they are a bit heavy for me. Otherwise very good looking sunglasses.
4.0,"Great shoe for a very active 3yr old! Fits her feet comfortably and washes very well, which Mom appreciates!"
4.0,"I love it! It is perfect for when you don't want to carry a big bag. It's just the right size for a phone, credit card, money and a few other things you may need. I just wish the strap was longer . I just purchased  4 more for Christmas gifts!"
4.0,"Flimsy, but works pretty well."
4.0,It is very pretty.  I ordered a size up and it was still small.  I like it and hope of lose weight to wear it.
4.0,"I like the band, it's pretty good looking. I hope it breaks in a little because it's too stiff to really function properly right now."
4.0,My son loves it!! Unfortunately the first one was way too small. We had to order two sizes larger for it to fit. It’s brightly colored & material is similar to those for a wind breaker. It arrived much sooner than expected. Would recommend as long as you know to order a larger size.
4.0,"UPDATE:<br />Still the best compressions I've purchased so far, in fact, I just placed another order for more today.  I had to reduce my initial review by 1 Star because of the company's lack of service response.  With my initial order there was included in the package an offer of a percentage off on my next order if I would send them a copy of my review along with my order info.  I did so and 6 weeks later no response to my initial or follow-up emails.  Couldn't wait any longer so I bought some more today.<br /><br />Great product, compared to others.  Waistband especially much better than on others I have tried.  They fit perfectly and as listed in the size chart, no ride up, great support.  Great value and I will purchase more in the future"
4.0,"These sunglasses by AIEYEZO Modern Y2K fit me comfortably and seem pretty sturdy. I like wearing them and they are comfortable to wear as a headband while indoors, which I do often. They also came with a carry bag, cleaning cloth and a small screwdriver."
4.0,The boots are perfect for my needs
4.0,I got this to wear through The Holidays and love it. It fits as stated in the size chart. It’s thin so it can be used as a layer. Very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Overall, this is a cute kaftan - nice machine embroidery, nice tassels, overall good quality so far. My one complaint is that the color in real life is much, much brighter and peachier than the pink shown in the photograph, which is more muted pink. If you don't mind that, then buy away."
4.0,Very cute however runs large
4.0,Good quality.... They look pretty real.. Got a few compliments..
4.0,Purchased as a gift.  My friend loved them..
4.0,Nice jumpsuit but fits a bit small. Would love if it was a bit bigger for the boobs
4.0,Nice case but a tad small. It would work best for glasses that fold completely flat. Overall a great case.
4.0,"Overall I reall like the unique style of an open earring. They are not a heavy earring but they also don't pull your lobes as well, there a bit smaller than expected but look nice on. I definitely would purchase theses a gift for someone who is small framed & does.not want anything overpowering"
4.0,"I bought all these dresses looking for a baby shower dress for my daughter’s baby shower. This dress is beautiful, but it needs to be ordered in advance because it needs adjustments. The straps are way to long and the breast area is for larger breasts. I returned the dress before deadline and yet it isn’t showing that I did so and I still haven’t received my refund yet. Don’t recommend getting if you need your money back for awhile."
4.0,"I bought this top in xlarge , normally I wear between medium to large, its a bit big but looks very nice with jeans."
4.0,"Just as pictured.  I'm 5'2, 124 lbs.  Fringe goes to about my knees.  It's nothing special, but for the price it's a great value.  I decided to go with one that was a different color, but this one was fine."
4.0,Nice material nice fitting but a little small in the waist makes it to uncomfortable to wear.
4.0,Size color and fit we're all good. Buttonholes were stitched slightly too small. Very difficult to button.
4.0,A bit bigger than I expected but they are cool!
4.0,"Dye dots in the white areas and wore for 20 minutes and the white areas started peeling off and small holes in random areas. Bought 4 pairs all same problem. Size med fit me perfect though..5'0..142lbs, just enough ankle bunch. Hopefully they will exchange and no more problems, supposed to be Christmas gifts for my kids."
4.0,Cute but a little small. We got 2 wears out of it
4.0,Cute little something for our grown sons to remind them they are loved
4.0,The reason 3 on comfort it gets loose to me a lot. It doesn’t stay on tight it always feel loose when wearing it fir a while
4.0,"These are a vast improvement over their first design. The pretty much address every issue from the previous set. The only item that is an issue and this is just because they advertise as a one size fits all, is that the bridge is not adjustable. Other than that, they are much better under and above water. They seal well enough as to not allow water to accumulate at the bottom. The snap on, snap off latch is a very good option, but time will tell if it eventually becomes an issue by wear and tear.<br />Also after reviewing the other set that we got, which appears to be their previous version, the seller contacted us, offering to send a new pair with different specifications."
4.0,"Very pretty. Perfect fit. Fabric is thin, but not see through... excellent for hot weather. The only problem was the little black and white piping around the bottom goes around the front halfway around the back and then kind of turns under a little bit 3/4 of the way around the back so the construction isn't as great as it could be. But I'm keeping it."
4.0,Great design and fit. Runs a little on the small side.
4.0,"I haven't really been able to use the bars, I think my lip is just too fat for these (its healed and everything but still snug)... however I love how the smaller gems on this fit the longer bars (by the same company). I need the longer bar but prefer the smaller gem so it works awesome!"
4.0,"I got these on a promotional price/coupon and I love them, it’s finally spring where I live but it’s always raining and wet these help me go on the porch and not end up with cold wet feet, and they look cute too!"
4.0,Ordered these shirts for the gym and really like the material. Only complaint is the arms are a little tight .
4.0,normally this size fits but this was really tiny
4.0,"The hat and patch are great quality. I was a little disappointed to see the patch was starting to lift when I received, but was able to fix with fabric glue."
4.0,i like the comfort and the ability to pull it up without any trouble
4.0,Really love the print on these leggings and you can't beat the price! My only complaint is they ride up like crazy.
4.0,"I have a mixed review. Loved the colors and style, super vibrant and fun. I wear a 7.5M normally and got the 7-8. Fit perfectly. As far as arch support, there is some, but I prefer more. Also the thong/material piece between your toes is a little too wide for me. I am hoping with time that becomes more comfortable."
4.0,"I was expecting traditional swim trunks,  these are very short and very tight.  Not quite a speedo, but close.  But they are sonic,  whom my son loves and will be fine for swimming in our pool at home."
4.0,Great sock at a great price. These are not the original omniwools that were 70% merino but theses are still a good sock. I have had some of these that had a weak ankle band and fell down all the time.  These are much better for whatever reason. I got 6 and all have been good.
4.0,"Nice, a little on the large side"
4.0,Great baggie dress - lots of room and fibrant fabric - hand wash shrinks big time
4.0,"Fits as expected.<br />Have owned several of these for a few months, are well made and survived washing without issues."
4.0,"I’m about 5’5” 135 pounds, originally ordered a medium.<br /><br />I advise ordering a size higer if you have any amount of concern on the size, or if you have a big butt/thighs. I wore them once for a workshop, and they ripped all along the seam of the back.<br />Can’t fault the product here, I wish I had ordered a larger size."
4.0,Food light poles - no padding in straps for wrists
4.0,absolutely gorgeous dress. just love it
4.0,Great price. Store prices are over $20 for one pair.
4.0,I have a rain suit but it’s so hot to wear in summer or warm weather. I wanted a suit that was lighter and cooler and this one fit the bill. Really light weight and so much cooler. Anything that will keep out rain going to be a little warmer but the light weight is awesome can’t even tell you are wearing it.
4.0,Color is not the same. Pink is like a light mauve.
4.0,Great shoes but it's one size smaller dan your Normal shoe size
4.0,"Great design, great idea  but too heavy even with nothing inside,so it's  not easy to use as an everyday bag."
4.0,"Absolutely loved the dress, however it does wrinkle fairly easy....and it stretches and looses it's shape. I ordered a large, I'm 5'5 176lbs with hips and a butt. So as I sat the material gave a lot of slack and didn't bounce back. May I suggest going a size smaller to avoid this.But other than that a great purchase!"
4.0,I had to tweak the heck out of this! It was way too big in the bust and neck so I had to wrap the neck entry twice to fit but once I tweaked it I fell in love 😍 Will prob order different color in a small! I'm 5'7 150
4.0,Swimming--my friend uses it at the Y and she likes it.
4.0,Gorgeous.  The chain tarnished right away however the company was great about refunding my purchase.
4.0,"Not lasers, but just little flash lights."
4.0,I liked the item I just dislike that it is small.  I expected it to be bigger!
4.0,"These pants are so versatile. I can't decide if I should use them as comfy lounge/pajama pants or if I should use them as moisture wicking pants for my workouts. The leg is a loose fit, but the waist was a little more snug than I would prefer, but there is a stretch.<br />I love the style of the pant; it is sort of like a jogger, and the pockets are, of course, a necessity. The material is wrinkle-free and can compact easily into a gym bag, so they are great even for after a workout."
4.0,"Needed some new impact glasses for shooting that were stylish and polorized. These definitely fit the bill! And work well with my small head. Also the semi hard case is top notch, the soft pouch could be a little thinner for cleaning the lens. but overall...for $20.00 very nice!"
4.0,We bought enough of these to equip our entire chorus for our concert.
4.0,"This dress is so classy. The length is great! It hits the knees. I bought a size up and it was still too close for comfort. I would wear it out on a date, but because it's too tight and the material is stretchy it's inappropriate for work. Beautiful dress. I would recommend it."
4.0,Kinda big but it's ok.
4.0,Cute. Great for kids. Would only fit small adult.  Colors and design was really good and what I was expecting.  The quality of the fabric was not as soft or sock-like as expected.  Still a fun gift for kids who will only care that they look cool.
4.0,good but too thin
4.0,Bought this product for my Grandson for Christmas. I like the quality and he loves it.
4.0,"I use this every night at my industrial plant job and I don’t know what I’d do without it, the breathing mesh in the front doesn’t work very adequately but besides that this Balaclava keeps me warm when I work in 30 degree weather for hours at a time"
4.0,Secures watch in place so it's not moving around on band.
4.0,I like the watch and was glad to get extra bands.
4.0,Mom & Dad &#34;to be&#34; are both big Star Wars fans! We all got a kick out of the saying on this cute onesie!
4.0,"I love it! I'm a size 2, but after reading reviews I went up a size (size 4). I'm about 120lbs 5'3 and I suggest ordering a size up. The waist part of the dress ended up to my midriff, but it'll do. I can rock it with a crop top."
4.0,Everything about this product is good fits just the way i wanted it to
4.0,"For $40 I expected better materials would be used. It definitely could use more stuffing/batting. Its enough to get through wearing it a couple times but don’t think it will hold up to heavy use or washing. The headband is only sew along the bottom edge.<br /><br />As another reviewer wrote, delivery was one day short of 6 weeks. Seller should update shipping times to match. Last few weeks Amazon was showing this item as refundable and possibly lost.<br /><br />I only gave this 4 stars because you can buy the pattern off Etsy, buy better materials at Hobby Lobby and sew your own for the same amount. My new project!"
4.0,These have become my go to sun glasses.  I wear them daily.  Even while running.
4.0,Really stylish and comfortable. Not polarized but still very good at protecting my eyes from the sun.
4.0,"Good quality, not all pugs though it was a mixture of paterns. I love pugs on anything."
4.0,looks good...bought for a special occasion this weekend.
4.0,This may fit some vape devices but not a vape pen!
4.0,This is a beautiful dress and it is made of good quality material. It hangs very well. I am a 5'9 plus size curvy girl and the fit was perfect. I received a lot of comments on the dress and the color was eye-popping.
4.0,Pretty bracelet. Packaging did not identify product as sterling silver .925.
4.0,"I have really thick calves. I can't fit into knee high boots even the ones meant for thick legs, but I fit into these.  Which is nice.  I was expecting them not to fit.  I love them.  I wear them with my yoga pants all the time and wear them out and around the house"
4.0,"These boots are amazing! I always worry about the accuracy of size when ordering something online. With these boots you don't have to worry,the sizing is correct"
4.0,It was a little snug around the tummy area
4.0,Looks nice and fits great.
4.0,I really like to color of this purse and I have received many compliments. It is roomy inside and I can wear it on my shoulder with just the straps. It does not have a lot of compartments on the inside but big enough that I can put everything in containers like makeup and keep in bag.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:db01c3b2631112978022059c4fb220ae]] Was great! It fit great, I ordered a small & I’m 5”3, 120 lbs. athletic build and this hit all the right curves. I will say thought the material was sorta see through so I had to wear a VERY small nude thong so it wouldn’t be so obvious and a nude strapless. I would probably order this in a darker color"
4.0,Super nice. A little big. But loved it.
4.0,"It runs Super small! I'm 5'2&#34; 170lbs. I wear 14/16 USA size and I ordered a 5XL and it fit perfect! I'm really good at ordering from Amazon, so check the product's size chart measurements to pick your size!"
4.0,Very comfortable and soft. Tool 1 star off due to sizing. Sizing runs a size larger due to the stretcy material. Size small feels like a medium and medium feels like a large.
4.0,"I've ordered 2 of these rings. The first one never tarnished or faded after almost 2 years of wear. The second, however, is more of a yellow gold color now. I think it looks fine, I just miss the rose gold coloration of my previous ring."
4.0,Zero complaints.  I would purchase this again.  Description is accurate and is well made.  Price vs quality is very good.
4.0,"IT ARRIVED IN GREAT TIMING. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL BRACELET BUT I DID NOT NOTICE SIZING AND IT WAS WAY TOO LARGE FOR A WOMAN'S WRIST, ESPECIALLY MINE (I AM PETITE). IT CLOSES AS A BELT WOULD AND THE LEFT OVER BAND WILL CURL UP IF IT IS LONG, WHICH IS NOT AN ASSET TO IT. A BETTER CLASP WOULD MAKE THIS A FIVE STAR PURCHASE. THE LEATHER IS SOFT, THOUGH, AND I WOULD BUY ONE FOR ME IF OTHER SIZES WERE AVAILABLE. SOME OF THE SYMBLOS WERE A BIT LOOSE BUT CAN BE TIGHTENED A BIT AND IT ISN'T A BIG DEAL. ALSO, THE FLOWERS ARE NOT AS SHOWN, THOUGH SIMILAR."
4.0,Most women my wife's age would not wear this. My wife has the body and the guts.
4.0,I am a waist 32 and bought Medium. Fit well.<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019NOU96I/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5[[ASIN:B019NOU96I Platinum Sport Men's Solid Sport Bikini Swimsuit Red Medium]]
4.0,Bought these to do crossfit in. They are a bit bulkier and heavier than I thought they would be but they seem to be good quality and fit ok.
4.0,"I love that it was warm and thick material. However, the Edging is raw and uneven as seen photos. There are loose threads but that can easily be cut. This skirt is perfect for cooler weather."
4.0,Everything was great besides a damaged box. Shoes weren’t affected.
4.0,Very cute. Runs large. and the design is poorly glued every time I moved it peeled off a little more I'll have to stitch it back on. But I got alot of compliments
4.0,This is a cute dress. It fits true to size. Will be fun to wear during the summer or with a Jean jacket.
4.0,Great shirt but if you wear a XL get an XXL.
4.0,Great product idea.  The problem is my phone is too large and bulky to fit properly inside.  It really pulls on the scarf.  I just use it now without the phone as I hate to return it.
4.0,Cute outfits but a bit snug (the top).  My daughter is just 8 months old (21 lbs)
4.0,"very nice, grips hilding up well."
4.0,looks well made don't no if it will hold up to extended use as yet.
4.0,"These compression socks have been a great investment for me in terms of keeping my legs happy. They really do compress well, but are not too restrictive to where they are hard to put on. While not very soft, the fabric sits on my feet and legs well so that my legs don’t feel itchy throughout the day. And when wearing them for long periods of time, I’ve noticed I don’t have to adjust or pull them up much, something I had to do constantly with my Naturalizer brand compression socks. The socks themselves look as described, and the colors are fun but not blinding neon like other compression socks sometimes are. As of writing this, I’ve worn/washed them probably about 6-7 times and there doesn’t seem to be any loss of compression. The only drawback I need to mention is how the inside of the socks can be “stringy”, and sometimes my toes get caught on these threads while I’m putting them on. This hasn’t been a huge inconvenience but does make the product feel a bit cheaper."
4.0,"I like the raincoat.  It is light-weight and perfect for East Coast Spring.  I wore it out in a heavy, fine rain and the jacket beaded up water for a good 40 minutes during a steady downpour.  The jacket appeared to stop beading up the water, but by the time I returned home, my clothes underneath were not wet.  We were out in the rain for at least 1 1/2 hours and my clothes stayed dry.  The jacket fell to my knee--which I was pleased about.<br /><br />Good product at a fine price!!!  Very pleased"
4.0,"I love it!! But, I gave it 4 stars because it’s much more “rose gold” (copper) then the pictures show. I was hoping for a more yellow gold but it’s more copper"
4.0,"The clarity is fantastic, the only reason for star loss is the cutouts are not there. Still a great value."
4.0,Fits ok (I have a weird body type i guess so it was tight in certain places but fine in others) great for if you wanna sweat too.
4.0,"It's the size of a regular backpack. Nice , but I want it smaller."
4.0,"Like the product, won't be sending it back, but someone sowed the velcro on the wrong side of one of the straps. Not sure how that happened... but overall decent product for the price. Padding wrinkles on the inside a bit. They will be holding my safety glasses so not a huge concern with it."
4.0,The item was just as described.  The chain did have a kink in it.
4.0,Its a nice long dress. Its long and fits great. 5 foot great length.
4.0,Works for tennis
4.0,"The dress is very nice. But, I’ve had it for a while and haven’t worn it yet. This is why:<br /><br />The yellow is see-through, and the dress needed to be ironed, but after ironing it still has creases in the fabric.<br />The buttons are functional, which I did not expect. I’d be concerned about the wide space between each button, but I have to wear something underneath the dress anyway, since it’s see-through.<br />I bought this dress to wear by itself on warm days — having to wear layers underneath is uncomfortable.<br /><br />But it does look very nice."
4.0,They fit well over the nose and under the chin. They don’t was well as they come out wrinkled. I wear one next to my skin as My skin doesn’t like medical grade 1 or 3. I put my cotton mask on and then put N95 over it. For comfort.
4.0,At 46mm it is a miss should be larger due to design and functions.
4.0,"Comfy, but wears more like a winter thermal shirt than a sweater."
4.0,"A little on the shorter side than what I expected (knee length or just a tad below), but perfect fit! True to size, and nicely flattering girly look."
4.0,A bit heavier than expected but works well.
4.0,Very nice casual shirt. I found it to be a little warm though. So this will be more e of a fall shirt but like it a lot. I bought a large as I like it to be a little loose
4.0,it tells time pretty good but sometimes it 2 or 3 minutes off when  I do not touch it
4.0,"I knew these ran a bit large, so I got the next size down. The suit is adorable and I got a ton of compliments on it. If you're extremely pear shaped, or extremely top-heavy, you may end up needing to buy two suits so you can get the sizing right."
4.0,Wish it was embroidered
4.0,"My only complaint is you can see up the sleeves more than I would like. Still worth keeping. It's pretty casual and comfy. I'm not in love what the color, but it was accurate. I got a size Medium. I think it's perfect fit for my size."
4.0,I like the material and design of skort. My only issue is the shorts.  They roll up when walking or sitting.
4.0,A little bit noisy but great solution to wet sneakers
4.0,I should have just gone with my size. Medium!  But I was fooliah and thought I was a large. But still love the dress.
4.0,It's bigger than I thought.
4.0,I live the pattern of this and super comfortable the only issue I wish it was a bit tighter around the waist.
4.0,"Runs a little snug but I like it. Definitely fitted, pretty soft material overall, seams might not be great for a long run though. I try to go seamless for those so I don't chafe at all. Not fun to chafe at mile 6 when you have 6+ miles to go :)"
4.0,I wasn't crazy about the chain .  The picture mad it look more clear / see through
4.0,"It fits fine in the straight-cut/thinner parts of my body but there's hardly any stretch or give to sit down/squat. I play roller derby and need some movement. If you don't need to dance/move/sit in these, then go with the small size. Otherwise, go a little bigger. I'm a size 4/5 pants and got the small and wish I'd gotten bigger for my hips/butt."
4.0,"The case fit the label, printer perfectly. How old is the printer, the USB cable, and has room for labels."
4.0,Loved what wallet looked like online.  At the price the make and material should be alot better.  Made very cheap.
4.0,"Very nice, a bit smaller that I expected though."
4.0,ware too fast put that does not mean that they are not good because between work and biking I go thru all gloves fast but I really like them they are very comfortable and have good grip rain or shine yes I would recommend these gloves I will buy another when mine ware out thanks karl kline
4.0,I'm 4'11 / 115 lbs<br />I got a small and it fits loose. I got this dress for work. Fits fine. I wish it was a little smaller but maybe it'll shrink in the wash.<br />Also the white up top is a little see through - you have to wear a solid color bra
4.0,"I took a star off because the prints are an off-white color, but they’re still good prints. I haven’t washed it very many times so I can’t say about how long they’ll last but doing good so far. Other than than it’s an amazing hoodie, I wear it all the time."
4.0,Nice pants but a little smaller than normal size
4.0,This coat fit me but it ran large and looked odd on me. Tying it did not help the look of the jacket. It is well made but not my style. I had wanted to wear it with a black lace maxi gown for my son's wedding but it did not look right.
4.0,"A tad smaller on the top than I would have liked. Shorts are fine. Very comfy, but material pills like crazy after just a few wears. Overall it is fine because it is just pajamas, but I’d be careful if you need them for something else"
4.0,"Very simple watch - two settings (time and date) The LED lights are super bright, and it seems like it is sensitive to the touch, but not so sensitive that a shirt grazing it will turn it on. No sounds so no worry about annoying alarms. I am a 26 year old man and it fits me fine. My only critique is certain numbers are very hard to read with the lights and the band can make your wrist sweaty but for a $7 watch... this is pretty great"
4.0,Its a little light in weight even though it's a commerative.
4.0,"These pants are comfortable and I like that they have pockets. The large seem to fit well, but they do tend to slide down and I have to keep pulling them back up my waist. I’m not sure if a size smaller wouldn’t do this. I have a large in another brand that doesn’t do this."
4.0,love the racer back
4.0,"Buen producto, me gustó"
4.0,"The color is vibrant and the shirt itself is nice. I feel, though, that when I wash the shirt the decal will start to crack and eventually wash away. I don't know if it will, but is the impression I get."
4.0,Beautiful colors but somehwhat small. order a size up!
4.0,"Very sturdy feeling, don't feel or look cheap unless you really inspect them. Curious to see how they will continue to hold up, though, after several weeks they still look new. Cute glasses, slightly oversized, but in a good way, not overdone at all. I'm considering buy more in other colours."
4.0,"Dress is nicely made and fit everywhere perfectly with exception to the chest area, which was smaller."
4.0,Could use a little more material on the side boob part. But otherwise cute as can be.
4.0,"I had ordered these before, so I knew the size to get.  I love them, but I think the size is very deceiving.  I ordered 3X which is really XL."
4.0,I wear these often around the house. Not usually in public unless I am wearing a long dress because they are somewhat see-through.
4.0,Legs ride up<br />otherwise ok
4.0,The product is good but a little small for an 11 year old average US size boy . I've find ahead and ordered men's size in small for my son.
4.0,got so many compliments.  wore under bust line.  i am short and it is pretty long
4.0,"Ordered Oliver Peoples Nella. Fast shipping. Excellent packaging. Sunglasses came in the case and the soft bag inside the case. I wasn’t expecting perfection because the sunglasses were 70% off so they were likely used or came from floor models.<br /><br />I didn’t feel like paying full price for this model (after having lost one I bought full price), so I was happy with the vendor and the product. Some advice. Don’t  expect perfection.<br /><br />The vendor did an excellent job with everything else but it’s a gamble with outlets in terms of quality control for heavily discounted products.<br /><br />The hinges didn’t sit even on flat surfaces and were crooked on my face but I just fixed the wrap and tightened the hinges and they were good as new after."
4.0,"Toddler Baby Girl Clothes Halloween Outfit Long Sleeve Ruffle Shirt Tops Ghost Pumpkin Pants<br />Size 2 - measures the same as size 3 outfits.<br /><br />My little one is 17 months and is currently wearing a size 18 to 24 months. So, I wanted to order something a bit bigger so I went with the size 2. Well, it runs more like a 3. We can roll the sleeves and legs but I think it will be a bit too big for this Halloween unless she has a MAJOR growth spurt! It is so adorable and so soft though! LOVE The outfit! Very well made and nice fabric! 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,"I normally wear size M, but needed an XL for a slim fit. It's a great looking shirt and very flattering to wear. I would give it five stars but for the fact that the material is not entirely comfortable, but it is nice a stretchy."
4.0,I think I'm between sizes. The large was a tad big. I'm sure the medium would have been too smaill
4.0,"Bought this sweater for our 3 year old son. He looked great in it, and it fits...for now. The sweater is maybe a little small compared to other brands."
4.0,"Very nice for a Star Wars fan!...they were a bit smaller than expected, but that was fine, a gift for a teenage girl. They were of medium weight. I guess any bigger and they would have been pretty heavy. She liked them!"
4.0,Well made leather wallet. Holds everything i need it to for a quick jaunt to grocery store or running errands. Like the zip around that makes the cards inside secure.  Doesn't fit well for my samsung galaxy 5 but will stretch with time. The magnet for the cell phone past is not very strong. If the cell wasn't difficult to slide in i would be more worried about it falling out due to that. The change pocket zip inside holds next to nothing so I don't use it for that.  It's otherwise well made and the wristlet is convenient for quick trips. Also fits my passport although snug.
4.0,Not as opaque as I expected but will work fine under dresses.
4.0,"It's fare, nothing special with this price. Overall fine."
4.0,"I wear a 3X by most clothing lines' standards, so I ordered this skirt in a 3X. Unfortunately, it's somewhere between 5 and 10 inches too tight around the waistband for me, even though the waistband is partly elastic. I'd recommend ordering at least one size up. The skirt itself is nice though, and looks really cute. I'm going to have to keep losing weight so I can fit into it. It would be a shame to never get to wear a skirt this pretty."
4.0,"Nice, light and great for summer. Not a quick dry material but comfy and cool. Not stretchy either but again still good for a hike and around town but nothing extreme like climbing, running or yoga."
4.0,"They are really nice socks, unfortunately my legs are too fat and so they only come up half way, I was really hoping they would actually go all the way to my knees.  Oh well, live and learn. =)"
4.0,"Fit well but most of the green disappeared after washing in too hot water. The green may wash out in cold water too but I don't know. I wanted to use it as bathing suit shorts, but if it can't touch water then i obviously can't."
4.0,The first time I bought this cardigan the fit was different. The color I gorgeous though.
4.0,"As advertised. Not as flexible as I would like, so doesn't conform to smaller wrist as well as I would like"
4.0,"Purchased the dress in blue, size small based off my size: 34-25-35, 115lbs, 5'2"". Fabric and material quality is spot on as in the description. It is medium-heavy linen which I could picture being worn in all seasons. The coloring is as shown in the pictures. The sizing is a bit off, an extra small or extra, extra small would have fit me better, but it is not available (11/04/2018) in this size. Due to the dress being oversized, the look was not flattering, as I really did look like I was wearing something way to big for my petite frame. The length hit to the mid calf as shown in the picture. The buttons would make this great for nursing, and there are pockets!! A great dress for the price ($29.99) if it fits!"
4.0,Wore for wedding and they were very comfortable
4.0,Super cute. All stretch material!
4.0,I liked this dress but it was not the red shown in the picture.  It was a wine color as one of the other reviewers must have received.  I hated to send it back because it was perfect except for the color :(
4.0,Makes a big difference!
4.0,"Pretty, took a bit to receive."
4.0,The weight of the band is good and the color matches the face of the rose gold colored watch perfectly. Very pleased.
4.0,It looks just like the photo. I just wished the chain was a bit longer
4.0,"I love the gray knitted one but the silver one as pictured, has glitter on it. Hence the 4 stars."
4.0,Love the rubber sole on the bottom and perfect for my just one year old who loves taking her shoes off... because she can’t quite figure out how to get these off yet! Also she is just learning to walk and these making walking a lot easier in the pool/beach/water area.
4.0,"This dress is fun and unique. Unfortunately it runs a little loose in the waist and doesn't provide the defined look I gravitate towards. If you are looking for something more ""baby doll"" cut, this would be the perfect dress for you. I am 5'9"" and the dress hit me about 2"" above my knee."
4.0,Wife liked it a lot can’t wait to wear it
4.0,"Although it’s cute and stylish, it’s a smaller bag than expected. But it’s the perfect for a girls night out or a date night."
4.0,I loved the design and color but it was a little too small for my taste.
4.0,Its a little bit larger and longer . but the material is heaven! Very soft and comfortable and stretchy
4.0,Got this for myself for Christmas and I I can say is I’m very impressed so far.  It’s stylish and sturdy.  The automatic winding feature works well and when worn through the average work day will give it enough energy to continue ticking till the next morning. Took off a star because the watch doesn’t have a manual winding feature and the side buttons are too easy to accidentally press requiring frequent readjustment
4.0,A bit longer than I expected but I'm kinda short so. Very comfortable. Cool design. Fits well.
4.0,"Fit a little small, but great dress."
4.0,My daughter likes this style of hat. I ordered this for her and she loved it.
4.0,"I do really like it.  Wear it all the time and looks greats.  Was very difficult to adjust size.  I have two different tools for this purpose and have done it with no problem on other watchbands.  I spent hours trying to get this one adjusted.  Finally, brought it into a jeweler and had it done for me.  Cost an additional $10 that I wasn't expecting.  But, once it was adjusted, I feel it is well worth the price and goes with everything. Runs very large.  I have small wrists, and we had to take all the adjustable links out to get it to fit, so be aware if you have small wrists.  I never change to my other Fitbit bands any more."
4.0,"This is a nice skirt for the price. I think it probably runs about one size larger than normal. Even if you order two sizes, like I did, they both will fit. It's just a matter of how you want it to fit. It is a stretchy material. My hem is uneven but I don't want to return it. I took off one star for the hem."
4.0,Glasses are light weight and do as advertised. I sit behind a computer all day and have noticed headaches becoming the norm. I am hoping these glasses do the trick.
4.0,"This is a nice and functional product. However, my sunglasses broke as I kept streachijng them when putting them around my neck. My fault, but I wont use my croakies unless I have rather flexible sunglasses."
4.0,It was too small but am getting a replacement
4.0,"It is a nice jumpsuit. True to color. I am petite , (5'2, 120lbs). I am in betweem xs and s. The only size that was available was xs so I bought it but it was tight. So its true to size. Very nice color and good quality. I wish it was available on other color and sizes."
4.0,"Good overall quality, leather is thick, and brass hardware seems secure.  I use it to carry an old-fashioned English cartridge case, which fully loaded, weighs approx. 30 lbs, and this strap handles it no problem.  My only complaint is that the shoulder pad feels thin and cheap, they could have made it nicer by stitching together two layers with some cushioning in between.  For the money, a solid, if utilitarian, buy."
4.0,"Stretchy, high-quality material with a higher waist than I'm used to, but it works with the button design at the waist/stomach. This small fits like an XS or even a double XS, so be sure to order up a size if you don't want them to fit super tight. (For reference, I am 5'0 and weigh 100 lbs.)"
4.0,So far so good but I haven't wore it yet
4.0,Beautiful but tarnished quickly
4.0,"Really pretty necklace - exactly as shown in the pic - but if you have boobs, it lays funny and the layers get messed up and overlap each other. Best for people with long torsos or smaller busts so it can lay flatter."
4.0,Love the look of these earrings and they stay in place well.  Only wish they were 100% silver as I have sensitive ears but they are an excellent price and good quality.
4.0,"If you are looking for a cute bathing suit for a cheap price, this is worth it!"
4.0,Wore these at the Disney Holloween Party.  The design is well done and good quality.The shirts were comfortable but little on the smaller side and don't wash in nothing but cold they could be easily shrunk.
4.0,"Works great so far, just have to see how long they last."
4.0,"Hangs well, looks good, not see-through"
4.0,"Bought this for my wife and as she states all lingerie tends to run a little small compared to everyday clothing so, go up a size from normal. Wife said she likes it and it’s as expected."
4.0,"One thing that is not fully clear from the pictures is that the bottom end is in the ""frayed"" style, which gives it a much more casual style. That on its own would not necessarily be a bad thing, but my wife's shorts had very different frays to them. One side had around the 1/2 inch size that you can see in the picture, but the other leg had around a 1 inch fray (the left leg). This made it a very visible mismatch.<br /><br />On the positive side, she found them to be very comfortable and airy in the way that jean shorts ought to be, so I only knocked off one star for the frays"
4.0,Was surprised to find out it fit by Tissot almost perfect. Was not hard to adjust band or to put on my watch. Would recommend.
4.0,Great gift for a 3 to 6 yr old.
4.0,Beautiful dress just way too long
4.0,"The socks are beautiful, but the do slide down a bit.  It may not even be the socks, my shoes are a bit loose on me."
4.0,"Very comfortable, arm holes good do not come down too far. It is a great length, I love the ties on the side. I say it fits on the tighter size, which I think is the style. I have a bigger belly area and it clings. But it is still very comfortable. I'm normally buy 2x shirts so I ordered the 18/20 I'm 5'6 around 240lbs if that helps anyone."
4.0,Looks like a seam stitching may be coming loose and when it's fully packed to the top.... The top flap won't cover the bag completely. Used weighted to about 70# and worked great for nearly two weeks.
4.0,You gets your money worth and more
4.0,One word... Beautyfull.  !!!
4.0,"Works well with my Schuberth E1. However an issue I encountered was storing this in my hardcases and the small lever that allows engaging / disengaging the lock snapped off in 7 months. It was able to be repaired using some small zipties, but that lever is not very well protected for more rugged use."
4.0,I LIKE IT FIT GOOD SOMEWHAT BIG THO.
4.0,"It is nice and warm, and I like that in our super cold winter times. However, the Beanie Cap is a bit too short!!"
4.0,"These earmuffs are warm and attractive. They are soft on the inside, and they fit.  She finds many earmuffs are too small for her but these are not. She really likes them and that is saying a lot.  They look well made.  If for some reason they are not as good as they look,  I'll alter this report."
4.0,The dress is thin enough yet comfortable and I’m going to pair it with a sweater and wear it to church but please wear a black bra lol it’s kinda see through
4.0,Quality was very good especially for the price; fit was perfect.  Look like UGG slippers!
4.0,They're super cute and we actually used them as a halloween costume for my 3 year old. Based on other reviews we went up a size and got the 4t for our son and it got him well. He's normally a 3t and these fit great so I'm general they seem to run small in our experience with this product. But. Otherwise they are great.
4.0,"Cómo se puede apreciar en la foto la tela es bastante transparente, el material de la camisa es muy suave, parecido<br />al algodón, es una tela ligera, fresca y cómoda. La talla es Cómo corresponde, yo pedí talla M y me quedó perfecta. La camisa tiene un diseño asimétrico que la hace ver diferente y divertida, me gustó mucho. Tengo que decir que es una camisa veraniega o para climas calientes."
4.0,"Too many strands and some have read beads TOO big for my taste and the necklace doesn't seem to hang as neatly as the picture suggests (that could be me, I tend to get things tangled up).  I nonetheless kept it and give it 4 stars because (as I've done with other costume necklaces) I simply cut off two strands with the largest beads thus avoiding the YOKE-like look and made the necklace more delicate.  It also lies better now."
4.0,"These earrings are well-made, lightweight, and the gold is definitely rosey. The posts are longer than I am used to, which means they prick my skin while lying down. I just removed them before sleeping. I have had no issues with irritation or redness. These earrings come attached to cardboard in a velveteen drawstring pouch.<br /><br />I received a discount on these earrings for review.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01JUAU7OE FIBO STEEL Stainless Steel Womens Earrings Round Ball Stud Earings for Girls 6mm]]"
4.0,"Cute, good size... Tarnishes eventually... But that will happen with anything gold in color unless your buying real gold.  I wore it for 2 or 3 months before replacing."
4.0,"This watch was nice but I had to return it.  Almost impossible to see the time in the dark, which is what I wanted it for.  It's a great watch otherwise."
4.0,"Okay, well. I can tell they’re good leggings. And I want to love them but I’ll have to wait until I get the capris because these are both too high waisted and WAAAAY too long for my 5 foot self. They feel great however and look beautiful. I have no doubt I’ll like them when I get the right size."
4.0,"After reading some of the reviews for this tankini, I was really worried about the Small size I purchased for my 120lb 5 foot tall frame, but I really like this suit.  When I first pulled it out of the package the bottoms looked huge and the top looked small, but overall fits about 90% as expected.  It's just so hard to find a bathing suit that works 100% all the way around.<br />I am a size 34 A cup size and this small fits perfect, and would fit a size B as well.  It's snug around the rib cage, so if I were a inch or two large it would be too snug, and would need a Medium.  As for the bottoms, they are made almost like a cheekster bottom, so they cover your cheeks about 75-80%.  I am impressed on how secure the suit is, and stays in place while jumping waves in the beach.  I would definitely recommend this for the vibrant colors, light padding in the top which hides nipples, and complete boob coverage.  I also love the solid hot pink hip accents.<br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review."
4.0,This is the second annual sock gift. Daughter in law loves these so they go into the Christmas box every year. Fit is good and they are just a little funky.
4.0,Much smaller in person. Haven't worn it yet. Silver heart in middle is quite off centered. Still cute and for price good product.
4.0,"Love this hoodie, fits a little on the small side but great quality"
4.0,"They are a bit see-through, but they are long which is what I have been looking for, the straps are adjustable , and they fit comfortably on the shoulder, I got a few of these, and I would defiently buy more!!"
4.0,I love it but after washing and drying it started to peel. Fabric is low quality and too expensive.
4.0,"I buy these pants for my two sons, but will be buying some for myself in the near future.  They fit well, seem to be wearing well (that is not wearing out quickly) and have all the pockets they will ever need.  The boys say that they are comfortable and light weight.  The are a good value for my family in comparison to other utility/tactical pants.  I'll add my own thoughts when I have a pair of my own."
4.0,pretty skirt
4.0,"You get just what you paid for: a very small, very light umbrella for traveling. I was very pleased, and unfortunately someone else appreciated it and snarfed it from me in a restaurant bathroom. The radius of the umbrella is modest, and it isn't the sturdiest, but it was just what I needed and I will be ordering another."
4.0,"Great! I'm hoping I can shrink it a bit in the dryer because it's just a tad loose up top. Other than that I love this dress! This is my second Miusol dress. I think I found my new favorite brand! Finding dresses that fit is really hard because I'm short and somewhat curvy with a short torso.<br />For reference my measurements are 33, 27, 38 and I'm 5'1&#34;."
4.0,"I like this, but was not as pleased with it in person."
4.0,Nice and well made. I'm glad I bought it.
4.0,Dress eas comfortable and perfect for the wedding. So many compliments received.
4.0,Not true to size.  Normally I wear a large but upsized to XL.  The XL was too snug.  So I ended up returning & ordering a 2XL.  Fits perfectly now - excellent quality.  Just make sure you go up a couple of sizes.
4.0,SUPER cute and comfortable.. My only problem with them is the fact that they ride up.. But no biggie.. They also do run a bit on the small side.. So plan ahead an get a size bigger! 😉
4.0,I have to take it to get the shoulders taken in a little. Otherwise its good. Its not a very spectacular jacket. But its good for the price.
4.0,These are pretty and comfortable.  They are petite and work well for everyday wearing.
4.0,"I’m 5’6, 140 ordered a medium. Fits well. Slightly short on the back side. Material is thin, which should be good for summer weather.<br />The pleating and pockets make me look like I have a belly, depending on how I stand."
4.0,"I wanted a small, bezel-set pair of second hole studs.  Had bought bigger CZs before, but these are the discreet size I prefer.  I've been wearing them since I received them - pretty, well-made and just what I wad looking for."
4.0,The clip at the end of the band broke. It was a nice watch until it broke.
4.0,"My husband lost his wallet around Christmas, he did end up finding it after we ordered this wallet and an AirTag but still a good buy since he misplaces his wallet somewhat often.<br /><br />The blue color is nice, seems very functional for all different kinds of cards ID spot on the outside and inside.<br /><br />I do think it kind of scuffed in two spots already so we’ll see about how it will hold up in the long term, specially for the price. Probably not the most expensive wallet ever but it also was not cheap to buy specially when you consider you have to still buy an AirTag for $30."
4.0,"Been looking for a yellow belt for forever.  And this is a bright sunshine yellow.  Only the front is leather type material the rest is streach band.<br />Solid belt, well made. Very happy with it."
4.0,"Elastic straps aren't the right lengths at top of boot, some are too tight and the others hang loose  off the knee. Otherwise the shoes themselves fit as expected. They may look better over pants but as is they aren't as attractive looking as expected."
4.0,Feels like PJS that I can wear to work. Super comfortable. Thinner material than I expected but if washed delicately and hung to dry I think it'll hold up well. Cute on. I'm 5'5 125lbs and got a small
4.0,"Clip JUST fits over my 1.25&#34; belt. Very snug, but it does fit. I cannot see it fitting on anything bigger at all. I've only had this a little while so I can't speak to the longevity, but I don't see why it would break down too quickly. The overall action of sliding a key ring on/off isn't as smooth and mindless as I would like. I'm not saying it's bad, but I've had other holders that are much easier. There are mini ridges cut into the stainless laterally to give the swing-arm a bit of texture. I'm not sure what it's there for other than decoration, but they slow the movement down just a bit. In addition, the area that you must press the swing-arm in order to remove a key ring is very small and it seems like your thumb is just in the way.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is the manufacturing. The metal eems like it was rough-cut out of a bigger sheet but no effort was made to smooth the edges. If you take the holder and moderately brush it against your skin, it'll rough it up leaving white makes, but not drawing any blood. It's not sharp enough to cut your skin or even snag clothing, but the edges are clearly not smooth. This won't be an issue for causal users, but for those with there hands on it 24/7, it'll get annoying. I don't use mine much, I just need to keep keys out of my pocket, so I'm going to use this. However, for heavy users, I'd sped a few more dollars and get a finished product."
4.0,Thick wool cap.
4.0,Bras straps show. But a pretty dress
4.0,Cute. Not the best quality but you get what you pay for. Great for a fun night out!
4.0,"It looks really REALLY cute, the ring isn't too heavy and the necklace doesn't break at all. THe only complaint I have is that the part where the ring clasp meets the leather/pleather necklace portion is really irritating, I had a red spot right at my collarbone after that night because it's that irritating. The necklace is really cute and I got tons of compliments, but it's kind of irritating and annoying to wear, not sure if I want to wear it too much after."
4.0,I like this top.  The material is lightweight and comfortable.  What I liked the most is that the collar is not too high so it doesn't bother my neck. I didn't give it 5 stars because I wish it was just a bit longer in length.  I'm short (5') and it just comes to the very top of my hips.  I would recommend it though.
4.0,"Cute sweater, love the cut. You have to wear a shirt under because of the high slits on side, but that’s what makes this sexy"
4.0,They shrink after the first wash
4.0,Item received exactly as described & shown
4.0,Super cute :3 and legit
4.0,"This shirt is very comfortable and very warm... way too warm for summer (I'm at the end of summer right now) It's not all that cute, but it fit like I expected it to and it wasn't form fitting (I hate form fitting clothes) It's the kind of shirt I could see myself wearing again and again, either around the house or on a quick run to a store. It's not something I would wear to anything remotely formal.<br /><br />Sadly, I only wore it once before I made a mess of it. Because it's so light-colored (the blue one is, anyway), I dropped a tiny bit of food on it while I was out to eat and it stained! It also doesn't look like it will be easy to get the stain out. Alas, my slobby self will probably have to demote it to a bed shirt now. I'll have to wait for summer to be over, though, because it's definitely not an August shirt!"
4.0,my daughter loves the paw print
4.0,Really like this.purse. It is my everyday work purse!!
4.0,"Bought this for my 2 year old son, it's a tad bit small on him but he's got a big head! Other than that he loves it and it seems to be made well."
4.0,"Great product for the price, especially since there were so many in one pack. They were however, I but on the larger size. My son normally wears a large, but I should have gotten the medium instead"
4.0,"Bought as a gift, fabric is average for an apron. It's decent for the price. It came in the mail pretty fast, about a week. I'm not exactly an apron (or grill) master myself so 4 stars seemed fair enough for the price and product"
4.0,A bit small. My daughter wears 4T and it fit a little snug. I recommend getting one size bigger.<br /><br />My Daughter is 3ft tall and weights 38 lbs.
4.0,Fits a little different than my other caps but honestly I don’t care enough to complain almost 5 star.
4.0,order 2 of these for my older daughters.
4.0,"So my main complaint is this arrived with a stain (on the #4) and it didn’t wash it out (see picture).  I think it might actually be an error in the printing.  Colors not great around the collar either (see picture). Normally this would cause me to give it a low rating , however  my 7 year old absolutely loves it and has been wearing it nonstop.  the overall impact is still pretty adorable and Since he is in no way bothered by theses details and the stain is not super noticeable I still gave 4 stars, but thought I should add pictures as I imagine this may matter more to others."
4.0,Nice black work pants I purchased the med.I wear a size 6 in jeans and they are tight in the waist.Would recommend just size up when ordering.
4.0,"These earrings are very unusual and very attractive.  I would have liked them to be smaller, but the price was right."
4.0,Would rate 5 stars for comfort and fit but from the photo I thought the item would be a much lighter grey.
4.0,"Cute dress, lots of compliments! I wore this on my honeymoon in cancun and it was perfect. The bottom slip could be a tad bit longer (as others have noted), but when you walk this dress just comes alive! I also have a larger chest but didn't have any issues going bra-less due to the fabric on top being thick. I dont know when I'll wear this again, but for the occasion it was perfect!"
4.0,Love it..looks like the pic and metal is vibrant
4.0,This blouse runs small. The shoulder sowing is not on my shoulders but on my traps. If it fit correctly I would’ve given it 5 stars. But it’s very beautiful and I kept it. Love the material and how stretchy it is.
4.0,Presentation  Is nice. It’s okay.. look better on the picture. 🤷🏾‍♂️
4.0,loved the shirt fit well. the only thing was his eyes looked wonkey.
4.0,"Very nice watch, seems to run a little small but it will work out fine for me."
4.0,"I like the hat and have received many compliments on how cut it is. It does sit rather low on my head, I think it is meant to be worn by a man. But it is still cute. Can't wear glasses or sunglasses with it though."
4.0,Low quality but great price! The drawstrings need to be retied or else they will come loose
4.0,Looks great but the frames look flimsy
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, however they are very heavy so the ear clamp starts to hurt after a few hours."
4.0,"I wouldn't work out in this top, it doesn't have a lot of support. More of a crop top, but I'm very happy with it as a sexy shirt. The top is figure-flattering and has a shelf bra. The straps are a little long on me, I wish I could adjust them, but it still fits. The material is soft. There are removable pads in the shelf bra also, and the back of the top is super cute with strap details.<br /><br />Good quality. Fits true to size, would recommend as a top, but not as a sports bra."
4.0,I'm 5'3 and weigh roughly 120 lbs. I ordered a small and they fit fine but are tight around the waist. They're still comfortable but the fabric doesn't have any stretch to it. So I would order a size up from your normal size.
4.0,Great bathing suit cover up!
4.0,My Mr. just started to try and learn to swim. These goggles are perfect. The nose plugs and ear plugs were an added bonus.
4.0,Look good fit well. The only thing is the shorts part are a little to wide for me but still like them.
4.0,Though I don't technically wear it my fianc&eacute; loves it.  My fianc&eacute; is about 5'7'' and this makes it to her knees fairly easily. Very soft and comfortable to lounge around in. She generally used a blanket if she wants to keep warm.<br />Overall I would recommend it!
4.0,I liked the mask
4.0,"This is a very cute dress. It does run pretty large though. Also, according to the picture, it ends just above your knee. You probably have to be very tall for this. I am 5.4 and it goes down to my calves. But the color is nice, its well made. You can order one size down though."
4.0,"It's looks like there's a bit of shape to the waist but it's just a rectangle with sleeves. I know how to sew and will be attempting to cinch the waist but it wont be easy with this material. Also, it's soft and scratchy and very warm. I'd guess it's a wool blend."
4.0,"Dress was very pretty and comfortable.  Children's well,  fit is slightly smaller than normal."
4.0,"I bought these for my wedding shoes, I still go blisters because they didnt stay up. There was an elastic band on the back to help, but they fit small so it didnt stay up"
4.0,"This is top is super cute on a teen girl but it is a bit on the thin side, imo. The sleeves have a nice size bell shape to them. It is true to size. My daughter says it's comfortable and would like it in other colors. I would buy it again."
4.0,The plastic strap that goes over the top of your foot is a little sharp & uncomfortable but will stretch with time. I advise not putting anything that will leave moisture or residue inside the shoe because the opening is small making it hard to clean out the inside.
4.0,"These are extremely comfortable and easy to breathe through.  The ear loops help keep them in place. Some businesses have asked me to switch to a traditional mask, the only reason not 5 stars."
4.0,Product fits nicely
4.0,"It was bigger than expected which made it a little gaudy. I will make the chain smaller to be more like a choker length which will stop the flower from banging around. I like it for the price, but if you are looking for a really really nice thing, go somewhere else. What are you doing here? Spend more money."
4.0,The dress is beautiful but it runs small. I bought a XL but I should have bought it a couple of sizes up. It fit really snugged like spandex.
4.0,"The fit of this dress is definitely one size larger.  I had broken arm & foot so I needed loose fit, however I probably won’t wear it this next year because it hangs on me like a tent.  I’m a medium and ordered this in a medium but it’s definitely a large."
4.0,Nice and comfortable. I like it.
4.0,This cardigan is HUGE but will come in handy if I need a tent. What is the yarn made of?
4.0,I’m happy with it as an easy throw on dress to run errands in during the summer or wear out to lunch. I don’t like the neck situation in the back so I’ll just tuck it in when I wear it.
4.0,"Great graphics, but the silky material may not be breathable (so not good to wear outside) or fire-retardant for use as pajamas."
4.0,Good thickness. Would definaly not dry it in the dryer. Size up 1 size if you have any curves.
4.0,The only downfall is they snag a little to easy.
4.0,I like the bag overall. It's beautiful and spacious. Color is quite elegant. The only flaw I found is the shoulder straps. The edges are not smooth so it is a little rough on your skin. If the manufacturer read this please find a way to improve on that. I will definitely buy your revised version.
4.0,"Stiff material, but a nice looking shirt. I  wear a large but with this shirt I needed an xl."
4.0,I bought this to wear under stuff to expand the length.  It is very good at accomplishing just that.  The quality is fine for the price.
4.0,"The shorts are fine, although I have a few quibbles with the design.<br /><br />Firstly, the belt. Not really necessary, as there's a string tie inside. But the belt itself is useless, it's just a strip of elastic. Pull it tight, it just stretches. Pull it tighter, and you have about 9 inches of leftover strap dangling off to the left. And you can't remove it, it's sewn in!<br /><br />The left pocket seals with two velcro squares. But the squares are far apart, on each corner of the flap. If you want to open the pocket, you have to pull on one corner, then the other - they don't come open together. Sometimes pulling the second corner re-seals the first. And there's still a large gap between the two squares, large enough you can take things out / put things in without opening the flap. So you have neither security NOR convenience.<br /><br />There's also a puzzling slim pocket on the right behind the mesh zippered pocket. I do like the mesh pocket with the zipper, but the narrow pocket is a bit of a puzzle. What's it for, exactly? There was a slim cardboard cutout of a pair of pliers there - are these work shorts or swim trunks. Weird."
4.0,Should have ordered the next size up.
4.0,"Nice umbrella. Sturdy, pretty, just what I ordered. It's not as big as the umbrella I had used for years, and so I feel as if I'm settling, even though it's a really nice umbrella!"
4.0,Product is fine but way too big for me
4.0,"The hat looks very nice, I got the black one with the white lettering and I have to say it met my expectations. When I got the box it was destroyed. The box looked like it was in a fight. All the corners were smashed in and it was overall crushed. But I wasn't to concerned because it wasn't exactly fragile. when I took the hat out of the box it looked really nice. there was two pieces of string that was hanging off the hat, all I did was cut them off. I wasn't surprised that when I took the hat out of the sealed bag it smelled like fish. (no offense to my Chinese friends out there) It smelled like it came from the fishing docks, but that didn't really matter I just used cologne to freshen it.  that hat does need to be broken in, the fit is a bit awkward and the bill of the hat slightly bends up. other wise great hat."
4.0,Fit was great 👍🏽 wears well!!
4.0,In my opinion the product should have more velcro surfaces which would enable the sandal to fit more snug based on the users preferences.  The sandal looks very nice and is comfortable.
4.0,"The dress was bought for my great-grand whose mommy is expecting.  She wanted to be dressed in the same color as  her mommy d  at the baby shower and the fit was perfect, the color was perfect and she loved it.  Not flimsy but good quality.  She can wear this dress for many more occasions to come."
4.0,"Not quite as perfect as the Apple band, but close."
4.0,Very sturdy wallet with plenty of room for cards with no struggle to get cards out like some other wallets. The half zippered side wallet is perfect for storing cash but not so good for change.  I ordered the pink color and it's a soft blush pink just as you see it pictured.  Will definitely order again in another color.
4.0,Very pretty! I sized my finger wrong so it doesn’t fit on the finger I bought it for but it fits on another one so I’m keeping it.
4.0,comfy chones. Good price. I am a 40 waist. Bought a package of XL White and the fly doesn't always stay closed. Bought a Package blue and a package of stripes 2X. Fit good. fly stays cosed.
4.0,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift, so I can't really say how much the recipient will like it; however, I'm very please with my purchase and think it's a very pretty scarf."
4.0,Perfect size for my 7 yr old to carry her dance stuff to/from the studio. Bag material is a little stiff and it arrived with a chemical odor that had to be aired out but overall happy with the purchase. It's a cute design and gets the job done.
4.0,"I bought them for my son. He needed  a wide arch sandals .They are light weight ,and  fit pretty good ."
4.0,Definitely need to order a size up!
4.0,It Hasn’t been cold enough to really see if they will keep your hands warm. But I love that I can wear the inside glove separate from the mitten.
4.0,"The jogger looks very nice, but the fit was very big for me. I was going to use the jogger for working out but I to return it back."
4.0,"I was suppose to receive the 3X but instead received the 2X size.😔<br /><br />It's more of a Bluish Gray in color than an actual Blue Blue color. It has an eye catching design around the neck / bust area. Short fluttery sleeves.<br /><br />Thankfully ... it does stretch (thank you, Spandex). The only problem with that is that you can than see every lump, bump & roll on my body (no thank you, Spandex).<br /><br />** Keep in mind that this is not the actual size shirt I usually wear or was suppose to receive. **<br /><br />The shirt is thin & light weight. Has a Silky type feel to it but it comes in a great longer length (like 55 inches long).<br /><br />Overall, an okay shirt. Not really my style but would probably look great with a flowing longer skirt or leggings. Giving you that boho hippie type vibe."
4.0,Felt strangled in itt.
4.0,Im a little chubby and with this fabric its easy to see all the little bumps and lumps but other than that I recommend it the material feels genuine to that of sports wear I recommend this
4.0,Great set and the material is soft and silky. They run small (I'm a size small and had to go up to a large)
4.0,looks nice in jeans and a T-shirt. must buy as a casual watch
4.0,"First, this feels like a very high quality sweatshirt.  The inside is fleece and the outside is smooth.  The inside and the outside of the hood are also smooth.  The elastic cuffs are thicker than typical and this makes them look high quality.  The zipper and tie cord are colored to match the color of the sweatshirt. The waist has the tie cord but the hood does not which is nice for a change -- it's not swinging in the way all the time.  I find it very cozy and warm.  I do wish the entire sweatshirt was longer. The main pictures in the listing that show the model with the various colors make this appear hip-length.  It is not.  It hits above the navel. The sleeves are also a tad short for my liking - wish they were two inches longer. Because this is so cute, I will try to make this work by wearing a longer shirt underneath. I also noticed that the fleece inside comes off onto any shirt you wear underneath."
4.0,"Very comfy. the top half is a little loose but I'm small up top, but it is not too bad."
4.0,fit good but a little snug around the waist. overall looks good and the fabric is nice.
4.0,This is not a large backpack and it is not small either. The quality doesn’t look cheap and feels durable. The color is eye catching.
4.0,"Bought these for my icy-foot spouse to wear on cold days in our wood-floor house.  She likes them, they are comfy and definitely non slip but not quite as warm as expected.  Good for cool evenings, perhaps not so good for cold evenings.  But good quality and comfy."
4.0,Cute hoodie with good colors. Took over 3 weeks to received. Shipped from China
4.0,Quite pleased with the Breezer - with a slight breeze and a little sweat on your hair it really does feel quite cool.  The size medium will fit a 7-1/8 but it's on the snug side.
4.0,A little smaller than expected but good workmanship.
4.0,Too big for my size 6-8 frame. The cloak is sold as a one size fits all. I’m keeping it but not happy with the sizing. The cloak is well made and looks very nice. I’m hoping bulky sweaters will make a difference.
4.0,"Delivery was very fast......Very cute eventhough it was a lilttle too big...It was workable, and love it☺😊😉"
4.0,If you love South Carolina...this is a must.  True to size and good material.
4.0,"The loupe is meant to have with me for reading small text on labels so once in a while. Works perfect, does hardly take space in my pocket. It was quick sent without any issue. Good product, good price."
4.0,I entered this rating because I do not know what it would take to rate a 5 star for this item.
4.0,"Very nice jacket, XL fits me well without feeling bulky. Not a hunter but I fish on the jetty at the ocean. Does a good job keeping me warm blocking the cold wind and keeps me dry from water splashing up."
4.0,"The bracelet is very nice, but it is not hot pink.  It is more of a deeper pink.  Hoping it will match my daughters other prom accessories."
4.0,"great fit but low cleavage and very shiny, so I returned due to occasion that I needed the dress for"
4.0,My son's 8 and he loved the watch because of the light. It looks better the picture than it does in person only because it looks more plastic and cheap but overall he loved it that's all that matters
4.0,These are great shorts for the money! I got the green pair and worked out in them today. I only had them roll up twice but they stayed put for the majority of my workout. They are nice and thick and squat proof as far as I could tell! Overall great quality
4.0,Product arrived on time and was delivered in expected condition
4.0,"Good price, fit, and quality for the skirt. Happy with purchase."
4.0,Quality isn't the greatest (already gotten a couple of runs/holes in them) but my son LOVES these!
4.0,"This is gorgeous but extremely small, and with me being mixed and having a thicker nose it was very hard to get in, and not that noticeable. So just keep that in mind when thinking about buying this"
4.0,This went perfect with my dress for my roaring 20s holiday party.
4.0,"i liked it , wife  didnt , said it looked too shiny so i got a stainless steal instead.. wear it  everyday to the gym even.."
4.0,Cute shirt! Definitely order a size up for all my pulse size friends!! I normally wear a 2x and I'm glad I ordered a 3x!! A little short but I like It
4.0,"Its perfect for my travels,"
4.0,Very comfortable and love the color!
4.0,I got this in a short amount of time. The navel ring is beautiful. I put it in right away...... Sadly it broke. But it was such a easy fix I just brought pliers to it To hook the cross back up. Ever sence then I've had no problems and no infections ( I have real sensitive skin ) so I do recommend this product overall
4.0,It is a lil more snug than other shirts I wear but got lots of nice comments on it
4.0,"Comfort was there the moment we starter on our daily walk. No pressure points , no slipping in the heals. I would purchase this shoe again."
4.0,I bought this 2 years ago and I still love it<br />its great for the price would recommend
4.0,Really great for the price they are alot darker shaded then most glasses ive tried in this price range
4.0,Such a pretty and well fitting bra! I would have given it all stars but you cannot wear this under a T-shirt or something like. You can see the bumpy lace. But it fits and supports really great without stupid padding that those of us with large breasts don’t need
4.0,"I run between an XL and XXL on most things, so I got a XXL just in case.  I had to recheck the label thinking I had received a 4xl.  Luckily I was able to wash it on Hot and and dry it for 3 hours to get it to shrink to a more acceptable size.  It is very warm and I like the inner material."
4.0,great fit its real to its size
4.0,These glasses cases were exactly what I wanted for my reading glasses. I really like them.
4.0,The item is cute and warm but it does run a full size small
4.0,it looks bigger on site.
4.0,The arms should have more space
4.0,"comfortable, roomy."
4.0,Love this dress. It makes a perfect little black dress.
4.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and normally wear size 4. The sizing chart in the images said I was a Large but I had to exchange for a medium, which fits much better. The  leg slit also lined up much better with the M.<br /><br />The material is not the softest I have ever worn, but the dress is cute,  so I will make due! Good buy for the price."
4.0,"Cute, Very comfy but lose Fitting."
4.0,I loved them but they ran small.
4.0,Shipping & handling were as promised. Excellent.<br />The sizing of the shirt’s is at least one or two sizes under what seems to be a standard size expectation.
4.0,Awesome jacket! Great fit! Sleeves are a little tight at the wrist but I think it's intentional. Really pleased with quality.
4.0,"For cheap sunglasses they're fine. The lenses do distort some, but they do the job and for $10 I'm not going to complain."
4.0,Cozy sweater.  Really like it.  Comfy!  Only problem with it sheds.  Don't know a better way to explain.  But would purchase this brand again!
4.0,Great look and very comfortable. A few days in and it keeps accurate time. I'm 5'11&#34; 215 lbs.  If I were much bigger the watch band would be to small. It does however fit just as I like with no adjustment.
4.0,It was the right size and simple design for me.  I needed a clutch that I can bring with me to more formal events but I also wanted one I could just grab and go for a night out.
4.0,It's a decent black top for the summer but it's oversized so size down if you prefer a closer fit.
4.0,Nice watch and cheaper price
4.0,Great color and comfortable. I’ve worn in summer as a dress and now as a tunic over jeans.
4.0,"These are nice sized earrings. I bought these in all 3 sizes but returned the .8 as they were larger than I like and had missed seeing them in the .6 originally - I want to wear them in my double pierced ears so wanted two different sizes. The 'glitter' isn't as good as some others I have, but still nice. I had a slight issue w/the .4 in that one of the red earrings had 2 spots that were just clear - they had missed adding the color. Rather than go through the hassle of returning them, I just colored them with a red marker. Those two spots don't sparkle, but doubtful anyone will notice other than me. I wish I had thought to use red glitter fingernail polish instead of the marker, but I didn't - an idea for someone else if they run into the same issue. LOVE that the posts are stainless steel."
4.0,"My customers say ""These are the most intense or painful nipple clamps!""<br />Know your customer's nipples - This product works for ANY SIZE nipples - Slightly difficult Adjustment<br />The type of clamping system is a bit harsh and it's easy to go from so lose that they fall off to so tight that they inflict some intense pain, limiting session time."
4.0,"For the money I paid, it was great."
4.0,Nice fit! Though I had to seam rip a buttonhole open.
4.0,I love the dress and it fits as expected but the buttons are a little loose. I plan on changing them.
4.0,"Purchased this dress in orange - the price is great and it's super comfortable and cute!  There is one major issue in the back; there is a keyhole-type opening that fastens with a button and loop.  The loop is too small to fit the button!!  But, I have long hair and the keyhole is not that big, so I actually just wear it unfastened!  It may have been a one-off defect, but just be warned that you may need to make a new loop or switch out the button on your own.. or just wear it unfastened like me.  But honestly I love it anyway, I've worn it quite a few times both casually and in a work setting with a cardigan."
4.0,"it takes some breaking into, but overall, they're very comfortable and will probably last my entire lifetime! arrived in a timely manner, excellent condition."
4.0,Looks like the picture but the piercing was slightly too big
4.0,Perfect sizing for me. The one shoulder design keeps my left side free from pain because no strap presses on my pacemaker. I wish you had this design in regular bras.
4.0,"Very pleased with the pendant. It closes securely and looks very nice and shiny. Was hoping for a better chain, this is like a dog-tag kind of chain but for the price, it's all good."
4.0,"it's a adorable skirt for sure, i just wish i received the size i ordered. the seller generously went a few sizes up since it's chinese sized, but i already intentionally done that so the first skirt i received was way to big! they allowed me to keep it & offered to ship a smaller sized instead of a refund which was fine. my only problems was the shipping takes nearly a month & the 2nd skirt i received was still abit big but fitted better than the last. I noticed i have another skirt of the same brand (that i didn't buy from here) that was a xs & fits me perfect. just wish i received what i ordered but seller handled it perfectly."
4.0,"you can't beat getting six pieces for this price. the quality is lightweight and the larger one is defiantly big. the sizes are great.<br />however, the zippers are a little weak, i opened one as soon as i got it and had trouble with the zipper already and nothing was even in it yet... but for the price you can't beat it. just be gentle with them and easy on the zippers."
4.0,great!  firs well  and warm in cold weather too<br /><br />would buy again
4.0,Great sound dress but still sexy to my husband.
4.0,My son is so happy
4.0,"Great swimsuit top.  I got it to match some black bottoms that I recently ordered.  Fit as expected, just need to work on my shape a little more to feel more comfortable in it.  :)"
4.0,The belt was not included with the shorts making the outfit incomplete. If it would have been included the outfit would have been cute.
4.0,I like the way the shorts look and they are a good length. The material isn’t as soft as I’d hoped so that’s why I gave them 4 stars but overall pretty happy with them.
4.0,Good and cute
4.0,The outside zipper gets stuck. Be prepared to unzip before you get to the checkout.
4.0,not used to wearing face masks. Light weight. Love it.
4.0,This is an amazing skirt. The tag did say that you could put it in the dryer so I did and it completely shrunk and ruined. I ordered another but learned my lesson!!
4.0,I really like these...I won't lie they are difficult to get in with long nails but it is possible. They look awesome on. Definatly love them💖
4.0,Love it! The slip knots were already tied which makes it super easy to get on and off.
4.0,Purchase as a bday gift and he loved it. Soft and love how it looked on him. I would definitely purchase more from this company in different styles
4.0,I really like these earrings and they’re very well made but they are quite a bit smaller than I was expecting.
4.0,Very cute. Problem for me was they changed color after using them in water
4.0,"Fits okay. After about 3 wears some of the seams started to rip, but they were able to be mended."
4.0,"Topmdoes run big, get one size smaller"
4.0,"These are the design I like, however they are longer, up and down, than similar ones I have used before.  I hope they bring those smaller ones back."
4.0,Pretty cute stick on earrings. Thought they would be more glittery but still look cute. Girls ages 3 and 4 LOVE these.
4.0,"For the price, the skirt is amazing. However, the ivory is definitely not ivory. My dress is ivory and with the skirt placed on top, it looks pink. It’s pretty and I’m actually going to keep it as is, but it’s not ivory. If you want ivory, order white and get a belt to offset it. Other than that though, I love it! It came on time and is poofy and pretty comfy. The elastic waistband bothers me a little but again, get a belt. Works perfectly as an overskirt on top of my sheath wedding dress to wear at the ceremony!"
4.0,"Shiny, thick and nice material. Pleased with order."
4.0,A bit larger than expected.
4.0,this is a nice bag the perfect size for me
4.0,"I bought this for my young kids. Product comes in a well packed packet. It’s not fit for small kids. But I keep it for next few years, I think so."
4.0,"This hoodie is thick, warm, and cute but it runs VERY small, is not very stretchy, and it shrank after I washed it. I am going to give it to my daughter and order a L... although I MIGHT even end up exchanging for an XL. I am 5’3” and weigh 125 lbs. I am usually a size M but this M was too small."
4.0,This stand was nice but as others have mentioned softer caps dont sit in it as well.
4.0,Not to expensive cap that it rather thin but it’s comfortable.
4.0,A good pair of shorts that I purchased for a wonderful price. Traditional fit.
4.0,Nice but you need to have small nipples for this to fit
4.0,"I purchased this watch on the ""Flash Sale"" page. Took a chance on Casio. I own a lot of watches - here are my thoughts.<br />- Size: nice fit, I have a small wrist<br />- Weight: a little on the light side<br />- Band: ""rubber"" but not very soft or flexible and it runs long. I have to use the last hole to make it fit my wrist. So, if you have a big wrist you'll love the length.<br />- Face: really nice design, and easy to read w/out readers.<br />- Watch width: this is a thinner watch then I expected but makes it a bit more comfortable.<br />Overall - happy with the purchase and the deal I got on it."
4.0,"Good fit, the weight of a thick tee shirt. Sturdy enough that the pockets can hold something without getting all stretched out. Kind of scratchy inside. Hoping it softens up with washing and wear."
4.0,Very nice and roomy. It looks and feels like leather due the quality of the PCV. Plan on buying it in another color
4.0,I really like this shirt. It does not match the description though. The sleeves are much longer than what it shown in the photo. Everything else is the same though and I really enjoy a lot.<br />It came much sooner than expected which I like about this seller.
4.0,Nice sweater and color.  I now have 3 different colors.
4.0,Served the purpose well lightweight nylon?? Materials for the jacket and pants . Its definitely not the same material a suit or tux would be made out of but it was definitely comfortable for baby and looked nice. I  have only washed once and everything held up I don't see him wearing it again because we dont have an occasion for it but he could if need be. Fits according to chart
4.0,I like it so far.  The test will be how it lasts.
4.0,"Fit my watch, relatively easy to resize band, but retaining pins are difficult to get to stay in without some modification, somewhat cheap feeling, clasp is a little sharp around edges.  That being said, great replacement band at 10% original cost of the OEM band that broke after one year!"
4.0,Very comfortable to wear even with the snug fit
4.0,"Very flattering. Classic fit. Fabric is not too thin or too thick. It won't keep you very warm, but it's a perfect topper for sleeveless dresses."
4.0,A little tighter than expected. I’m 5’ and about 125+/- and they were pretty snug on me as well as a little short. I was able to get them on and button the sides but they’re pretty tight. I purchased a size small. I probably should’ve ordered a medium.
4.0,"It's cute and I like the color. It does look much better in person than it does in the picture. It is flimsy, but that is kind of to be expected."
4.0,This roomy purse with plenty of space for all that needs to fit in can be found through a variety of zippers and pockets. The handles can be used or the convenient strapped provided allows for over the shoulder placement. Nice look and feel.
4.0,Great price fast shipping.
4.0,"This is a cute, cusal shirt. Despite the denim color it is not denim, strudy or rugged. The materil is light, thin and comfortable. The white contrast trim and white buttons provide a sort of country western vibe. It is  regular fit. It is not as generous as some brands so if you tend to have a little pudge, a lot of muscle or are between sizes, definitely go up a size. It launders nicelyOveraall a nice shirt. It feels like  nice, breathable, soft dress shirt but is more at home in casul, relaxed venues."
4.0,I liked the earring but for me they were too large.  gave it to a friend of mine and she loved them.
4.0,"The color is much more blue then in the picture and the material feels odd to me. Other then that, it fits great and really gets the job done."
4.0,Disappointed it’s not that adjustable
4.0,"A cute, simple top to wear over a bathing suit. The back is really just a string so you can't wear a bra with it unless you want it to be seen."
4.0,Grandson loved product
4.0,Works good for the purpose however made out of poly and not real durable however price is good
4.0,The seller shipped it properly. Not really much else to write seeing how this was just the seller and not the actual manufacturer.<br />I will add that the straps are thinner than I had thought. Actually I hadn’t thought at all about the straps in my search. So many bags these days have oversized straps that I was surprised that these seemed significantly thinner that what’s currently trending. It’s still a great all season bag.
4.0,"This dress fits beautifully, I'm normally a Medium/36B, 150 lbs, 5'7"" and I bought a Medium.  In the yellow color it was see through enough for me to need a slip - but looks great with one.  After the first wash the material changes slightly and wrinkles up a bit.  May need a quick iron if you don't like a casual look.  Hits slightly below the knee, pockets are decent and somewhat functional.  Cute enough for the price that I would buy again."
4.0,"I like this tank. Its long, mid thigh on me, I'm 5'9&#34;. And very flowy. I'm a 36G and I ordered a large, fit's nice around the arm holes. Usually finding top to accommodate my top half means the arm holes are huge. Its a nice soft, stretchy comfortable fabric. I will order more. Great over leggings and skinny jeans. Covers the tush."
4.0,Nice for my spouse!!
4.0,"Worked just like advertised, great quality"
4.0,"These are so much better in quality than I anticipated! They are comfortable to wear, decently made. The only major thing is that some of the arms are loose on the hinge, but an eyeglass repair screwdriver fixes that easily.<br />The 10 pairs in assorted colors are brightly colored and look good. I actually have put pairs in my cars, stroller, bags, desk, so I am ready to walk out the door without any cares and any time.<br />The size is great for my normal sized head, they also look good on my teenagers. The lenses are dark without being either too dark or too light.<br />Really, for the price, look and quality these are a no brainer, and not just as party favors!"
4.0,perfect fit. good fabric. delivered on time. My boyfriend loves it :-)
4.0,"Update: Our winter got a little chilly this year (in the 40s) so I ordered this dress again but accidentally got a medium this time. To my surprise, it fit! Because this dress has a free open hip area and like a bell shaped flare, it wasnt too small for me! (I'm pear shaped)  The only place I noticed it was tighter was in the arms. So, if you're a petite 14 like me and have smaller arms for your size, you might want a medium for a little closer fit. The large will give you a nice fit too but looser in the arms/neck. Otherwise, the body still fits nicely over my 38 bust and 34 waist - even in medium!<br /><br />I'm a size 14, 38C. Large fit perfectly. But the fabric is too warm for Florida. Would be better for cooler climates. Fabric is a soft, velvety kinda plush. I'm only 5 foot tall so it fit more like midi length instead of knee length. Good quality and nice print, just too warm for my needs."
4.0,A little stiff but comfortable!
4.0,Love Custo. fun  to wear with t-shirt or tank
4.0,I like this dress. It fit very well. I will order another color once they have any available.
4.0,"Like the design and they're really warm/comfortable for around the house.  Good sole for walking through the garage/on the porch, occasionally.  Only issue is that they're not very breathable.  If that was better, I think they'd be about perfect."
4.0,Nice lightweight robe..nice length and fit. But there was hole in the pocket. I’m obsessed with pockets so yea that really bothered me. Didn’t have time for a return. Cute robe though for the price
4.0,like the cut away at the shoulder perfect fit
4.0,"I feel like its a tad small but I have also never worn a one pice made for sport swimming , I also feel like if o got the bigger size it wouldn't fit. I'm pretty happy with it over all"
4.0,"Love how it turned out, the shirt is soft and good quality.  Haven't washed it yet to see how the design holds up against wash and wear."
4.0,"Good quality and fits well, nothing really more to say,"
4.0,Build quality is surprisingly good — both the crystal and the body are solid. The leather band is too stiff; I replaced mine.
4.0,"Love this got lots of compliments. However, it is too light weight and the center moves around, so constantly adjusting."
4.0,"Looks really cool, nice and distressed as pictured. It's quite smaller than I thought, more suited for small wrists. For a large male, I'm baaarely able to<br /> comfortably clasp using the last hole. It makes a modest accessory, will work well for Ren Fair costume."
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous, so comfortable and you can dress it up or down, depending on the occasion. The only problem is that it wrinkles very easily if taking it on a trip."
4.0,Very pretty.Get lots of compliments
4.0,I bought the wine colour. The colour was as advertised.
4.0,Yes I did thank you
4.0,I love this belt.  It works well and looks great.
4.0,"Love these.  Fit well, cute and fashionable."
4.0,It looks just like a bracelet and you would have no idea that it is a watch unless you look closely. The tie ends were a little long when I got it  but that was easily solved with a little trim or they would have been sticking out in the picture from the bottom of my wrist. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of 5 was because the braid it is attached to goes under the sensor and if you want to test your heart rate you will have to move it and press it down onto your skin. Other than that it is great and I only use it as a watch anyhow!
4.0,"Love the dress wish the straps were adjustable. Can't wait until summer to wear it.  I am 5' 4&#34; 130 and I got a small, wish they had x-small but this one works."
4.0,"When I first opened one of the masks, it had an odd chemical smell. But I spread open the nose clip, and hung it on a hook in my house overnight, and the next day it didn't smell at all. So as long as you air them out beforehand, they seem pretty good."
4.0,my eight year old loved. not the best material but for the money and what it was she loved it.
4.0,"Love these pants. They are a bit stiff and the liner on the inside of the knees that makes them so rugged annoyed my son at first, but after several washes they’re his go-to. My son is also a tall and skinny, the drawstring waist and inseam are perfect."
4.0,I love wrist warmers in general  Those are a little tight on the wrists but I kept them
4.0,"Great fit, super soft, lightweight and comfortable."
4.0,"I have this one when I go out, wearing something seductive on date nights. Love it!"
4.0,"Product is great, just wish It had pockets"
4.0,"I'm giving it four stars because I liked the build quality. However, the size of mine (XL-Tall) was waaaaaaay too long in the body, much more so than other &#34;Tall&#34; sizes that I typically purchase. I returned this one and purchased a XL-Reg (unfortunately, was not available at Amazon at the time) and am very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"I bought these glasses to go over a large pair of backup eyeglasses that I wear at the swimming pool when I'm doing water aerobics.  They completely cover my retro-style (big, ugly) prescription glasses and protect them well.  Furthermore, they are quite comfortable for wearing for at least a couple of hours and they sit securely.  I am very impressed.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they didn't come with any kind of protective case, so I worry about transporting them in my swimming bag as I don't want them to get broken.  I've not been able to find a large enough case from another seller either, so it would have been doubly nice if one had been included that was sure to fit.  Still, these are wonderful and far better than the traditional kinds of clip-ons."
4.0,These masks fit my 4 year old and my small 6 year old. I have had a lot of trouble finding kids masks that actually fit little kids. The material feels nice and the stitching looks good. These are 2 ply which I understand is important for effectiveness. The elastic isn’t the most comfortable. They pull on my kids ears. My 6 year old says she prefers her other masks with the cloth ear loops. I’m hoping the elastic loosens over time and becomes better. I was happy to find these since my 6 year old needs masks for school.
4.0,Dress is cute and fits nicely.  I would order in different colors.
4.0,My wife loved the necklace but not the ear rings
4.0,"These are really nice toe socks, especially like the non-skid feature on the bottom.  Only criticism is that the toe area seems a little small, or tight..if that area can be enlarged, these socks would be perfect."
4.0,"Love the swimsuit and has a good amount of support. It probably fits a medium if you do not have curves. I am 5’6, 140 but am a curvier build so i am exchanging for a large. Bust support is good though, just a little snug and I’d like the bottoms to cover a little more of my backside. Super cute and quality seems nice."
4.0,"These are better than the photo, but a wee smaller than I thought.  I ordered three, so I can make a pair of earrings."
4.0,Excellent shirt for the price. A pain to iron.<br />Order at least on size up!!
4.0,"I love these but I wish the inserts were sewn in because they come out in the dryer :/ Not too strappy, and there's a lot of support!"
4.0,"I haven't worn outside yet, so I don't know about the waterproof factor.<br />I usually wear a medium in men's gloves.  I ordered medium and they're snug. If I order again I'll go up a size. I will edit post to let you all know about them being waterproof."
4.0,"It is beautiful! Good quality! Must send it back, because it is too small. Need the next size up."
4.0,not so comfortable but ok for a custom
4.0,"Fits just as you'd expect, and it hasn't fallen apart. Nice stitching and good feeling material."
4.0,"These socks are so cute! They are much too large now, but we will grow into them!"
4.0,"The dress fit well. Good material and stylish. Only give 4 star because after several wash, the connections between the blocks become not flat anymore. It seems that the stitches used to make this dress shrank after machine wash."
4.0,I got it 2 sizes up and it's still snug. Very cute but small.
4.0,Looks nice but not yet try in rain.
4.0,These earrings are great! They came super fast and are just adorable.<br /><br />Only problem - they didn't include backs. But i'll take it for the price!
4.0,A nice little coin.
4.0,"Looks just like the photo.  Fits slightly small, but generally a good buy, particularly for the price!  Fabric seems durable enough, although it is not heavy winter fabric.  Warm enough, but definitely more of a light jacket than a thick winter piece.  Only downside is no pockets!"
4.0,"I am impressed with this wallet. It is a nice quality and feels nice to the touch. I ordered it in black and like it in this color a lot. It has a snap closure with two snaps. Two snaps allow you to stuff it full and still be able to close it on the farther snap. There is a hole with a metal ring in the wallet that will allow you to hook strap to turn the wallet into a wristlet. However, mine didn't come with a strap. I think this might be a mistake because the product photo shows a strap. I deducted a star for my missing strap. Otherwise, this wallet would be worth five stars.<br /><br />When the wallet is open, the first side has six card slots and a windowed area for ID. The ID compartment has a hole in the center that allows you to easily slide out your license/ID. There is also two pockets for something such as cash or coupons. On the other side of this area is another two slots for cash or a checkbook and also four additional credit card slots.<br /><br />This area makes up the outside of a zippered compartment. The zipper is great quality and doesn't get stuck. Inside of this zippered area are two larger compartments for cash, checkbook, a phone, and more. My iPhone SE fits inside of it easily with plenty of room to spare. There is also a smaller zippered compartment inside of the compartment that allows you to store any loose change.<br /><br />I like this wallet because it stores everything securely. It is supposedly RFID-resistant but I don't have a way to test that. It is a nice wallet, though, and I'm happy to have it. It keeps all of my cards and money secured inside. Additionally, it just looks nice altogether.  It would make a great gift for someone because of the quality and appearance. It also comes in a gift box so it would be easy to wrap and present to them.<br /><br />I received this wallet for free in exchange for product testing and a review."
4.0,Very nice quality however they run a little on the smaller size.  I purchased the silk long pants by Del Rossa and the medium was perfect.
4.0,Good quality material and fits great
4.0,They where very cute but difficult to get into my ears because of the shape of the earrings.
4.0,kids loved em
4.0,"Nice shirt, just runs small."
4.0,"If you can sew and intend on using this long-term you may need to work on it some. I got it for an event where I was playing a fortune teller and used it for one day. By the end of the night it was fraying horribly. However, it's still pretty and I do a lot of sewing so I may sit down and play with it a while. Good price for that extra sparkle and splash of color I needed. It is small, makes a good head scarf or neck scarf. Around the shoulders might be a stretch...literally Lol."
4.0,"This is a product I always buy, but I needed it delivered. Voilà!"
4.0,"It's a little long in the arms, but looks cute when you roll the sleeves, because the dinosaur pattern shows.<br />Also seller very prompt with responses and helpful."
4.0,"I bought this dress for myself but it was too small. My daughter can wear it, though, and it looks very nice on her. It is a beautiful color. Will have to see how it washes but for the price, a very nice little dress."
4.0,Nice looking shoe and a good value for the price.  The only issue is the shoes make a slight crackling sound.  I can live with it.
4.0,It's a bit big and I have to keep pulling it down or else it starts creeping up over my eyes..... but it gets the point across at work!!
4.0,They need to  make  this in red and black.
4.0,"I picked up these GSGGIG Tactical Shorts for Men for my teen son, he is tall and slim. The 29"" waist hangs on him, I really could have used that belt shown in the product description, but alas, there was none! The fabric is stiff and feels very durable, it is a ripstop fabric in a poly cotton blend. In hopes of shrinking these, I machine washed them and threw them in the dryer. They did not shrink at all, which speaks to the quality of the fabric, but also means I will need to put these away for another season and hope he grows into them! He loves all the pockets and the color is cool, they appear to be very well made too, but even with the elastic in the waist, they are just too big for him!"
4.0,"I'm going to give these earrings a 4, cause they were the perfect size &weight but I was a lil disappointed the yellow gold was more of a rose gold. The first day I wore them, we went to the beach & the salt water didn't tarnish them nor did they tarnish!"
4.0,"This is almost a perfect Naruto keychain. My only problem with it was that the color of the eyes looked like it was smudged, so not the best looking in that area, but other than that I actually like the keychain a lot and it looks exactly like Naruto. Perfect for fans and it goes really well with my Gaara keychain that I also got with it"
4.0,"The jeans are nice. I just read in other reviews that the sizes aren't true to size, so I ordered a larger size. They are a little to big. Also they are not flattering at all. But they are in nice condition and look like the picture."
4.0,But it still looks great.  I have a short to medium torso.
4.0,"This item received d a 4 due to the quality, as it was thinner than I expected. I am a size Large and I am wearing a Xl."
4.0,Really nice durable chain. Looks like real gold.
4.0,Super cute and looked like the photo -  my only complaints are that there is no belt loop or anyway to hold these up and that the pant seam only has one single line of stitching and is not surged so my suggestion is if you buy these plan to reinforce the seam in the rear somehow less you want to be splitting out some point during the evening.
4.0,These are made of heavy canvas.  The design is cute and the shoes seem well made with a nice sturdy sole.  They are cut small though.  I've contacted the seller who responded very quickly and is supposed to be sending me a replacement in the larger size.  I'll update this when I get the larger pair.
4.0,"Beautiful necklace , high quality and who doesn’t love Disney !"
4.0,"I wish this top was just a couple of inches longer in the front. I have a really long torso, so I rely on tunic length to keep me adequately covered. Aside from that, I really like this shirt."
4.0,"I really liked this dress. The cut was flattering, it was lightweight, dressy enough without making me feel too stuffy or old. Had it been available in other colors, this might have been my first choice."
4.0,Thin and beautiful
4.0,"The hat overall seems to be good for keeping the sun off your neck.  Its made with a lightweight material that weighs next to nothing and feels cool to the touch, you can hardly feel you're wearing it.  It has an adjustment string to keep it on your head in the wind.  It says for men/women, but I would have to say that more so for women.  If you have a large head it will not fit,  its really snug on me and I'm not that big, on the small size for a man."
4.0,These eyeglass holders really do the trick! They stay very well in place and come in cute colors.  I definitely recommend these.
4.0,The material is nice and soft/silky and the color is perfect.
4.0,My wife says they are comfortable socks and they are awesome looking. Great for going to Cape Cod in.
4.0,"I like it, solid material."
4.0,"This is a very lovely bracelet. You can clearly see the inscription on the plate and the light rose color compliments the silver nicely. The clasp is easy to open and close and so far it has held up rather well. I have been wearing this everyday for a week now and find that it hasn't tarnished even though I wear it for hours everyday. I did think that this was going to be slightly too thick for my wrist, meaning in the way it looks, but I find that it still has a feminine look even though it is a thick chain.<br />Overall it is a nice piece and looks good on."
4.0,"The pants fit larger than expected. I had to have them taken in and hemmed. So, I definitely recommend sizing down."
4.0,Son buenas mascarillas.
4.0,For the price it’s an excellent watch.
4.0,"Seems like a fine product, but I guess I had misread it and thought it had a little padding. It is not padded at all. I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review."
4.0,Love it! Great color and material feels soft and durable.
4.0,Great headband but the Nike symbol is coming off already
4.0,"So cute, but was way too big in the chest. My size details are below. The bottoms would fit, they just sat a little bit weird on my body, so I couldn't perfect the look of the strings without them looking pulled together.<br /><br />If you have large breasts, I'm sure this would be great!<br />My sizing info: 5’8”, 150 lbs with hips, M in swimsuits, 6(M) in dresses, 8ish in Jeans and M top. 34C at VS"
4.0,This product us exactly as it states. Fits the watch perfectly and was easy to change out. Would be 5 stars but the band is hard to adjust once on. Must guess as to how loose/tight it is before you put on.
4.0,just love my new rings
4.0,"It;s as good as one would expect, at such a bargain price.  My only issue is it’s undetermined, which is the front, and which is the back."
4.0,"They are pretty good gloves, the only downside is that when you take them off they are easy to turn inside out."
4.0,"I used this for a Ms Frizzle costume and it was perfect! The print is very cute.  The size runs a little smaller than I'd like.  The fabric is not stretchy, and with the zipper under the arm, it was a little tough to get on, but overall I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,I couldn't reslly rate durability because I just got these but the seem sturdy. We will just have to see.
4.0,Beautiful and comfortable. The material is thin and a little see though. I wear white under garments with it.
4.0,These headbands are super cute! I'd totally recommend buying!
4.0,I like these boots a lot.  I often wear black pants to work and since I'm always freezing in the AC I'm looking to wear close toed shoes.  These fit great and were very comfortable.  I have to walk between our many buildings often during the day and I have worn these several times when I had to do that and had no issue.  I gave it 4 stars because I wish the heel was rounded a bit because it took a little getting used to have to put my foot down flat.  These looked professional with my work slacks but would also look great with a pair of jeans.  I'm hoping I can find these in another color because they were so comfortable.  I received these shoes at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Im short so it was kind of long
4.0,I liked it and was a well made product but ultimately sent it back because I determined these high waisted swim suits just don't flatter my short waisted body.  I really wanted to make it work and love it!
4.0,Nice shoes<br />Good price<br />I have narrow feet and they feel narrow. So caution for people with wide feet go up in size. The do have a tightening stap across top.<br />Lots of compliments from fellow spinners!
4.0,I read reviews and knew they ran a little big. I wanted the length to be to the ground so I ordered the her size anyway expecting I’d need to have it altered.I was correct a little big but perfect length. I had it altered and also had the sash attached. I took off 1 star because if it’s not attached it won’t stay in place and I didn’t care for little feather flower or cane with to clip on. I used a clip on rose instead. After alterations I was happy and flower girls looked absolutely beautiful.
4.0,The shirts were just fine but I was looking for a heavy-duty shirt. These shirts very thin material
4.0,"This item was purchased as part of a costume and isn’t as cheap as I thought it would be. It’s not real gold, obviously, but it’s heavy. Just wish it could be sized. Too big."
4.0,"I really love these glasses and went on a hunt for them when I saw them on a girlfriend of mine. I tried them on and they fit beautifully. Her pair was brand new so they hadn’t stretched quite yet. When these arrived, they had no noticeable marks or scratches but these babies have definitely been worn. The glasses were not clean (obvious smudges) and the packaging was not in order. They truly are beautiful and totally worth the money, but I want a new pair, not a used one. I’m contemplating on either returning them and try to find another brand new pair, or make do with these and possibly get them tightened a bit at the eyeglass shop nearby."
4.0,"This is a decently nice watch for the price I paid ($8.99 with free shipping). I wasn't expecting much when I purchased this product. I simply wanted a cute, inexpensive watch that would go with a lot of outfits and that's what I got! The band seems like it would crack and wear fairly easily. It does not like to bend. I have pretty small wrists and the watch is a little loose on me even on the smallest hole. Overall, it is a cute watch for $8.99. I do not think I would pay more than that for this watch."
4.0,Good so far no color change
4.0,It's a really nice necklace. The pendant is the perfect size. I would buy it again
4.0,This is a cute top and the fabric is nice. I like to have my tops about 32 inches long and this is probably 28 inches. If you are on the shorter side it will work great for you I got my usual size and it worked out OK other than too short
4.0,Like the product. It seems to be more effective on materials than others.
4.0,"It's better than I expected, I'm impressed..."
4.0,Love it so much but The chain turned  dark so quick in few days  And the stone chipped.
4.0,"This little item has come in handy dozens of times. Being on my phone keeps the glasses always available. If you require reading glasses, it is well worth the money.<br />The only somewhat negative I found was that the glasses tended to slide off my nose (hence the one star deduction). But this is not such a problem as to not recommend them."
4.0,"What a comfy shirt! I tried it on and didn't want to take it off! It goes perfect with leggings and can be dressed up for the office. I nearly returned it because I thought I had ordered a size too big - it hangs well over my thighs and could (almost) pass as a dress. However, the top part across the chest is a bit tight, so I worry that ordering a size down may ultimately be a bad idea. I personally feel the need to wear a belt around the waist with it just to give myself a little more shape. I will be ordering more in different colors to make more outfits. This is the perfect lounge-y shirt!"
4.0,"I am not crazy about the top waist band, it turns and gets twisted inside the material. But otherwise comfortable."
4.0,"Had dress hemmed..too...too long.  After  having dress altered, it is still too long..the person that altered it said that this type of material  is hard to hem..it crawls. Lovely  dress..just have to alter  it again.  Have not wore it yet."
4.0,Wonderful hat. Fits nicely as expected. Looks good. Looking forward to the nice weather with the new hat!
4.0,"Kind of a different feeling material, however it fits pretty well and will definitely work for my needs. The material at the top is a little thin so I will wear a cami with it."
4.0,I like this robe however the arms are too tight. It is not made like the other Miss Elaine robes I have purchased
4.0,it seems like a very nice jacket...
4.0,We had a coupon and bought this for roughly 6 dollars. It was definitely worth it. We would definitely buy again if it’s still that cheap. But a medium and maybe we should’ve gotten a large because I’m pretty sure it will shrink.
4.0,The look of this thing is great! I think it is better used as a nice display for Flash fans in their living room or office. It is VERY hard and difficult to put on. The edges are sharp and can cut you.The lightning bolts fall off easily so get some super glue.<br /><br />I am giving this 4 stars because it really looks good. I only put it on once per year but it looks good on my desk!
4.0,Fast shipment nice earrings. I would recommend this company. I never got to wear them for my 70's party. but I did see someone with some biggers.
4.0,"got 2 pair since i usually loses my glasses.  they are nice looking andfit perfectly.  got them mainly for golfing. I think I see the ball better than with regular sunglasses.  I have worn them in sun, rain and night  and see wall.  Theyre a great buy"
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this shirt. I was a little surprised at first because it is nice, but not flashy. Took another look and it looks nice without being distracting. Goes great with jeans or dresses up with slacks and a nice necklace or scarf. Very soft and comfortable no matter how you accessorize ( or don't) and doesn't cling to unintended curves like thinner fabrics tend to so it flatters imperfect figures"
4.0,Very cute for the price 👍
4.0,"Wonderful! Fits perfectly!<br />Cons:<br />- not moisture wicking material<br />- do not order black, it’s kinda faded black."
4.0,"Elastica, facil de abrir y cerrar.<br />Incómoda a la hora de colocar en el pantalón(proceso lento)"
4.0,Would have been fivr stars cept the shipping took forever nearly two months i have to say customer service was amazing amd refunded me half of the cost cause i missed a special day i was supposed to wear these for but Omg omg omg!!! I was so scared at first when they arrived that they wouldn't fit (I'm a super fluffy girl and ordered the 3xl) but when I tried them on they slid right on with ease!!! I normally have very bad self conscious issues and these made me feel sexy for the first time in my life!! They are super comfortable too ❤ I can't wait to order more from devil fashion
4.0,I went with reviews and I up sized by 2 and it was  way too big but I love it regardless just have to alter it but everything else is perfect
4.0,Was big enough to fit my 7 inch table and my keys. Came with a matching hand wrist and a gold chair strap.
4.0,Still felt like they were a little small even though I ordered size 9
4.0,They're a little delicate. Can easily detach if you don't make sure the small rings are fully closed before you wear.
4.0,It is a bit small but manageable.  What was a little off was it smelled like a sweaty person at the neck and mouth part.  It came in a sealed plastic bag so not sure how that happened.  Seemed to wash out ok.  For the price it’s just an annoyance.  Otherwise it’s soft and is pretty good.
4.0,"good looking and design, no faulty"
4.0,"It is a &#34;novelty hat&#34; so don't expect extremely high quality construction. It's more like something dancers would wear on stage with a costume. But my daughter loves it and wears it all the time! So for such a low price, it's a great deal. It's cute and flashy, just the thing to jazz up a summer outfit."
4.0,look good fit good
4.0,"As all curly girls know, dry winter air and unlined hats are no good for our hair. I love that this is lined with satin. I wish it were a little longer to cover my ears. But I have a lot of hair so that’s a factor."
4.0,Measured myself but it was still small so I gave it to my daughter. It's very pretty and you have several choices of color leggings to wear with it. I still might order another one for myself in a larger size. Very cute!
4.0,Very small apron. The ties can’t be wrapped around like you normally could with a cooking apron which was a bummer. Still cute though.
4.0,Looks really good and is s great price ! I'm really happy with it . My boyfriend loves it
4.0,"The grandson didn't seem too impressed but has worn it, so that's the review for what it is worth."
4.0,"I bought one 6xl and one 5xl and the difference was pretty minimal. I normally wear a 10/12, (5 ft. 3 inches, 150 lbs). but wanted these to be loose and comfy. Both had tabs to pull up the sides, similar to how the sleeves are designed. I actually cut my sleeves to make them less bulky and confining. I did notice a small amount of shrinkage the first time I washed and dried them. Overall they are quite soft and comfy and thicker than I was expecting. The first pic is the 6xl (more red/pink) and the second pic is the 5xl (more blue/grey)"
4.0,"I sent my first order of these back because they didn’t work with the battery pack. After receiving these, they again didn’t work. I got frustrated and walked away to message the seller without turning it off, about 30min later, they lit up and now work great! I don’t know why but give it a while at first. They are pretty neat once you get them to work.<br />They don’t attach the battery pack to the wings (for your comfort & convenience), they give you a phone holder for your arm...this is a pain and looks stupid so I’ll have to sew a pocket to fix it."
4.0,"They are very pretty... I just thought they would be darker purple like the picture, they're much lighter."
4.0,Material is soft. I love the shirt.
4.0,I hate the original silicone bands. They make the watch look bulky and masculine on my tiny wrist. This is SO MUCH cuter. Just do it. It’s like $6.
4.0,This pajama set is super super comfy.  Feels so great on your skin and very breathable.  Ideal for sleep but can also be worn as a cute set around the house or even out. I like the gray color of them. I stress the are soooo comfortable.<br /><br />The pj set is very well made and the set is just so cute. I like the v neck on it. The set is a bit on the bigger side but for me that just adds to the comfort.<br /><br />I reccomend these to anyone who wants to be comfy and cute while sleeping.
4.0,"Nice hat, warm, great value."
4.0,"works alright protects from sunburns, but hard to keep on less you bring back over top of back of head"
4.0,So cute for my granddaughter! The material could be a little better otherwise it's nice.
4.0,"These colorful lanyards have a length of 13.5”.  They do not stretch.  There is a locking “knob” to adjust the length.  You’ll notice that they have black plastic clips on the ends.  These are extremely stiff.  You have to press the mask straps into them.  If you’re using a mask with thin straps, then it’s not as big of a deal. . . but. . . if you’re using a mask with thick straps, then it’s going to take a bit of effort.  These lanyards are individually wrapped.<br /><br />These lanyards are one of thousands being offered by Chinese companies right now on Amazon.  At just over a buck each, the price is not that bad, but be sure to look around for the best price before purchasing."
4.0,"I have not used it yet, but it appears to be good quality."
4.0,"My daughter asked for a Hello Kitty umbrella for Christmas, this was a great price and design. There was some scuffing on the product when I received it but overall I am pleased."
4.0,Fit perfect. Really cute
4.0,Bought this item for my granddaughter and she loved it
4.0,"Super cute, light weight, Exactly like the picture"
4.0,Husband loves.  I didn’t like the white round button on top of cap rather it had been blue.  Husband didn’t seem to mind the white.  My husband said something inside cap was sharp and poking his forehead.  He inspected and discovered two pieces of the clear thread was not flush to inside rim.  He snipped the sharp thread and now no issues.  He is happy with the cap.  Loves the flex fit.
4.0,Necklace was exactly what I expected! Still loving it!
4.0,These work well.  The only change I would make would be to enable size adjustment.
4.0,Works amazing hasn’t broken like all of my other bands however the paint is fading on it already
4.0,"It like this shirt. The bottom edge is asymmetrical, which I like but wasn't expecting. The picture made it appear as though it came to a point in the center. The fabric is quite thin. Very comfortable"
4.0,"Fits fine, there is a little room in waist area. Order in normal size you would wear in skirts."
4.0,"Cute. It’s very comfortable material and stays in place. My only complaint is how awkward the pockets are... the dress is perfect length for me, at 5’4”, but doesn’t make sense that the pockets fall mid thigh?!"
4.0,Looks good but a little plain looking.
4.0,Worth the money to pay for it
4.0,Belt started to separate between layers.
4.0,I liked the quality of the shirt but it was a little too big for my child. Sizes run a little big
4.0,Cute earrings but to small.
4.0,"I spend a lot of time on computers.  My doctor told me the blue light put out by the screen could contribute to my insomnia.  These glasses seem to work well.  I had a pair break at the hinge but the glasses were replaced no problem.  It did take about 3 weeks to get the new set of glasses.  The glasses are comfortable, clear and I really think they are helping.  A good value for the money."
4.0,Looks just like the pictures and I received  package in a few days however it runs kind of small im about 5'7 and weight  142 i bought a M but the bottom  was too small the top fit fine and I'm a 32 DDD  but if you have any type of  booty I  would  get the large
4.0,"this is verry good one , you can bay it and you will not be disepointed , this one m"
4.0,"It is a pretty necklace but, I feel for the cost you pay then the chain should have been thicker and the charm should be denser. It should have cost 1/2 the price."
4.0,"It's an old fashioned snap back baseball cap.  material is a little rough, but comfortable overall.  haven't ""broken"" it in yet but once I do I'm sure it will be fine.  Nothing notable to see here."
4.0,"Nice looking, simple and a good price. Ticking sound is a bit loud, but it is a functional watch."
4.0,Excellent  fit.
4.0,"I wish the shoulder straps were a bit longer, they are just more like a handle. over all its a good bag.."
4.0,Great design. The leather case a bit scratched.
4.0,"Shipping took forever, but they come exactly as shown. A very convincing screw that has gotten a lot of comments from anyone who sees them."
4.0,Nice quality. Nice looking.
4.0,I like this shirt I just don’t like how it rises up in the front
4.0,"These are good, thick (but not hot) material. They are long on me and I'm 5'9"", but shrunk up to the perfect length after a few washes. True to size. Very comfy."
4.0,really long crotch area
4.0,"Made cheaply. (My little one pulled the bear off the bag right away, and the bears eye fell off.) Do love the size of the bag. Fits everything my little one needs. Also really cute."
4.0,"Lo e the dress, a little big in shoulders"
4.0,"I found this to be a gorgeous dress! However, when i received my dress the armpit area was ripped =( like the seam was ripped right out and a piece was hanging. I am disappointed, but I am returning and will be repurchasing as I have bought other dresses from Anni Coco and never had a issue in the past. I see this one as a fluke. Every once in a while there will be a bad one in the batch. Otherwise I truly love the dress. It is very pretty and very retro which is what I love! The materials seem to be a tad thin, but I view that as better for the summer so it won't be bulky and hot! Overall I would still recommend this dress to everyone. I also want to add, i would order a size up as china sizes seem to run a  tad small. But I honestly cannot fully account for size as mine was damaged...but i still feel it looked small compared to a US L.<br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
4.0,"Small so therefore it's tight on me but maybe perfect for a smaller or slimmer person..  I am 203 lb, It's very beautiful though and I still wear it on special occasions..."
4.0,"Love the dress and the material itself but I took the advice of others and ordered a size up...still had a lot of cleavage. I'm going to keep it but like others said, going to need to wear something beneath to hide the ladies."
4.0,After a couple of months the battery is still going strong. Really good feel on the wrist. The fabric that the strap is made out of gets a bit itchy after a while but nothing to extreme. People do compliment the watch but they also like the color its so bright and looks good on both male and females. Great buy or Great gift even.
4.0,"I'm a size 14, 5'7&#34;. The dress cut is flattering (maybe a little long), the material is thick with a nice stretch. I could not button it. I'm a 36H.<br />Kept it so I could wear it on date nights; not appropriate for work."
4.0,Very cute just what I wanted for me and my friend but the bar is very small and the engraving is small too I expected bigger though I love it just as well
4.0,It was unfortunate that this shoe was a little tight in the toe area but looked great regardless. I returned them out of fear that I would snap the material since the fit was so tight. I wish I could have kept these! Love the python looking material and the light cork wedge.
4.0,"This top is decent for working out or for casual wear. The fit is spot on and the fabric is stretchy and comfortable so there might be some flexibility with the sizing depending on your fit preference. The color looks nice and I like the mesh on the upper back. I deducted 1 star because during a workout the fabric did not feel breathable which was disappointing, but for the price it is fine."
4.0,The lenses were a perfect fit for my Gen 2 Echo Frames. After a week of use I haven't noticed any issues and they transition in sunlight just as I would expect them to.
4.0,Very Nice .. Works Great .. Good Size
4.0,"I’m 95lbs, just under 5ft, 32/26/33 measurements. I bought the black and the pink, and I did have to go to tailor to have the straps shortened by an inch or two. If you’re a little taller than me it should fit perfectly though."
4.0,These are just what we needed. My mom hated all other &#34;bibs&#34; made her hot and uncomfortable but she accepts these well and no more hot liquid is hitting her and her clothes are staying clean all day.  I'd give 5 stars but you do have to treat them very cautiously and affixing at the back is a trick we use a paper clip - but for the price it's not hard to overlook that - they do exactly what I need them to do and that's great.
4.0,"Great watch band and love the colors.  One word of caution, when being active if you bump the side of the band it may become detached.  As such, I’m only going to wear it in more laid back settings."
4.0,"Couldn't tell how much I liked this dress until I put it on. I wish they had more colors that I could order as well. Fit great, and didn't shift or ride up. Lays mid to upper thigh. I'm 5'4 and 138 lbs, I ordered a medium"
4.0,it was a gift nice
4.0,"Great watch<br />It is however shipped with no instructions for the operation of<br />the watch. Need this for Bezel info and setting of separate dials<br />Without it the functions are useless and I would have no choice<br />but to return the watch to Amazon<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />A C Wilmot<br />617-852-7723"
4.0,"I got this in the army green color and according to the size chart, I chose an extra large. However, after receiving it I definitely could’ve ordered a large or even a medium. The size chart I believe is way off. It is thin, lightweight material, not superb quality, but nothing different than what you would find at a trendy discount store. I love the lightweight, thin fabric of the shirt because in south Texas it is hot most of the year. I personally would buy this in different colors except sized down one or two sizes. For the price, I think it’s cute!"
4.0,"Fit is good.  Good buy for the price.  Had a chemical smell, so you might want to wash them once before you use them.  You wouldn't want to get chemical on your doo-dah."
4.0,Returned only because of the silver metal part...found another brand where the metal part is black and brown like the band. Loved the spring rod for easy removal or installation.
4.0,Haven't used yet but seems like what I wanted!
4.0,Cute. Simple. Best for maybe 6-9mos
4.0,Love the darling cute jewelry
4.0,Perfect for a few extra scarfs for wedding guests !  Comfortable cozy fabric too
4.0,"Seems to be quality construction and material, but too snug to actually wear.  Perhaps I'm confused about my size?"
4.0,My mother likes them a lot.... Super good price
4.0,Withstanding a 10 y/o at camp and still working!
4.0,"I ordered it to wear casually for a dinner. Its color was beautiful , flares were awesome and I liked the quality as well. the only problem I had to go through was the size. It runs a little smaller and therefore I had to return it. I hope they would have make it with standard sizes..."
4.0,Very cute. I've received many compliments. I am about 145 pounds and the medium was loose on me.
4.0,"Really cute, 3 year old grandson loves it! Great buy, great price."
4.0,This product I like cause it’s comfortable and I like the fact I can pull up on my face instead of a mask that fits around my ears
4.0,Love this retro suit and dots....it's navy and white.....not b&w.  Top runs small but pants are perfect.  Cups should be bigger but as long as the girls aren't big...you'll be fine!  It's a two piece after all.  Nice material.  I'm 60....178....5'6&#34;.  I looked good...not great but I didn't expect to but I had confidence and recently lost 90 lbs. And I bought it!
4.0,Bought this as a gift.  A lot bigger than what I thought. She used it as a key chain instead of a pendant.
4.0,The item is slipping/ sliding out of my ears. I can only wear it while on bed where the pillows support it. The size is good though and fits me well. It is warm and serving its purpose. It is foldable. Excellent service for the seller; well packed and fast delivery.
4.0,"Love the bright colors on this fleece sweatshirt.  Wish the white was not the large section as kids get into food and dirt and it ends up all over their clothes!  However, this sweatshirt is very warm and works well for a cold fall day.  I don’t let him take it to day care as I didn’t want it to get destroyed, but we do use this at the park or on hikes.<br />The arms are long enough for my lanky boy and the length of the sweatshirt also goes past his jeans on the waistband."
4.0,Beautiful earrings. They are a little on the heavy side though.
4.0,"Super cute holiday pajamas. The cotton is nice but it isn't super soft. I wish it was softer for pajamas. The design with the gnomes is adorable and perfect for Christmastime. The fit of the size medium is good. I'm 5'7"" and 150 lbs. The pants were perfect but I'm not a fan of super fitted tops. It fit, and even when I raised my hands up my stomach wasn't exposed, but I prefer a looser top."
4.0,"These sunglasses are great! Exactly what I was looking for. The blue tint is really cool; I noticed though that when you wear them, the shading of what you're looking at in front of you changes depending on what part of the lens you're looking through.  No biggie, just something I noticed.<br /><br />They arrived on time, nicely packaged. These sunglasses are very light as well compared to my other ones. The bamboo has a nice finish to it as well.<br /><br />Would recommend!"
4.0,Matte frames
4.0,"Bought it for my toddler girl. The fit is good.  The front is a little wide so it looks a little bulky, not the prettiest shoe but it works."
4.0,"I was so excited when I found these finger lights for such a great price. A pack of 4 is about $5 in most retail stores. I bought these lights as party favors the first time around and for a teacher's treasure box the second time around. The first time I received 40 loose lights, the second time I received 10 packs of 4. Some of the lights burn out quickly and the finger straps break easily (on some not all) but overall the kids love them and they are great value for money. Parents and teachers keep telling me how great they are and how much fun the kids have with them. My advice is to by extras which are totally worth it."
4.0,"Love this top, aside from the straps being much too wide to be comfortable in hot/warm weather.  Comfortable cotton fabric, which is so hard to find in this style.  I'd love to see this with thinner straps for warm weather, and would then buy in several colors!"
4.0,"Like a few other reviewers, the skirt portion was too long. However, it looked as described and my daughter was happy with it overall."
4.0,"Adorable, but runs a tiny bit small. I'm still keeping it, because for organic cotton, the price is unbeatable!"
4.0,It is exactly what it says it is.
4.0,This is a great dress for the price! I typically wear a small or medium depending on brand and style. I ordered a medium and it fits and is flattering but a little more loose than I would normally get. But I have gotten several compliments on it.
4.0,was for someone else.
4.0,"This is a nice looking jacket with a nice feeling. The pink color is a soft pink that is of perfect tone. It's warm and feels very comfortable.<br /><br />The cardigan is well packed in a vacuum sealed bag; it comes out wrinkle free and is impressive to the touch. As stated, it fits perfectly. I ordered a Small, and there is no issue in fit. I'm 5'4"" and 110 pounds, and I really couldn't ask for a better fit. There's enough extra room to wear with it additional layers underneath, but it also fits well with just a single layer. This piece can be dressed up or down and should serve as a versatile piece in one's wardrobe. Please see the pictures for examples of the fit and measurements. Wearing a black cotton shirt underneath, there was no fuzz transfer which is always desired on outerwear.<br /><br />At $51 at time of writing, it's a nice piece, but there are some early indicators of small cosmetic quality issues. Most notably, the button stitching shows visual signs of sub-par stitching (or lack of cutting small pieces of trailing threads). Another random thread was exposed as well on the sleeve. It lacks the quality of expensive name brand pieces, but at $51 it's a relatively fair price for a piece that looks great when worn.<br /><br />If the visible and obvious stitching issues around the buttons weren't present, it'd be a 5-star piece at a reasonable price. Fortunately, those are easily fixed, and this cardigan will see a lot of use in fall and winter. I'll report back if any issues arise after consistent use."
4.0,I prefer a looser fit and this is pretty form fitting.
4.0,It looks nicely done but not solid feel. The back is more hollow than I expected but still a good buy.
4.0,"For the money, this is a good buy! Plenty of room...zippered pockets....the only thing I was a little disappointed in was the trim on the ends. Looks like snake skin! Yuck! I also thought it would be trimmed with silver to match my jewelry...but nope! It is trimmed in gold."
4.0,Very comfortable and great support
4.0,Great swim skirt
4.0,"The shirt itself is great quality, but the fit is really off. I'm a heavy guy, 5'9&#34; at 240lbs and I was considering getting an XL, but bought the Large. I wish I would have bought a Medium because the sleeves on the Large are like an XXL. The torso on the shirt is still baggy too, so if you're looking at buying one of these shirts buy at lease one size smaller than you normally do."
4.0,"My wife has been getting into ear clips since she doesn't want to pierce her ears. This is her first &#34;dangling&#34; one, and she really likes it. It's cute and cheap and looks to be of decent quality."
4.0,"Ok so I just had bilateral oncoplasty Oct. 30, I was not provided a post op bra so I ordered these. The material is soft and not abrasive. I do have stitches underneath both breasts that is not bothered by the band. I was a previous 40D, so I ordered an XL just as a guess. Although the bra is comfortable, since I am still very tender and with the drainage tubes , I feel like the XXL would have been a better choice so as to be a little looser after surgery. All in all I would recommend this bra for post op! Also I am about 5’3, and my cup size is probably a 40C now. I would suggest a size up if you need this for time right after surgery."
4.0,"Really happy with purchase, gave 4 stars because bottom runs a little small"
4.0,"The color was beautiful; the piece was a little larger than what I usually wear, but so large that it looked like costume jewelry."
4.0,Looks great and is super soft inside. Note sure about the quality; how well it will hold up. Will update if any issues arise. The little leather pieces on the screens are very thin and come off in the wash. I had to re-stitch the top button on.
4.0,Looked very 70ish just like picture
4.0,The jacket fit very comfortable and keeps me warm when the weather is cold outside.
4.0,"Super soft and comfortable, they did stretch out a little bit after a few washings and wearing so maybe size down"
4.0,The blouse is just as I expected to be. It fits nicely and I love the color.
4.0,Better than I expected for the money. Light and comfortable. Nice finish.
4.0,"nice material, stretch ok, the top half fits good but the bottom half is made alittle to small and not enough length to cover your bottom properly if you're bigger below"
4.0,The bracelet is just a little to big for me
4.0,"I really like that it's not so big as I anticipated. Some of my piercings have closed a little so I had to leave it on my ear for a week for it to get use to. Is this an original one cause It didn't have any writing on the inside of the hoop earrings that I got. Even so, I really like the product and if my nephew would like it when he sees tomorrow, I might purchase it again"
4.0,"The clasp action was a little stiff, and the clasp itself is a little small.<br /><br />THOSE ARE THE ONLY BAD THINGS, AND THEY ARE EASILY IGNORED.<br /><br />Apart from those, the product is flawless and functioned perfectly.  The levels were great, the joinery on the metal parts was great, the finish was slick and shiny, and even though the clasps were small, I think they were a standard size, and they certainly didn't fall out of a French cuff during a whole wedding and reception.  What, you want more for $10?  BUY THE LINKS."
4.0,"I’ve been in need of a new wallet, and this one does the trick. It’s minimalist in design, but it’ll hold just about everything I need in a wallet. One gripe I have is that on first use, it’s stiff and won't close all the way, but I’ll give it time. A great new wallet."
4.0,These are great! But I’m only giving 4 stars because I have others like these and I like them more.
4.0,Little small for my eyes and head
4.0,Everyone loves them and want to know where I got them
4.0,These actually feel like more expensive sandals! Great!
4.0,This is a very nice looking cover up. It is nicely made. The only issue I had is that it is a bit heavy for the summer. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,"Review:My hand is 7.1 inches,the glove is a little wider then my palm,and the glove’s fingertip is just the right length. I bought these gloves mainly for cleaning up the house during this quarantine period,to cover my hands when I go to grocery store,gas station etc. I have a box in each car, and in the entryway of the house. They are easy to put on,and plenty durable for one-time use.This is an advantage when you’re trying to get them off without touching their outer surface after you have been in a public. They are perfect for those who want to keep their hands covered when going into public places.And I love the big quantity with 500pcs per box. Pretty good single use gloves. 500 for a good price ,definitely recommend."
4.0,These are ok for just wearing around the house.  They don't have much padding.  Reasonable price.
4.0,Todo está bien.
4.0,"The earrings are very cute, but there's not a lot of detail to them. I do like that the earring backs are snug. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,Nice. Good fabric. Would buy it again.
4.0,Loved the comfort. The top material is a bit thin. I have toes that tend to point upward and they went through the material like butter.
4.0,"Beautiful fascinator. Bamboo are a little long. Gets in the way when I got in the car. I cut then back and it is still beautiful. Exactly what I expected, color and style. Thanks"
4.0,The sunglasses have performed as advertised and fit nicely over my glasses.  The trick will be in their durability and right now I see no reason why they will not stand up.  Thanks
4.0,They are OK.  Very light weight.  The lens isn't very high quality but if you lose your glasses all the time like I do then they look good and aren't expensive.
4.0,. Nice optics! Look good.
4.0,Fit well I like it
4.0,"I went up two sizes, but maybe could have just gone up one size. However it still fits well. I love this suite."
4.0,"A little bit tight but everyone that sees them, asks where I got them because they are that amazing and cute!"
4.0,Perfect fit!  Super light and comfy.  I've gotten compliments on them.  The only drawback is that they do have a chemical smell that takes a couple washes to get rid of.
4.0,"Great top, really nice material it's just a little longer than I like but love the way it fits."
4.0,Some of the lever back were stiff and slightly discolored. Still a good value for the money.
4.0,slips a little and my ears get cold if I dont keep holding over my ears
4.0,I bought this for a friend of my granddaughter.
4.0,"I'm returning the dresses and reordering a larger size.  I love the fabric, colors and length.  Hope the larger size fits, as I will be very disappointed if I have to return these too."
4.0,A little flimsy but good for the money. Did what it was supposed to
4.0,Fits pretty good. I wear an XL and chest is a little tight when working out.
4.0,Super cute but had to return. Just slightly smaller than I would like
4.0,Very reasonably priced. I purchased this as a gift. Difficult to rate because I haven't seen the watch in person. Recepient seemed happy with the item.
4.0,"I was nervous to buy these without trying them, I have a wide face and big cheeks so I was worried about the fit. There's a bit of a gap between the bridge and my nose due to where they rest so they sometimes slide down my nose but it's really not a big deal. I had Costco put the lenses in, so for the price it was a great deal. I've gotten a lot of compliments on them so like I said, although the gap isn't ideal it's also not a deal breaker."
4.0,The chest of this dress is a little snug. I'd say if you're wide chested you may be uncomfortable. Other than that it fits nicely and can't wait to wear it to the event.
4.0,"THIS WAS BEFORE-PLEASE READ UPDATED REVIEW BELOW!! Whoa-this is straight up torture! OMG!!!! That was the worst few minutes of my life! No-really-I may have injured something.This thing is AWFUL!!!!! Med? Uh NO! More like XX SMALL! And I am not going to send it back, because I will only get a few bucks, so I am going to IDK...I could barely fit the thing on my mannequin!! Anyway...A WARNING FOR THOSE WHO BUY---IT IS SUPER SMALL!! LOL :P<br />**UPDATE** SELLER CONTACTED ME DIRECTLY AND REFUNDED FULL PURCHASE PRICE! ALSO SENT ME A DIFFERENT CORSET THAT I LIKE, THE NORMAL TORSO SIZE LARGE, SO I HAVE CHANGED MY REVIEW-OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE! REALLY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO HELP ME AND MAKE SURE I WAS SATISFIED! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!"
4.0,"Has a rustic look to it and made of solid wood so it has a good weight to it. Crossbow is absolutely usable and shoots the arrows a pretty good distance. I can't really provide more info on use as these were purchased for a cosplay and the convention requires the strings to be removed. Missing one star because a couple edges of the wood were rough and required a quick sanding. However, still very satisfied with purchase."
4.0,"Used the goggle for the first time today for lap swimming.  Very comfortable goggles, very clean view but definitely not anti-fog.  They were fogging up by the end of the second lap..."
4.0,A few loose threads and very thin but cute.
4.0,It was a gift and she said it fits nice.
4.0,"I was impressed with the fabric quality and I loved that the sleeves are somewhat longer than usual. It does run somewhat larger, but just the loose section. I'm large busted and so it fits well in the upper section but for a peplum, the mid section seemed like a lot of fabric. I kind of felt pregnant 🤦🏼‍♀️😂. But the print is cute and quality fabric. One last thing that wasn't my favorite is the way the criss cross in the back was made. The tie is very very long and it doesn't criss cross very pretty... it doesn't lay flat. It just looks scrunched together.<br />If you are smaller chested, size down for sure! If you are like me, it fits true to size, as long as you don't mind lots of SUPER loose fabric in your peplum tops!"
4.0,"Wish these came in winter white , or light tan , or cream color."
4.0,Very cute.  Runs big.  I would go a size down so it doesn’t look like a tent. Very good d al for the price.  I’m 5’5 and will have to wear heels for it not to drag.
4.0,Very cool material for hot summer nights
4.0,Liked the suit but I ordered it too big based on comments.
4.0,"Wanted these to replace a set that I basically wore out.  Any elastic bracelets are eventually going to break.  These are a very nice pearly white and look classically posh.  They are slightly smaller than I thought they'd be, but are well matched and the slight irregularities of the fresh water pearls are quite charming.  I would purchased again for myself, might upgrade slightly for a gift."
4.0,"It fix in all the right places, a little long but  gorgeous"
4.0,Close enough to the fit. The model/mannequin is a little bit misleading but as I said ...not far off. This fit me almost like a pair of cotton tights. I didn't want it as close-fitting
4.0,got it for my girl for a wedding so she didnt sink into the grass. both sizes didnt fit her shoes so i just put in a piece of rubber band to make it snug. a bunch of other girls had them and they fit their shoes just fine...
4.0,"The collars a bit low for my liking but, I like the shirt itself."
4.0,Probably gonna return too wide and straps too loose :( but very comfy
4.0,"Very nice and light, well ventilated"
4.0,Some cause itching
4.0,"Fits well, stretchy and looks nice despite the cheap material."
4.0,fits a little smaller than a regular 1X.  I could've went up a size.  Like the color and necklace.
4.0,"I had been eyeing this dress for forever! I first saw it on Pinterest and eventually found it - yet Nordstrom’s prices can be not so forgiving, and when the only people who seem to be wearing it are celebrities on the red carpet, I was slightly intimidated.  Yet, I decided to look into some alternative options..<br /><br />The photos that they have posted are of Instagram stars wearing the original, so I I had to go to the reviews to get a better idea.<br />I’m 5’3”, range from 130lbs. - 140 lbs.  I’m a 32D in cup size and have an hourglass figure.  I got a medium in the light blue and the dress fit perfectly!<br /><br />The reasons for the four star rating is that the dress was a little longer than I was wanting, the lace was cut at the top so it did fray a little bit (which wasn’t a huge deal, I personally just thought it looked odd) and I thought is was going to have pockets.. I was wearing it for my fiancé’s Naval Academy graduation, which was an all day event, so pockets would have been nice, but it wasn’t anything I couldn’t live without.  Because of this event, we have to walk a total of two miles in our get-ups, yet I stayed cool and comfortable all day (which is what I was wanting in this hot Maryland weather).<br /><br />I definitely recommend this dress! Buy it!! Hope this helps:)"
4.0,I really like this bra a lot.  It's very light but the problem for us plus size girls is that straps are very thin and don't support as much as I would like.
4.0,These are definitely see through. Need to wear something underneath or there will be no hiding anything. But they are fun and fit well.
4.0,"This is cute as can be on my wife, but a bit spartan in it's construction... obviously not intended to be worn over bare skin, but with proper care and under protection it serves its purpose.  It's scratchy, so at least wear a shirt or sweater under it, because that will also add to the insulation factor."
4.0,very cute team. a the color is a color in not use to wearing but love it !
4.0,Love the color. The tops fits very neat and comfortable. The skirt is beautiful with a flare and bounce. No worries about the tummy bulge.
4.0,looks good. Fits decent.  Shank alot in dryer. Tight fit after dryer. Suggest air dry.
4.0,"These are very pretty, but one of the clips is looser than it should be. They’re quite dressy, but look great with jeans too."
4.0,The product is good but it does not meet my expectations.
4.0,"I had high hopes for this dress given the nearly 3k reviews, yet now that I have it, I'm a little disappointed.  I tend to be wordy, so I'll make this concise to save you time:<br /><br />Pros<br />pockets (gotta love that!)<br />fitted<br />price (under $30)<br />flowy fabric (fabric is also a detriment - see below)<br /><br />Cons<br />hem uneven - sure sign of a second-rate garment<br />wrinkles<br />fabric thin - Too sheer for winter wear - which is a disappointment since you'd hope to wear it in winter with the long sleeves, and I wouldn't even consider ordering this in anything but a dark color b/c it would likely be see-through.<br /><br />Important to note, I just got it; I haven't worn or washed it, so I can't speak for how it will do in the laundry.  I'll keep (and wear) the one I have, but won't be buying a bunch of different colors like I'd hoped"
4.0,"Love the dress, however - I did not receive the one that I ordered. The background on the skirt portion in the picture is black. The one I received is not."
4.0,I like the necklace. Very pretty. It's just what I ordered. I just mite get the other colors. Thank you.
4.0,I wear a lot of black and white and these earrings are really cute with any outfit I wear! Nice customer service.
4.0,"This suit is super cute! I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered two sizes above my regular size. It fits great! It is a little short in the torso, but i bought it planning on cutting the bottom off and making the top a tankini top. So the shortness of the torso doesn't matter and the top half is super cute."
4.0,very thin materials.
4.0,LOVE THE DRESS. THE BOTTOM IS A SHEER MATERIAL WITH AN ATTACHED SLIP
4.0,Bought them for gf she loved em arrived in time and evrithing was as expected
4.0,"Nice looking, durable bag. Love all the compartments!"
4.0,They run big. Other than that no other issues. They seems to be good quality boots. Delivery was fast and easy to track my package
4.0,Me and my granddaughter
4.0,"Edited:<br /><br />For the price, this is a nice strap.  Good thickness and excellent feel. I paired it with a cream Weekender Chrono, and it really looks fantastic.<br /><br />It is a strap that looks to be two thin pieces of leather fused one on top another. It looks good and feels great, but it isn't one solid piece of leather.  This may be normal for this price point--and it doesn't really detract from the band quality.  Edges look to be finished with a coating--again it looks fine, but it's different from what I am used to.<br /><br />This is a thicker strap than the stock NATO straps that come with the Weekender series.  I had to pop of the spring bars to install it so I didn't scar the leather, so if you want a version for quick changeover, you should look for something thinner.  As the strap ages, I would bet it will slide in and out easier.  The thickness does lift the watch off the wrist a bit more, but the height increase is much less than I expected and is not an issue.<br /><br />Note that the silver buckles are slightly less polished than the case of the high polished version of the Weekender.  It's not noticeable at a glance, but if you are looking for it, you will see it.<br /><br />I've had the band on for about 6 hours, and the oils from my skin are already starting to give it that nice rich patina.  I'm sure in a few days it will set in quite nicely.<br /><br />A bit long for my wrists (6.5 inches) but I chose to trim it down by an inch or so.  Others may choose to tuck the excess in—I just don't like doing that."
4.0,It's a beautiful set. I got compliments from a few people while wearing it. It does make me look pregnant but I would recommend it. altho it comes a bit wrinkly but a little bit of ironing would do the trick.
4.0,Order a size and a half up. These run very small !
4.0,Looks good. Easy to take out the links to make it shorter.
4.0,Only thing that I did not like is the connector from the charm to the chain is not what you get and the tree charm looked alot diff. Than the pic. but for the price it's still very pretty and a good buy!
4.0,I like the style and the way it looks even if it did drown me i was able to see it seems in.
4.0,really thick.  bought 4 Joe USA hoodies which aren't as thick for when I workout with weights at gym. This one is great for cold weather.  was too thick for my workouts at the gym but great quality.
4.0,"&#34;One size fits all&#34; never fits all, no doi!! :) I'm in a wedding this summer and all the bridesmaids were told to purchase this, so I even though I was nervous about the one size thing I had to go ahead.  I'm an adult size 12 so I do really think that it should fit no prob but alas, it is tight.  Then I sat down and it popped open.  oops.  so I now am trying to lose a little weight for the wedding which really isn't a bad thing I suppose.  Very cute other than the fact that I am now forced to lose weight by my purchase of this item."
4.0,Bought this for my 8 yo for halloween. She loves it!. Its held up well after 3 wears. Havent washed it yet though.
4.0,"My son loves Chevy anything, he really likes this shirt."
4.0,"The white dress was completely see thru so I couldn't wear it for the event I bought it for, but otherwise very nice and flattering. I'm sad it didn't work out for me.  I might buy the dress in a dark color later on. I bought a medium and am 5'7'' and 155lbs."
4.0,"If you have a lot of hair, this looks great! Really warm and comfy"
4.0,cute and as expected
4.0,I love the look and really wanted this item but the battery is dying and the clasp is too tight and I cannot open it to put the watch on.  but as for everything else again I can say I love the watch
4.0,This is a super cute dress! I have wider hips so i'm not that big of a fan of just how &#34;flare&#34; this dress is but it looks good on me regardless.
4.0,"Loved  the storage. It really is a great bag. Sturdy, lots of pockets. However the lining in mine separated at the dream at the top. I have three, and the two I use the most have ripped. They're still usable, but I have to 'baby' them. I also never used them for significant travel so it wasn't overuse that caused the problem."
4.0,present for granddaughter
4.0,"This is big on me, however I expected that. I am a girl and it was designed for men. Its is surprising how shocked people are when they read the bottom line. Always ends in laughing. :-)"
4.0,Pretty decent quality - I thought it would be an iron on but had to sew it on
4.0,"This dress is amazing, espically for the price! My only complaint is that it’s a bit big at the top of the back, which leads the top front to be very loose. If you’re bigger chested you might not have this problem though. I’m just going to get that little part altered. I’m 5’6”, 145lbs and have a “fuller” figure. I got a medium and it’s perfect in every area except the top."
4.0,"It was a little bigger than we expected but that was a good thing for us. Our daughter wore it and everyone who saw her thought it was adorable. Everyone asked where we found it. So fun! Only problem is that it's very warm, but if it's cold outside this will be a plus for you :)"
4.0,Runs a size small. I ordered another the next size up and it fit the little girl.
4.0,I had been wanting an open back tank for a while. It’s hot in GA.  This too fit as expected. It is soft and the back is open. It just got on my nerves when I bent down. I guess that is not the fault of the product itself though.
4.0,Cute little scarf..the material is not shiny either which is a plus!
4.0,"Great for the gym locker room/shower! Little roomier than I expected, but still works well. Nice and light so doesn't weigh down your gym bag."
4.0,Nice very soft and comfortable
4.0,Nice purse for the price.  May have to shop for another style and color.
4.0,"look at the pic , its a cool hat. good product."
4.0,They are fine. Good for the intended purpose.
4.0,"The length and fit was as shown in the picture and fit well.  It's comfortable, although *very* long.  The color was off- the green in the picture is more of an olive, but the green I received was lighter and brighter.  I preferred the olive."
4.0,"I gave these to my husband who runs pretty much every day.  He was getting sore calves and I thought these might help to eleviate some of the discomfort.  He said they were tight to put on and not very soft, but totally made his run and post run more enjoyable.  They seem pretty durable but he has only wore them several times.  I think for the price they were a very good buy.  Would likely buy another pair.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"My son, who has Asperger's Syndrome, loves typewriters and things associated with antiquated trains.  This typewriter pocketwatch works and he loves it!"
4.0,Form fitting dress. Great choice for summer outings.
4.0,This bralette is so cute! It was a bit small (C cup) but I mostly needed it for the design to peek out the top of another tank so it worked perfectly for what I needed.  It doesn't provide a whole lot of support so maybe don't expect to be running while wearing this bra.
4.0,I thought it was 2 but its only one. Got order a 2nd one
4.0,These came very quickly. They are very pretty and they match the picture perfectly. I have sensitive ears and these do not bother me at all.
4.0,The only thing it is missing is more support on the bottom of the top of the suit. I love it otherwise!
4.0,"Good watch for the money. Easy to set time, date."
4.0,"It fit well, but it is thin, so it needed a slip"
4.0,I love this attractive necklace and cross but the chain is little small in length.
4.0,I really like this bag. It’s the perfect size and great for the day at an amusement park. The only disappointment was that it was supposed to be somewhat waterproof and the back is not.
4.0,I am 5'6&#34; and the legs are a little too long. They are very comfortable and seem to be great quality. I have worn them a dozen or so times and had no issues.
4.0,Carries my ball just fine but not good for big shoes..
4.0,"Otherwise, it is a nice slipper/mocassin and is truly good indoor/outdoor.  Overall nice, just a little tight, but I think it will stretch to fit."
4.0,It is a little loose under the arms but everywhere else fit as expected.
4.0,It doesn't seem like it's going to last long. The feel is good for the pricing.
4.0,I love the quality of Zutano clothing but hate the high prices. Of course I am just grandma so a splurge now and then is okay but not a steady purchase. Does not shrink when washing and drying and adorable on.<br /> So the one star off is because of the high price for a growing baby that will get limited use out of item.
4.0,The middle of the top is closed! I did not like that!
4.0,"These earrings are very lightweight, which is good. The style does not look cheap, looks trendy and like they came from a pricey store. They may be a little bit delicate but this is my first time wearing them so we’ll see."
4.0,Not good for trail riding trees and thorns rip it right apart.  As for open track riding it's awesome.  Light weight and breathes easy.
4.0,"Cute - but the frames are even larger than I expected. I got them for a 1950s costume, and I would have worn them for that (and only that), but I went with another pare that works for the costume, and I will likely wear again."
4.0,These pants fit good. They were very long though. I think they had a petite length but I got the regular.
4.0,"It's ok, but it was not what I was looking for, so I decided to return it."
4.0,Enjoy it great essential oil accessory
4.0,Nice flow and great colors.
4.0,"i'm a med shirt most times, ordered exlg because i'm a 32ddd. and also have long body. and have very muscular arms and its just right."
4.0,"I'm medioum size ..Good thing i got the large,  it was nice i like the material."
4.0,It’s for my deployment bag for volunteer work on disaster relief for my laundry
4.0,This item is what you make it…<br /><br />It’s cute. Your style has to connect with it.
4.0,The material feels cheap and there aren’t enough loops to keep the pants up right with the belt when sitting. They’ve lasted me a couple of months now with no sign of wear.<br />But I love these pants they are really cute and would buy more colors
4.0,This charm bracelet is super cute I love it
4.0,Greet
4.0,"Beautiful colors just like the photo. Fabric is  smooth, lightweight and cool to the touch. It is on the thin side. If you're like me who dosen't have a perfect body and pushed out a few babies you'll want a undergarment to smooth everything out because you will be able to see every dimple and roll through this dress. LoL"
4.0,"Nice, elegant but sheer"
4.0,Great quality... love the length and material
4.0,Very beautiful design. Just get a size larger than your usual.
4.0,Not the most comfortable material but it's not bad by any means
4.0,"This sweater is so soft and comfortable. It seems to run a bit big but as its a cardigan I don't mind. It did come with a very strong perfume smell that even after washing still seems to linger, if you are sensitive to smells I would be cautious."
4.0,"Great quality! VerY thick and heavy, As far as the fit, I ordered according to the size chart, affording to the chart it would barely fit me because I am plus size, but when I received it, it had a little more room, which I'm thankful for. I'm not too happy with how it looks on me, but that's not the makers fault. Just doesn't work with my body shape. It ended up having way too much lace for me and I felt like an old lady so I returned it."
4.0,"These were a little larger than I thought they would be they will work until I can find something a bit more durable. However, I did received them promptly in excellent condition."
4.0,I love this product and it really can clean my sunglasses!!
4.0,I love this shirt! My only issue is the wrist holes they are a little tight but that is not a deal breaker for me. so even with the tight wrist holes this is a very nice shirt. it is very pretty and comfortable on and long enought to cover my butt becuase lets face it no one makes jeans that cover your whole butt nowadays and no one makes shirts that compensate for the pants not covering your butt but (ha ha) this shirt does! it covers my whole butt and i love that! I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest/unbiased review.
4.0,Comfortable but does run small.
4.0,"I just purchased these boots, I loved them.  They are pretty easy to get off and on and they are pretty sexy looking.<br /><br />However the only think I dont like about them is once you have them on and laced up, they bunch up on the top of the foot when you stand on them.  I am not sure if maybe they just dont fit right and they are to big for my or what.  Other wise they are pretty hot :)"
4.0,Loved this for my one year old. Head band was way too small and she couldn’t wear it. She looked so adorable though!
4.0,"Works well, but the grip wears off quickly. I've used it about 10 times and it's worn off 80%of the fingers."
4.0,"I like to change my Fitbit bands all the time. I like a variety but the rubber replacements but they aren't very dressy. I think this offers a decent alternative. At first I was concerned that it was so wide but it actually looks good on and looks more like a watch band. I bought it in black so it would be the same color as the fitbit. The ONLY issue I had was the size, I took out all the links (it comes with extras) and it is still slightly loose on my wrist. Not enough to fall off but moves around quite a bit. I am really happy with the band though."
4.0,"The fabric in these Awesome 360 Men’s Beach Board Shorts is attractive and weighted well for water acceptance, draping and clinging as is typical when wet. Mesh lining is fitted appropriately and the two front outside pockets are a bonus. As for garment construction, when washed in cold water, color was stable and seams and hems were secure with no fraying. The one factor that was less satisfying is that the sizes seem to run slightly large—maybe a half size. If you’re on the cusp of a size, it’s enough to make a difference. Though not available with my order, I’ve included a photo of the size chart for your convenience. Having this information and considering the quality, I have no problem recommending this item for purchase."
4.0,"The dress is very pretty, however, I may have to return it because I was hoping I would be able to wear it to work and the top part of the dress, the black part, is pretty sure."
4.0,"The light grey color provides a smooth texture that is not itchy or scratchy and is an especially attractive color. The fabric is light-weight, quite thin and is see-through. The fabric on the inside of the two loungewear pieces is the same as it is on the outside and it is delightfully soft and comfortable. The set is composed of a blend of 95 percent Rayon and 5 percent Spandex and both pieces are highly stretchy. The size large is somewhat smaller than expected so do order up particularly if you prefer your loungewear to be roomy. As care directions instruct not to tumble dry, shrinkage of the garments is not anticipated. The set does wrinkle easily so light steaming may be advisable.<br /><br />The top features a wide V-neck with button detailing all around in the front of the V. Only the lower three buttons are functional. There is no collar. The sleeves are short with no additional detail. The length of the top almost reaches the end of the shorts and allows for a cute front tuck. The edge of the top is finished and straight with the front and back being the same length. The top features no pockets.  The top looks attractive worn with jeans or shorts as well as when worn as a pajama.<br /><br />The shorts feature a functional drawstring and elastic waist. There are no pockets. The outer side of each thigh is elevated by the cute detail of a triangular white lace insert at the lower third of the legs of the shorts and is visible even when the PJ top is untucked. The pajama bottoms are short.<br /><br />This simple unadorned loungewear offers softness and comfort that is likely to be highly desirable sleepwear in the warmer months."
4.0,Good quality hat but the printed part is small and hubby is afraid to wash it too much because he feels the letters will fade and become unreadable.
4.0,"I've enjoyed this product. Worked as stated, with the sweat level, and the fit."
4.0,this is super cute but runs small. Literally all of my fat pops out the whole on the side
4.0,"It’s general quality BUT there is a very noticeable threading flaw where it looks like it may have been damaged and an attempt to repair was made. I know that’s not what happened, it’s a machine flaw in the stitching but it’s a noticeable flaw nonetheless"
4.0,Neon green. Arrived earlier than expected. Decent quality. I weigh 140 so I bought a large
4.0,This beautiful elastic Tibetan bracelet arrived on time and in fine condition. They really do help me with my meditation.
4.0,"Out of three dresses I purchased this was #3 in order of preference. It was a pretty dress and pretty color, and my friend helping me decide really liked it. I found it not as flattering on the profile view as the other dresses so ultimately returned it."
4.0,Ordered for my 11 year old and they were a little tight/small.
4.0,"Solid piece for the price, definitely a fun watch to own."
4.0,"This is a very cute and flattering dress!<br />Not sure how it will hold up after a couple washes, but for the money it is a cute summer casual dress"
4.0,Cute - looked as expected. It was large on my toddler.
4.0,Fit was as expected. They appear to be good closed-toe sandals. Got them for my daughter so she could wear them to school as the weather starts to warm up.
4.0,good cap but a little bit rough
4.0,Comfortable with a nice fit. Not overly tight around the ankle.
4.0,The crystal isnt as blue as shown in the picture but its still a nice ring
4.0,"5'4, 139lbs  small fit perfect ( loose fit) BUT shirt is NOT off the shoulder style.  The neck is slightly big and looks funny but not big enough to wear over the shoulder / I even tried stretching it and I wasn't able to !  Very disappointed as I wanted to LOVE this shirt. Will be sending back ☹️"
4.0,This came in a little on the small side to me. The 4x fits  more like a big 3x but when i say this jacket keeps you warm we have worn this during 2 snows season with a tshirt and and you come in sweating. Has like the sherpa inside the jacket.  The arms dont so they are not as warm but this is great for really cold temps
4.0,a great looking dress
4.0,Love it but the silver buckle
4.0,I like it.  I wear a adult size 2 and am 110-120.  The small fit perfect with extra room.  There is no stretch though.  Does not bother me.  Color is perfect black.  Light and keeps you dry.  I like it.  They were exactly what I hoped.  !!!!
4.0,"Little tighter in waist than expected, but otherwise good product and shipping was great!"
4.0,"nice size, solid, and well made.  the cover is a bit hard to open, however.  the compass is fully functional."
4.0,"Enviaron relojes equivocados, ""to my Mom""...<br />Yo ordené...""to my son""..."
4.0,"I love the dress! The material is soft and it's is super comfy. It's very long, which is what I wanted but even with heels I had to pull it up a bit. There was a run (thread pull) in the front which disappointed me but otherwise I love it. I've worn it several times and received compliments each time."
4.0,"Good quality, beautiful lace cover up. Very BoHo"
4.0,"I think they are beautiful. I'm only giving 4 stars because they are a little too big for my feet so I tied a not in each end to shorten the string, other than that they are well worth the money. I get a compliment on them every time I wear them."
4.0,I bought this chain to go with my origami owl locket. It is a good thickness to hold the locket and has a ring to put extra things on with claw hooks. Wish it was real silver but for the price it will work just fine.
4.0,This is a great pack.. Sturdy and fun all at the same time..
4.0,Perfect size -could have one more compartment on the outside for keys
4.0,They were just what I thought they would be. The girls I gifted them to love them.
4.0,"Is as advertised, i  like it."
4.0,"Fits small.  I wear a medium and bought xl based on reviews.  It's not flowy like the picture, but still really cute.  I like it."
4.0,I like them but was disappointed with the colors I got 4 black one royal blue and a brown
4.0,"I liked this bag so much, the colors and everything its ok. Good quality also"
4.0,"It is a beautiful color. the size is just a little small. I wish it was about 10 inches wide. I still use it and I plan to get a smaller billfold, I think that will help.so far it is a nice purse.( I also cut the strap shorter)"
4.0,Its difficult going by size charts because women all have different measurements..according to charts. I ordered a medium and it was big in the waist..other areas were OK. I didn't like the black &#34;lace&#34;...its actually a black croched piece..NOT lace..cute dress but not what I was expecting
4.0,"I have not used it as it is a Christmas gift, but I did look it over.  The colors are a nice light blue and a green.  The material is a heavy material.  The straps are wide. It has two outside pockets, both with zippers.  One pocket is on the outside and one zipper pocket reaches to the inside.  There is also a pocket on the inside.  You can pull it shut just a little to access your books, etc. easily or you can pull it closed tighter"
4.0,Cute dress. Not as long as expected. I bought a size up. I wear a medium buy bought a large.
4.0,Very nicely done but the jacket is much bigger to than expected.
4.0,little tight. But nicely made
4.0,"It finally came in the mail! I like it. Its definitely made for tiny women. I'm a 34 B cup and was spilling out of it. Can you say side boob... I can't even post a picture. I wore it for coachella tho, so it worked for that. It's actually sewed up too high in the front and it's sort of a weird shape, so I cut the middle and took the pads out to make it fit better. I couldn't even wear it at all before I cut it because it only covered half my boobs.<br /><br />But definitely worth it for the price."
4.0,My grandson like them
4.0,Great quality. Very pleased with dress.
4.0,"I usually wear a small dress and ordered a medium, fits pretty well. Not fantastic quality, but for the price I definitely can't complain."
4.0,"Roomy bag for its size, durable, a good value. The strap is basically a ribbon though, so even though it is adjustable, the buckle slides right back down."
4.0,"Theyre comfortable and durable, but not as well cut as they could be. There no change in the cuffed legs diameter and they barely fit to button over the tops of my calves. Other than that, they're great."
4.0,Father in law loved it - I'm not sure Brando wore this in the original film though.
4.0,Not as dark as picture
4.0,"Warm, but a little itchy"
4.0,"I am still confused by the image showing three sets of legs in leggings,  but the amount posted is for 2 pairs. They are very stretchy so they can sag and you have to hike them up, but I have never had leggings or pants or tights that don't require a good hiking up."
4.0,Great pants for laying around in. Not as breathable as I thought they would be though.
4.0,I like how the amazon version fit on me than the ROMWE/ Shein version. I was disappointed when I bought it on ROMWE. But so far no complaints
4.0,"I’m Not A Big Person,I Ordered  XL  To Small Not  good Quality If Material"
4.0,"They fit small, so just like everyone else recommends buy a size up. I bought mine (XL) for my son who is 13 years, 5'7 and weighs 165 lbs and uses it for his goalkeeper training. He is very happy about the product and next time will buy a size larger as he is growing fast :D"
4.0,"Much better than the fabric strap which eventually faded and smelled of dried perspiration. This resin made strap will be easy to clean. The only problem with this strap is, it takes patience to install."
4.0,I love the fabric soft and stretchy
4.0,Great feel great fit
4.0,"Very thin, but nice for the gym"
4.0,Being bustier the bikini top was too small but the bottoms and the tank top for perfect! I ended up finding a bikini top that matches so now I just wear the tank and bottoms. Super cute and comfy for days at the lake.
4.0,"Love the robe. Bought it in &#34;coral.&#34; It arrived as &#34;hot pink.&#34; I'll live with the color as the robe is fine. And, unlike many other fleece robes, it does not shed."
4.0,"Item was purchased for a child,, fit is good, durability is good, style and color is exactly what child wanted."
4.0,Very Nice Pendant!!
4.0,Son is very happy with wrist band - wears them constantly including in the shower which is causing the embellishments to come off slightly after just a few weeks.
4.0,"A good product. Four stars because the selected size was slightly smaller than expected. Once adjusted over the ear, they do their job."
4.0,"TierraCast has the shape, and the attitude, of Swallows down!  This is an adorable Swallow Charm with enough detail to add interest.  They are Antique Silver Plated Lead-Free &#34;Swallow&#34; Charms that are made by TierraCast in the USA.  I recommend them."
4.0,"I was so sad to return this... It was really beautiful, nice material, and fit well everywhere except the bust. Because I didn't fill it out enough, the neckline/collar didn't lay flat and kind of flopped open. Fashion tape would have fixed, but I just couldn't see myself doing that every time I wore it. The buttons were also not super secure, but nothing that couldn't have been easily fixed. I ordered a small, am ~5'5"", 138 lbs, 36B, and typically wear a size 4/6 (trending more toward a 6)."
4.0,"Don't expect these to last forever, but they are excellent as party favors. I mean, why else would you buy a pack of aviator glasses?"
4.0,Fue un regalo para mi esposa y le gustó mucho cómo le talla
4.0,"So fun. Only complaint is there was one spot with a small blob of gold on one of the earrings, where you couldn't see the veins of the leaf."
4.0,"Good quality, quick drying material and construction. I plan to wear these for kayaking. Size chart is a little funky. I normally wear a size small that I returned for a better and easy fitting, medium to row in."
4.0,"It's cute, have not worn it yet. Changed the chain out!"
4.0,I thought it would be right below the knee. It came mid calf. I want it for work. It’s still a great dress. 4 stars!
4.0,"I'd of given it 5 stars if it were true to the color it advertised to me. The blue is easter egg blue. The bag itself is good, very roomy, alot of pockets and zippers. The center of the bag inside, has a zipper in the middle, going the length of the bag. It is actually built into the lining. As if there are two sides, inside."
4.0,"Perfect cover-up, sheer and light weight. I purchased a pair of pants of similar material and wore the cover as a duster for a pool arty."
4.0,"I hung Captain Spaulding on the front of my house for Halloween, he was a big hit. The only drawback, is the audio is limited to only one phrase. He did ok outside, but if it rains, be ready to change the batteries. The lights on his eyes are red and his jaw moves when the audio plays, plus its noise activated, so it goes off when any noise such as clapping or a car door closing happens."
4.0,they got their S1-S2-S3-S4  MIXED UP.  WORKS GREAT NOW.
4.0,I did not get the same color green t shirt. It was more of a heathered lime green.  The design is super thick and the pink smeared and stained the white.
4.0,"I do love the style, but the shirt has silver lines on it that i couldn’t see in the pictures. Obviously buying clothes online like this is not guaranteed to be the greatest quality and the lack of photos was risky but it is beautiful on. Not only that but i found it later on romwe for a cheaper price $6.95 exact same shirt 🙊"
4.0,I used this product for my friends and I. They were great bracelets and tightened around my wrist well.
4.0,Very thin but I like style and fit
4.0,"Much smaller then expected. But, great build and quality material."
4.0,"This article is the appropriate dimensions for a proper lengthened scarf, and the green and silver stripes are a perfect portrayal of my Slytherin pride.<br /><br />However, upon opening my parcel and binding it about my face, the scarf inexplicably smelled of a wet goat; speaking from experience as a former herdsman myself. Nevertheless, t'was nothing that a few puffs of cologne couldn't fix."
4.0,A Little small! 🎩
4.0,Good buy. Good price. Fit as expected.
4.0,cute top vibrant color fits as expected
4.0,Bought this for my sister to x-mas. She absolutely love it.
4.0,Fits great. Comfy. Only slightly see through so no neon underwear :p<br />Got a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,"Ships from India so takes awhile, but very pretty and seems like good quality. The sapphire stones are a little lighter color than true sapphire, but I know some people prefer that so... didn't fit the ring I bought it for but that's my fault not theirs, now looking for a smaller stoned ring for the center!"
4.0,So comfy & a lot of compliments. It's bit tite when you put on & take off
4.0,"I really like this dress. It fit a little large for my petite frame and was longer than I needed it to be. The color was pretty and the embellishment was beautiful. I liked the modesty for the bust (34DD) and had hoped to wear it to a wedding, but found another dress I liked better."
4.0,I bought a large for her and its ok. She have a few months wear out of it.<br />Material is a bit thin but its ok
4.0,Nice warm gloves if you're not in the snow.
4.0,"I love the boots! I ordered a 9 because I normally wear an 8 1/2. They fit a bit snug but I'm dedicated to breaking them in, hopefully they will lossen up soon."
4.0,Purchased this swimsuit for my daughter's 2 year old pictures and it was a hit. The fit was just as it should have been (high wasted). The quality was ok but that was expected considering the cost.
4.0,It was what I wanted. Thanks
4.0,"It is not shaped for riding. Strictly a around town on a cool evening. Light lined jacket at best. It’s black, I thought it was dark blue. It looks real nice, and clean."
4.0,I like the color combinations and the beadwork. It looked like a lot of work. However the ends were a little scratchy. So it makes for a nice display piece.
4.0,this is perfect for paddle boarding I do.
4.0,"Nice hat, perfect fit.  Packaging was bad as hat mailed in an envelope so the hat was a bit crushed in the front, but was able to correct it."
4.0,"Love the print and colors. It fit a little tight around my thighs, but fit great everywhere else. Got a lot of compliments. Won't ever wear it again until I lose more weight."
4.0,"I'm a slender guy, 5'6 athletic slender, wear size 31/32W 30L. These were skinny fit. I wear 32W in skinny styles. These fit fine, however, they're harder to move in due to being tight and having no stretch to it. If you're looking for something fashionable and less functional, this is it. The material is sturdy and pretty good denim wash. If you need something to work in, look somewhere else or buy a size or two larger. They're pretty tight around the calf area. I had to return due to the tight fit, I got the 32W and it seems to be 32 or 33L by default for that size."
4.0,"Very pretty with nice detail.  Given the style and size, a little cumbersome to get on and latched so best for someone not planning on changing them frequently. Was expecting them to be not so tiny but keeping them anyway.  Excellent seller communication with care tips and discount code for additional purchase."
4.0,"These were beautiful and looked as expected from the pictures. The box they came in made the jewelry presentation look very cheap (plain cardboard, with inked ribbon that said &#34;fashion jewelry&#34; and a bow).  The box made the jewelry look very chintzy and cheap even though the jewelry itself didn't look cheap.  I switched out the box so that it looked nicer because I was giving this as a gift.  The person I gave them too thought they were beautiful.  Given this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the box."
4.0,Great size and good looking bag. Thank You for prompt dependable service!
4.0,"Very good quality. Thicker than I thought. The only negative is where the ruffle is, is uncomfortable on my skin so I would need a cami or something for it to not be irritating to my skin."
4.0,The graphic print is good quality and hasn't come off at all after numberous washes but I do wash inside out and hang to dry so it won't shrink
4.0,This is a beautiful dress and a great value for the money. If you are full figured and busty I suggest you go up in size! Love the feel of the material and the design.
4.0,Much more durable than expected. Decent cove and easy to set up and take down
4.0,I'm not quite sure why my purchase came with a heart shaped ring instead of the circular ring for keys.  The heart shaped key holder made it almost impossible to get multiple keys on it especially if they are colored coded with a cap.  I had to replace the ridiculous heart shaped ring (I threw it out) with a sturdy circular ring so my keys could easily move around the ring.  I would have given 5 stars but because of the lousy heart shaped ring I had to downgrade my rating to 4 stars.
4.0,nice shirt but much much too large (ordered medium)
4.0,Only 4 stars becuse you cant take the chain off without cutting it. So I can fit my larger chain.<br />The one it comes with is really cool with Magnetic Hasp. I hate to cut it but I'll break it anyways if I wear it. 🤷‍♀️ Love the Charm though!
4.0,"Nice coat, it's pretty long,  hitting below the knees.  I'm 5'6, 160lbs with an athletic build. I have wide shoulders and ordered a size 12.I  wanted a long coat for cold Iowa winters. It's warm. The only issue is the zipper can sometimes be hard to get fitted together just right and the shoulders are just a little tight."
4.0,"Nice work bag, size just right for my computer and other essential stuff"
4.0,I like it but my wrists are small. It does have an adjustment on it that fits better.  I think it is cute.
4.0,"This charm is okay, I thought the fish needed a little more detail otherwise nice bead."
4.0,Only thing was a couple of the beads fell off.<br />My Granddaughter is using it for her skating competitions so Beautiful!!
4.0,"Estepoba Men's Premium Casual Stretch Long Sleeve Solid Button-Down Work Shirt  came nicely packed with out any damage. This shirt  is made up of  95% of cotton and 5% spandex. Even though it is a long sleeve shirt , we can rolled up the sleeve."
4.0,"Can't beat the value. Bought these for our student store at an elementary school and sold 40 of them in one day. They all worked, although they're a pain to set."
4.0,This shirt is definaley cute! And fits great!
4.0,it's cute! I throw a jean jacket over it with some sneakers and wear to work!
4.0,"These shoes are perfect with just the right heel height, and very comfortable.  I also got plenty of compliments on them."
4.0,I love this product but the part of the bikini in my booty looks  like does not have rear but if you have fit perfect
4.0,My son loved theses shoes they are the best ever I will be buying other colors.
4.0,"Overall this is a good polo for coaching, it looks nice without having to be super dressed up. I own 3 of these polos and plan on buying more. The one negative I have is that they are short in length, so you will have to wear a tank top underneath."
4.0,love how it has a little pink in it. it will goe nice with an outfit I had picked out for it... I also purchased a second one for my girl friend.
4.0,Sweater is super cute but beware it fits very small and tight in the hip/butt area. I even exchanged for an xl and it still fit snug in that area (and I don't have large hips or butt).
4.0,"Its nice, but way too big to fit comfortably on a woman."
4.0,"My son loves these and even though they're velcro, I'm told they're still 'cool' enough for a 3rd grader. The bigger test is to see if they hold up like Stride Rite shoes do - all I ask is 1 year (they grow out of them by then), so crossing my fingers. They do look sturdy though and the lights are something I am hoping to have as long as possible - I consider them a safety feature. My husband was able to see my son at night when camping, which is great."
4.0,I really love this coat!! The only reason why I have 4 stars. Was the the hood seems awkward. It’s only connected by a little strip of zipper and the rest of the hood just kind of hangs. Gives the impression that it’s hanging on by a thread.
4.0,"Cute shoes, but slightly too narrow for my almost 5 year old’s foot."
4.0,"Obviously cheaply made, but worth the price. You can still see through them."
4.0,Would have liked the waist to be more snug but overall happy with this suit
4.0,"It's very difficult to find 100% cotton NightShirts, many say 100% cotton, but there is Lycra added but not listed. This NightShirt is definitely 100% cotton, love the feel and fit. I'm 5'5"" 130lbs & I always order a size Large in my NightShirts & PJs, I like the loose fit. The length hit just below my kneecap. The fit is perfect for me, not tight in the arms, underarms, waist, or chest (I'm a 36B). I would have loved to keep it, but the low scoop neck is not for me. These are winter PJs & my whole chest is exposed.... & cold. Other than that, this is perfect! A size Medium may have fit, but would have been slightly snug for my personal taste. If you don't mind a very low scoop neck, I would highly recommend."
4.0,"Good looking watch and easy to read.  Band notches are just a little “off” for my particular wrist and it’s either too loose or too tight and the connecting notch is actually a little too short in my opinion - makes it hard to get on.  The band itself is not high quality.  I’ve found the watch quits running on occassion for no apparent reason, usually when I haven’t worn it for several days.  For the price and look, it’s somehting I will deal with.  I prefer inexpensive watches like these since my taste changes frequently."
4.0,I would recommend sizing up on these.  They are short at the torso and definately fitted!
4.0,"These look, feel, and flow the way I expected them to from the photo.  I got lots of compliments on them as they are flattering and fit according to the size chart, which I was grateful to have.  Ordered several pairs as they were for a small group performance.  After the performance, I cut the pants and had them hemmed into shorts.  Love them!"
4.0,"Very nice color, good quality, a cute and practical dress to wear around the house."
4.0,"This suit is made of quality material; however, the scoop neck in the front doesn’t sit right. It flips out and doesn’t sit flat against my daughters chest."
4.0,"My daughter loves this and LOVES the fabric but I notice Disney tends to run a little small. I would have bought a size up but wasn’t available. Cute PJs, held up in the wash"
4.0,smaller than I thought but nice
4.0,the top is slightly larger then expected and the side pockets keep coming ot
4.0,The shirt shipped fast and fit well! Can't wait to wear it!!
4.0,I have worn 2 pair so far with flats and ankle pants- the first pair did run (one sockette) are very comfortable -
4.0,They are great for working out. Wearing with jeans. Very pleased with the product. Thank You.
4.0,Just a little tight around the calf area.
4.0,Really cool just the right size it might actually be perfect the only down side is that the sword case part can fall off at times
4.0,"Solid mask, not cheap or flimsy."
4.0,"Cute, stylish goth<br />I will wear this to a concert soon"
4.0,"These glasses do dim the extreme headlights of motorists moving toward ... you making night driving safer.  They are not wonderful, just better.  I've only used them a couple of hours.  They are worth the $20.00."
4.0,A bit more form fitting than I anticipated
4.0,Love the way these fit and feel.  Very soft and comfy.
4.0,I really like these nice I wear them a lot
4.0,Good fit and comfortable to wear.
4.0,Shirt overall was good looks a little different than the pic. Wasn’t crazy about how the sleeves felt. But overall all not too bad
4.0,The fabric is nice and soft. The lace at the bottom adds a nice touch.  It was not as loose fitting as I thought it would be.  I ordered a small.  I usually wear a 6-8.  If I order again will try a medium.
4.0,"The locket is very nice, the chain not as heavy as I would have hoped and the lobster clasp was broken, so I need to replace that. Fortunately I was able to put the locket on my own chain until I can fix the chain that came with it."
4.0,"Bought this as part of a Halloween costume. Initially didn't realize it was coming from China, so I got really worried it wouldn't arrive on time after I ordered it. But it came sooner than anticipated. I bought the red one, and it is a slightly lighter red than expected but still totally fine. It is on the small side! Luckily, I have a small head, so it still works for me, but someone with an average or big adult head, may not be able to wear it. The ribbon had come unglued but still stays in place due to its fit. The hat came slightly folded in the packaging but straightened out easily. This hat works just fine for me, especially given the price. It will serve its purpose."
4.0,I uhh was hoping that the size small would be able to hold in my 32J chest but that was clearly a bit too much to ask XD  it’s super cute though and the quality isn’t terrible for the price.  I think I’m going to repurchase it in a large and then sew the band to fit.
4.0,"The glasses fit really well.  The darkness is terrific and easy on the eyes while driving.  However, when I try to see the side mirrors I can't get both eyes to line up on the mirror.  I can see perfectly out of one eye or if I turn my head just a little, see out of the other eye.  I tried to bend the frames or arms and I got them to work pretty good but just for a little while and then they reverted back the their original form.  Overall I really like the fit and feel of the glasses and will stay using them.  I will try to get my head in a position the allows me to see out of both focals at the same time."
4.0,"Im very happy w the affordable price but unless it’s user error, I would have preferred a hard copy of the plan. And since this is a new jewelry purchase, I haven’t had the need to use it yet, so I can’t comment on how easy or hard it is to use. But I think it’s a worthwhile purchase."
4.0,"It looks too small, bur stretches just right. Love the waist, it's supportive and won't roll during workouts. Pants are smooth. Does have a weird seam, but its ok."
4.0,"Love the colors, material and style. Unfortunately the top was a little small for me but I still wear it. Would be better if a little bit bigger for more busty women. The elastic turns when you put on so continually have to readjust  and even it out.  Bottoms are flattering and have tummy control."
4.0,"Turned out just like the photo, great cheap buy"
4.0,The fit is really comfortable.  I like the fact that there are the rounded pads which give a nice look under shirts.  I only wish it was a little more supportive but other than that it is great.  I'll be ordering some more in other colors.
4.0,My son is 7 but very tall and skinny so I ordered a size up for him.  Glad I did.  The shorts fit a little tight on the legs but perfect on the waist.  I thought they would be a little bigger.  The material has a spandex feel and will be good for swimming.  Please note there is no net on the inside but I don't think that will be a big deal since they are more tight fitting than regular swim shorts.  Overall I am pleased and my son is so excited to wear these.
4.0,"Overall, I love these glasses so far. They came with a nice little bag to keep them in. It's hard to find rose-colored glasses with actual protection from the sun. These are well-shaded and reflective. Be advised that the trims and frame are large and you will be Ble to see them at all times. I hope they end up being sturdy."
4.0,"Just received this keychain, it's very cute! Definitely big enough to find your keys in your purse which is nice. I'm happy with this purchase. I'll be getting a different color each month to have the whole collection!"
4.0,"I am really liking these yoga capri pants. They fit as expected- make sure you look at the size chart. I went with my hip measurement of 36 and chose the small (normally I would have chosen the medium- since all my other workout pants are a medium). They held up great to 3, one hour long outdoor FL workouts and kept me cool. Usually I need help peeling my sweat soaked pants off after a workout but I was able to take these off with no problems. I look forward to wearing these in the winter months outside. I would purchase more but a shorter capri next time, around 17 inches instead of 22 inches for everyday wear."
4.0,This was for my bonus daughter for our family portrait. It fit her great and was a good color. Matched the other family members well!
4.0,It's very dainty and can catch a snag easy so watch out for things when you get it.
4.0,Fit was a bit tight for a + boy
4.0,"I need a swimsuit quick that was modest for swift water rescue training. Im 5’10, 175 lbs and this swimsuit actually fit my long body! I love it!"
4.0,"Perfect fit, just as ordered"
4.0,Came very quickly. Looks smaller than picture but still beautiful.
4.0,"I like it; the look, feel and design, but it was too large for me."
4.0,Fits as expected thank you.
4.0,"LOVE the look of these mini hoops. They can completely pass as sterling silver and diamond hoops. I have tiny ears and these guys cuddle them closely for a wonderful never-take-them-off experience. BUT! I have lost several of them due to the latch design. While I appreciate the no-nonsense and non-poking closure, these little guys are easily unlatched and fall out with the slightest friction, such as taking off my shirt. Since they're so inexpensive I just keep ordering replacements, but this is my third order. I'd love for a more secure latch system that still maintains the non-stabby design of the current product."
4.0,nice short
4.0,I am 5'4 134 and typically wear a size S or 4 in most brands. I usually size up for workout wear but according to the chart it said the small was a 4-6 so I ordered a S. They fit nice but are a little tight around the waist since they are high waisted. They are a thicker material which is perfect for fall and spring and they are a great capri length. I am going to order another pair but I am going to go with the mediums since they will be more comfortable for workouts.
4.0,"Great item for the price, does need hemmed as pants come unhemmed from the box."
4.0,Paint was a little runny and started to chip after a couple weeks. I really don't mind too much though. They're glasses.
4.0,A little lighter weight than I expected but the color is nice and it fits well
4.0,"Good quality but jus,t or,der 1/2 size smaller ,than your regular size"
4.0,"Cute and cozy, just a little too see through."
4.0,Super cute; runs a tad large. I got a 12 but definitely could have gotten a 10. Thin material but it is lined. Slip still required for modesty’s sake. My skirt wasn’t made properly and doesn’t lie flat in front but thankfully I can sew and can fix it.<br />Requires ironing; A-line style really flattering on my “slight pear” shaped body. Great price.
4.0,Love the feel very comfortable. But after washing they can get wrinkled easy.
4.0,Everyone at the rubies cube competition liked it
4.0,"Cute! Daddy loved it! Average quality, fit as expected."
4.0,"Great fun for Oktoberfest, run a little smaller in thigh than we expected."
4.0,"Bought for a gift , print and shirt quality looks great. Glad I sized up one size !"
4.0,Very nice canvas bag. It's big enough to hold some of my books and folders that I need for school also a laptop if needed. It has an inside pocket for smal small items. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it does tend to tear at the seams easy. But still very cute bag.
4.0,this is a soft and comfortable dress. it's very long (would probably brush the floor for someone about 5'7&#34;) but it's fine for me with tall heels. my only complaint is the pockets are small - would be nice if my phone would fit.
4.0,"I like the style of the skirt, the only neg thing I would have to say, is when I pulled the bottom up it looked like I had a bigger belly."
4.0,Really cute shirt but definitely runs very small. I usually wear a small (5'5&#34; 118lbs.) and a medium is tight but will work for me.
4.0,Perfect Velma skirt.
4.0,"Feels good, but some had small holes by the heels. Minor thing though."
4.0,"Beautiful, vibrant colors, but because it is a lighter background, it shows my extra weight around my stomach a bit when I'm feeling a bit bloated. If I didn't have that issue, I would really love this dress. It did fit slightly smaller than another similar style from another company (Zattacas). If it fit like that one, I probably would have kept it. Would look beautiful in the summer with a tan if you are going somewhere tropical!!!"
4.0,Hard to find half sizes for men's sandals. Just what I was looking for.
4.0,"Cute booties, but too small especially with socks on my little boys feet.  They probably would have been perfect if they would have had a larger size."
4.0,The cap is way too small for my 3 year old. Everything else fit well. Added on 4/29/16 we recently found out our son is I. The 10% growth range for his age so if your child is on the smaller side of three it fits well.(except the hat)
4.0,Quality is better than I expected.  Fit is as expected.  I would have much preferred a step-in style with a front zipper.  But the lack of side pockets is a HUGE negative.  My phone falls out of the breast pocket every time I bend over — problematic when feeding the cat.
4.0,"This sweater has such a cute, slouchy fit. I love the drop shoulder and tuckable looseness. The fabric is lightweight and perfect for layering. The fabric is slightly scratchy but not enough to prevent me from wearing it. I love the deep, rich color of the red. This feels like a wardrobe staple and I've only had it for a few days."
4.0,"Me fascino,soy m y lo pedí m me quedo perfecto"
4.0,"These shower shoes were a replacement for another pair I bought on Amazon that were dangerously uncomfortable.  The Vertico Shower Sandals are basically one big pieces of shaped rubbery plastic.  Even the part the goes between the toes is fully integrated into the into the sandal (i.e., it doesn't pass through the sole.<br /><br />I wore these sandals for about 5 hours the other day with no complaints, and I didn't feel any irritation or abrasion.<br /><br />The water rolls off them easily in the shower and they dry quickly.<br /><br />I wear a size 10 - 10.5 in shoes, assuming I'm wearing socks.  I bought size 10 in the sandals and they fit as expected with bare feet (no overhang of my toes or heel).<br /><br />The sandals fit well against my feet and didn't slip off or make a really loud slapping sound as I walked.<br /><br />Upon arrival, the new plastic sandals has a distinct (but not unpleasant) odor, but after a day or two of them sitting out, there was no smell."
4.0,"Love the skirt, super cute. However, it had an odor when delivered. I hand washed it, but just don't be ready to throw it right on and go."
4.0,Decent quality and does the job
4.0,Novelty piece. Fun piece for summertime with tank tops.
4.0,At least 3 times larger then what I expected. Still very cute. I intended to give then to my daughter but I don't think she would like this size. I may wear some them some time if the right outfit/ mood strikes
4.0,They are very well made and have held up well so far.
4.0,"They’re very pretty, a little small, but very pretty."
4.0,I honestly don’t have a reason to dislike it. I love how it feels very secured and even if it looks thin it doesn’t feel like it will break because of how the string is made. I like it and hopefully I get to show it off this Summer !!
4.0,I got a 2XL it feels more like a in between a L -1XL
4.0,It's on the short side unfortunately. I got a size large based on the sizing chart but it is very form fitting. I wish I had gotten an XL. I am 5' 6&#34; and 135 lbs. It seems very well made though and is quite comfortable
4.0,"I'm 5&#34;10 195lbs athletic build and got the large. Tried the jacket on for the first, fits perfect.  Honestly a bit surprised that it looks exactly like the photo.  The only thing I'm my not too thrilled about is the pockets(bottom two ), they're thin and I'm worried they'll fall apart easily."
4.0,These seem to be made well enough. Not expecting them to last super long but with kids it doesn't matter since they outgrow them fast enough. For the price they're definitely worth it.
4.0,"I will be wearing this pretty dress to a wedding.<br />It meets my expectations perfectly and since I’m a lady of “a certain age”, the 3/4 sleeves is perfect."
4.0,Good bifold. Kinda longer than I thought. It did have a snap to keep the two sides together. Picture shows a greyish bluish tint but mine is like a puke green color. I would recommend to anyone who will carry this in a purse or inside coat pocket. Not intended for back pockets.
4.0,"There are so many sizes to choose from, but you should definitely size up. The fabric is a little on the cheap side, but it's cute and it does the job it's supposed to do. My kids were every excited to have a family set of onsie pajamas. We did have to return/exchange for larger sizes for the kids."
4.0,"Fit perfict, single identical small bubble in each, both same transparency. Very light &#34;stone&#34; feels like plastic."
4.0,They came in the mail today and j actually really like them! They look like they're really expensive and work well! I didn't give them 5 stars because one side is kind of stuff and whenever I open and close them I feel like I'm going to break them. But I recommend buying them if you just are looking for some cute sunglasses but they probably won't last you that long.
4.0,"Attractive and well made, but it's a bit heavy for  a single fastener. However, it makes my position clear without having to wear PP shirts or hats and that's a big plus for me."
4.0,Very stiff material.  I’ve been wearing this band for a couple weeks and it is still pretty stiff.  It is a little difficult to get tight enough for my wrist but I think it will get easier as the material loosens up a bit.  Very attractive.
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, fairly petite at about 100lbs; these pants are comfy and fit moderately well. there's extra cloth at the ankles, though, so not a perfect fit but doable for someone my size. i don't worry about them slipping too low during my yoga practice, though, so still totally functional! :)"
4.0,the leather is really good :) the package was also very attractive.. its a good gift for a man but the problem is that its a little cheap made.. because it has little spikes inside and its not the real color.. seemingly it is cheap painted black..
4.0,"For the price, it's a pretty decent watch. Don't expect luxury crafting but a basic, essential watch that you can wear anytime."
4.0,Smaller than expected. It is beautiful and my daughter loves it. Is very cheap made but she likes it.
4.0,"I got these for running and they definitely don’t move around on my face or slip down my nose. I like the silicone grip that’s embedded in the frame - no digging in. They are a large frame so not something I’d personally wear for everyday.  Cheaper than other big name polarized glasses and just as good so far, but time will tell if they hold out as well."
4.0,"Overall, I love this dress! It's got a nice amount of stretch and the fabric is sturdy. It washes well and irons nicely. I deducted a star because there are quite a few loose thread ends and there was a very small stain on the shoulder but it's covered by the collar so you can't really see it and I'd already washed and dried it so couldn't return. I'm 5'7 and it hits right at the knee. I have a 38&#34; bust and it fit just fine with only minor pulling at the buttons when &#34;the girls&#34; weren't adjusted right."
4.0,like the product.  holds cards & cash securely.  i used a similar style/concept leather wallet (at 3 times the price) however the leather would stretch out when it gets wet; this product has elasticity.  i usually carry 4 cards plus some cash and all fits nicely and stays in place.  only minor downside is pulling out one card at a time can be difficult; especially if the card you want is in the middle...  but it takes a second to pop cards in and out...
4.0,"I love my wine colored tote because it’s perfect to take to the office.  The leather, lining, and zipper are good quality.  It is a step up from a shopping bag as noted in the description.  It is a stylish bag at a good price.  I just wished that the handles were longer and that the faint smell will eventually go away. It was packed nice and carefully for shipment."
4.0,A little tricky to close and open.
4.0,"Exceeded our expectations. Lots more storage than what they tell you. Overall quality appears great. Little bit of stitching issue around the bottom belt, hoping that doesn’t become problematic or<br />Tear. Will review after use."
4.0,"I absolutely love this top!  Great material and fit.  Perfect for jeans or leggings, or can be dressed up with white slacks.  Great quality!  I would purchase again."
4.0,Varicose veins
4.0,"It is cut well, though not as snug as I expected.  I would have preferred the fabric to be less shiny (would have been beautiful in a poly/cotton with slight stretch)."
4.0,"The structured collar and hidden button placket are great looking, and the light weight poly/elastane cloth is very comfortable."
4.0,"This is a nice ring and I like it, however, it runs about 1/2 size too small. I'm pretty much a solid 8, but this feels a bit too tight on me.<br /><br />In person, the diamonds look quite a bit smaller than I was expecting from the product listing photos. Only one of the diamonds seems to show up - the others sort of just look like dents in the ring.<br /><br />The color is spot on for 14k (I don't think it looks like 18k). The band overall is very smooth and shiny. It feels very well-made and comfortable on my finger - there aren't any rough or sharp areas on the ring.<br /><br />Overall I like it a lot, but it is a bit snug.<br /><br />Edit: I liked this ring so much that I got one in a size 9. Unfortunately, it's too loose for the finger I wanted to wear it on, but it does fit my other finger. This really is a gorgeous ring."
4.0,Soft and easy to wear.
4.0,"I bought these for back up shower sandals and they will fill the roll fine. They fit fine, no problems with being to thin or short, no overly rigid areas. I have the Vertico sandals with the flat band across the front and they have held up fine for over a year so I decided to get these too. I am not going to wear them for a walk down the street but for short term use they are great."
4.0,I'm a 10 and ordered a 9...Fits perfect.  Needed to order a size smaller as other reviews recommended. When I walk my feet slips back and I need to walk 'forward' or on my toes to keep it balanced. Other than than its comfortable and casual looking too!
4.0,I got this to wear as a bridesmaid at my sisters wedding. Everything fit perfectly but the sleeves were a little big. Not enough to get altered on short notice.
4.0,the hoops were not what i expected they are extremely small like nose rings but the bars are super cute
4.0,A little shapeless but can be fixed with a belt
4.0,"I love this top, but unfortunately it runs big. I ordered a small, I'm 5'6, a size 4 in tops, but it was too long and a little too big. I'm short waisted so maybe if you have a longer torso then it would work. It's well made though and nice and thick. I'm sad I had to return it."
4.0,"What a spectacular buy! Inexpensive, but wow. This dress is stunning. I’m 5’9”, 135, size 8, 34A. This dress almost fits like a glove. It’s built for a bigger ches, like at least a C cup. A little extra padding was needed."
4.0,The material was a little thinner than I thought it would be.
4.0,I gave this to her for Mother's Day and I have to say that it looks very good on her. I'd say the size is a bit smaller than a silver dollar so it's pretty big. Its not heavy though. The chain is very nice and compliments it very well.
4.0,"It's not expensive fashion jewelry, so you get what you paid for. Shipping is quite slow but for the price, they look very nice."
4.0,The fabric is really soft and silky.  I would size up as the ear holes pull a little on my six year old.
4.0,The dress was just what I expected
4.0,"This dress is cute. But I sized up based on other reviews and could have fit in a medium better than the large. I'm 5'3 and 155, the dress goes nearly to the floor so I might need to hem it an inch or so but otherwise great dress."
4.0,"I ordered 2 shirts Medium one is fine this one was too small.  Not returning, but a little too tight."
4.0,i liked it just to small for my big head
4.0,Runs big and the bottom curls but besides that it's perfect #godawgs
4.0,"Great bracelet, bought it for my 3 daughters, its more of costume jewelry but they seemed to like it. Its not very &#34;quality&#34; but its perfect for 6-12 year old girls who lose stuff anyways, but it still looks cute on them. You can't beat it for the price."
4.0,"The stripes don’t always hit in a flattering way, but it is comfortable!"
4.0,Wife Loves it as I bought it for her.
4.0,"Really love these,they are super comfy. Only problem I ordered XL which turned out to be too big for me."
4.0,"Gift was for my daughter and she loved it. Easy to put on and take off. As she says.. ""Very Fashionable"""
4.0,Cute Pajama set!
4.0,This would have received a 5 star if the sizing was consistent in colors. I got the army green in XL and fits great. Then I bought the bright blue and my butt barley fits? I'm confused lol
4.0,"I've only had these for nearly 2 months, but I like them a lot so far.  These would consider these compression-based socks, with a uniform compression I feel from the toes to the ankle.  I wear these for working out at the gym after work, and occasionally  for work-since I am on my feet walking around most of the day.  Its well constructed, with no inside stitching or seams work that one may feel against the skin once you have them on.  They don't smell after heavy use, and seem to wash well, without loss of compression.  Again, only  under 2 months, but just what I was hoping to get!"
4.0,The only problem I have is it is hard to pump.
4.0,Definitely worth the purchase. Super cute
4.0,"I really like this outfit! It is adorable. A few issues though... - it stretches out really easy<br />- it runs small, which I read on some other reviews. I got a 12-18months, my daughter is in 9 month clothes and this almost fits her. - it does shrink"
4.0,"My teenager got this for a gift, it fits well and is a nice quality. She's very pleased."
4.0,I bought this for my husband and he liked it.
4.0,It's great but somewhat small. Not perfect.
4.0,I went up a size based on reviews and I’m glad I did because they are pretty tight. Still cute but deff can not dry them.
4.0,"The shirt is super cute, it's just the size description is deceiving. When I think 'girls', I'd presume a small would be a 6-7. This is more like a small women's. Would have been 5 star if it would have actually fit a little girl."
4.0,my waist has gotten bigger so these helped
4.0,Comfy. Stayed up pretty well
4.0,What a fun item!  Totally soft & well made.  Great for tossing (throwing?) at TV when Green Bay doesn't score.  Packer fans will love it.
4.0,This is the most perfect summer top! I love how you can adjust it to the length that you’re comfortable with. I would’ve given it 5 stars but one of the strings was defective as I couldn’t pull it down. Fortunately with just pulling one string it still looked fine.
4.0,Loved it just too see through and could see everything! But besides that made butt look nice!
4.0,"Great product, the jacket a little tight but still a great gi!!!"
4.0,Finally received this and hope that it doesn't rub off like the previous one I bought.
4.0,I have been looking for underwear that goes up to my belly button and wider in the crotch area so these are a great fit. However...I am not convinced the gusset lining is cotton as pads do not stick to this fabric at all anywhere like they normally do with cotton.
4.0,"I love the packaging, I personally assumed they'd be bigger but still totally worth it. And if like to add these are legit none of that flaking rose paint!"
4.0,Love the look and it's easy to read!
4.0,The only thing I don't like is that it goes through batteries a lot faster than my Logitech wireless mouse. Other than that its a great mouse.
4.0,"I like the open toe, they made my legs feel good. But they are tight at the top."
4.0,"I ordered the sage color and it definitely is not the same color i ordered. It came more of a minty, blue green. I really like the fit and can stand the color so I guess it’s fine? Definitely not the green I was expecting."
4.0,Really cute suit. Problem is when you get it wet you can see the cups sewed into the breast area which isn't that flattering.
4.0,"I was very hesitant to purchase shoes online but I needed them in a hurry and didn't have time to go to a store for a few days so Amazon to the rescue! These shoes fit well and the size is accurate. There is a little bump under the big toe where the strap is tucked in below the surface. I was able to wear these shoes all day without being irritated by it, I noticed but it didn't stop me from wearing them again. I would order this brand again"
4.0,"Works as advertised. Quick shipping. Works best if you're only looking for 1/2"" or less extra room. Overall satisfied with purchase"
4.0,Very cute and looks just like the picture but a little too big in my opinion
4.0,Fits true to size. Good material.
4.0,Great replacement headband for the SteelSeries Arctis 5 headset. Looks and Feels like the original.
4.0,Very pretty but larger than I thought...I bought these in two colors for my grand daughters who are under 10 years...Neither one can wear them as they are too large...They will keep them until they are older....
4.0,I love the blouse but it is too small. I gave it time sister
4.0,"Fits snugly, feels ok. Thought it would do more, but it's no miracle."
4.0,"I am not normally fond of underwear; it tends to feel constricting to me. With these, I was frequently not aware that I was even wearing them. That's a good thing! Seem to be sturdy. The fly is fine. I'm older, so the boxer look is fine for me."
4.0,"Sunglasses work and fit very well, I would have given five stars but I need more experience with them as I have only warn them three times."
4.0,"I wear a size 10/12 in pants and bought a Large — the skirt fits perfect, is very comfortable, and moves with you a little bit. HOWEVER — this skirt smells absolutely atrocious. I have washed it 3 consecutive times to try to get the smell out, and it hasn’t yet."
4.0,Light and pretty. Spacious for travel.
4.0,"My only problem after receiving it, I realized that it was an elastic band holding two plates together around your cards"
4.0,Not great quality. The ear pieces get caught in my hair.
4.0,"The product snapped on the watch great, is secure and looks really good. However, it is too big for me. I'm going to take it in since it's just sewed elastic and I have the machine for it but still, I measured my wrist and it was within the small range listed but it's still very loose and swings all around on my wrist."
4.0,This is a good looking watchband. Be careful to save the pins that you remove from your watch because the ones included with the band were too big to fit the pin holes in my watch. I was able to reuse the old ones and the band works fine now.
4.0,"I have had lots of compliments on this dress!!!  I’m glad I am not very tall, as it is none too long.  The fabric is so soft and the pockets are great!!!"
4.0,Grandson loves this hat
4.0,"Washed up nicely, fits good and is soft."
4.0,Gift so I presume is ok.
4.0,I like that I can attach it to my smaller purses that won’t hold a glass case. And I can fit both reading and sunglasses in this soft case at the same time. The downfall is that the caribeener broke pretty quickly.
4.0,Fits right but too short for a tall person.
4.0,"I’m a very active person, and don’t like to wear sports bras all the time, and wires on my bras always brake after the first couple weeks of having them. I love this bra. It’s meant for thinner smaller chested ladies. Like a-c with 32-36 band. They are tight and compressing, like a sports bra with nice padding."
4.0,"Great bracelet. It looks just like the image. It is A little long though, if you have a skinny wrist that is."
4.0,"The fit is great! It is snug, but not right."
4.0,"Very cute. Just got it , so we will see how sturdy it is after some use .  Looks like it will hold up."
4.0,Great idea! The hooks need to be bent a bit more or should close better. They slide out too easily. Otherwise they look great!
4.0,Nice glasses for kids
4.0,"I have purchased these shirts in two different color sets. I love the cut and I really like the shirts. My only problem is they shrink almost a size after washing and the sizing is not consistent between colors. The red runs larger, then black, then grey, and the green is a lot smaller than the others. If you buy big, you’ll be good."
4.0,"I really liked this dress and hoped if would fit so that i could ware it to an event in 3 days.  but it runs small,  its stretchy which is great but it showed every roll.  But;  its well made and very pretty I wish i could keep it."
4.0,Thick material. Nice quality
4.0,"Liked the pattern,was way longer then I thought"
4.0,kind of small but cute.
4.0,"Great for the price! If you’re careful and take it off before showering or putting on like sunscreen or heavy lotion it will stay gold. I was good about it for awhile but it’s now ended up in the shower, pool, and lake a decent amount lol. It’s started to silver around the clasp but not too noticeable and i still love the look of it!"
4.0,A nice top. But not for small boobs. Im 32b it was a little big.
4.0,"I bought these because of the design. The detail is very pretty and unusual. They are lightweight and very dainty. I would have liked them a little larger, but am very pleased with the quality and the appearance."
4.0,I have no complaints about this product.<br />It a gift and hopefully the person enjoy it.
4.0,Muy lindos algo pequeños pero perfectos
4.0,Well made and as advertised. Fit well but bigger nipples would be helpful! Ha. Looks good and comfortable.
4.0,Lightweight and easy to breathe thru
4.0,I love the depth of color in these! Very dark and shiny LOVE EM! the method of hooking together is fantastic I don't have to fight getting them closed after putting them into my ears.<br />The color has NOT faded and I have showered and been in the sun etc.<br />these are a great pair of every-days!
4.0,"Thick, warm, fits well, good quality. Husband loves it. GO CATS!"
4.0,Thought it was more cloth like but it’s ok.
4.0,they are small for people who do not want to carry to may keys
4.0,Ocean Blues Women's 7/8 Leggings High Waisted Tummy Control Stretch Ruffled Leg Workout Trainning Yoga Pants<br /><br />These are cute and flattering. The fit is true to size and seem to be very well made. The color looks great and has not faded. Our daughter is super happy with these leggings.
4.0,It does what it supposed to.
4.0,The item is very nice but just too small...might go back and o
4.0,"I give the swimsuit 4 stars only bc it didn’t fit my top area (DD/ DDD)  Nice quality, color and the hardware stands out."
4.0,Looked kool ....the kid loved it
4.0,"I loved the fit of the dress, but returning and only giving 4 starts because of how transparent it is with the pockets (tried on at work, not wearing then returning). The rest of the dress was fine. For reference, I am 5’5”, 170lbs, and ordered XL. I was wearing nude under garments and you couldn’t see them. The pockets however, were VERY noticeable. I also didn’t like that you can’t wear a normal bra. Not a huge deal, can wear a bralette, but the pockets were a deal breaker."
4.0,"Very pretty cover-up, but the color wasn't white, it was very off white.  I had to buy another cover-up to match the other of two swimsuits."
4.0,Great glasses.  We spend a lot of time in the sun and on the water.  They are perfect.
4.0,Just a little larger than expected.
4.0,"Loved the show, but they run a size smaller than expected, so I ended up needing to return them!"
4.0,Got a watch band for my Huawei watch and the band came with to long of pins.  These worked perfect.
4.0,Beautiful purse.  Had to return because purse was twisted from the company and could not reshape.  Customer service was great when I returned.
4.0,Tbh if I was thicker it would look more like the picture but over all I'm satisfied
4.0,Not Pandora but works fine and nobody can tell the difference.
4.0,Really eased my leg pain after a break and surgery.  You have to really work to get them on (I'm a larger-sized woman) but it iso worth it.
4.0,The clutch looks heavenly..simply awesome! was looking to gift this to a friend but havent a clue how to open the same..please have someone contact me at the earliest with directions...
4.0,"My granddaughter just loved it the only problem was a chemical smell I left it air out for a few days , there should have been one of the little packets inside to take away the smell"
4.0,"When originally received merchandise, sizing was inconsistent, stitching was coming out of one of the masks, and one on one mask the two pieces of fabric were misaligned/not stitched together correctly.  Merchant quickly resolved issue for me.  Gave 4 stars for quick resolution.  Thank you!"
4.0,This is the pink color I was looking for.  Very cute ankle boot.  I have to struggle to get them on and they are somewhat tight so I cannot wear them all day long.  I would recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,Fit a little tight but acceptable.
4.0,Not sweater fabric but washes easy!
4.0,"The turret kind of spins around instead of staying in place, but what more can you really ask for for 7 dollars."
4.0,Exactly what it is supposed to be.
4.0,"This Item exceeds expectation in both design, price and delivery time. Hard to believe such mild price and affordable quality is been sold."
4.0,"This is not the thickest and most durable ref jersey that one could buy, it is fine quality and the price just can't be beat.  My son uses it to ref hockey & so we glued some velcro to the chest for his patch and sent him off to the rink."
4.0,Great tyo slip in your purse for unexpected ice.
4.0,I like it but am not able to wear as it's too big (one size fits all)
4.0,"Love this dress! It is flowy and light. Slightly see through, but perfect for the beach or just a bralette under. The chest is loose but other than that it is perfect!"
4.0,"Super cute, needed to &#34;fluff&#34; the feathers up from packaging."
4.0,The frames were a little large on my face but they are polarized and are stylish with actual bamboo arms (you can see the grain on them). At about $20 these are a good deal.
4.0,I ordered this so I could have more room in my suitcase for my upcoming trip. I had already ordered some others and I needed another one . It wasn't as big as I expected but I will keep it and use it anyway. I like the way you can pack so much more with these packing cubes. They make your suitcase look neater and you can get more clothes packed with less space. I wish I had of bought these years ago. I travel a lot and like to have extra room in my suitcase for other purchases i might make and need to fit in my suitcase also. It is well made.
4.0,"Really pretty definitely would recommend, only problem my daughter had an allergic reaction and her ears swelled up :("
4.0,Boyfriend usually wears a XL in sweatshirts and hoodies but this XL was baggy.<br />We probably should of ordered a large.
4.0,"Like the different colors of these socks.  Soft , but do have minor flaws."
4.0,I purchased these as a gift and was very satisfied with the product I received.  The earrings were a little mismatched in size.  But this just adds to their uniqueness and shows off the fact that they are not machine made.
4.0,NICE CUT NICE DESIGN BUT WAYYYY TOO SMALL.
4.0,Casual y delgado
4.0,Cute tee.
4.0,I like the design and I like how lightweight the shirt is!
4.0,"I wore this for new years and it was so comfortable,  the size very accurate,  it was just a little bit short on the legs but I looked fantastic with high heels.  Stretchy fabric and very nice lace on the v-neck area.  Sexy and comfy."
4.0,"not in love with it, doesn't look the same as pictures. It has pockets which i love.. A lot of loose strings. Material doesn't really breathe so it makes me sweaty. Also, the band in right below the breasts so there's no waist and it makes me look pregnant. Love the length,, Im 5'10"" and it hits below my ankle so if you're short that might be an issue. I like it enough to keep it but I wouldnt buy another."
4.0,Lovely...but I had to shorten the straps to fit better.
4.0,Quality and picture is great. I am a 36 DDD and the xxl was to tight
4.0,"I just got the 24 mm Swiss Reimagined tan leather band and installed on an Apple Watch stainless steel using the LUVVITT adapters. Looks like an original product made for the Apple Watch. The leather band is thick (3/16&#34;) which makes the bulky apple watch look less bulky. The material of the band feels like good quality leather. The color is very close to the picture on the screen but I am sure it will change with use, which may make it look even better.  It has stamped &#34;made in Germany&#34; on the inside but you cannot trust if this is a fact.  In any case I am very satisfied with the look and feel. Looks very masculine but may also look fine on a lady's wrist. The inside has a softer leather that is in contact with your skin. We will have to see how well it ages and holds with use but for the price you cannot go wrong.  Even if it only lasts a year.  I definitely recommend it."
4.0,"... and the fabric is a *tiny bit* loose around the underarms, but otherwise, I really like it and will wear it regularly. The fabric is light and drapes nicely. Perfect for gardening on the patio on a hot summer afternoon!"
4.0,Extra large is too small for my 13 year old son???
4.0,"This dress is adorable.  I can’t wait to wear it! Order true to size or down a size- I ordered true to size because I have a larger chest- otherwise, most people can probably go down a size."
4.0,"got as a gift. this is cute, but I don't know how well it will hold up over time. looks a little cheaply made"
4.0,"I got a size medium and it fits as expected for the most part - maybe slightly larger than expected. It is longer than I was expecting though.<br />Seems like good quality, though."
4.0,"It’s a little too big, but all in all like the colors, My recommendation would be go down on one size"
4.0,"The product is easy to use and works to stretch shoes, the only con is when I tried to use it to expand a pair of heels, it doesn't go all the way in because of the arch of the heel."
4.0,"My phone Holder works good most of the time. The only issue I have is sometimes when entering a small car,if it catches on anything it pops apart at the swivel  you can easily pop it back together . All in all its a pretty good product."
4.0,I bought this for the square body on the back went out of my comfort zone by buying the blue but it’s actually a really nice looking blue Really like the shirt
4.0,I love it and it's beautiful. Length is longer but I love it that way. It was tighter then I expected it to be especially around the cheat area. But I love it so much I'm keeping it and continuing to wear it! 😍
4.0,Fabric was super light and a high low is always nice but I should of sized down. It made me look a little slouchy as the material is very relaxed which makes it comfortable. I no longer need this item but would consider reordering in a smaller size
4.0,"It's a good quality scarf... suitable for it's purpose, soft fabric and nice pattern"
4.0,"When I opened the box I was immediately taken back by the material. Not what I was expecting.  I bought this as a gift for my daughter and I didnt think she would like it. Turns out, she loves it and it looks super cute on her!"
4.0,Love this watch. Looks very nice on my husband
4.0,The material is super soft. It feels like PJ's. I bought this for a costume idea for me and my boyfriend (he's stitch and I'm lilo) I got a large and he usually wears a medium. Good thing I did because the sleeves barely reach his wrists. He's only wearing it for Disneyland and then it's mine after lol.
4.0,I use these glasses as safety glasses in a dental office.  Patients love that the light is not so bright in their eyes.  Wish frames were bigger but minor complaint.  Glasses work fine.
4.0,I bought this for my 5 year old son to keep his money in.  I would love love to get a change purse but trying to find one for boys is a little hard.  The change section is small as to be expected since its a wallet but it serves the purpose.  He loves it. The wallett is also good quality.
4.0,Neat looking pants but go a size or two up
4.0,Love the shirt fits perfectly. I order the shirt with prime two day shipping the shirt arrived two days later then expected. Other then that a nice shirt.
4.0,A bit on the thin side. I think anything that could drop on him would go right thru the apron. The hat is toddler sized.
4.0,Child really like it
4.0,"The bangs covered passed my eyes, but otherwise fit very well."
4.0,My husband is 6 foot tall and 180 pounds. The large top him very well. Material seems durable and it has been washed several times.
4.0,"Very comfortable, will work better for colder days."
4.0,Cute!  Bright. Nice material.
4.0,I’m a 38 c and it fits pretty close to true size. I run long distance 10-15 miles so I wish this had a little more padding or support.
4.0,"The fit was ok, but I’ve never been able to fit most hats unless it’s custom. It should work fine if one has a narrow head or wear their hair down."
4.0,"Beautiful skirt.  On me it's a rather long midi (I'm 5'8&quot;), but everything else about the skirt is very nice.  I also bought Simply Retro's bow blouse and the two pieces look great together.  Moreover, the skirt works very well with any top in the Victorian style category - a perfect complement!"
4.0,So soft and looks as pictured hut sleeves are more 3/4 length. Love the button detail! I normally get a small but ordered a medium and it fit perfect(34b size 4) thin cardigan but will be so cute!
4.0,Durable and distinguished.
4.0,"This bag is at the same time bigger and smaller than I thought it would be. Based on the pictures provided, I thought it would be more rigid but it’s actually very soft and doesn’t stand upright like the pictures show. It’s also wider than I thought it would be. It fits a LOT - keys, wallet, three small pouches (one for tea, one for first aid, one for make up) a pencil case, a Stephen King novel, sun tan lotion, deodorant, hand sanitizer - and doesn’t lose shape. It could actually fit more.<br /><br />The zipped pockets on the sides are kind of useless and, when I opened the vertical one, I almost ripped the lining trying to zip it up again. They aren’t big enough to fit anything. Also, the smaller handles/straps are very firm. I’m sure they will soften with extended use.<br /><br />Pros: fits all my junk and isn’t heavy on the shoulder, is comfortable against the body<br /><br />Cons: useless pockets"
4.0,"nice product, well delivered."
4.0,"Love it, except it is a little wobbly . SLIGHTLY uneven legs."
4.0,"The first pair I received wasn't the best. The stones were very uneven, and one stone was missing. I contacted the seller and they had me take a picture of the damaged good, and a new pair was sent to me very quickly. The new pair that came were more of the silver color instead of the iridescent color I originally order. BUT I feel with the WHTIE base color on the ball, (which holds the actual stones) looks better with the silver stones and appears less cheap then the iridescent color I originally order/received. From far away, the original iridescent ones would of looked fine if all the stones were intact. The new pair still isn't the best looking thing up close, so I coated the entire ball with clear nail polish, which evened it out a lot. Even though the product is just alright, for the price its a good buy! The seller was great and very easy to work with, and had no problem helping me out with the original defected pair and very fast in their response time. **in the picture attached; the one of the left is the non-damaged iridescent stud VS the new silver color stud on the right. NOTE: The silver pair does have clear nail polish on it)."
4.0,"The ring itself is nice and comfortable, but some of the color doesn’t fill in all the way for the embossed emblems. I doubt anyone will look closely though. My husband liked it as an alternative to his metal wedding band."
4.0,Nice looking purse. Larger than I pictured but when is a handbag too large?  Many pockets. I would have given 4 stars but HARDWARE is a bit on the cheap side.
4.0,Only thing is my change always falls out
4.0,"Received on time, not damaged and the product was exactly as advertised. I would make additional purchases from this vendor."
4.0,Valentine shirt
4.0,Advertised as 14 oz but is only 12 oz.
4.0,Very cute and arrived on time. Found them to be a bit flimsy for the $30 cost though.
4.0,Very pretty and diffrent necklace.  Well made and great deal on price.  I bought a dress and it had this necklace pictured with it. WEST COAST WARDROBE STARRY EYED CROCHET DRESS has this necklace with it.  Goes great!  love it.
4.0,Very thin material which is a pro and con. Pro is that it is breathable and light weight. Con is that it doesn’t protect well from dust & COVID (i don’t think any product like this will). You can adjust the amount of fabric over your face so I guess it can be breathable & protective but not at the same tome.
4.0,"very Nice product, I love it. unfortunately it take almost one month to arrives to US because came from other coutry, for this Im rating 4 stars."
4.0,"Very quality product for the price.  Dark and well constructed.  Also, comes with a fairly nice case and a wiping clothe, which is a decent bonus for a low priced item.  Only one minor complaint is that the glasses are so dark while indoors or in the car, I can't even really see my phone or my dashboard display, etc.  But, i suppose if my biggest complaint about sunglasses are that they might be too dark in certain situations, I don't really have that much of a complaint...."
4.0,"The wetsuit jacket artwork is beautiful, and it's really well made and tailored. It looks like it will perform well for years. The huge negative for me is the horrible chemical smell. It's very strong, and makes me feel like I am putting on a toxic wrap."
4.0,They're exactly what I needed but dang the balls fall out so easy....
4.0,"I found these very comfortable, but small for ear  use."
4.0,"I am so impressed of the fitting coz it really fits well to me. I'm kinda petit kind of girl and I usually got a S size and really don't think that this is as the same as what I expected because I bought some in the same size but it's either too tight or loose to me,but this one is just so perfect.<br />I love the style. Excellent fabric used. Just a little bit concerned on the edge because it wasn't hem,both at the top and bottom side of the swimwear.<br />I got this item from a discounted code in exchanged of my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"These run very small. I normally wear a medium to large depending on brand. Based on the size chart, I ordered a XL and they are still very tight, especially under the armpits. I bought them to wear under my scrubs during winter months. They are working well for me, but I do recommend ordering a larger size for comfort."
4.0,"Love these bags because of the removable solid bottom, the insulation, and the size.  What I don't like is the zipper.  it sticks and it's not very sturdy.  I had to attach large paper clips to the 2 bags I bought so when you try to zip it, you can actually find the small zipper head.  Otherwise, they are awesome."
4.0,"Very cute, just not big enough on top. It need to accommodate big chested women."
4.0,"I bought this for me so i wouldn't burn up on warm mornings out on the deck. My awesome wife liked it so much, she wears it more than I do. Even though it swallows her up a bit she looks pretty darn sexy in it.<br />I just ordered another one today."
4.0,"I thought this would be a handy organizer to put into my backpack to organize my calculator, laptop charger, phone charger, mouse, etc, BUT the product itself is actually kind of heavy and adds a lot of weight to my bag. And heavy things such as my graphing calculator tend to fall out. Also all the images make it seem like every item you have can be perfectly organized into the cocoon but in reality it's hard to get everything organized properly and the gaps end up being too large or too small for many items. It's good if you have the time to plan out how to arrange everything on the cocoon but I just like to throw things in my bag and go. It actually requires some thinking to make everything fit perfectly like in the sample pictures... However, I still like using it to travel and keep it in a luggage since it's not sitting on my back being extra weight."
4.0,"Cute bottom, but the sizing runs on the bigger side. Was gonna return it since it didn’t fit (would probably fall down in rough water), but will keep in reserve for pool use."
4.0,"Super comfortable and really cute! I've gotten compliments on them by a lot of random people. They aren't super waterproof if you are planning on working in the snow in them the water will definitely soak in, but it repels it if I'm just walking around outside."
4.0,"I am a curvy woman, and while it &#34;fits&#34; it isn't flattering and my boobs and ass fall out easily. So wear with caution."
4.0,"I sent in my measurements and I don't think they were used? The dress ended up too short so I needed tailoring but color and fabric is just as expected, great quality and not as full as I thought it would be."
4.0,"I’m 5’4, 143 lbs,  the extra large was exact fit, would have preferred a little more room."
4.0,"I love the design, the concept of it and all, but the space to put cards in was really tiny and I had to stretch it some to fit just my bank card in it."
4.0,"I love the way they feel. I bought these because I’m standing in a procedural lab all day/ 5 says a week. My legs hurt. I have graduated compression socks that I love but are really warm and shiny because of the elastic. I thought I would give these a try.<br />These socks are not graduated compression. They provide pretty equal compression throughout. The material is soft and warm but more breatheable that my current socks. The front pattern is not throughout the whole sock, the back part is just black knit. The back appears somewhat thinned out when on your leg. I guess it’s what makes it breatheable? These socks are pretty long though. I’m 5’4 and they go over my knee. But fall at a slightly awkward angle so I end up folding them down or they just gather behind my knee and cut into my skin. Otherwise I would give them a five. I wish they had more colors."
4.0,Not as fitted as I thought but it's still really cute and sizing is accurate.
4.0,This hat is soft not hard and brittle like most hats of this style. It is very comfortable but runs a little big.
4.0,Selling good quality order again
4.0,"These glasses have metal frames and plastic lenses. They are not polarized, but they do have a grey color to them. They do have a more than adequate amount of sun protection. The lenses are HD for a better view through them. The best part, is that if someone runs off with them or loses them, it wasn't too expensive."
4.0,"A little tight on the head, but seals well around the ears. They appear to be an honest 20-22 NRR. A great value, will order another..."
4.0,They get the job done. Light weight and basic
4.0,Great for yoga!
4.0,A nice little necklace/bracelet that tries to emulate the 7 Chakras.
4.0,"I enjoy that is a classic/ flat design, smooth to the touch. No abrasions or discoloration on the pin itself. I've left it on my jacket, and the pin and clamp have still stayed in place. Solid purchase!!"
4.0,"I purchased this dress for a 70's disco party and I was very impressed by the quality and design of it. FYI as other reviews mentioned; It is on the shorter side, so I would recommend wearing some form of spanx underneath. I am 150 lbs. 5'3"", and ordered a medium. The fit was much looser than expected so I could of ordered a small and it would have fit me better. I bought some black safety pins and cinched it from the back since I have wide hips and didn't want it to look boxy on me. I wore a cute gold belt to accessorize it, and everything came together! Overall a cute affordable dress, and I can get a lot of use from it for future parties."
4.0,Great shirt came really fast fits as expected soft fabric overall happy
4.0,"The leggings feel great, the look good, I love that it has pockets but they were too big. I’m always a size medium but this was actually too loose. The material was also not as tight as I thought it would be. Might see if I can exchange."
4.0,Purchased for my children to wear during screen time … he looks so cute he’s wearing them daily.
4.0,"Kind of tight but they are super cute, my advice to order a size bigger."
4.0,I ordered this for a friend for her granddaughter....she said it arrived much faster then she expected for Christmas and she was thrilled.  It was very nice and for the price was absolutely perfect.
4.0,They are about half size too small. So go up half.
4.0,I want a looser look in the legs.  Maybe I will try a larger size.
4.0,I ordered a large! I am 5’6” and about 220 pounds. It fit really well. It’s a little plain so I bought a $13 belt off of here to wear with it and it looked great! On the shorter side. I wore flats but probably could have got away with short heels. It was very flattering and I got compliments all nights!
4.0,"Loved the way this dress fit! Extremely flattering and a great length. I am 5’10 and dresses always tend to be too short on me, this looked fantastic. I purchased this dress for a upscale concert on a girls night and I received compliments all night...and paid less for my dress than anyone that we met! There was a flaw in the dress in the stitching where the inseam under the zipper was at, but was able to quickly fix it when it arrived and you can’t tell anything was wrong."
4.0,"The pearls is juts fine but the box is not the same that seen in picture, down the quality of the gift"
4.0,"Nice soft fabric. The length of the bottoms is substantial, which I like. The waistband is a little narrow and uncomfortable -- it would be nicer if it was a wider, flatter waistband. The top runs a little narrow through the torso and a little shorter than I’d like. But for the price, these are a good choice."
4.0,"I read the other reviews that said that it runs a size smaller than expected, so I ordered a size larger than I wear and it fits great. I wear it weekly and will probably order more."
4.0,Super cute and comfy. the design makes it hard to walk straight but for toddlers that run and don't care too much about watching their gate this is fine.
4.0,"Happy with earrings except that the backs are push on, they don't twist on or have any grooves for the backs to be secure. I've lost the backs of the earrings taking off sweaters,  hats, etc. Cure earrings buy be careful with loosing the backs. They're not loose but they will come off if you're not carefull."
4.0,"Smaller than expected and not as soft as I’d hoped but cute and does have pockets, which everyone seems to want these days."
4.0,These make great party favors for kids.  My kids play with these all the time.  The batteries seem to last forever.
4.0,Gave this as a gift. It’s well made (for the price) and made a good impression.
4.0,Beautiful purse.  But it sheds little pieces.  Beads don't stay in place.  I'm going to glue them down.  But I love the purse.  Has lots of room too.
4.0,Nice and flowy short in the front  longer in the back
4.0,Definitely costume leggings. Good for 1 night
4.0,"They are 95% cotton and 5% polyester, so comfortable and washable. White stains, yes, but it also bleaches, and it matches pretty much everything. The kids need a lot to wear as the weather very gradually gets cooler."
4.0,"I love this dress and so did everyone at the ball. They were all shocked when I told them it was only $100! It was a little big while standing, but it doesn't have any give to it so even I sat it was a good size. The beading is GORGEOUS! They like to flip around though, so I was flipping them back all night, but that's expected in a dress with this many beads. This is the first dress I wore that I loved and I was comfortable all night! I knocked off a star because it is pretty heavy and the wrinkles from it being folding to fit in the box were practically impossible to get out. I tried the steaming shower multiple times for 45 minutes-an hour each time and nothing. I also tried ironing it. Finally, I had to pay about $30 to get it dry cleaned, even that didn't get all the wrinkles out. Overall though, I really did love this dress and I'm happy with the purchase!"
4.0,Little smaller that I expected but overall nice product.
4.0,It’s a small bag with no pockets. Quality is ok nothing extraordinary or terrible about it.It serves its function but for the price I expected some pockets.
4.0,"It' not thin but thick.<br />Sometime, needles are stop because of pressing between my hand and wrist."
4.0,It was fun for a while to wear but the dangles kept getting caught on something. Then it was no longer fun.
4.0,"This dress runs a little small.  I needed to return my large and order an extra large.  It is a soft, light weight material and is nice for the summer and fall."
4.0,"they are nice a soft and keep my hands warm, but i forgot that they were in my laundry and put the in the dryer it ended up unraveling all the sewing at the bottom part of the hand warmer 0_o"
4.0,"I was so excited to get this lanyard when it arrived! I loved how it looked wide enough to hold all my pins for trading and for display too!!! In addition to this, it would come with a super cute metal Star Wars charm! What avid pin trader wouldn’t love something as awesome as this?!?! :D<br /><br />And then I opened the package.<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, the quality was TOP NOTCH! It’s just... I didn’t quite get what I ordered. Unlike the wide, ribbon like lanyard shown in the product photos, I got a regular (but still very high quality) Star Wars lanyard. My main frustration is that THE VERY SAME LANYARD THAT I ENDED UP WITH COSTED $5 FROM OTHER SELLERS ON AMAZON. It just seems kind of silly to spend extra money on something when I can easily get it cheaper somewhere else.<br /> Aside from the downfall, the the shipping time and handling were great! The product arrived as promised and right when I needed it!<br /><br />Anyways, the main purpose of the review is to warn you:<br />DON’T ALWAYS TRUST PICTURES :D ONLINE!!!!"
4.0,I am 5'6&#34; and 113lbs and I am a 34AA.  This fit perfectly.  It was the correct length.  I do like that it is kind of stretchy so it is comfortable.  I wish it was more straight down but I did know it flared out at the time of purchase.  I choose this because you can wear a normal strapped bra with it and it is covered. I also wanted something with sleeves (even if they are lacy; it is not completely exposed).
4.0,Good rosary for the price.
4.0,I bought this as a Valentine's Day present for my boyfriend and he loves it. It actually looks better in person than online. The only down side is that the blue part is already coming off after a week.
4.0,True to size. They’re very comfortable. They do add slight visual appeal to rear however not as much as expected. I think if I had the extra money I’d buy another pair in a different color.
4.0,Item fits great but isn't as silky as I would have liked.
4.0,Bought these for my nieces for Christmas they loved them and they fit perfect.
4.0,I really like these hats!  Some people said they were too long but I think they are really cute and I’ve gotten numerous compliments on them. Two hats for nine dollars is a great price and the quality is good. I like them a lot!
4.0,Wife just love it
4.0,Pretty sturdy even though at first they seem flimsy. Bought them as backup safety glasses for my son and he loves them
4.0,"Edit 2-25-2022<br />I have several pairs of these which I brought late last spring for summer wear.  As a physician who at one time did sclerotheraoy, I have had a preference for Sigvaris. After many months of use rotating these I must say these are excellent. As best I can tell I am still getting good compression. I know this because I saved one of the pairs keeping it new to compare with those I have been using.<br /><br />Sine of my brand name socks have not held up as well.  Of note, most of the medical FDA approved hose are much thinner. My personal preference is for a heavy sock. Indeed, I usually wear a pair of regular socks over these.<br /><br />When you compare these to 50 to 90 dollar brand name hose, it's a no brainer! Though I dinged them a star for the reason stated below, in all fairness, these are so good that I had to change it to 5 stars. For people with venous insufficiency, price should not prevent you from wearing these. You will feel better that is for sure<br />Original review...<br />I wear graduated 20-30 progressive hose for venous insufficiency even though I have had several sclerotherapy procedures. Most physicians, myself included, would recommend the continued use of graduated compression hose on the 20-30 range. This means that the socks will deliver 20 millimeters of mercury pressure at the ankle increasing to 30 millimeters of mercury at the level of the mid-calf. Like blood pressure, compression is measured in units of millimeters of mercury, mm/hg.<br /><br />I had training in sclero back in the 90s. My go to compression socks have always been Sigvaris brand because they are the best and proven to be efficacious. In particular, they alsohave the most accurate sizing taking into account shoe size in addition to the other measurements for knee high socks, ankle, mid-calf circumstance, and the length of the leg measured from the floor to the bend of the knee.<br /><br />However they are not cheap, nor are the other medical, name brand compression socks. That said, I still recommend them.  Sigvaris makes a heavy sock like this one for athletic purposes...but they too are about 65 dollars.<br /><br />I happened to read a positive review about these and thought I would give them a try.  I was quite pleasently surprised . I really like them. I believe they are giveng me the proper compression I need. If they hold up tfor 3 months, they will be worth it considering that they are 1/6th the price of the name brand socks.<br /><br />They are a couple of caveats. In emails with the company in which I asked some questions for this review, they happened to say that these 20-30 graduated compression socks are FDA approved.  This is important because it means that the socks will deliver the graduated pressure starting at 20 at the ankle through to 30 at the calf. The socks can only receive this designation if they can demonstrate this through specific testing. This is important if you are wearing compression hose for medical reasons such as venous insufficiency or varicose veins whether you have had sclerotherapy or not.<br /><br />I checked the FDA database to see if these socks were approved by the FDA but the FDA could not find them. I wrote to the company about this and to date they have not answered me.<br /><br />In addition, generally, if you are wearing compression socks for medical reasons, they have a finite life after which they will not deliver the specified compression. It is usually said to be around 3 months but it depends largely in part how many pairs you own and how you rotate them...that is if you have 7 pairs and essentially west them once a week, obviously that is a far cry from wearing the same pair daily.<br /><br />In my email, I asked the company about the recommended duration of use and they refused to answer me.<br /><br />My suspicion is that the socks are not FDA approved and for that reason, they cannot say anything regarding medical efficacy or duration of use for a medical indication.<br /><br />I get it. There is a substantial cost associated with obtaining FDA approval which is one of the reasons FDA approved socks cost from 40 to 85 dollars. What ticks me off is that that they did not have to lie to me. My phone number was in my email signature. They could have picked up the phone and told me.<br /><br />Does the lack of FDA approval mean that the socks do not deliver the specified pressure? The answer is no but the company just cannot prove that they do not can they make any medical claims. If you have worn compression socks for awhile, you have a pretty good idea what it feels like. You also know that that over time the socks lose some of their compression which is why they have to be replaced.<br /><br />So, there is a trade off. You can spend 6 times the money for FDA approved socks or you can purchase these and trust your own experience.<br /><br />My guess is that these socks are just fine. I removed a star not because of quality, but because they lied to me unnecessarily and could have been upfront about a subject I understand all too well.<br /><br />My suggestions for using these:<br /><br />If you require this level of compression, you should wash your socks by hand after each use in warm but not hot water. There are specific mild detergents for compression socks that you can find online.  Ivory soap can be used. Do not use bleach or softeners as these will degrade their efficacy. Rinse them until the water is clear. They should not be wrung out or put in the drier.  Just roll them up and squeeze the water out of  them and hang them up to dry.<br /><br />This will help to maintain their elasticity and they  will last longer. It is best to have a number of pairs so you can rotate them since they should be replaced ever 3 to 6 months.  For this price, you can have 7 of them for each day of the week. Buy 8...on the 7th day throw them all in a bucket and wash them by hand. (I like to wash each pair separately every day but I also have socks made by other companies mostly Sigvaris and I use Sigvaris liquid washing solution. You can find the solution here on Amazon. A little goes a long way. A bottle will last you a long time."
4.0,Material not what i expected..... size not flowing like pic
4.0,Super cute but the style/maker runs really-really big - I wish I could exchange it.  :(
4.0,It's like a stretchy material but it's REALLY big so It just looks like a gray potato sack... It's long and wide even though I got a small.
4.0,Very nice and comfortable.  Wish it came with the battery pack.
4.0,"I love these, they look great and are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />They clean easy and months later still look great.<br /><br />I personally can only wear them for a weekend at a time, any longer and the shape does start to irritate me.<br /><br />They are easy to remove and put in. I have also not had any problems with them coming unlatched during wear."
4.0,"The earrings are cute and come in a nice gift box. It is on the small side, so I give it to my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. The price is fair for the quality of  the earrings."
4.0,"looks good for the golfing type, seems to help with my wrist pain good product."
4.0,This jacket is nearly perfect other than the fact that it doesn’t have pockets.
4.0,Wire too thin
4.0,I brought some others that was so fake that I could not believe.<br />This actually looks good and had a nice soft feel. Gave as a gift for my nephew and had not complains
4.0,I was glad to get the watch! I didn’t use it until yesterday (Sunday) for church! I went to set the time and it wouldn’t turn to the time I needed! I turne clockwise and counter clockwise and it didn’t work! I used another watch! Last night I decided to try again and I was able to set the time correctly!  I will keep the watch but I was about to call this morning to send back!
4.0,I like it but the frame was a little smaller than the other Kenneth Cole I have. It did not have the size posted on the site.
4.0,"Quality made, with good price for item."
4.0,Not exactly as shone but still<br />Nice
4.0,Did a little re-tailoring to make it more user friendly.The straps are a bit strange. Very well made however.
4.0,If you are buying it but it one size less for me is to long and big.
4.0,"This is a nice set that unfortunately didn't work out for me. If your natural waist's smallest point sits pretty high up, these might ride up the crotch area too far as the elastic band is not adjustable. Style is pretty and fabric felt nice though, sad to return."
4.0,Had a hard time finding this at department stores so was delighted to be able to order it.
4.0,"A nice pair of socks that come with the ability to be worn with dress shoes… Yet, these have a bit more substance to provide you warmth during the colder months. A warmer, thicker, heavier threaded material does nothing but, add to the quality and comfort.<br /><br />Love the color: The marled charcoal gray and black make these a really great blend of color that is easy to wear with various  dress slacks- black, olive, gray.. we’ve had a spot on match so far!<br /><br />For my husband who wears an 11.5 but, has a real skinny foot- these fit in a size large. There was minimal shrinkage and socks have held up nice so far.. no loose threads or pilling as of yet and socks have held their elasticity. Best part of all, they don’t add extra bulk so, dress shoes still fit comfortably... yay!!<br /><br />For a price point under $15 for five pairs- you truly can’t go wrong.. the only issue some may have, is the brand name printed on the top.. it’s a bit of a nuisance but, not a deal breaker since it’s covered by the pant leg.. but, something to be aware of!<br />I hope this info can help your decision.. feel free to let me know!"
4.0,Very nice quality material. Very cute.
4.0,"It is just a bit smaller than expected. shopping online I can wear a top from a small to a XXL....crazy! I will order one size up, and get more colors. It's nice and lightweight."
4.0,"Cute, colorful, went well with costume"
4.0,I did not expect they are smaller. But overall...they are cute and i like them.
4.0,"You can never have enough socks, and these fit well and are comfortable. They're pretty bright so I'll need to be careful where I wear them, but otherwise very nice."
4.0,I expected it to be larger. The stone is very small.
4.0,"20200116. This is all second hand reporting from my wife. :-)<br /><br />We both like the look of the shoes, but she says they are not too comfortable to walk in, mostly because of the strap across the toes. We ordered two pairs, two different sizes, to allow for strap differences. She decided on the one size up, but even with that, she says the bottom strap hurts her toes if she walks very much. So, nice looking shoe, looks great with leggings, jeans, or a skirt, but you not be doing much walking."
4.0,"This wrap is really cute but it runs a little bit small.  I am 5'1 and about 110 pounds and its even a little snug fitting on me. It does not have velcro adjustment or its not very strechy so it pretty much stays the size it is. It fastens with buttons, not the velcro like I've had in the past so it takes a little more time to fasten all the buttons. It falls under my knees so its fairly long for a towel wrap, but I also am very short. The fabric is soft and comfortable and I am able to wear it for long periods without getting irritated or itchy. I like the white trim around the edges. That tends to make it look really feminine and pretty! I would recommend this to my friends and family as the price is good!!!!!!!"
4.0,"Not bad..  They did the trick and for the short money, I was happy with them."
4.0,Very comfortable shirt.  Ordered more.
4.0,"I have a previously purchased scrunchie band in small that fits perfectly, this band runs a little big and is loose fitting. Pretty color though."
4.0,I purchased these for my daughter's wedding as her colors were this exact match. These are not elegant or look expensive by any means but are well-made and do the job for an occasion or two.  I felt they were pretty with my blue dress and the earrings did not hurt my ears although somewhat large. They are light weight.
4.0,These are very nice frames and worth the money they look thick but in fact they are very light. My husband really likes them Comes in box as well
4.0,It looks very nice and expensive but after you adjusted the band it can just get loose one of a sudden. It dropped from my wrist twice thankfully my watch screen didn’t break.
4.0,"Very very cute suit for my daughter, a very very minimal amount of rear end coverage.  That is why I didn't give it 5 stars...but if you like minimal coverage this is one of the cutest bikinis I have ever seen.."
4.0,"Love the sweater, wish it was a little longer."
4.0,"I LOVE it, but the color sort of faded. I do wash my hands about 25 times a day though and I’ve had it for quite some time."
4.0,It told me to order a size larger because their size system did not go with the US.  My brother is a medium.  It told me to order a large because that is equivalent to a medium in the US.  Brother tried it on and said it was too big for him.
4.0,"I really like these pants. They are so cozy and warm. However, one pair came with the crotch seems coming apart. I had to sew them<br />for my daughter. I ordered one for me and one for her. Mine pair was fine but her's WAS NOT. That was embarrassing as it was a gift. :(<br />I recommend examining upon receipt.<br />But like I said, I love them on."
4.0,Wife says I look like a penguin but I don't care because it adds class to my ride. Cool and comfortable.
4.0,great cover up from pool/jacuzzi to hotel room
4.0,These were a little more snug than I expected but after having them on for a while they were very comfortable.  I spent the day at the beach and they were great for jumping in the waves and then going for a walk.  More coverage than a standard suit.  I can't wait to take them paddle boarding.
4.0,"These are very pretty; could probably make 3 necklaces out of it!  I do question them being pearls however, they look more like dyed shell.  I love pearls & have many strands so that is why I wonder.  But they are pretty nonetheless."
4.0,"fabric is nicer than anticipated, and after initial handwashing & airdry, it is hanging quite njicely and should assist my old-lady, old-fashioned fall wardrobe. So far it seems like good value for the money."
4.0,Nice set of head wraps. It comes with basic colors to get started which works if you are just beginning your collection. They are perfect if you are interested in more length but not thickness. These are quite thin which I mentioned is not bad; It works great if you want a front knot.
4.0,"Lots of usable screws,  just no movement screws"
4.0,"Such a soft feminine touch.  The lace is not scratchy and the closure is correct.  I purchased the next size since it indicated runs a little small.  The fit was perfect.  It allowed me to wear an open-back dress with enough hold without have to wear a strapless bra, which I find to be uncomfortable. Purchased it in another color and I'm glad I did."
4.0,Runs small. Ordered a 2x and it is tight. Normally wear a 1x or xl. A bit see through as well.
4.0,"The mask itself is good, but its difficult to use with the filter in it. The filter always gets twisted up."
4.0,"I just started needing reading glasses, so I wanted a few pairs to keep all over. These were great, and a nice variety of colors."
4.0,"Pretty, as pictured"
4.0,I like the adjustable straps but I don’t think this holds the girls in well.
4.0,i got this for my right daith - but it is for the left. I am able to still get it in on the right with the gems backwards it showing. It would be great to have a guide stating which side it will work on and the option to choose right or left.
4.0,"This is a good bra.  The materials seem light for its design.  The construction is good, and the package was great.  I did not like the give of the fabric, especially on the straps."
4.0,"I had a total ankle replacement about a year and a half ago, so I was interested in trying out magnetic therapy to see if there might be some benefit in reducing some of the residual pain that I'm still experiencing.  I haven't progressed a lot in that area in the past few months, so I feel qualified to report on what I've come to accept as the amount of discomfort that I'll have to live with.<br /><br />Although the bracelet is designed for the wrist it is malleable and I had no problem shaping it to conform to the upper area of my ankle.  In the first few days the benefits were quite recognizable.  Some pain did return, but not to the extent, nor the duration that I had experienced pain in recent months.  I was certainly a skeptic when my use of the therapy bracelet began, but that has changed.  I do believe the bracelet and its magnetic properties have afforded me a recognizable degree of pain relief.<br /><br />I plan to continue wearing my therapy bracelet, which has attracted questions from friends and acquaintances who have noticed I'm wearing it.  My own research into magnetic therapy has led me to understand that the benefits I'm experiencing are not necessarily cumulative, but would be immediately recognizable, and this has been my experience.<br /><br />What do magnets have to do with pain?  Well, all our body systems are apparently effected by magnetic fields.  I have no explanation for the benefits I've noted above, and even if there is a 'placebo effect' taking hold, what does that matter to the beneficiary of pain relief?  I can only testify to my own experience, and that testimony is that magnetic therapy appears to me to be a real phenomena."
4.0,"I bought this monokini for my wife because I wanted her to wear something sexy at the pool. This was definitely a great choice. Note that these run very small. So you get a sense of her measurements she is 5' 8&#34;, 120lbs, and 34C. I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly. The quality of the product is pretty good considering the price. It's not going to be Victoria's Secret quality, but it's not poorly made either. If you manage to get the right size you won't be disappointed."
4.0,"Great, except for Lady the lenses a little big"
4.0,Love the dress just needs to be a little longer
4.0,I love this dress! Fits as expected and looks great!! only thing..it's pretty see-through so need to wear a slip underneath but totally worth it!!
4.0,"Arrived promptly. Colors are slightly more muted than I expected, so I hope they don't fade quickly. I like the design a lot and the plate is good quality aluminum."
4.0,"My daughter wanted something a little extra to go along with prom dress. This did the job ,she was happy all that matters to me..!<br />The first one we received on a Tuesday  was broken but was replaced with no problem and was delivered that Thursday."
4.0,I am happy with this item but I am a 32D and had ALOT of side boob showing so if you are not into that then this may not be for you. It ties around the neck and around the back like a swim suit and the tie around my back had to be re-tied multiple times throughout the day because it came untied
4.0,My eyes are not sore anymore!
4.0,"Nice layered look, the multiple chain design catches the light in different ways so it's very pretty at all angles.  Big enough to be noticed but not overwhelming."
4.0,LOVE THESE NECKLACES
4.0,Liked the shirt and it look.
4.0,We used this for a Halloween costume. It was a little on the small side but for only a couple hours it worked great and the price was terrific.
4.0,"These are attractive cabochon settings, but I had to return the set I ordered because the count was short one of ten settings."
4.0,"After reading the mixed reviews, I was hesitant to buy Bamans Women's Skinny Leg Work Pull-on Slim Stretch Yoga Dress Pants w/Tummy Control, but I'm glad I did. While the material IS on the thin-ish side, the issue w/the pocket outlines (as a few others stated) is probably due to sizing. I usually wear size 2 pants but bought size 4 and there was no problem with the outline of the pockets being noticeable. I bought these as casual dress pants to wear to dinner w/boots, not for yoga/workouts (prefer form-fitting) -these were too long to wear w/heels (reference: 5' 2"" - 115 lbs). I liked them enough to order another pair in a different color."
4.0,Cute &#34;mismatched&#34; Christmas socks from Solmate (Mistletoe).  I bought them for a gift for a friend who loves these socks.
4.0,Cute....especially for the price...but u need double sided tape because your boobs WILL CONSTANTLY FALL OUT! also runs small...typically I wear med...but I ordered xl and it was still almost too small!
4.0,"This got a lot of attention at our Halloween party and people were even even asking to buy it from my son.  The only thing was that I wish the height was adjustable, better suited for kids 10 and under, my son is 15 and 5'9"", but other than that it was a nice touch to his grim reaper costume."
4.0,The legs ride up a bit but they still fit good says hubby.
4.0,Beautiful blouse.  But loose threads everywhere that I've had to fix. & must b VERY CAREFUL not to &#34;catch&#34; on ANYTHING even while wearing.
4.0,"It’s a very tough bag which is great as I’m really hard on my bags! I love all the pockets. The color is as expected, a nice muted gray that goes with anything. My only complaint is that the shoulder strap attaches at two points that are not directly across the bag from one another which makes it twist in an unnatural way and takes away from the clean lines and crisp look of the bag which also takes away from any outfit you may be wearing. It makes it look old and worn out, if that makes any sense."
4.0,Fit exactly as it should and super comfy. I like that it was long enough on the bottom to cover the top of my pants because some shirts seem to ride up a bit too far. My only issue is I wish there were more colors is XXL to buy because I would get them all which is why not 5 stars.
4.0,Looking good no way out look
4.0,great item & price!
4.0,The pendant looks authentic gold.
4.0,"Great fit and my daughter loved it. Was defective after first wear, but seller generously replaced the shoes at no cost. Great deal overall!"
4.0,I wanted it to be darker
4.0,The shoes are very nice but the glitter effect on the black/red shoes are just a bit much for a boy. . . .I decided we could find something that worked better.
4.0,"Based on the standard size measurements on Amazon, a &#34;large&#34; shirt should have fit me well.  However, it is way too large and I will need to return it.  However, having subsequently purchased a size &#34;medium&#34; I can say the product is exactly what I've been looking for in a long sleeve golf shirt to wear most of the time in Florida weather.  Except for the misleading size problem, I would have selected five stars.  If I have any problems returning this &#34;large&#34; size, I would amend my assessment to one star."
4.0,Perfect size and feels durable so far and doesn’t have a plastic smell
4.0,"This was a lovely dress, just did not like the lining."
4.0,"I purchased this to replace the rubber strap on my new Tag Heuer Formula 1, because even when fastened on the last hole the Tag strap was too large for my wrist.  This strap, because it is silicone and not rubber, is quite supple and feels great on my wrist.  The fliplock clasp has a few microadjustment holes, so I was able to get this strap to fit perfectly.  Be sure to cut the strap one space at a time so you don't accidentally cut it too short, and leave it longer on the 12 o'clock side.  I am giving it four stars only because the fliplock deployant clasp feels a bit flimsy, even though it has held up so far.  I really like that style clasp in combination with the silicone, versus the regular tang style fastener.  For those of you seeking a good replacement strap, I recommend it."
4.0,"I took a chance on this gown since it was listed for a really good price ($35), and I'm a performer on a budget. The dress is really pretty and good quality, as expected for Papell. The sizing is just as I expected (ordered a 6, got a 6, need to hem the length since I'm 5'4"").<br />However, it did have some minimal cosmetic damage - some pilling in the fabric, loose threads, etc. - but for the price, nothing a good pair of scissors can't fix. Another con: it holds on to odor, so if you sweat at all in your gown, be prepared to dry clean it often!<br />Also, for info's sake, my dress came stuffed in a bag and was super wrinkly on arrival. The fabric is definitely prone to wrinkle. Again, easy fix - just used my garment steamer.<br />Overall, 4.5 out of 5, with half a star off for the minimal damage in the fabric."
4.0,Excellent quality watch for out door and looks good also.<br />loved it.
4.0,"My husband loves watches so I thought of getting him something inexpensive yet stylish watch for day to day use.<br /><br />This watch fits the bill. The silver color and the minimalist design look elegant. This is his first time to wear one with mesh strap so it’s an adjustment. I also like the slim face. Be aware though that it’s only slim on the face section but at the back, it isn’t. It doesn’t really bother my husband but for some, it may be a big deal. It’s water resistant (not waterproof!). Although this watch is very lightweight, it’s stainless steel.<br /><br />If I were to critic this watch, I would ease on the branding. It’s got the Julius brand on the clasp, on the face and a J initial on the long hand. Overkill I think. But it’s not too obvious unless you look too closely.<br /><br />I received this watch at a discount for review purposes. This is my honest and unbiased opinion after testing the product."
4.0,I love these mask so much that I ordered a second set. Very Comfortable.
4.0,Looks expensive. Nice size watch that's easy to read. Watch band is so-so.
4.0,Great price and super cute. One of the 3 necklace stone fell off. Otherwise as described.
4.0,I absolutely love this ring. It is perfect weight and thickness. It is made very well. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the color has started changing looking more tarnished. Even so I’ve gotten several compliments on it.<br />Also be aware is can and will get caught on items easily.
4.0,Great product I would give them 5 stars but they shorted me one bra I never got my gray one and I paid for 5 Bras And only got 4.
4.0,"The sound quality of the speakers i pretty good.  The volume is not too high to be noticeable by others unless they are close to you.  To hear the speakers well, the hat needs to be directly over your ears.  I do have to wear the hat a litter lower on my head than with another hat, which causes the front and back of the hat to be lower on my forehead and back of neck as well.  Other than those fit issues, I think the hat is really good.  It is a warm winter hat.  I have other hats that let more cold air in when it is windy out, but this keeps your head warm on days that are 0 degrees F.  I have worn the hat about ten times so far.  No issues with keeping the charge over a long walk in the cold."
4.0,"Love the colors etc., Fabric is thin, thin, thin.  Wish I could buy a shirt with fabric.  If you don't have any concern about your midrift, etc., it a wonderful fitting shirt.  Go for it."
4.0,Great pjs especially for those who are want to be warm.
4.0,"Exactly what you’d expect for the same priced best at a Gap. Not great, but certainly not bad."
4.0,As advertised.  Could not be any happier with the quality and look of each pin
4.0,It’s so freaking soft! Comfy for sure. I bought the XL even though I normally buy L tips and sweaters. I think I could of gotten away with this but the length isn’t that long and I’m only 5’1. I still really adore this cute sweater though.
4.0,"The heather gray is a dark gray color with the sexy look. The high waist is on trend for 2021 and the length is longer than shorts. The build quality is okay, I'm not sure how long it will last compared to more expensive brands but that's why these are so inexpensive I guess."
4.0,I ordered this a while ago originally I wanted to return it because it’s slightly big but it works. I just wore it for the first time today and again it’s OK it is big I could’ve went down a size smaller but I don’t believe they had a size smaller at the time of me ordering I originally ordered for an occasion and they ended up changing the theme of the occasion so I never wore it I wore today and today is Christmas.
4.0,I got the red and white hat and I love it but it fits tight. Where the fur meets the inside of the hat is very tight. Once you get past that then the hat fits fine. Put elastic in it. Slot of reviews complain of the same problem.
4.0,soft and comfy just fit was a bit too small for me.
4.0,"Very sturdy construction and clarity in the lens, too. Will buy again for Christmas gifts. I would recommend this pair of sunglasses"
4.0,Length to my knees. Fits shoulders but runs a little small.
4.0,I love the way it looks it looks so fine dos't look cheap i gave it 4 star only because it didn't com with a certificate.
4.0,Color exactly as pictured and sizing is accurate.  Just a little shorter than I prefer.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the keyboard after reading some negative reviews. The fit to my tab 3 is perfect, the keys are tactile and responsive as any keyboard on my laptop or desktop computers. Functions as a stand for the tablet and a protective case. Have charged the keyboard once in the 2 months I have used it. Wish it had a delete key, but it is for an android device, so....<br />The tablet is everything it was advertised to be. Nice size and weight, display is as good as my HDTV, meets all my needs for a lightweight device for extensive travel. Battery life is more than the advertised hours, so far. No functionality complaints at all... I would like the charging port on the side so it can be charged while sitting on the keyboard/stand..."
4.0,"My only complaint is that they werent the right color, was supposed to be lake blue, not teal"
4.0,"Bought a pair for myself and when I saw how nice they were and the free shipping, I bought another pair for a friend of my mom's who thought that they were real.  They are unusual due to the round shape and the lack of a setting, but they rest on the earlobe or in a cartilage piercing nicely!"
4.0,fit well. good price.
4.0,Runs small at least a size or size and 1/2.  At least...compared to O'Neill.  Appears to be fine other than that.
4.0,a little too long perfect for a wedding
4.0,"Love the shirt but from past experience, I got an XL instead of a L. It’s still a more snug fit than I prefer. Unless you like form fitting t’s, consider going up a few sizes."
4.0,Happy with the dress and hat.  Disappointed as I did not realize it was being shipped from China therefore unhappy with how long it took to ship.
4.0,Liked it cute and fit my girls nicely there size 6/6 and 7/8. Only thing k didn't like was no size on the item
4.0,Came quickly and as pictured.  Fits well and is cute while functional.
4.0,Beautiful.  Much smaller than picture.  Would have liked metal backs rather than plastic.  Lost one back before I realized what the were.
4.0,Cute but did not fit me well. Also it’s see through
4.0,Runs a little small. Get a size larger likely.
4.0,"Very nice, and plush"
4.0,"I bought a costume with a headpiece, but wasn't happy how it looked so I purchased this one. It was amazing looking and I got a ton of compliments at a Halloween party. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was that is was warm under it. When I took it off after 5 hours my hair was very damp! In fact sweat was dripping down my neck after 4 hours."
4.0,Love the hat except little tight on head. Needs to be bigger.
4.0,I like the feel of this product. It was cut a little low for me n a little short.  But over all I loved it. I was on zoom so I was on with it.
4.0,"Good feel. Breathable, decent odor resistance. Not very durable though, a few of these socks have holes in the toes after only ~4 months."
4.0,We both got unknowingly for each other watches for our anniversary. I'd have given 5 stars if my picture was a bit more centered but over all it was a great gift and he loves it.  I tell him he can think about me all the time now.
4.0,My daughter waited months for this to finally come back in stock. Had to jump on it. Standard Pokemon hat. Good build.
4.0,Good product. Sizing is alittle smaller than expected.
4.0,This dress is beautiful! the only complaint I have is the top is see-through so I would recommend a nude bra but other than that I ordered a small I'm 5'1 and the length is perfect which Is a miracle! material is nice and I could wear this pregnant or not !
4.0,I like the style of the glasses. I don't like how the arms of the glasses are loose
4.0,"What can you say about great socks?  Ask this seller, they provided a top-quality pair of socks.  The only draw back is that they were more expensive than what I would expect for his item."
4.0,"I really like this product. It fits very nicely. I am a size 16 in dresses, I ordered am X-Large and it fit. It was not too short, a little above the knee. The material is nice its not transparent at all."
4.0,Had to return... not that there was anything wrong with the quality I just need a larger size
4.0,"Ordered the x small.  I am 5'2 and this dress is too long. Would need to wear 3-4 inch heels to make this fit. Also,  I am a 34B and it is slightly tight on the top even without a bra.<br />Other than the length, its a nice dress.  Wash and wearable.  No ironing needed."
4.0,"So, let’s be honest about this dress. First of all, it’s absolutely a beautiful design. If you’ve ever wanted a bodycon/form fitting dress, get this. However, my one complaint would be that it tends to bunch up a lot. Doesn’t matter how thin you are. It likes to scrunch up when you move. I anticipate that I’d have to be fixing it constantly throughout the time wearing it. I’ve decided I want to wear it with a white skirt so I’ve included pictures with one of my own skirts that I already have to get an idea on what that would look like. All in all, for the price you pay, I’m super happy. I’m 5’2” and around 112 lbs and ordered the XS"
4.0,"This fit as expected, but it's long!  Or... I'm short.  It fits me like a dress.  BTW  I'm 5'2&#34;.  Nice colors and looks good on."
4.0,sleeves are too long.
4.0,Looks great! Just a bit smaller than i expected.
4.0,"Unfortunately, the dress I received was coming apart at the seams so I had to return it but it was beautiful when I tried it on."
4.0,"They are absolutely beautiful, glittering gorgeousness but they are a bit too heavy. If you want them to use for a few hours or so they will work but if they are worn for long periods and/or often they will stretch out your ears. I would order them again though, but to be used in craft or jewelry projects."
4.0,"Love the dress!!! Only thing i don't like is how low the pockets are. I am 5'4 and barley past my feet when standing. So i would mention on the page not for tall women, unless they don't want it to be a maxi on them. I got so many compliments."
4.0,"I can't put them in the dryer because they shrink. I love all the colors, they feel soft and they have matching wrist bands so I am coordinated on the courts. I just air dry them. My friends sing &#34;Let's get physical&#34; by Olivia Newton John when ever they see me, so be prepared for a bit of a throwback feel. They do the job of keeping my hair and sweat out of my eyes when I play tennis so I recommend these head bands."
4.0,"Nice pants, decent material, but they're really long. I'm 5'3 and they're almost as long as I am tall."
4.0,Got this on a deal for like 10 bucks. Would not pay much more than that for it. But it fits good and the length is nice and so are the pockets. Oh and it is really soft.
4.0,"This is actually a really good find! I bought it to go under my daughters costume for a little extra warmth and it was perfect. The scoop is a little low for a toddler (in my opinion ) and it is VERY see through, but it is durable and well sewn. The size is pretty spot on, however it was a little long in the legs... Nothing too terrible, but I just wanted to make note of it in case someone needed to know.<br />I think I will order a couple more in different colors just because they are so well made and she loved how comfortable it was."
4.0,It's a bit more snug that I thought it would be (I wear a 6.5 or a 7) but otherwise I like it.
4.0,"Nice, clean and light to go casual or a bit dressed up."
4.0,I also thought there were different design only received the bezel set x3
4.0,The cap was great and it fit well. The shipping was a little late though
4.0,"The argyle pattern on these socks has been achieved by sewing the diamond pieces together.  Since these are compression socks, that means that you will end up with a very well defined cross hatch pattern on your calves after you take the socks off.<br />They wear fantastic and are very comfortable in spite of the leg decorations.  The vibrant pattern has garnered compliments every time they are worn."
4.0,"Nephew loves them, nice fit"
4.0,"These pants are super cute but I think I just ordered the wrong size. I am 5'6 usually sized 10-12 in pants, so I ordered a Medium because the Large said 12-14 and that sounded too big. The pants fit, they're just a little too snug for work. I really like the style and the color. I wanted to wear them to the office but they're a little too tight for that. Super cute though! I will probably wear them out with friends instead."
4.0,I really like the color of the shoes!
4.0,This socks runs small. Get a larger size.
4.0,Fits nicely. Was tighter around my chest then I would have liked and I'm not even a big girl. I usually wear a small or size 6 in dresses and had to order a large. A button slit was also missing so I have to cut one in. Weird! But the dress did look nice on me.
4.0,I don’t like skimpy bikinis for my little girl but she really likes the 2 piece so we compromise.  This suit ran a little small on my almost 7 yr old.  I ordered normal size but she said the chest area was tight and the bottoms cut into her thigh.  We sized up and she like it.  The straps for the top are adjustable.
4.0,"nice quality, looks good, stays in ears. would buy again"
4.0,"I like a small slim wallet and this design looked great in theory. I have cut my card stash down to seven with a few very thin card-sized items, but for me the issue was that it was too difficult to fold banknotes (bills) into thirds and stuff them into the side cash pocket. The cash pocket is soft fabric and it yields when you try to insert more than a few bills. Two hands were needed to get the money in. That was a concern because fumbling and hesitating when putting money away is not a good idea.<br /><br />I tried flipping the recommended directions using the center section for cash, but the side cash pocket is a few millimeters too small for cards, making it tricky to close the zipper. What a shame because it looks and feels great. If only that cash pocket had been stiff leather instead of thin fabric.<br /><br />Because it was such a lovely item I will try the Bellroy Slim Sleeve, but I will seek it out in a store so I don't waste shipping etc."
4.0,Quality is ok. Because of the seam in the middle front I wouldn't recommend it as a wear alone. Worked fine for Halloween costume with shorts over.
4.0,Instead of reading I love you Mom it read Liove you mom. Didn't notice it until now.
4.0,Wish I could figure out how to use it.
4.0,"This is a really beautiful dress, but it is somewhat lacking in quality.  I have worn and washed it three times and it literally feels like it's about to fall apart.  Super thin fabric, may last you a season."
4.0,Bought for my niece. Loved the look but it needs a underskirt. It definitely looks like a costume
4.0,"I wouldn't say highest quality, but these are certainly comfy! I don't like the way they ride up, but I don't know that I've ever had softer sleepwear. They fit fine, they were just what I was looking for in sleep shorts!"
4.0,My 2nd pair.<br />Good boot but heavy .
4.0,"Very happy with this dress. It fit true to size, maybe a tiny bit on the tight end. The fabric is breathable but on the thicker side, which was good to help it hold its shape. And of course the best part is the pockets =)"
4.0,This item is adorable--as attractive as the Disney Tiara and it matches the 2012 Ariel costume perfectly. I didn't have the time or the courage to hit the Times Square Disney store (my local Disney) and I ordered this with Prime shipping. I am so happy I took a chance on it; I couldn't be more pleased.
4.0,The holders are not strong enough. They fall down.
4.0,"Good Product, not as snug as I would have preferred."
4.0,"Removable pads are somewhat awkward looking.  Otherwise, its a great sports bra."
4.0,Loose when worn but cannot be adjusted no matter how i tried. But other than that i like it.
4.0,This really kept my head warmer while out snowboarding but it never stayed in places and stretech out so much
4.0,Way longer than in picture and I got a large and it fits like a xlarge. Fits more like a muu muu than a tunic. They also offered to refund my money if I gave them more stars. lol
4.0,The hat was way bigger and wider than expected. I bought it for my husband and we might just end up giving it away.
4.0,"So far so good. Writing hasn't rubbed off or anything, will update if it changes."
4.0,They are easy to use and made sturdy.
4.0,"I love the color! Too small, will order the larger purses!"
4.0,"I ordered a large shirt for my cross country runner built slim framed husband.  It fit pretty well.  If anyone is unsure if they should  size up they probably should. I will say the shirt fits close to the body and that is why I chose it.  It is a very thin breathable material so it works for the hot humid southern climate.  good for outdoor activities, but would not suggest for much more."
4.0,Too small in the picture looks bigger.  But it is nice
4.0,"These glasses are awesome!  And the only reason for the 4 stars is that beware these are NOT Prime eligible. You will get them when you get them. Are they worth the wait- sure but if you need something as advertised, shop somewhere else. I was disappointed that both times I ordered I had to wait for a delivery date and both times were in excess of a week."
4.0,"Nice light material so bundle up if you live in the colder areas. My daughter is 5’2”, it fit perfectly."
4.0,"if you've got a Brazilian body and &#34;booty&#34;, it is probably not recommended unless you want to feel like you're almost wearing a thong. The &#34;v&#34; cut in the back is also really low so your booty somewhat will be exposed. It is a very cute bikini bottom though."
4.0,The chain is beautiful and looks like it will be quite sturdy. Totally love it!
4.0,It's cute. The fabric is thin and a bit sheer so I don't think I will wear it in the summer. I will probably wear leggings and a sweater with it in the winter. I'm 5'4 and weigh 135. I ordered a small.
4.0,"Fits well, very glad I finally found one that fits me without cutting off circulation."
4.0,"This dress is wonderful! The V neck in the front isn't super low, so going sans a bra (if you prefer) is comfortable and covered. The dress material is  very cool against your skin. In that heat we've had here lately that was very very welcome! I'm 5'5 and ordered and XL and the length is perfect. It hits right above my ankle so if I wear flip flops or sandals I'm not stepping on the front of the dress. It is cut slightly shorter in the front than in the back and I think they did that on purpose. The dress is roomy front to back and side to side. I typically order a size larger than what I think I would fit b/c I don't like the tight feeling around my chest. This dress is a perfect fit all around. It has pockets!!!! They aren't very deep, but very comfortable for a hand rest. I haven't tested out if a key or other items wold stay in there but I think small items would. The only reason I gave this dress 4 stars instead of 5 is because the seam in the front is very strange. In the stock photos you can see on some of the dresses but not others. There is a seam right up the front. Not a deal breaker but it's just very strange there would be a seam in the front and not the back? This makes the dots not line up at all. Probably just being overly picky but if you have a seam, why not put it in the back? I get there are seams on the sides, and there are pockets, but the back piece is solid and the front is the one that's cut with a seam. I don't understand. Again, not a deal breaker just something I noticed and thought very easily could have been switched to the other side. All in all you will love this dress. It's perfect for being outside in the garden, running to the store, or throwing on some jewelry and going out to a restaurant or gathering."
4.0,"Nice fabric, comfortable and can be styled in multiple ways."
4.0,"I love this dress and I love the colors. It's a very soft material, which I like. But I have a hard time believing this is a large. The waistband is VERY tight and constricting. Like no way this is an adult womens large. I think it would fit a middle schooler better than any over the age of 15.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I depend heavily on reviews when I buy something from Amazon or any website, so I'd like to help others with my honest review when they consider buying something."
4.0,"I haven't worn this top yet and will update if anything comes up, but after receiving and trying it on, I'm happy with my purchase. I was worried about sizing issues after reading other reviews, but I heeded the warnings about a small fit and ordered up to a large (I usually wear a medium in tops), and it fits great, though if you want it to fit a little loosely, I'd recommend going two sizes up. It also is a nice, long length, which I also was concerned about after reading reviews saying it was too short. The fabric also seems like good quality. As long as this wears and washes well, I'll be very pleased, and will update to five stars! It's super cute!"
4.0,"Comfortable, and well made. Could be a bit larger for me, but otherwise very nice."
4.0,Showed up on time and look great on my wife.
4.0,Like these onyx earrings a lot.
4.0,I love the colors of this dress. There ruffle top with spaghetti straps are great. Even the draw string waist. What isn’t so fun is that it’s not too forgiving if you’ve had a big lunch.<br />I’m 5’4” 115lb bust 34C
4.0,"Super cute! Pretty good quality, I would just order a size up. I got my normal size and it looked like it was meant for a toddler... these are pretty high-wasted but very flattering!"
4.0,great ecCelt the neck opening is too lare
4.0,"It fits just a tiny bit snug on my skinny boyfriend. Def get at least a size up, 2 if u want it baggy at all.<br />It's decent for the price but def not as nice as a designer hoodie. Also not as fitted as something you would pay full price for. But overall was what I expected and my boyfriend wears it all the Time"
4.0,The dress so beautiful just like the photo but the large looks likd medium this is the only think i dont like i wish i irderd xl but beautiful dress any way
4.0,"Looks as expected, quality shirt"
4.0,Too small for an adult male.
4.0,The skirt is good to go. Above average quality can wear all year round! Sizing is good; not cut small
4.0,"I have three boys ages 2, 6 and 7. These bows fit each of them!! They are cheaper made yes, however for the price you can't beat it. As a mom of four buying outfits can cost alot especially for those special occasions. I can add these to a cute button up and have a great outfit using the clothes they already have. I love them and so so they!!"
4.0,Bought for the beach and they worked great!
4.0,"These are really well made and comfortable! I have a slight issue with them though. I bought these for my hospital stay while I delivered my son in a few weeks and as i was them around the house I’m noticing they are too loose and it makes it a little hard to walk. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to roll my ankle, which isn’t something an 8mo pregnant soon to be Mom wants to have to worry about. Other than the unstableness, they are really are nice to wear while just lounging around. Very soft"
4.0,Love it!! Very soft and comfy and the print is great!!
4.0,Esta muy bello y de buena calidad a mi nieta le encanto pero la talla es mayor que la pedida
4.0,"I ordered the khaki color and it looks like a baby yellow. Still cute but not the color I thought I was purchasing. The sweater is oversized, but looks great with leggings and styled off the shoulder."
4.0,"It is a good quality hoodie, but know what you're getting. It has a slick outside feel, that can snag easily. The inside is very soft & even though it's pretty thin it is quite warm. The hood is huge & the strings are very long. The print is perfect though. I followed others suggestions & got a size bigger for my daughter & I shouldn't have. She likes her hoodies baggy but she is drowning in this one. The sleeves are almost 6"" too long. At 5'1"" & 100 lbs the large fits her like a U.S. men's large! She is an XS-S in normal women's clothing, & prefers a M (sometimes L) for hoodies & that would have been plenty big enough for sure. For the price, I would repurchase in a smaller size."
4.0,There is not a registration card nor a felt bag to keep it in when not in use. All my other designer purses came with the registration cards and the felt bags. I feel like I was cheated for the price I paid.
4.0,I loved the outfit. packaging and shipping was great as always. only thing i had problems with were the suspenders. they were too big and my son is short i had to pin it in the back so they wouldnt fall. it wasnt a huge deal. Everything else fit just perfectly.
4.0,"This is a very lightweight, adorable dress. I plan on wearing this dress in the carribean for the night life. I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 140 pounds and the dress touches my knees. In the photo it shows a shorter dress (hitting above the thighs). The dress ties in the back and you may need someone to tie it for you. I tied mine and it just did not look right in the back.  Even when the dress is tied as tight as it will go around the neck, It was only 3 inches above my knees. Very different from the photo. If you are a seamstress, you could hem it higher for yourself. If you take it to a seamstress, it would cost $10 to have it hemmed. You cannot wear a bra with this dress without the bra showing. If you are in your 20's and have never had children, you could wear the 'stick on' bra. But, if you need to wear a bra, this is not the dress for you."
4.0,"Very good watch for the money. My only dislike is that the big second hand does not function like a normal watch. it is actually the indicator for the chronograph function. the second hand is actually the small window at the six o'clock position. other than that, the quality is great. I was happily surprised the watch band was actual leather and not that fake stuff. I feel this will be a good daily watch that will keep accurate time. I think this is the nicest looking watch timex makes and is a great value for the price. One cool think this has that more expensive ones have is the indiglow. not having bought i timex in years, missed that great feature."
4.0,I didn't like the sleeves they were too short and not as fluffy like picture they were flimsy didn't stand out like bell sleeves
4.0,Daughter was very happy with it that's all that mattered.
4.0,"Works for most people, but for really deep sleepers...mine took it off, threw it and went back to sleep. I will say it took the landing well."
4.0,"It's well made and the material feels nice. I wore it to work with a suit jacket and it looked presentable. I can also picture myself wearing out with dressy sandals. My only qualm with it is that the top is little loose. I had to be careful so my bra wouldn't show. However, I think it's just because I have a small chest. Someone with bigger breast should not have the same issue. For reference I'm 5'5 about 140 lbs and a 34/36 B"
4.0,Me quedo lindo me gusta diceno. Porque es suave
4.0,Super cute shoe. My daughter loved it. Decently priced considering where we live.
4.0,Fits a little short.
4.0,"beautiful sandals/ flip-flops. very slim, run a bit small, but luckily, i don't mind the snug fit.<br /><br />excellent arch support: easily the most impressive i've ever experienced, and seriously, believe me, i wear sandals all year round, every year since the mid '90s... i know my sandals, these are really, really comfortable.<br /><br />if you have ""fat"" feet, they might not be so comfortable."
4.0,"I was surprised how soft this dress is. The color has more black/gray than in the photo and less peachy. The dress hangs nicely and it seems sewn well. I am 5'3"" and it comes above my knee."
4.0,"I have several of these and having worn and washed them repeatedly, I can say that they are great. They do take a while to dry (I wash them on Permapress cycle then line dry) because of the cotton content and sturdy fabric. The zippers will irritate if you cross your legs while seated and there is pressure on that spot, but otherwise they're just decorative-- turning a standard item into something with a bit of style. Husband says they're nice looking, too."
4.0,Technically  It's a girdle for men lol
4.0,"The structure, pattern, nose wire, and adjustable straps are great! I have a very small face and found these masks as a suggestion, but these are the same size as most other masks. The adjustable straps help, but those can start to irritate behind the ears. Still looking for an alternative for small faces, but if your face is normal these are great!! The delivery was very fast as well."
4.0,"Ordered neon green and received yellow. The sweatshirt was made good, aside from receiving wrong color no issues with it."
4.0,"These glasses do work well for keeping the wind out of my eyes, however, I do wish that they were a little larger. They are a bit to narrow for me, but they do work well, so I can't complain at all. For the money, you can't go wrong."
4.0,"The color is just as it appeared on my computer screen. I fit all my cards in the larger zipper opening and use the side zipper for cash. I love having my keys, cards and cash all in one place. This replaces a similar purse I've had for years which was falling apart!"
4.0,"These aren't shoes as the review questions suggest, but I liked the product."
4.0,So cute with compartments.  Now feel secure that important belongings are on my person when at work.
4.0,New wallets do not come with enough card holders.  This worked perfect for his bi fold wallet.
4.0,"These shirts are advertised as 100% cotton. The ones we received were 80% cotton 20% polyester. Aside from that, they are comfortable shirts that fit well. Great for every day casual wear."
4.0,"It’s a little on the small side, but my daughter loves it anyway."
4.0,Fit grea
4.0,Good fit in the front and legs. Kinda tight on the rear. Beware if you have more than a flat booty.
4.0,Bien. Un poco fina la tela
4.0,Came late. They are a bit small than the picture
4.0,"I didn't realize how small these earrings would be. They are meant to be baby size studs, good thing I have small ear lobes."
4.0,Zipper is in the back. Diaper changes and bathroom visits not so easy.
4.0,"very large, can fit a lot of things but just slight errors in sizes ."
4.0,Very long on my long torso and high cut. So hard to find. Great color . Only problem is the back side of the straps won't lay flat
4.0,It's nice outside of the thin material.
4.0,"Love that it fits my phone but is not big and bulky.  However I wish there were credit card slots instead of putting ID, debit, credit, etc all in one pocket and having to sift through them."
4.0,"Good, fun shades. Band is tight so if you've got a big head like those that run in my family...it'll give you a headache after about 20 minutes wearing. Also previous posts mentioned that they are slightly crooked and I found that to be true. I ordered a pair for my daughter and myself...both were slightly crooked tilting slightly up on the left side and both a bit too snug for long periods of wearing. One last note...they catch reflection on the inside bottom of the shade so that is a bit distracting. Otherwise very good at blocking the rays. Still fun to wear!"
4.0,Solid product for the money!
4.0,"Cute, comfortable but run small"
4.0,"The dress itself is simple and lovely. I’ve ordered multiple dresses from this designer in the same size, but this particular dress was loose on me; most especially in the arms. The length is perfect. I will be having it altered."
4.0,liked it !!
4.0,Thinner than I expected but I guess they're surly worth the price. They just appear a little wider in the photo.
4.0,it was good it doesnt stick well after a few wears
4.0,"I bought this for when I gave birth I’d have something nice to get into after but it did run a little small do I would order up , not that I lost some weight it fits."
4.0,"The colors were vibrant and the fabric was great. I ordered a size bigger because I figured it ran small. It was still too tight. The next size up was a little big, but not noticeably so"
4.0,"I'm so sad this was too small! I'm 5'8 and wear a size 10 pants, but the slip under the skirt didn't cover my bum at all. The skirt is ridiculously soft though, I was quite surprised. If they sold it in a different size I'd buy it again, but I can't keep something that doesn't fit."
4.0,"I have been a part of the itty bitty titty committee for as long as I can remember and these bras fit like a dream! One thing to note is I did order a 30A and they will ship you a 32A. I guess it's just manufacturers' sizes? but it still fits!  I didn't think it being wireless would create a lift but it does! I love that it is adjustable in three forms - front lace, straps and comes with expanders for the bands.<br /><br />Only a few reasons why I gave it a 4 out of 5 ratings.<br />1) as someone else mentioned the cups are pretty high and will show through a low shirt. the lowest you probably could go is a regular cami or tank top. But not a huge deal to me!<br />2) I wish I could mix and match the patterns/colors of the bras - I would totally buy more if it was the case. But that is me being nit-picky :P Or even buy individual ones too!<br /><br />BUT over a HUGE win for the itty bitty titty committee! Defentially would be a good day-to-day bra!"
4.0,"Really love The North Face Clothing but this jacket runs a little small. I would order a size up next time and it’s really thin-kinda like plastic on your skin when it’s raining? No lining , but overall it’s ok! Looks really good and stylish."
4.0,"Although the product arrived defective, the seller was very considerate and efficient in finding a solution for the problem. I am satisfied."
4.0,good quality-------- a little large- long
4.0,"This is a good looking watch. This is everything that you would expect out of a sub $20 dollar watch. It is easy to set the time and date if needed.<br />What was amazing is this watch was already set to the correct date and time when it arrived. I am not sure if this was intentional, or they had just set them all to the date and EST time..<br /><br />The watch does have some weight to it, however becareful when you read the description that is says &#34;Citzen&#34; not &#34;Citizen&#34; movement.<br /><br />I am not sure how long this lasts, but it is a good for the price and you will get some compliments on this watch."
4.0,"This dress was exactly what I was expecting! I'm 5'5&#34;, 120lbs and got a size small. It fits perfectly and looks super cute! I got several compliments when I wore it to work."
4.0,This necklace is very versatile...wear it with jeans and a tee or with a dressy blouse.  The quality is definitely Brighton!
4.0,Wife has only used for a short time. She has a problem seeing while driving at night and the glasses helped her more in the daytime than at night. Still glad we bought them.
4.0,"work as intended.  a lil more give than maybe i expected due to the extra elastic, but work nicely."
4.0,The dress I ordered was a bit larger than I had expect. Thankfully I knew someone it would fit and she loved it! I received this product at discount for an honest review
4.0,Like the fabric and drape. Fit was a bit too large for my liking.
4.0,Plus size momma over here and these are giving me LIFE!!<br />My only complaint is that the pads get tangled in the wash!
4.0,"Very comfortable, wish it had pockets"
4.0,Writing is small but overall I like them. Glad I didn't rely on the bad reviews. The fit is perfect
4.0,"Strong, great material, you may need to stuff it to keep the shape. Colour is OK"
4.0,"I would purchase this item again. Needed goggles for my vacation to Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. I wear contacts and need to protect them from the salt water and from any waves that may crash over my head. These goggles worked perfectly. I wore them daily (for 2 weeks) for about 3 hours a day. Not once did they leak. I have never bought goggles that worked so well. They fit well and did not slide around on my face. I was able to see very clearly with them which was nice. I did cut off the ear plug piece, as I didn't need them.<br /><br />My only complaint, and why I took away one star, is the anti fog wasn't as good as I had hoped. I had no fogging the first three full days. On the fourth day I started to have minimal fogging. I was still able to comfortably see through the fog so I was able to continue wearing the goggles the rest of my vacation.<br /><br />Overall I was very pleased with my purchase and would recommend them to friends and family."
4.0,Nice little pin for the price. I gave to my little violin student.
4.0,Cannot give a review as they did not fit my glasses. Returned to Amazon.
4.0,"Pricey, but definitely does what they are advertised to do. Very light weight construction and would recommend you use the included hard case to transport. Recommended."
4.0,Better larger than expected than too small. I'm a queen at alternating. I'm a SIZE  14 bust DD. Fits more like a 16. I like though.
4.0,"This hat is very cute and stylish and good quality.  It didn't fit my head, though (my head is 23.5 inches around).  It will fit a small head, because it has an adjustable strap on the inside to tighten it.  But if you have a big head, you'll want to pass on this one.  I gave it to my sister-in-law who has a hard time finding hats small enough to fit her."
4.0,Delivered ahead of schedule...thanks.  Pretty.
4.0,"Hugs curves, wish company offered a jacket to hide imperfect waist in a coordinating color"
4.0,This outfit is super cute. It’s a little cheaply made but super adorable.
4.0,What a great deal for 4 pairs of stockings. I wiish they had rubber on the top of the stockings so they would stay up without having to use a garter belt. These stockings are durable and good quality and I have already told a few friends about them for purchase.
4.0,The color red is a bit off. Not the brilliant red so I wear simple black suit and white shirt.
4.0,They are a little thicker than ones I have had before. They still work fine.
4.0,Very nice ring. The fit was exact and the color is perfect.
4.0,"It was a lot bigger than I expected.  It will hold a lot when I travel, including a book."
4.0,These shoes are comfortable and pretty. But you must size up. Don't really like the material on the top. I live in Florida and they are warm for summer. Will wear to church.
4.0,The product is nice.
4.0,Pretty happy with my purchase. Love the color. I do think they may fit a bit smaller than normal sweatbands tho.
4.0,Nice and roomy and deep..
4.0,"These are great sweatshirts, they run a little large fitting  no big deal."
4.0,Cute hat. Took a very long time to get to me.
4.0,"Dress is a great dress to run errands or use as a coverup. Thick material and fit perfectly. For the price it’s a great dress. Fabric is very thick it’s not see through at all. For reference,  I’m a size 4/6 bust 34c and 27 inch waist. I bought a small and was very happy with fit."
4.0,"These look the same as in the picture, but they are very lightweight and not high quality. They also aren't very expensive, so you get what you pay for. They look ok but doubt they'll last long."
4.0,"it worked perfect because I ordered larger size based on previous experience.  I'm 8-10 US size and sometimes 6 US, and I order a Large that fit me perfectly"
4.0,"Great fit and quality, however the color is not apricot, nor nude color, it's kind of light to medium brown. That is why I gave a 4 star. I ordered once before a nude color and returned it, it was way too big everywhere. This time I ordered 2 sizes to see which fits better. I am 34D, and 34D was perfect. I am not sure about the color...?"
4.0,"Didn't come with backings and list one the 1st time I wore them.  Too thin and very light weight,  not enough substance to them"
4.0,"The beards quickly began falling off the masks. Hats were a little itchy due to the cheap material, but perfect for having a fun little project!"
4.0,"I ordered a large which is what I would normally wear but this is pretty tight, probably should of ordered an xlarge. Once I am zipped into the shirt it helps with my posture."
4.0,"The shirt was surprisingly well made. The leggings were so thin they were almost see through. Hat is great, shoe covers are big but probably to fit over big shoes. Would have been a 5 if not for the pants. I intend on wearing my own leggings with it and it will still look awesome!"
4.0,"I've been wearing Vionic's for a long time... The fit is pretty correct. Because it's a higher shoe & strappy with a back zipper I ordered a 7W, my normal size, however, I often wear 7 1/2 W in sneakers, boots & some shoes. I read the reviews & order accordingly.<br /> Considering the heel & style they are comfortable & very pretty. I couldn't imagine wearing these all day.I do &#34;wobble&#34; just a little in them. Hum!!! The comfort is there, & if you need a sexy shoe with support, this is a good choice.  I Love the look, but I'm not &#34;In Love&#34; with the comfort. I'm keeping them because it's a nice look, but I wouldn't run back & buy another color. Unless I really needed this look in another color... They're nice..."
4.0,"cute liprings, I think I only used the golden one. It works fine. I haven't tried the black one because chances are, the paint will come right off and I don't want to take that chance as my piercings are easily irritable."
4.0,"This was my first time buying clothing from amazon. I was nervous but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It looks just like the pictures. I’m 5’3”, 124lbs, 34ddd. I got a small. It’s fits pretty darn good. It’s a little tight in the rib cage but I like the length of the dress and fear that going bigger will make the dress longer. Because it’s a little tighter on rib cage, I can hike the dress waistline up a little putting the dress at the thigh. It does show fat rolls on your back where your bra is and it is pretty staticky. I bought it for a wedding that is gonna happen in February. I’m allergic to the sun, so I have to pair it with tights. It’s definitely cuter without tights but oh well. Actually wish it was just a little bit shorter. But overall, for the price and for what I  bought it for, it is great. I don’t regret my first clothing purchase at all!"
4.0,There are 2 different shoes pictured on the photos. Photo 1 shows the mermaid style but the rest of the photos show a different real show with neon pink.  That's the one we received not the mermaid but kept because my daughter liked them anyway. Just fyi you may not get what you order.
4.0,It was alittle to tight for a size 10 and it being a large
4.0,A little large but wearable. I like it and have already gotten compliments on it.
4.0,"This little sweater is really lovely.  Sleeves and sweater are both just the right length.  I don't find the fabric itchy at all, but I do think it's probably too delicate to throw in the washer, although I might put it in alone on delicate and do a very quick wash then hang to dry.  The only thing I would point out is that I ordered the beige and I guess that technically it is beige, but it's a bit more on the yellow side than I would have liked (and believed I was getting.)"
4.0,"I have a pair of these shorts from years ago.. and they fit the same.. may be a half size larger than the listed size, but not enough to say &#34;somewhat large&#34;"
4.0,Great value and color similar to what I was looking for.
4.0,"A bit snug in the shoulders, but I don't often lift my arms over my head in public, I wear it often and get compliments on it.<br />Would recommend"
4.0,the stretch in the pants is nice? but the top doesn’t stretch that much.
4.0,nice wallet !!
4.0,its very nice and the quality is very good
4.0,Perfect size for my outfit
4.0,My boyfriend loves it!  But the neck part is kind of sticking out.
4.0,"This is a beautiful silver necklace.  I have not had it long enough to wear but I'm betting on many great compliments.  It is not two toned like the picture shows, it is all silver."
4.0,Very light and comfortable. The only complaint would be the bad smell when first opened.
4.0,Love the look of the pants.  Does as expected except that they are pretty long. Great quality material.
4.0,"I needed a multi use purse and liked the color of this one. I was surprised how small it was packed up. It came in a small package and I thought that there purse would also be tiny, however, it is not. The nylon fabric makes it very compact and light weight. It has ample room inside. There are numerous zippered pockets that are very helpful for my needs. I like to keep money, keys, glasses, phone, granola bars, etc isolated for easy location.  Even when the pockets were filled, there was room inside the main compartment. I really like this purse.  The strap is adjustable and I have found no flaws in the manufacturing. The reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the zippers. They are plastic and can tend to stick. I have noticed that if I am having difficulty, I just need to make sure the zipper is clearly lined up and facing down. I have used this everyday and am enjoying the ease of use, but the zipper does take some patience at first. It seems good quality, it is just the nature of a plastic zipper. Anything else would weigh down the purse. Overall, I am very happy with this bag."
4.0,The pieces are shifting but I love it otherwise.
4.0,I received this dress earlier than was due which was great... Material is very thin so use appropriate under garment as everything will print out. I'm a size 16 - 18 and I bought the largest size to be on the safe side and it fit....so be careful choosing your size....overall I love it...
4.0,Was ok not great quality!
4.0,Got as expected.
4.0,"It's cute! It's a little stiff right now but I'm sure as I wear it, it will get looser. The color is pretty accurate to the photo but it was a little tricky to get on. The leather is not real but it looks pretty darn good."
4.0,T-shirt material dress...very comfortable
4.0,"Love this cami. Soft and comfy, even the lace. Got white and black.<br /><br />Unfortunately the black was more grey than black and went back.<br /><br />May try another color."
4.0,"The woman in the image must be very short. I can get the sleeves just past my elbow, but then there is no bunching like shown in the image. They are not long enough to hide the ends under my short sleeved shirts -- even though my short sleeve shirt sleeve hit the elbow, there is a distinct BREEZE where material does not cover bare skin.<br />It is longer if I take my thumb out of the hole and wear it at my wrist. I've tried making my own but I'm not much of a seamstress. I have bought other sleeves but they weren't as long at these. Still. I need longer."
4.0,"I like the style, but the material is kind of OK."
4.0,Quality seems okay. Very comfortable but seems to run a bit large.
4.0,Wicked cute dress! I’m 5ft 145lbs ordered a medium and it fits perfectly! I was a little worried with this style of dress and me not being stick thin and having curves but it’s very cute and flattering on! It is lined and not see through. Perfect for spring and summer!
4.0,"It's fairly good quality my girlfriend loves it. I almost lost it because the little ring connecting it to the key part broke without me realizing it, but good thing I saw it on the floor so keep a eye on that. Overall it's a great product."
4.0,"These ate being used in salt water on my jet ski and have been doing a great job so far, only cons that have come up are the strap is not necessarily the most comfortable and the sealant that comes in contact around the face isent the most sturdy. But when comparing prices of these to 60-80$ glasses they'll do the job just fine"
4.0,These earrings look exactly like the picture.  They are a little heavy which is my only complaint.  Price is great compared to others.  Happy with my purchase.
4.0,"I really liked it but it was really small but that’s the only thing! It came in this tiny ziplock baggy, over all I love this so does my best friend!"
4.0,"These are soft and a good fit everywhere but the fingers are very long, great for a piano player perhaps"
4.0,"Queda muy justo pero igual sienta lindo, tela un poco transparente"
4.0,"Not the same shirt as in thumbnail, but it was still quality"
4.0,won't stay on waist falls down
4.0,great pair of sunglasses! bought them for vacation and went well with my swimsuit!
4.0,"These boots are very well made. Very comfortable as well. The only gripe I really have with them is that the chains on the back of the boot have a tendency to rattle rather loudly. While this is to be expected, it's just not for me. I love these boots, I still wear them rather often, but I'll probably be buying another pair sans chains."
4.0,"Hat is OK, but definitely for beachwear only. It is so floppy that it obscures your  vision if you try to wear it and walk."
4.0,"Great color, good absorption and squat proof. But runs small in the waist! Butt and legs fit great, so maybe it's just my body? Because the waist is small and is high waisted, the waist band rolls down like CRAZY. If you have a bigger tummy area than butt/legs, you might have the same issue."
4.0,"I’ve used it three times, it meets the need, looks as good as others I paid more for. Nice Obi belt, it dresses up a simple outfit."
4.0,These were great and got here super quick.
4.0,Plastic was not completed attached to thebox .other wise my son loves it
4.0,The dress is nice but not a very good quality
4.0,"For the price I paid, this is a good value. The product arrived and it was just thrown in a bag that wasn’t sealed all the way. At least a dozen of the bands were twisted and bent and one was missing half of the fastener snap and is useless. The colors displayed on the listing were much more vibrant. I received navy blue, pink, purple, yellow, green and brown. The holes aren’t punched out all the way and my floor was covered by little dots of confetti when I opened the package. The key point is these bands fit the t-guard thumb guard. It’s a little snug in the clip but otherwise fits well. They are not as nice a quality as what you buy directly from t-guard but get the job done."
4.0,Love the wallet!
4.0,I bought this for my Wife and fortunately she likes it.  The material and finish are great but be warned this is a HUGE fanny pack.  It's basically a purse.
4.0,"a medium weight sweatshirt, was given as a gift . well made."
4.0,"Very nice quality. Snuggly warm.  But, like other reviews, it does run large.  I could have gotten the next smaller size and been happier with the fit."
4.0,It came well packaged. They look as pictured. Would buy again.
4.0,"The all fit except the solid colored choker, it was too large, everything else was incredible."
4.0,A nice spiritual gift.
4.0,It could be sharper.  The pin seems to make a bigger hole than I like.
4.0,I was expecting a shorter dress this dress is down to my knees
4.0,My son still like this item.
4.0,"Strong and durable! Fit me well. Sadly since the charm hangs it was ripped of by something somewhere that I'm not aware of. Wearing it properly as jewelry, this is a very nice piece of symbolism. Be careful for water can rust metal pieces. All in all I thought this was a nice bracelet and I'm a guy."
4.0,"My son likes the watch. I set 8 alarms with a vibrate function, but sometimes it doesn’t vibrate. It’s like it has a mind of it’s own. First my son told me that it didn’t vibrate at a particular time. I thought it was strange, but thought that maybe he missed it. Then I wore it myself for a couple of days and noticed that it didn’t vibrate twice in two days at different times."
4.0,"Cute and comfy. Definitely not like lounge around pants bc they don’t really stretch. They definitely go above your ankle if you’re tall, but that’s fashion so it’s cute. Great for the price for sure."
4.0,"Initially when I took the products out of the shipping bad, it looked as it was going to be too small, but once I tried it on it was almost perfect...the almost comes as the shirt made me realize I need to work on my love handles....other than that I'm very satisfied and feel &#34;SUPER&#34;!!!"
4.0,"The night yellow pair reflects everything and is distracting while driving.  If all lights are off inside vehicle  and only have exterior lights to deal with,  they're okay"
4.0,Surprisingly descent build for so little cost.
4.0,"Might wanna change wording in the description .... I thought this was a buy 20 get 25 more .. my fault!!! Was a good price!!! But I did buy these for 4 girls to split for our upcoming Disney, wanted something a little cheaper for them to split & trade in the park.<br />Despite the wording, the pins came in & were perfect & just enough to split among 4 girls to use on our trip.<br />All authentic<br />All in great shape<br />Would buy again<br />Only giving 4 stars due to the wording of the description .... otherwise, perfect!!!!"
4.0,"The shoes are very cute and appear to be made well.  However, it didn't state that these were baby shoes.  I was looking for Kids shoes size 4/12."
4.0,"First off,  purchase A LOT of clothing and workout gear from Amazon and understand that fit and details can differ from size to size and color to color. Here's my experience:<br />I am 170#, 5'9"", althletic build doing HIIT type workouts in a casual planet fitness type atmostphere. I have these pants in a variety of other colors (the red, teal, and purple are not see thru). They are a full high-waist to top of foot on me which may prove too long for shorter folks. I wanted a black pair and decided to start here. The size Large, black pants are pretty thin. Thin enough that every panty line will show thru and if you wore white underwear or were particularly fair skinned, it may be a problem. I decided to keep them and just remember to wear dark underwear but I'm also not a big squatter. If you're working out on the floor surrounded by a bunch of bros and you're the type to be a little self conscious, I would skip these. The little dots/pattern, are usually additional thread, on these pants, they are more like a burn/cut out and it's as if they intentionally show skin when stretched, I noticed it at my knees when doing a leg press. I have wider hips and a narrower waist so there tends to be some gapping created with other pants that come up even just an inch or two higher-not a problem with these, I really liked how they sat on my waist. I didn't feel the need to pull them up or pull up the waist as I moved from machine to machine. These aren't a ""buttery"" type but more of a coarse material that may snag. I like them enough to keep them, if I had to guess, they feel like they'll probably last a year with being worn and washed 1-2x per week."
4.0,"Very warm jacket, seems to be of good quality. Interesting words on the interior tags but over all very pleased."
4.0,It fit fine and was comfortable.
4.0,These bibs do a great job at absorbing drool. The 360 design is great because my baby inevitably pulls and turns his bibs around all the time. The Muslin material is very soft and super absorbent. In my opinion it absorbs better and more then terry cloth or cotton by a long shot. It’s also a lot softer then those fabrics so if your constantly wiping your baby’s chin and lips they won’t get irritated. My only complaint is that the neck holes of these are a little wide for my 6 month old. There’s a decent gap that allow drool to still get on the neckline of his clothes occasionally.  But all in all these are good for drool on the go !
4.0,"Cute dress!  I followed others' advice and ordered a little smaller (I'm a 10-12 and I ordered a medium) and it fits perfectly!  The seams are a little itchy to me, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
4.0,Didn’t look very sturdy but held up nicely!
4.0,"Color is good. Weight is good. Don't know about washability yet. Recipient put it on and wore it immediately out of box.  It should be pictured as for someone a bit shorter and heavier than the model they show, however."
4.0,"Got this pack for a 5 year-old for a stocking stuffer and he loves them.  4 months later, he still plays with them and accidentally leaves them on all night on occasion.  I think we had one non-working one, but for the price, that's not bad."
4.0,"It’s lightweight, very accurate and has useful extra features. I bought it for the stopwatch, and that works well for me. One weak spot: the built-in light. Casts virtually no light on the watch face. Only lights itself. So, yes, you can see the light, but it doesn’t light up anything else. Didn’t need it for that, so I’m very satisfied, particularly for the low cost."
4.0,Cute Keychain 😍.  Had one rhinestone missing though when I opened it up.
4.0,"Colors just beautiful,  runs small, so order 2sizes up"
4.0,Ordered a size 2 sizes larger as per size chart
4.0,My 13 year old niece loved these as a birthday gift.  As exactly as described and pictured.
4.0,Very cute...wish it was a tad bit longer in length
4.0,Medium fits better on the torso/bottom
4.0,"Great Shirt... I have only one, because its so expensive (reason for 4 star), but its my favorite shirt when running or for the gym."
4.0,"I really like these glasses, and for the price, I think it's a great product"
4.0,I do love this top.  I decide to order large size and I think the top is better when it is not tight on you.  I love it!
4.0,"I bought this dress for my wife during a promotion to get 50% discount in exchange for a review. She is 5'2&#34; and weights around 100lb. She wears XS (0/2) or S (4/6) depending on whether the dress runs large or small. Since this dress does not have size 0/2, I went for a 4/6.<br /><br />The dress is beautiful! If you are afraid that the material will look or feel cheap, do not worry; it is comfortable and acceptable quality. The finishing of the details is not perfect, but this is expected at this price point.<br /><br />The only thing we did not like so much is that the dress does not fully adapts to her figure well in the back. I wish they would have a 0/2 to compare and see if this slight misshape is because of being too large or because of the dress design in itself. I think if you are a slightly taller/heavier than my wife, the 4/6 will fit you perfectly<br /><br />Overall, a great gift and a new pretty dress for my wife's summer collection!"
4.0,Pretty chokers but they're probably not the material your thinking they'll turn out to be. When I got mine they were folded and wrinkly so I just took a straightener and fixed that but they are wonderful but the chains can be found to be a little rusty or cheap?
4.0,Very nice material cute but it runs small and it's short from the back I would order a size up if your 40 dd our higher .
4.0,light and breathable good for hot days and keeping the sun off
4.0,I have bought a size medium in this brand before and it has fit even though I’m usually a small and this one just fit a little bit bigger than I liked so I would say stick to regular size on this one! Love the material though and the design of the shirt! I’m keeping it but if I get other colors I’m sticking with a small.
4.0,"The strap is a little tight on the top of my foot, but I feel once I wear them a bit they will fit fine.  Very comfortable."
4.0,Nice dress with pockets (YAY!) but I suggest choosing one size down. (Tempting to see this dress as a coloring book page ... .)
4.0,"Great quality, very pretty ,but runs about a size too small"
4.0,Very nice. Wish it was a bit larger.
4.0,I was skeptical at first but im glad i went with it the fabric is great the fit is pretty good it does have underwire huge plus but the top fits a little weird..i wish it had a clasp in the back like a bra cuz it feels loose but doesn't look loose so no big deal an the leg holes are a little tight but also no big deal at all im 5'4 150 pounds and i went with a size large it covered what i wanted covered and still looks great i cant wait to wear it to the beach!!
4.0,"Got this as a gift recently and I really love the material and it is very comfortable. I’m 6’0 and have the xl and it runs very short in length compared to any other brand shirt I have such as Columbia, Mountain Hardware, Patagonia etc."
4.0,Material has changed from last year when I ordered.... It's still okay... just made more cheaply
4.0,Wish is was bigger. Runs small.
4.0,"I like the aspect that the rubber bands can wash off easy, even when oil gets on it. For I get in situations were a lot of oil gets on my bands. Otherwise I would get the fiber material ones which would seem to wear better. I only had this watch for a few years and the band strap end keeper as well as an adjusting hole tore open on my watch. So I had to get a new band for it."
4.0,comfy.  a little short
4.0,The dress was ok. A little too silver than I expected and the style didn’t look that great on me. I returned it. But the dress itself was ok
4.0,LOVE the fit of this dress.  It's just the right length - not too short or too long.  VERY flattering.
4.0,"A little small, but otherwise fine."
4.0,Great dress. Very festive. Wore it in place of an ugly Xmas sweater and it was a big hit! It does run big. The small size will fit a 6-8.
4.0,"I purchased the shirt thinking a men's XXL would fit me (I wear a women's 3x).  Shirt wouldn't button across my chest, so I gave it to my husband."
4.0,This pair of Dakine gloves works very well during winter. But the inside pair of gloves doesn't have touch compatibility with iPhone
4.0,Nice shirt. Little long but cute shirt
4.0,"They stay on pretty well, but I gave it four stars because when I sit down they get loose, and I have to keep adjusting it, but it gets me through my uniform inspections!"
4.0,Logo almost like Topgun
4.0,OMG this is such an adorable jacket. I get so many compliments from this jacket. I was a little concerned about the quality due to the reasonable price but was pleasantly surprised that it is very good quality. The only problem I had was the buttons are not sewn on very good.
4.0,Nice comfortable jumpsuit.  Good stretch. I would've gotten an 1x but reading the reviews I got the XL.
4.0,"Excellent presentation, very good watch and with an extra bracelet<br />I’am very happy"
4.0,"The dress fit, but the empire waist is a little higher than it appears in the picture. I'm going to pair a wide black belt with it to give some shape and separation from the top and bottom."
4.0,Absolutely stunning but for the price one would think they were hypoallergenic
4.0,wife likes it. could of had a few more compartments for as big as is.
4.0,Great stocking stuffers for my teenagers. Light weight but a nice size. Individual packaging.
4.0,They’re a little big under the chin but overall I like them
4.0,"Arrive within less than a week. Came a little tangled but its very pretty, nice color. Fits my waist perfectly."
4.0,This fit great (even for my G cup chest) aside from it being really short. I normally wear a 14ish and the XL worked for me.
4.0,"Looser fit than I'd like, especially around the hips. I wear a medium, sometime large, and should have ordered the medium since the large is too big. I also took the huge buttons off because I think it looks better without."
4.0,Sizing is very confusing.Quality top notch!
4.0,These are great. They don't slip off your heel and that is a MAJOR plus to anyone who has tried no show socks before. They are more expensive than I'd like to pay for socks but they work. They are also very thin. I will try to post a follow up after I have worn them for a while to see how well they hold up and clean.
4.0,The free was amazing but a tiny bit tight the accessories that came with it were ok but a little cheaper made . Luckily I ordered another accessory kit when I ordered.
4.0,"Love the color and the feel of the fabric and the looks of it, haven’t worn it yet so kind of hard to review"
4.0,"Very cute and sexy swimsuit. The reason why I give it four starts is because when I put it on, a piece of the white underlined cover was visible in the front. Also, in the glutes zone, this white underline fabric will become visible everytime I'd move. Other than that b great buy."
4.0,This is perfect. Fit really well. Knocked it down a star because the red velvet stained parts of the fur and the shedding is insane lol
4.0,Great gift for 7 year old
4.0,"Earrings are pretty just not what I expected for the cost. They are rough, looks like they maybe trying to rust or the metal is about to flick off."
4.0,"So the fabric isn’t what I was expecting and feels not cheep but not super good , I’m useing it for cosplay so I won’t wear it often but it’s not uncomfortable. The arms are a little small on me, but I have long arms so I am not surprised. But overall good for cosplay."
4.0,"Cozy and cute, but way to big! Normally a large and I ordered a medium. Still too big!"
4.0,"The fabric is like any other swimsuit fabric, it's nice. The top fits perfectly but the bottoms were a little bit too small. The price of the swimsuit was amazing for the size and the quality. It would be awesome if theme seller could offer different sizes for the tops of vs the bottoms."
4.0,Pretty shirt. Very sheer. Fit is smaller than I was looking for but I can still wear it.
4.0,I got this shirt for my nephew who recently turned 6 years old and a HUGE fan of the Super Mario Brothers!  He had to wear it that same day before singing Happy Birthday!  Better clothe than a toy.
4.0,Feels a bit cheaper than chiffon.. But it was $12.  Im not thrilled. But content considering the cost & quick delivery.
4.0,"El reloj hermoso tal cual sale en la foto, tuve inicialmente un problema pero lo solucionaron de inmediato, viene con un folleto de instrucciones. Me encantó!!"
4.0,"It is beautiful, but sadly too small!  I normally wear a large so ordered XL because you need a vest to be bigger in order to wear things under it.  This XL is too small for me all by itself."
4.0,I am 5 feet 100 pounds. I normally wear between xs to small. It was not tight for me so someone who can go between small and medium (if you have big hips or butt prob not).  Definitely not for someone who wears large or xl size pants. I bought the black ones and they look like the picture. You can see panties through.
4.0,material was a lil snug but i loved it!
4.0,"light, but large."
4.0,"These are pretty earrings that can be worn with either a casual or dressy outfit. They are pretty lightweight so no worries about weighing down an ear lobe. These aren’t perfect matches (see photo), as one is slightly  smaller than the other, which is my reason for a star deduction."
4.0,Fit well. Bought for travel.  I think they will wash and wear on the road well but have not tried yet
4.0,I like my new thermal shirt.  It's a bit thicker than expected but it definitely keeps me warm and the polar vortex at bay.
4.0,My daughter is five and she is wearing 6<br />It is small. But we are still gonna use it as tunic top
4.0,"Good fit. It does stretch out after a while, but that seems to be expected for this type of hat."
4.0,"I am 5'-3&#34; tall and wear a size medium top, so I got a Med in the posture shirt. The fit should be snug, but it I found it to be slightly challenging to put on. It is also quite a bit too long for my torso, so I had to fold it up at the bottom.  Once on, though, it was very comfortable and helped to good keep my back and shoulders aligned.  I would recommend it for anyone who has physical problems associated with bad posture."
4.0,Love the earring exactly like the picture
4.0,This long sleeve is quality made. You can tell right when you put it on that it's a shirt that will last. Buttery smooth and comfy for cold days! I like a loose fit.
4.0,"I bought size large for my husband. He actually wears medium, but I figured they would shrink so I went up a size.<br /><br />When he first tried them on, they fit perfectly. The length was perfect and so was the waist. So already they fit like a medium. They are comfortable and cool and perfect for lounging. He was a fan.<br /><br />But then we washed them (on cold) and dried (on low) and they shrank. Now the hem of the pants sits about 3"" above his feet! So I guess we needed to order the XL for my M husband :/"
4.0,watch is on the smaller side
4.0,Super cute but top runs a bit small if you have a larger chest area
4.0,"the girlfriend loved it, so i did something right..."
4.0,Fit well but more of a linen type jacket as opposed to a wool/cotton blend I was looking for.
4.0,These were cute.  And I think they will last.
4.0,"I got this leather strap to go with my Sony A7 RIII and a smallish lens (Tamron 28-75mm).  The leather feels nice to the touch and looks great.<br /><br />I am 6’5 and feel like it is a little too short to strap across my chest, but it is still doable.  It works better when it is hanging off one shoulder, though.  For reference, I had my 5’7 girlfriend try it on and I have a picture of how it fits her fully extended.  I think it will work fine for most people, to be honest.<br /><br />I mainly wanted to have it for shooting around the house.  I was using a wrist strap before, but sometimes I want my hands free while I have the camera, so I prefer this.  I also have a Black Rapid strap and it feels more secure, can be adjusted to fit me without an issue, and is more comfortable to carry for long periods, but I like this strap because it isn’t as bulky.<br /><br />I think this is a pick your poison kind of thing.  I believe there are more comfortable straps that will fit more people via adjustments, but I think there is something to be said for a light, stylish strap that isn’t as bulky when you want to put it in a small case or just have it for carrying the camera around the yard.  All in all, I wish it was maybe a foot longer, but I will still be using it a lot."
4.0,Love the quality. Bamboo is so comfortable
4.0,"I absolutely love these! I recently had my second child and a while I've been able to lose weight fairly quickly I have a Tonna of extra skin on my stomach. Unfortunately when I put on my jeans it ends up pushing the skin down and making me look like I have a huge grandma pooch. I typically wear high waisted jeans so I was looking for a high waisted piece of Shapeware to help smooth out my belly.<br /><br />These fit me super well and I was really impressed that they were marked as A  Victoria's Secret product. They were advertise that way so I'm not sure if it's a knock off of Victoria secrets product but they definitely work really well. The fabric if they're made out of is really comfortable and supersmooth on the skin. I didn't notice them at stretching out while I'm wearing them the only thing I noticed is that they do tend to slip up word on your body while you move around in them. Because they slip up word I wouldn't recommend them if you were wearing a high waisted pair of pants and a crop top that shows your skin because you may end up with the Shapeware slipping out above the line of your pants.<br /><br />All in all I absolutely love them, I have since ordered a few more pairs in different colors and some in song bottoms. I don't notice any panty lines with these, and I do also wear regular underwear underneath them and I haven't noticed that it's too tight and it doesn't leave any weird creases for my underwear."
4.0,"These are for a person who want the executive look. or maybe you own a Teary. Block out the sun very well, very good quality  for a cheap price."
4.0,The night vision glasses are not bad. They do take away the glare of headlights.
4.0,Very thin fabric but soft and comfortable
4.0,Liked the color and the material. Fit is great! However the perforated holes are scratchy. I wouldn't want to be thinking of the scratchiness while wearing this.
4.0,"Trust the reviews, size up!!! The bottoms are super cheeky but still high waisted and fitted. The top is SUPER SMALL. Anything over than an A cup is gonna feel constricted and tight. However this is such a good buy and its very trendy. Get darker colors as the lining is thin. 4 stars!!! I would totally recommend. A good staple to have in your swim suit collection."
4.0,"Anything with Eeyore is hard to find and these were just perfect. Pants are very comfortable and top is not quite as loose as I like, but they are fine."
4.0,"two of the shirts were as expected but one of them while it was the same size as the others, didn't fit the same as the other two. Overall, great quality undershirts."
4.0,"YEEPSYS Women's Zip Front Sports Bra<br />This sports bra is comfortable to wear with adequate support for most activities. It features removable pads in the cups (the pads are thicker than I’ve found in other sports bras), cute crossing straps in the back, and a zipper closure with internal clips for added security and to make for easier zipping. The front zipper makes it easy to put on and take off when you're sweaty.<br />It is quite similar to a Tek Gear zip sports bra I purchased about a month ago, with the main difference being the sides of the Yeepsys brand are very high and offer quite a bit more coverage than I’m used to with a sports bra.<br />I ordered a medium, the size sports bra I’ve purchased for years, and I think in this case, I probably would have preferred a small. I’m a 34D and the medium is a little too big."
4.0,"Very nice looking short, like it!"
4.0,Love the feel of the fabric; soft and cool to the touch. It has a beautiful satin trim on neckline and the drawstring. Only drawback is the very tight waistband. Will need to have taylor loosen. I even sized up and it's still snug. Everything else is perfect!
4.0,"Overall, the outfit fits well except for in the bust area (I'm a B/C cup depending on the fit of a bra and the bust area is quite large). The downside to this is that unless you're a D cup, you'll probably need to have this altered which, isn't an easy fix due to the seam lines being on the center of each bust. I was able to have the tailor make the changes but, the cost of that was more than the actual outfit itself. The other aspect that would make this better, would be if the fabric had a little bit of nylon in it. Being 100% Polyester, it's nearly impossible to keep wrinkles from appearing. Living in a city, it's possible to wear it out somewhere that I can walk to and stand at the event. But if I had to sit in an Uber or drive somewhere- it would be really wrinkled by the time I arrived."
4.0,"The first pair I ordered were a perfect fit, but it had a hole in the seem so I returned it. The second pair that came are larger than the other pair. I can never understand how that happens. But I still like them, they are so soft, and they have held their color after several washings."
4.0,Fir was very comfortable. Will be helpful at work since we have to wear masks for 12 hours
4.0,"This is a pretty scarf. It is large enough to be worn as a scarf or as a shawl. The fabric is light-weight and soft, and the color is a nice pastel pink so it goes well with a variety of outfits."
4.0,"I'm 5' 7.5"", around 155 lbs and this drape is very flattering.  I just might buy another one!"
4.0,"So warm and cozy!  The ears are a little bigger than I thought they would be, more like puppy ears vs bear ears but they look good regardless.  My only negative is that the stitching is coming undone in the top seam and they haven’t even been run through the wash yet."
4.0,Not the fabrics I expected
4.0,"Really Cute dress! But I feel like it does run VERY big. I bought a size larger than normal because I have a larger chest and it was way too big. I am going to have to make some alterations on it, but otherwise it is really cute."
4.0,But is heavy but that means it will give you better rain protection.
4.0,It is beautiful and perfect for my December wedding!
4.0,"I have not yet worn or washed my new Sox, but they look and feel very nice. I would rather post a review after I’ve worn them awhile."
4.0,"It is good! I bought this for my 9yo and it is soft. He loves it! Only issue is with the red one. It just leaves alot of red fuzz, but over all it keeps him warm and he loves it."
4.0,This is very stretchy and the material is thick (good quality) but feels more like swimsuit material.
4.0,"We use a lot of the disposable ponchos in the summer/spring months.  My boys both go camping with Scouts and we do a lot of outdoor events.  I wanted something that provided better coverage and could be used again.  Also, the ponchos are huge on my 11 year old.  These are nice for the price.  They are too small for my 14 year old, but they just fit my 11 year old.  I would recommend these for younger children... maybe ages 5-10.  The hood is adjustable, and this has been reused once so far.  It's a nice looking, quick, cheap option that packs flat."
4.0,"Not as cool as the older style but, still a good pair of socks"
4.0,This is very cute but it does fit snug through the chest if you are bustier. After several washes it starts looking a little rough but still happy with purchase.
4.0,"This ring is pretty, although like one reviewer stated the little CZ gems do not sit within the band, they kind of pop up, so I am giving this 4 stars because I can feel the rubbing from those gems on the middle of my pinky and middle finger at times, which feels weird. the ring is very lightweight, and the stones shine in the sun. It is very attractive for it being CZ's. I received this for a discount in exchange for unbiased feedback.  It is very pretty and would make a nice gift or a good starter ring for a teenage girl."
4.0,Great had them for about 3 weeks.there are dark for real nice back
4.0,"Cute dress.  Very comfortable.  Didn’t like where the seam was to attach the top to the skirt on me, but overall the dress still looks nice."
4.0,"Wish this had come in half size smaller it is a little loose. Have worn every day doing every day stuff. Stays bright, does not turn finger green or irritated. I really like it"
4.0,I need to return this. I don't like the facing behind the keyhole pattern.
4.0,Es súper comoda suave no da calor no aprieta me encantó se demoró la entrega pero es muy buena.
4.0,"These are silky soft and not see though, but definitely doesn’t give compression. These work for all activities but be aware they won’t be like Gym Shark, they are simple soft high waisted leggings. The fit perfect, I wear a 10/12 in jeans and fairly fit- I got plus size per recommendation but I think the one size would have been fine."
4.0,Received today. Says hand made all silk. Looks like a solid feel and not too wide or narrow. Hanky seems a bit small but pleased with the order for the price.
4.0,Cuffs unfinished.
4.0,"Can't go wrong with these, great value !!"
4.0,It fit...
4.0,The item was bought as a gift.  They liked it very much.
4.0,"This is my second time purchasing this after the dog chewed the cord off the first unit. They work. They don’t turn smelly shoes into roses but they really help shoes from going from slightly smelly to shoes you have to keep outside! If the user of the shoes sweats a lot, wears the same shoes daily, or just works in an environment that causes the interior of a shoe to get damp just use this daily to dry out the shoe and keep the funk smell at bay. This may help save those smelly shoes you were ready to kick to the curb!"
4.0,"Very nice anklet. There is a small bell on the end, so besides the charms clinking together, that jingles as you walk. Fits as expected, but I don't have fat ankles. I have worn it several times, and it seems to be durable enough."
4.0,I liked it....I'm 5 feet it does fit me long...but it is a great material! but it does fit true to the size. I got 1X.
4.0,Super cute but shorter than pictured
4.0,"This isn't super supportive -- I only wear it for low-impact activities-- but I love the idea of a racerback style with straps that don't dig into the sides of my neck.  I generally wear a 32B, and I returned a M for a S because the former was just slightly too loose."
4.0,"Overall, I like the suit. It was just too big, and they didn't have the color I wanted in the next size down."
4.0,Not as wide as I hoped but nice sunglasses. Feel and look cheap but already seem more durable opposed to others I have used.
4.0,Nicely made skirt. It just runs big. I normally wear a 12/14 or Large. This felt like an 16/18 or XL.
4.0,It’s really cute! I’m usually a medium in juniors so I ordered the small it fits good
4.0,"This is a comfortable top, fits as expected (relaxed fit) except for a gap around the arm holes in the front. This is a roomier tank top so if you want it more fitted, I'd order a size down."
4.0,"Simple cut, but affordable.  Runs large.  5'9"" 160lbs male => choose Small for a slim-to-normal fit.  Medium was considerably too large in the shoulders for me.  Too big for a comfort fit.  Look at Vapor brand for a smaller Medium."
4.0,It's a good robe.
4.0,pretty but it seemed tight from the bottom and big on the top .. i guess bcz everyone has a different body shape ..overall nice top
4.0,I wish I would have sized up one more because the set is snug on me and not loose like advertised.
4.0,Should have bought more! Like the fit and feel to these shirts.
4.0,"Their a little thinner than what I expected, but they were only 5 bucks, so I can't complain.  They still do the job."
4.0,"I like the glasses; the loss of your peripheral vision while wearing them, IS dangerous though...<br />*Update* The frame of the glasses snapped a few days ago. I'm not angry, they were only 10 bucks, but I'm a little disappointed. I did kind of like them. Oh well..."
4.0,Super cute. My 25 year-old daughter loved them because her fiancee no longer steals her socks and stretches them out since we bought these. :).
4.0,I bought this to wear during exercise and it works as expected. The material is a little thin but nothing worth complaining about since it's not that expensive. Quite comparable with the original BUFF headwear.
4.0,Awesome shades.....delivery was fast also. Two thumbs up!
4.0,They are elastic shoe lace
4.0,The dress is super cute. It hits right at my ankle (maybe a little higher) but other than that its cute.
4.0,Fun to open the boxes
4.0,"Good fit, no real complaints..."
4.0,"Fits beautifully, but beware of cleaning instructions, once washed, it’s a wrap...you can trash it. The dress itself is beautiful and the color is rich!"
4.0,"I really like this little dress.  It is not completely see through, but still airy.  The sleeves are a bit tight compared to the overall fit of the dress. The material is a bit stretchy, but no enough to lose its form. I haven't washed it yet. We will see how it holds up to that. I'd buy it again, especially if they had more colors."
4.0,A little on big side but cute
4.0,Very soft leather
4.0,I like the pendants alot and the words are beautiful but the chain is very short and thin.  I got this for my daughter as a remembrance of her Dad.  It will  need a longer chain if you were to wear it but I think it would look nice hanging on the mirror in her car so she would always see it.  All in all I think it is a thoughtful gift.
4.0,"Not bad, I received what I paid for. I did receive compliments. I personally wish it were slightly smaller, as my hands are slim & small."
4.0,Product as described. True to size.
4.0,"Bought this as a Fall and Winter bag, it is a nice charcoal grey color. It is very roomy, it does however have a horrible smell. Because of that I have only used it one time. It is put away in my closet until the smell is gone. For the price it is a nice looking handbag. I look forward to being able to use it once the smell is gone."
4.0,"Wipe your jewelry... watch it shine. Downfall.... some of the oxidation gets on your hand, be sure to wipe jewelry down with a clean cloth before use"
4.0,As expected. Very shiny
4.0,"Little smaller than the original apple band sizing of 38/40 mm but thick,good quality."
4.0,"Good looking outfit, pretty color."
4.0,"It's ok. Tight at the hips, despite me going 2 sizes up. I had to tuck it into my jeans and wear it as a shirt rather than a dress. It's too short to wear as a dress anyway.. And the sleeves are not the same as the picture. They're hard and stiff and itchy."
4.0,"Considering the price, this was a decent value.  I ordered it for a one time use to match my son's date's dress and it was the right color."
4.0,"These were nice flip-flops, but they were much too small for my boys, even though I purchased the correct size."
4.0,"Beautiful, but shrunk to too small on first wash."
4.0,"Cool little braclet, my daughter really likes it. I only gave it 4 stars because of the quality. The band is studded, but the stud points are on the wrist exposed, making this easily removeable studs. Though a cool little band, I doubt we wouldve ordered it if we knew how flimsy it was."
4.0,Nice dress but fit was too small.  If you wear a large get an extra large.
4.0,"Overall I'm happy with these. They do run a little small. I am 5' 4"", 135 lbs, 25 inch waist and 35 inch hips. I ordered a medium and that's even a little bit snug but I feel a large would be too baggy on the top. I can only wear a pair of leggings under them, nothing thicker, which should be fine because they do feel layered enough to keep me warm. If I crouch all the way down they do feel pretty tight in my butt and legs but the material feels high quality enough to not rip. They unzip on both sides so getting them on is really easy and they have a ton of pockets. I bought the white ones and they're super cute on. I can't wait to wear them on the mountain! I didnt buy them on Amazon but given the lack of reviews on these I figured I'd leave one here too."
4.0,I ordered a plus size dress. It should have come with a plus size belt. So unfortunately I can't use the belt. So I'm forced to use the dress flowing free. That was not my intent. We shall see if it works for the wedding I'm going to next week.
4.0,They were pretty but I had yo return because I couldn't get the top cuff to stay on my ear.
4.0,"It' a cheap peace of jewelry,."
4.0,I buy this set to my friend birthday and she like it it’s cool gift
4.0,Happy with necklace
4.0,I love the ease of putting my dress on
4.0,The only thing I didn’t like is that it has to be dry cleaned
4.0,Held a lot and gets compliments.... I thought the price was a little high for the quality.
4.0,"I did not expect too much since the cost was inexpensive. there is more support in the ones you buy at the drug store, but you get one only and they are not that cheap.  If this doesn't provide the support you need, I would suggest going to the local pharmacy department for the other. For the money, it was fine."
4.0,"Does not have wire enforced straps, and when the gun is in the pocket, the purse wants to fall onto it's side every time you set it down. It looks nice overall, and I have been carrying it for about a month now and both the purse and the wallet are holding up very well. Great purse if the straps were better, and maybe a long strap option, so you can carry across your body would be very helpful."
4.0,"The watch was great for a Chrismass gift, very light weight and lovely. Seller was so quick to send it too. I will buy another one just like that for my brother. Am sure he will like it too.Am happy with it."
4.0,"These earrings are exactly as described.  If I gave them four stars instead of five, it is because these are not five-star items.  They are a fun gift for a tween, however, and were enjoyed as such."
4.0,Bonito y con buenos terminados
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress. The pockets are an added bonus. Many, many compliments on this dress."
4.0,Didn't try these on yet but it looks very cute. I had one that the gem fell out of but that's okay. The plastic clear part is bendy but it probably won't break on you.
4.0,"A very nice bracelet which I wear daily, taking turns wearing it on both wrists. However, I am not sure that it works or does anything because I still have intense pain at times right under each knee from arthritis."
4.0,"So I got this for a man, a man who wears an extra large. The XL on this is supposed to have a 48 to 60 inch bust and a 42.5 to 50 inch hemline. I wear a size medium and am a lady and my bust is 36 and my hips are 39 or 38 and this fit me like a women's large top, which means the bust was around 40 and the hem was also around 40. The listed measurements on this must be for if you stretch it out so much that the design distorts, which is something you wouldn't want to do, because the design is wonderful. The XL fits like a women's L and would be far too small for this man, so I am keeping this, because I do rather love it. Be careful with the sizing on this one, because it really isn't accurate at all. At the time I got this, it was listed as an XL for men and there is simply no way that this would fit comfortably on an XL man with that tight lower hemline. It would have to stretch too much to be comfortable. I recommend that women order the size they normally wear and men order up one size, if you like it tight, and two if you like it looser. That said, this was an early release item, so they may well fix the sizing by the time you read this. Make sure to check the most recent reviews, on the review page, to check for what people are saying about the issue of sizing when you go to order. As an early release item, for review, they may have sent the wrong size. It wasn't labeled as to size. As to the design, it looks great, when not stretched out, and is really striking, just like in the photos. We got the wolf design and it is quite impressive."
4.0,Super fun socks in great colors but a tad tight around the ankles. Would recommend for teens or women with smaller feet.
4.0,Really well made. Great quality fabric. Lovely dress.
4.0,My family and I bought these hats for Friday night football games in November. They were comfortable and warm.  Made a big difference by keeping us warm.
4.0,"The Good: It glows in the dark, it comes with the &#34;middle green man&#34; (also glows). This alien mask is a design i was looking for years at my country (Mexico) it seems well built. It looks like the eyes of the alien are your real eyes (unable to see your eyes at glance)<br /><br />The Bad: The air is hard to get inside the mask, for me it is a little hard to put on and take off, the neck part doesnt fit very well, so more like out of your shirt design. The Head is not filled with anything, you have to put something to prevent it from looking empty. I was expecting it to be bigger. The eyes holes to see, are too small, perhaps taking out a piece will make it better to see through and breath.<br /><br />My comment: Very good to scare people this halloween or Dia de Muertos, also good for pranks :-)  could be better built (bigger) for what it costs."
4.0,I like this dress very much it will look good with or without leggings
4.0,Loved the dress. Fits really well. Material is really soft on the skin. All in all good but.
4.0,A great product for keeping your glasses on! I would have given it 5 stars but it's a little difficult to get the rubber slide on the arms of the glasses.  The company sent a lovely card ( which looked hand written) thanking for the purchase.
4.0,justo
4.0,Great price for six pairs! The bigger 3 sizes are too big for my tastes but would make great gifts for my sister. I have sensitive ears and I've been wearing these for a couple weeks now with no issues. They are sparkly enough and nice and clear. The posts seem to be a bit longer than normal though but that is the only thing that's bothered me.
4.0,I like the wallet/wrist-let but it is to big for what i needed. Returning it. Looking for something else smaller
4.0,"Soft and comfortable sweat shirt, I have not washed it yet but when received it was just a little larger than I would have thought. I do like it."
4.0,"These earrings are lightweight and pretty, they are a little plain looking but you can add beads or charms especially if you’re crafty"
4.0,Great product but I can't get the alarm off! Bought it for my boyfriend who is notoriously rough on watches and it's been great. Just wanted a watch that tells time and holds up to moderate outdoor use and that's what it is. We just throw it in a bag at night and will deal with the alarm thing later.
4.0,"I bought this vest at Costco this last month and i have to say I really like it! It's a nice colour of red, not too bright at all and it is very warm....... well for winter days in western washington anyways. It has just the right amount of down in it, not too little and not enough to make you feel like the Michelin man. The fit is good, the arm holes aren't too big and the lower pockets are roomy enough to keep your hands warm. Inside there is a wallet pocket on the left chest that snaps closed and a smaller pocket on the right side that zips closed for a 'regular' sized cell phone or a couple of mini-bottles ;) .<br /><br />The only issue i have with the vest is a really small thing and that is the constant tinny sound of the snaps...... it's not very loud, but just enough to hear when i'm walking. Something I'm sure I will get used to after wearing this vest more than a couple of days. I will however say that I paid, at Costco, about 1/3 of what this vest is going for here on amazon...... so for $30, it's an amazing vest"
4.0,Really nice looking and looks like quality sunglasses  however  way too small for my kids 3 and 6yrs.
4.0,"It is my second dress with this style.First was flattering polyester mix, navy blue flowers,second green,cotton,absolutely non flattering, more like straight fit, which I like but was expecting something like the first one."
4.0,"I love this crossbody bag. It easily carries a few credit cards, both bills and a few coins, and my iPhone 10. I gave a four rating for the tight fit for my phone and the partial chain shoulder strap. I would recommend it to anyone."
4.0,"Cute, but lacks the quality I had expected"
4.0,I'm normally a medium in most shirts and dresses but the Large in this dress fit better.  It is very comfortable and I love the color.  The only downside to this dress is that it is very thin and I think I will have to wear a slip or shorts underneath.  I am still happy with the dress.
4.0,"My daughter loves it. Fabric is a little cheap, but not filmy or see-through. Washes well. Great for the low price."
4.0,This is definitely a feminine band and I get compliments on it daily. The only hiccup is that it is a little difficult to put on and take off by myself. Also my husband had to attach the band for me because I was struggling with it. But it is beautiful and I have worn it to the gym a couple of times and so far so good. But anything like sweater material will get hung up on it. It's due to the closures around the stones.
4.0,Perfect for my bracelet!
4.0,Easy & pretty!  Got the “I’m with the butterfly” t-shirt for my husband.  Perfect….
4.0,"love this dress . The material is as advertised, a nice chambray. the pockets are a plus. however choose a size below your regular size. the fit is somewhat big. overall a great buy for the price."
4.0,These are worth the price. They are decent quality but not the best - the one of the strands on the three strand choker was twisted but it wasn't noticeable while wearing it. My only advise is people with thicker necks should be careful - my neck is about 15&#34; and I have to wear these on the last loop.
4.0,"Love it! Better than expected! Bought it for a summer dress to wear in Thailand for temple viewing (shoulder and knee coverage) Sleeves have slits and two leg slits on either side but shoulders are covered. The leg slits are modest and come up to my extended finger tips. Waist band has some stretch and isn't constricting. There are sewn on waist ties that you wrap and tie in a cute bow.  Only negative: The arm hole slits actually extend down pretty far so I will likely either stitch them up a little or wear a cute bralette since it will show if my arms are raised but all in all perfect for what I am looking for. For reference I'm 5'10, 170lbs and ordered a medium. The dress almost grazes the tops of my feet. Perfect for me and is a rarity, but if you are shorter you will likely need to wear heels, take it up a little or order a size down."
4.0,"A little small needed 3/4"". But still perfect"
4.0,A little on the thin side as far as the fabric but its fits well.
4.0,"Much bigger than expected and heavy.  It's great as a gag gift, but not sure it's actually useable if trying to keep pants up."
4.0,"The top feels too clingy for me.  It's not ""tight"", just clingy.  The shorts are very soft and comfy. I'm giving the top to my daughter and keeping the shorts. Still a good deal just for the shorts."
4.0,Pretty. Not bad for the price.
4.0,Pretty shoes for my little princess
4.0,"The colors match perfect to the photo! The fit is a little bigger than I was expecting, but I ordered a size up to be safe. The inside has the seams exposed, they dont bother me. But if you have sensitive skin, I reccommend wearing a shirt or tank underneath it."
4.0,Arrived on time. Product matched image. Difficult to project durability but expect it will wear well
4.0,This sleep bra is very pretty.  I did take out the cups inside the bra as I do not need them.  I am large enough to fill the bra without extra padding.
4.0,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 starts is because there are two small spots on the cost wear the seams are coming apart. Not good. Other than that it's fits well, it's warm, and the color is really nice"
4.0,"I have fibromyalgia and frequently get chostochondritis in my ribs, right where a bra's underwire normally sits, so I am not able to wear regular bras.  This bra is more like a crop top and extends below where my pain is worst and is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn!  The bra is very cleverly made, with the cup somehow providing support yet without the constriction of a normal bra.  The wide lace straps are also very comfortable to wear.  Plus it has the added bonus of being a beautiful bra! My only complaint with the bra is that the bottom tends to roll up a bit, which means I have to adjust it frequently throughout the day, which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  However, it is still the most comfortable bra I have ever worn and I highly recommend it for those in chronic pain."
4.0,My daughter has received many compliments from this chain
4.0,The mask was of good quality and fit well.
4.0,One pair broke right away. Otherwise I am very happy with the glasses. I have less pain from eye strain.
4.0,"The length is good. The fabric is comfortable. I washed the pants before wearing because I felt a thin, waxy film on the material. There is significant waste band gap when I sit down."
4.0,"Its very nice pants.  But, it is not as glossy look as shown in the picture.  Therefore, I can not wear at an nice outing with friends.  But, its still pretty nice for this price, and I may order again if it does not shrink after washing."
4.0,These pajamas are great but I have long legs so the bottoms could be longer. The top was great. Wish you could mix and match sizes as option
4.0,I love it looks pretty and can wear with everything<br />Not sure about durability yet only have worn it 1 time
4.0,Looks like shes wearing a marshmallow! Hahahahahha shes gonna wash it and see if it floofs down a bit
4.0,Good quality...granddaughter love it
4.0,"Great for the price - kinda have a red tint to the lens which makes stuff seem brighter than my usual black sunglasses but So far, so good :)"
4.0,Super thin material. Made it very difficult to wear as pjs for a trip with friends. I could’ve just been nude.
4.0,It's a really nice looking bracelet! Although it does feel cheaply made. But it was worth it!
4.0,"This shirt is okay. It is pretty. The material it is made of makes it a little on the tighter to your skin type, so if you like your shirts loose like I do, you will need to go up a size or more. It does fit okay, but it is a little tighter than I prefer. It is a pretty color, and I like the zipper for the neck and the pockets."
4.0,They were a gift would never fit me
4.0,"It is just a &#34;hair to small, I'm a size 4 and it fits like an extra small.<br /> But it fits like a glove and the fabric is soft and flows nicely.<br />The cut is also very flattering for a curvy figure!<br />All in all, I love it!"
4.0,Seems to be well made a little snug zipper is on the left side
4.0,"Love it!  Strap is a little long, but I simply pinned it for a better fit."
4.0,These boots exceeded expectations as they kept feet warm and dry during a winter season. Comfort proved reasonable for regular walking of distances up to one half-mile. Don't expect a fancy box or shoe trees - just a pair of functional boots.
4.0,These are for special occasions- very light see thru material very effeminate and wonderful can wear them but don't wear them all the time they are truly delicate and will throw your redneck partner off guard- love them! will order again.
4.0,"I love the color and they fit really well. Maybe it’s just me... But do harem pants only look good when you are barefoot or have your leg otherwise your pants just look droopy especially with old socks on? I mean I love wearing them around the house for sleep and comfort clothes but would have to be really careful with my outfit if I went out in public with these on. That said they are soft, so soft, just so comfortable."
4.0,I had to do some bending on my glasses but that was on me otherwise they appear to hold my glasses on but you have to keep loosening them to take glasses off and tightens to keep them on.... I've owned a better version of these.... but these do work mostly.
4.0,This ring is smaller than I thought.  Very pretty and nice setting.  Sparkles when light hits the ring.  I love it.  But if you are looking for a large ring this one wont do it.  I recommend it.
4.0,Thet. bracelet makes a great gift for a 14 year old.  The charms and the weight of the bracelet are perfect.
4.0,I love this poncho - it's very fuzzy and warm and so cute.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is b/c a couple of stitches are missing creating a small hole on one of the seams.
4.0,"Love it! I'm 5'2"" and 125 lbs. I bought a small and it fits perfectly"
4.0,Can't wait to sport this on the beach!
4.0,My daughter has a long torso so the leo doesn't fit well. It's too tight.
4.0,Such a fun and soft top but its it's definitely too chunky and doesn't look like the product photo.
4.0,My wrists are super skinny and yet these didn't slip right off so I already liked it when I first tried it on. It's easy to read and I love the colours as they work with all my casual outfits. It also feels comfortable on my skin.<br />It is VERY loud. I keep it in a drawer when I am not using it as I can hear it tick loudly if I place it on a table. The date and day are adjustable but only down side in my case is that my day starts at 8:00am and for some reason the day/date only changes around 10:00-11:00am
4.0,This case is very cute but it doesn't give any protection to your phone. The design is also printed on the outside and it seems like it will start to chip off in a few months. It's very easy to take on and off and still very pretty.
4.0,"My little girl lost her mind when I got her these as a reward for good behavior.  She just loves butterflies.  We didn't pierce her ears and decided she would be able to do it when she is old enough to make her own decisions. Hence, the clip-ons.  The earrings are very pretty looking.  Four stars instead of five because one of the butterflies came off and I had to break out some needle-nose pliers to bend the loop back and lock it onto the clamp.  I expected them to be a little more resilient.  But then In all fairness, I don't know if it's because of the build quality or more likely because these things happen when young child gets her hands on... anything."
4.0,The shirt is nice and comfortable to wear
4.0,This is a great set. The quality is impressive and the fabric is very durable despite being so lightweight. The cut is a little off but just style wise. They work well in outdoors and manual labor as well during house renovations. I think an excellent set for the price and how long lasting they seem to be!
4.0,Pretty good. Inexpensive. Little bulky.. Used a Compression to get down to 6inch by 8inch. Warm. Inside left breast pocket is just open to the whole jacket liner. Plastic zipper is catchy use A little zipper wax and it smoothes out.
4.0,I bought a medium and it shows my muscles perfectly.  I wear them mostly on back day to show off my lats. Not dry fit but still worth the purchase. The material is like a thin jersey but we'll made. I will buy more colors soon.
4.0,"Love the watch. It’s a good size to be able to see the dial and hands. The band is very simple to adjust and takes less than 30 seconds. The only reason I didn’t rate it 5 stars is the battery died after only a couple of weeks. It was easy to replace with a battery I got at a local store, but annoying that I had to do it."
4.0,just a tad tight on my big fat face...
4.0,Just somewhat small. Very cute though.
4.0,My son loves it but its a lil small
4.0,"I attached a tee shirt to the bottom to keep it from rolling up. I hate that.  Lovely material, pattern  and cool for summer. I am working on my belly bulge - maybe that will help."
4.0,"The bag is everything I expected it to be and it arrived very quickly.  I do wish it had a small handle at the top.  Otherwise, it has tones or storage space and is a great purchase."
4.0,"Esta muy bonito pero no es como el que pedimos, el del anuncio se ve con el diseño en todo la caja, el que me llego solo esta pintada la parte de arriba"
4.0,It's quite a bit stiffer than the original band (and less skin irritation) so it takes a bit to get used too at first. Use the screws that come with this band don't attempt to re-use the old one. It comes with everything you need.
4.0,"Good material and the size was right!<br />The ears came broken,"
4.0,"my daughter liked this after all, although she thought the bra didn't fit too well, it was too big because of the padding."
4.0,Runs a bit large but I really like the light material and pattern.....
4.0,"the dress, material, quality and the color is absolute cute! really, the dress was cute and I purchased L size but it did not close on my chest at all. the line of dress stopped right in mid of chest and cant close."
4.0,As described and very cute.
4.0,nice enough necklace. a little flimsy
4.0,The jersey is great! Well made and fits perfectly! The down side is the cost!!! Tag on the jersey says $60.00 but they charged $84.00 - quite a markup!
4.0,"Loose fitting and comfy.  Not the cutest dress I own, but definitely one of most comfortable."
4.0,Hard to come off. Straps come apart completely when you try taking strap off. Very disappointed.  That was 1st edition.....they did send me updated version to try.  A lot better. Thank You !!!
4.0,"Needed an addition to my stack when one bracelet broke and I'm glad I found this. It's subtle and not easy to see, but I can see it well"
4.0,I loved the style when received did not look like the one on th photo it was very fuzzy and stuff still loved it you should try it out
4.0,You can remove puff ball.  Nice lining.
4.0,Smells so good and left my skin feeling soft without the greasy feeling you normally get from thicker lotions like this.
4.0,"Great quality, but ended up being too bug for pocket. It’s more usable if you have a briefcase or something like that."
4.0,Comfortable and looks as described!<br />Very happy!
4.0,"Loved the fabric and style, but the straps were a bit too long for me causing some what of a lack of support.  I prefer high impact support.<br />The XL was small around my chest w good support and the xxl fit well,  just no adjustable straps."
4.0,"Great hoodie, very soft and silky, the colors were lighter than what is pictured. But still love it."
4.0,"This was really pretty, unfortunately, I had to return it as it did not match (colorwise) the outfit I was trying to pair it with for a wedding."
4.0,"Looks great with all of my corsets. I wish it was a tad longer, but I can add a few more rings on it."
4.0,The band seems to be good quality. The only issue is the lugs stick out a tiny bit on the Series 7 45mm. This is made for the Ultra 49 mm.
4.0,"Very long legs, but loved how it fit elsewise. Had to have the legs hemmed. Material was stretchy and was very comfortable."
4.0,Really nice handbag for the money.  I was looking for a smallish bag with no top handle (easier access to inner compartments).  I like the small side flip open compartment for my phone and wallet.  The 4 star rating is only because the lining material is not very good quality and probably won't hold up.
4.0,Soft and comfortable. Color is true navy.
4.0,Is it real diamonds???
4.0,Great arch and ankle support. The material is very breathable and they are comfortable all day. Very slip resistant and great for all kinds of weather if working outdoors. I love the steal toe but the right boot of the pair I received has a slight indent on in the steal toward the outside of the foot. If working long shifts it becomes irritating and rubs wrong. If not for that I would have given five stars.
4.0,"All right product, the quality of material on accessories like a case and strap is low but overall is average ...."
4.0,I like the quality of the hat. Lettering was nice but too small and I could see long pieces of the stitching sticking out
4.0,"Comfortable  Summer dress. Watch out when the wind comes up, for that reason you will  need to wear some  little shorts under the dress."
4.0,I wasn't aware of the boning at the top of this shaper. It does flatten and the boning helps prevent rolling. Good posture helps. True to size.
4.0,Very good for kids.
4.0,Used for my church hats because I have a small head
4.0,My daughter really liked this and it has a decent clasp and chain for the price.  The weight feels good and is comfortable to wear.  I would consider this a great gift for a teen (it's tagged that it's for those 12 and older).  Older teens or adults might feel that the quality is a bit lacking; though it's a good value for the price.  I would buy again.<br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,A lot smaller than I thought they would be. I will be wearing them at a wedding.
4.0,This sweater easily pairs with different clothing which is something I look for when I buy clothes. I recommend this product.
4.0,It was a cute valentines gift for my husband.  Some of the engraving was shallow which made a couple words harder to read.  Overall though I like it.
4.0,Due to past reviews I got a size bigger than I would normally wear but I should have got my actual size. I normally wear a large or XL and I ordered a 1XL it still looks cute but I definitely would have for just fine inn my normal size. I would say these are true to size it was delivered in a timely fashion and is high quality material. I would definitely recommend. I did receive a discount in trade for my honest unbiased opinion.<br />Update- they were awesome and exchanged my order no problem my only complaint is there is a HUGE difference between size L and XL! The XL was long like a tunic but looked like a box on me it was so big the L fits me like a normal shirt not long enough for lenggings and is much more fitting I do like the shirt I feel I would have givin this five stars if they had a size between those two to accurately fit.
4.0,I like the sturdiness of the product.  The colors are great. I just wish the lens were a little darker.
4.0,"It's kind of big but that's ok cause I rather buy bigger clothes then smaller obviously... But the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's all made by hand, is cotton and thread, beautifully done, it's something that I would save and pass on to a grandchild."
4.0,"ORDER A SIZE .5 SMALLER. THEY RUN LARGE ON THE HEEL. The support is ok, kind of hurts my arch after standing a while. Still better than 10 dollar slippers but gah the price is a little nuts for this ..."
4.0,Size was perfect and comfort is great.  I would recommend these socks.
4.0,"Ordered size 7. I'm 5'1, 130lbs, usually size 4/6 in jeans. Normally wear 28/29/30&#34; inseam. These jeans are juniors sizes but they are stretchy and run a little big. The color was dark and I liked the whiskering on the thighs. I don't think it stands up to the &#34;butt-lifting&#34; claims but they are comfortable and easy to move in. They are Capri length but I'm short so they fit like regular jeans (which is what I wanted). I'm going to return them, BUT I am ordering a size down. I've attached pictures."
4.0,"Good quality fabric and nice colors. The one odd thing, which I didn't notice when ordering, is the drawstring belly-button hole at the front. We'll probably sew it up and remove the drawstring. Look closely at the photo to see the hole. It's bigger than it looks there."
4.0,Size L<br />Like everyone else said the fabric is cheap but fits nice the only part I didn’t like was where it held in at the sides rubbed
4.0,Cute little dress up earrings for kiddos. A couple broke easily while trying to put on
4.0,"I really like this piece, very beautiful and great for warm weather. Would've given 5 🌟 if fit was better. A little larger than expected so I'll be breaking out the sewing machine. I ordered a medium and am a 36d so I ordered medium to accommodate my busy but I could've gotten away with a small."
4.0,"I'm giving 4 stars only because the sash wasn't fully sewn.  It should be an easy fix, but it was annoying that it came unfinished.  The dress is fine overall.  Fun colors and I like the pockets!"
4.0,A cheap and realistic alternative with a short lived finish and sticky springs. Worth the money if you want to go cheap occasional wear.
4.0,Cute pants. Im more on the curvy side soo it was a little snug but wearable.
4.0,The band is pretty comfortable but the pins that were sent with it were too long and after I found the proper length pins the band was extremely hard to put on my timex watch.  Barely fit the curvature of the watch and ends were extremely tight.
4.0,"Just perfect unless you have big size 10 feet like me, lol"
4.0,"Mom wife like it, quite &#34;sporty&#34;, and fun."
4.0,"Was received quickly and am very happy with it. Quality appears to be excellent. Have not worn yet, but am sure I will be very happy with it."
4.0,"I love this dress! The only problem is that the pictures make it seem like a nude color and the actual dress I was sent is off-white. It’s still a beautiful dress that I love, but it’s not nude!<br />It’s also not lined and very see-through.<br />For the price, I’d definitely buy it again."
4.0,"Nice shoe, very thin"
4.0,This dress is so cute! A little thin on the material but would be a cute summer dress and it’s very pretty. Worth the price.
4.0,I purchased this with high hopes. The shirt is nice it just really does not look well on my body type so I will not ding the seller for that. The lace is not connected on the bottom so it tends to move around a lot instead of staying flat. looks like the picture and is true to the description.
4.0,They are super pretty. The post of them are just a lot shorter then I thought they would be. So the don’t pass though all the way.
4.0,lining falls out with water wear.  I had to glue it in.
4.0,"Feels a little big on the sides, but really nice overall."
4.0,"The charm is great, though a bit larger than expected. The low star rating is for the necklace that lost its shine and looked cheap almost immediately. I realize this is not real silver but it should’ve looked nice for more than a few hours. I put the charm on another chain I own and it looks nice. So buy this for just the charm and you’ll be happy."
4.0,"They fit as expected. The quality of these water shoes met my standards. My son says they were comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was because it fell apart at the seams after 10-15 uses. My son is hard on shoes to begin with, so I'm not sure if the seller is totally to blame."
4.0,Liked the design graphics on it. I have a hat collection just nvr wear them.
4.0,"I had written a very good review for this item when I first got it, but after using them for a while, I found the seams, coming apart. I loved them so much that I re-ordered another set for my daughter. I am not a big person. I weigh only 125 pounds. I am so disappointed. I have only had them 2 weeks. Can I get a refund?"
4.0,"I was drawn to the cheery aqua color of this dress. The citron accents give it a tropical feel. This is the standard bandage dress with a mesh ruffle at the knee. The zipper is nice and strong, though you can just pull the dress on because of the wide neckline. My only complaint is that the arms were very tight. I couldn't lift my arms past a 45 degree angle. I felt very constricted. My arms are toned, but not at all large. I think I may have needed to size up for a better fit. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The large fit except for the arms.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Really hard to put on but very pretty.
4.0,gave them to my wife. They look a little girly to me.<br />all in all nice pair of shades! BUY THEM!
4.0,But recipient loved it. And always gets compliments on how cute it is!
4.0,So far so good. It’s cute and a lot nicer to wear in the heat than the thick wide one that came with it.<br /><br />Update. It catches on everything unfortunately. It’s cute for special occasions but not everyday.
4.0,"good material, its shape is a little awkward but I like it."
4.0,"I gave this bra 4 starts instead of 5 only because I didn't buy it with the intentions of it providing lift or seamlessness.  I bought it with the intention to create cleavage and more bustiness under a corset.  It worked out perfect.  I wear a 32-D so I am like a large C but because my band width is small my cup size goes up to a D.  The bra comes with padded adhesive nipple pasty's too. I have not used these yet and I suppose you could wear them under the bra too to protect your nipples if you are concerned about the adhesive.  It is a breathable bra and it is super adhesive.  Since I was wearing it under a corset I cannot really comment on it's actual lift and secureness throughout the evening because corsets keep everything lifted and in place.  I would however recommend it under a really tight shirt.  The size was perfect for me.  I actually cut some of the bra off (with the plastic on) around the top edges.  I did this because my corset was low cut.  I am happy with my purchase.  I would say that it can be worn 2 - 3 times with natural child bearing breast like mine because I require more support.  This bra would be perfect to be worn many times though for my daughter whose ""girls"" are still perky and unphased by gravity due to youth and no children or for anyone with breast implants or a breast lift..  Just my honest well rounded opinion, no pun intended  :)"
4.0,"Beautiful shirt! I got the wine color. It looks great on, too. I ordered a size up so I would have extra room. If I ordered my size I wouldn't have been able to wear it."
4.0,This dress is perfect for me it fits snug and it's very comfortable. I'm glad I bought this perfect by I am five foot four and about 125 lb so a size small fit perfectly you will not be disappointed
4.0,Kind of makes you look pregnant but it is cute
4.0,"Unfortunately if you are big-busted this dress runs small. It is light and airy and appears that it would be very comfortable, but it's too tight in the bust area for me. it's very cute on, and I'm hoping my daughter loves it as much as I do."
4.0,Love this top.  Is so soft and comfy.  I've gotten lots of compliments on it.  The only thing I don't like is the large doesn't go all the way around.  It would be 5 stars if it did!
4.0,Bought them for my girlfriend because I have hard wood floors and she gets cold feet. So boom solution. She loves em. They don't hold up so well in the wash. Good deal though.
4.0,"Fits perfectly from the bottom, straps are a bit tight between the armpit and chest, otherwise very comfortable, I'm 5'5 193LBS ORDERED XL"
4.0,love it but just wish the tie pin had black like the cuffins
4.0,"Very pretty. Lightweight and great for summer. I'm 5'2 and the waist doesnt fall right, making it difficult to tie and wear comfortably."
4.0,"It is a very nice bracelet and so is the message, but the charm falls off very easily. Be careful with that."
4.0,"Great quality, but much bigger than expected!  Ordered the Medium 1-3 yrs and these look like they would fit a 10 year old.  I'll save them.....for the next 5 years."
4.0,False advertising associated with product.  This cloth does NOT polish brass!
4.0,"Very nice, we'll see how it holds up over time.  I like the double layer style and it's fairly easy to clasp.  Shiny and pretty."
4.0,I've received a lot of compliments on these earrings! Different style so very original yet pretty and feminine.
4.0,"Still getting used to having all my usual wallet stuff in my front pocket, but don't miss that giant 'brick' of a wallet in the back. It doesn't hold unlimited amounts of currency like my old money clip did, but it didn't hold credit cards and ID like this one. All in all, it's an improvement."
4.0,The chokers were actually all a great fit. The clasps on some are a little weak but regardless I still liked them.
4.0,Too tight for me around the ankle. I cut them and then they were okay. Other than that they were awesome. Very durable and great material.
4.0,"I personally did not see this gift nor several others. They were sent to my daughters, sister, and sister-in-law. Best I can tell you, they are wearing them and no complaints."
4.0,"Not bad sunglasses, I got the transparent frames with black shades. I thought they might look good on a man's face, but they are a little feminine looking. Luckily my wife likes them so I gave them to her. I should have bought some neon colored ones since I wanted to have some bold-looking sunglasses. The other plus is that they fit my ginormous head. My head is seriously crazy huge, like 24+ inches in circumference. They fit without pinching or giving me a headache. But to be honest they still look better on my wife, even with her tiny pin head ;)"
4.0,"Great for yoga. The only downside is that if you wash your clothes on hot, everything shrinks but the elastic in the waistband. The waist folds over and looks and feels a bit uncomfortable in that respect. Nice shorts though. Look and feel great with a nice snug fit"
4.0,"This tie is great, exactly what i needed. Cheap material, not quite as thick as i wanted but for the price, its great."
4.0,Fit was tighter than my size.
4.0,"The material is dense and stretchy. Stitches and seems are well done. I normally wear a large or XL shirt. I ordered this in XL and it fits like a medium. This might be just fine for a fit skinny person. Not so flattering for a bigger guy. If you like your clothing tight, order your normal size. Definitely order a size or 2 up if you like a looser fit."
4.0,Great basic jacket. Bought it for Halloween costume and have been wearing it everyday since. It is warm and light. This will be my Fall and Spring jacket.
4.0,"Bought this adorable sweater for my 10 year old daughter. It has a comfortable/cozy fit. Very nice quality. Feels soft, and looks just as pictured."
4.0,Fits as expected.  I bought the blue print and it is not see through!  Love the pockets!
4.0,Bought this item at the request of my son. He likes the fit and color of the durags.
4.0,"I like it, but with these caveats.<br /><br />My first impressions:<br /><br />1. The quality of the leather is not so great. But, I guess you get what you pay for.<br />2. The workmanship also not so great. See the photo for an example.<br />3. Very skeptical about the quality of the buckle's finish.<br /><br />I have been using the belt for about 2 months (couple of days a week). The belt works great. Looks good, too. Though I am not seeing a problem at this time, the buckle is very likely to get scratched and the finish might peel.<br /><br />I wonder how long the ratchet might last, considering the the grooves are made of plastic."
4.0,Super comfy but kind of short. I wear it all the time though.
4.0,"Nice color, slippery material, the headbands are a little big."
4.0,"Its comfortable watch, looks great. Can't bet the price.."
4.0,"Grandson Loves it,"
4.0,"Love that these have the side blocked.<br />Love that they fit over the glasses.<br /><br />Don't love how tight the side arms pinch in towards the back, they are not straight they arc in quite a bit and make them slightly uncomfortable."
4.0,"Product description not accurate. Although I do love the outfit and comfort of it all, this is not a sweat suit by any means, very thin."
4.0,I love it but it's started discoloration. It more copper than silver.
4.0,Very Chic looking. I will love showing it off at Doctors Visits.
4.0,This is not an impact protection case however it does the job of protecting from scratches. A finger print magnet.
4.0,"My wife really likes the glasses and the frames themselves fit her head fine.  The problem is that one of the lenses did not &#34;pop&#34; in very well.  In fact, we had to shave the lens down until it did pop into place and that took most of a day including the use of a hair dryer on multiple occasions."
4.0,Ten bucks can't complian use care to not scratch
4.0,Looks great. Horns were alittle smashed when they arrived but I just put some bags in them over night and they were fine.
4.0,"It's pretty a bit tight I'd recommend a size up, crop top style and stretchy fabric. Not good enough to be used as a nice blazer definitely more of a light cardigan.<br />Overall not bad but I can't use it for work like I planned."
4.0,"I am 5’5, Apple shape and unfortunately this dress was not complimentary to my shape. It was good quality and super cute but I had to return it."
4.0,"I love it, but it's a bit too tight in the chest area and the waist line is slightly high (even for a petite woman)."
4.0,"They're beautiful, and came with a pretty pouch. Unfortunately they had a missing stone when they arrived today."
4.0,Solid for the price
4.0,"I don't really like the waistband on these, the fabric is just rolled over elastic."
4.0,"I got this for my husband to complement our 11 month old's Grogu costume.<br /><br />The material is a smooth polyester or something with the detailing screenprinted on - which is what I expected. It does run slightly on the small side.<br /><br />If you have experienced the quality of officially licensed zip up costume hoodies from Disney or elsewhere, these are nothing like them, so adjust your expectations thusly.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it was exactly as I expected based on the listing and the photos AND because my husband does like it and wears it frequently even though it's a little snug."
4.0,"The bangle is very nice especially for its price, however it was a little bulky."
4.0,"This fits my almost 4 year old like a dress. I cannot imagine this would fit a 7 or 8 year old just the same. My daughter is average height and is slim so my only conclusion is this dress runs small AND short. Other than that, It is a nice, summery dress. The cotton is nice and soft and it also washes well. I do recommend it but if you get the 7 or 8 year size please note it will fit your 4 to 5 yer old well :)"
4.0,"I ordered one size larger than  I typically wear because I love to wear my sweatshirts oversized. However, this did not happen with this item. Even though I ordered on size larger than typical, it fits like my normal size. Also the arms are cut very narrow. Typically I would return an item that has arms that are too narrow because I they feel uncomfortable. However, it is not that bad and for how cheap this item is I decided to keep it. Also, the fabric is decent."
4.0,"This costume is nice quality. It even has a hidden zipper in the front to make it easier for your child to use the restroom, without completing undressing. My only complaint is the fingers are soooo long and it does annoy my son. I don't know a 4 yr old that has long fingers that would need it to be this long."
4.0,"Don't know what I was thinking getting gloves for a 1 year old.  My 5 year old's glove were great, and these were nice, I just couldn't get my little guy to cooperate.  But that was my issue, not the gloves."
4.0,"I'm an adult, and even these ears were big- i resembled more of a bunny; had to show the tail to let people know I was a mouse. Comfortable headband, simple easy costume."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:9accd258110eff340ee58b968247c6d5]] Cute dress, perfect for an Arizona summer. Fit is okay.. It's a little shorter than I had anticipated and a bit tight in the chest for me as the buttons slightly pull. I adore the tone on tone polka dots. It could be a cute summer date night dress. I wanted something cute and cool for around the house."
4.0,Fit well wash first tho
4.0,"This product is cheaply made but def serves it's purpose. I'm one of those people that say ""you get what you pay for"" so having said that, for what I paid for this item, it's not a bad choice. I don't like the removable cup liners but that's not their fault. The fit is exactly as expected, no need to go outside your normal size range."
4.0,"I love it! It's super cute. The underlining is a bit shorter than the picture for the product but that's fine. I'm 36-30-40 and I ordered a medium. It fits well, but the arms are definitely tight. I gave it 4 stars because it's a bit see through, so you definitely have to wear tan underwear."
4.0,Love the shirt. Delivered as expected. Will order again
4.0,Nice soft fabric<br />Good looking
4.0,Got it for a gift and this pair was much better fit.
4.0,My granddaughter looks adorable in her minnie dress as she plays tea party. She loves it.
4.0,"This is a nice product if you use it to cut other people's hair. But I tried to put it on and cut my own hair. Did not work at all. So I gave it 4 stars because it did not work for me., but it is a good product."
4.0,Warm and cuddly. Going to get another one in black. Only complaint is that it's a little pricey for the simple cut of fabric it is. But it's more plush than it looks online. Really nice
4.0,It’s not quite as wide as the Apple version and a little less substantial. It does fit the watch well and the price makes it a bargain.
4.0,The shorts fit rlly good! But the top is a little loose
4.0,I dislike the hook sometimes it hard to hook in them together. Not really worth the money but it do what it’s supposed to do.
4.0,I love this dress. I got a lot of complements on it. Even though it was a little too big around the shoulders area I still love this dress.
4.0,"My daughter loves this. Fits true to size, and perfect for her tumbling class. Good quality for the price."
4.0,"Like the look and very pretty, but they widen at the sides and makes it hard to hold glasses on my head cause they slip off easily"
4.0,The item is too thick and warm for summer. I will use it late fall.
4.0,So fun to wear! Love vintage clothing in my assorted closet!  Thanks
4.0,My son likes the color and looks good on them.
4.0,"Gave these to my daughter and she seemed to like them.  However, she has not use them yet.  Will update later."
4.0,"Not too big, not too small. Unique, lovely color. Handy interior pockets. Useful and stylish."
4.0,The material is not as thick as I expected. I'm 5'2 and 130lbs usually wear a small/medium in bathing suits depending on the style. I probably should've gotten a large because the bottoms are very tight around my thighs and the medium top is a little small for me and I'm a 34D.
4.0,"I am 5'7&quot; and weigh ~123 pounds. I usually wear a women's S/M or juniors L/XL. I ordered the large; it was bigger than I like my shirts to be. The torso part of the shirt was sewn straight down--very boxy and not fitted. The sleeves were the worst part; way too big. So I just flipped it inside-out and took a couple inches off the sleeves and the torso and made it slightly fitted. Now it is perfect!<br /><br />The fabric is paper-thin so you will definitely need a camisole. It isn't very nice on the skin, but not irritating, either. If it holds up in the wash, it will definitely be worth the $7 and 15 minutes I spent on it!"
4.0,"The bracelet itself is absolutely gorgeous. It's super sparkly and looks very expensive. I wore it for my wedding and received tons of compliments. However, I have very thin wrists and these were WAY too big. I tried to get them resized at a jewelers and was told that it would ruin the bracelet because it's not real silver. I made it work by resizing it myself at home, but it was a bit inconvenient."
4.0,"I got these because they matched my scrubs. I didn't think they would last throughout my clinicals at the hospital ... Needless to  say, they were comfortable and lasted through surgical sessions of 6+ hours standing up. They are machine washable - which was great  and frankly, I can't say a single negative thing about it other then - I JUST DID IT!!! :D"
4.0,"THIS IS OK IT WORKS FOR WHAT I NEED IT FOR, BUT i WISHED i HAD GOTTEN THE LEATHER ONE IT WOULD LAST LONGER"
4.0,Muy buena!
4.0,For comfort get a size bigger. It is a nice jumpsuit however it was made different than the pic
4.0,I bought these for my sister. She loves it. Perfect fit on her face.
4.0,Its exactly as pictured it's not plus size tho. Order a size up if u want that plus size fit
4.0,"to be overly critical, when the wipe and glass case (cloth) are included in this case, it can seem a little snug. however, other than that, perfect fit"
4.0,"Overall the watch is pretty,  but very hard to adjust the strap."
4.0,"Very nice material, size correct and washes up great"
4.0,Overall this is a very nice dress the only complaint I would have is that it looks a little loose when it's on and I ordered my dress size that I always have. Still a very good product.
4.0,The clasp is not easy to use but I didn’t expect anything great given the price. So I am satisfied with the product overall and it served the purpose
4.0,"Super cute, bigger than I anticipated."
4.0,"I bought a few of these as a gift for someone who is relatively petite but doesn’t like clingy tops, nor does she like them too shirt. I ordered medium they were perfect - she loves the look and the fit!"
4.0,"My daughter tested these for me, since one of my legs probably wouldn't even fit into them. She's an excellent test subject because she knows clothes. The first thing she mentioned was the many pockets. She said that there's plenty of room for everything she needs and they're comfortable. She wears them to her weightlifting class and they work well for that. The second is that they are stylish.<br /><br />The only complaint is that one of the pockets had stitching that unraveled the first day she wore them, making that pocket unusable. This wasn't a big deal to her, since there are so many other pockets. Maybe we got a rare defect, because everything else seems high quality."
4.0,"I usually wear M but ordered the L. It is a little tight but the material is stretchy enough. Length is good, not too short. Looks just like the photos in the add. Also came very fast. Very satisfied."
4.0,Overall the mask does the trick. It's not going to protect you from disease as it is just cloth. There is no difference between wearing this or pulling your shirt up over your mouth. It is the same level of protection. The mask is comfortable and washable. I did notice that it shrank a little in the wash but overall it's an ok mask that i keep wearing on a daily basis.
4.0,"Appears well made and very pretty. However, I'm in Florida and the inner fabric is hot. Will be great for those who live in cooler weather or during our few days of ""winter!"""
4.0,[[VIDEOID:d8a09a4c3e41f04832e4c725afe21496]] I found this ring to be very unique with a heavy genuine silver band.  The sizing was very accurate and the large simulated Citrine stone looks great and reflects the light beautifully.  Kinda reminds me a a large school class ring.  It appears super nice and comes with a unique bag too.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
4.0,Kind of a basic cosplay piece but the fabric is nice and is well made.<br />The akatsuki clouds are sewn on instead of printed which is nice. They feel like they're made of a satin like material.<br />The headband is ridiculously small. Maybe it would fit an infant but you will definitely need a bigger one unless you plan to cover the sides with a wig.  You will also have to bend it to fit your forehead.
4.0,"This set was super adorable! Love the colors. Quality could be better-both of the ear tassels were gone from the hat before winter was over. But overall, reasonable price, super cute and soft."
4.0,"A little pricey, but great quality.  This wallet also has a great feel and look to it as well.  You won't be disappointed outside of the price."
4.0,"This looks exactly as the picture. It is a replacement for another style red coral necklace. I haven't worn this one yet. It arrived pretty quickly. I thought it would be a slight bit longer, but it is very pretty and I like it."
4.0,"Happy with my purchase. For the price, the fit and look was as expected. The material is thinner than some other yoga/exercise pants but I’m happy with that as i live in warm weather and run a lot. I would buy another pair. My only feedback would be to NOT make the pocket go so deep. It’s too long for most phones."
4.0,"I'm on the fence about this dress. I LOOOOVE the length, the cut, the color, the fabric... It's super flattering **IF** you get the right size. That's the tricky part. A small would have for perfectly if it hadn't been for the very tight elastic sewn into the waist. And the fabric is very clingy/stretchy, so it showed my ribs and the underwire of my bra. So I returned the small and got a medium... Same problem. If I could take out the elastic in the waist, a small would have been perfect. If you have ANY BIT of tummy (or mom belly) or back fat, size up. I'm usually a small/med (or a size 8) but I would probably fit a large simply because of the dang super tight elastic waist. Which is completely unnecessary for the dress, as the fabric is quite stretchy anyway, like I mentioned.<br />I'm 5'2 and 148lbs for reference."
4.0,need more coclors
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter. She loves unicorn and really likes the sandals. However, whenever she walks, it slips around her feet. Overall, it’s good sandals."
4.0,It was a good size a bit long but maybe thats because im a small person overall I really liked the product..
4.0,"These socks are awesome, they're bright and go up to your knee. Its 6 pairs in a pack which it worked for our event. We did the Chicago GLO Run and received good compliments! Only bad thing is one of my friends had a thicker calf the socks didn't go up her muscle. 😕"
4.0,This one seems to run a little large.  I got this in a medium (I am 5' 4&#34; tall and about 135 lbs. most clothes size 4) and this is a little too big.  I felt as though I was wearing a night shirt.  Great to just run out of the house and do a couple of errands though.  For the price I paid I can't complain though.
4.0,"As long as I'm standing up, I LOVE this robe. It's soft and warm and comfortable. Do you hear a ""but"" coming on? The zipper is one way, zip it up from the bottom. It does not unzip from the bottom. So, when you sit down it all bunches up in your lap. It's possible that buying a larger size would improve the situation, but the sizing is accurate  and I don't want to be swimming around in an oversized robe when I'm standing up. I still like the robe, but because of the bunching problem, it is not my favorite."
4.0,Wife had to return first purchase for two sizes larger to fit properly.
4.0,ZIPPER IS ON WRONG SIDE
4.0,Very good quality case was smaller then the picture though
4.0,"I get a TON of compliments on this dress. Material is very stretchy, the buttons on front are merely for show, collar is stiff and kind tight. Looks amazing with a petticoat. I think it was a good purchase on my end and the price was reasonable. I give it 4/5 because the buttons are sewed on very well and had string hanging off of them upon arrival and being brand new. I was going to send back and have them swap out for a new one thinking it was just my dress with the issue but I had read other reviews that had stated the same thing, so be aware you may receive yours like that as well. Overall I am very happy with my purchase, I wear my dress every 1-2 weeks."
4.0,I purchased this for my daughter. And it does fit her almost perfect but she had wanted it a little big because she likes lots of layers. I thought at first this would be enough with the look of layers but she still needed more. She can easily fit a tank under this and maybe a slim fitting tee but other wise its a tad small. Also she is younger and has no chest. This shirt is made for a chest. so the scoop neck is a little baggy on her. I love the extra long sleeves and the long torso. I only wish it would have came in my size. I received this item at a discount for an honest review.
4.0,Fabulous. it is as pictured. the only thing I don't like is the back of the buckle is hallow BUT they do show it in the description. Other than that is great not a cheapie. worth the $ . size is as expected.
4.0,Cute socks...
4.0,"Utilice este producto para subir el nevado del cocuy con una caminata de 12 horas done pase por paramo, superparamo y bosque. Fue una buena elección, cómodos, la talla es la justa pero compre media talla más grande para no lastimarme con las bajadas"
4.0,My son loves the characters. It is not insulated material but it is soft and fits well. Zipper works well.
4.0,loved it just like the 1966 batman show
4.0,Not what I expected but I kept the bag because it is a cute clutch you can carry with you when your out and about.
4.0,Grandson loves it. Perfect
4.0,"I bought this purse in red and black a few months ago. I love it. I have yet to scratch it , and I receive compliments on it all the time because of how amazing it looks"
4.0,"The dress  looks great as expected, also  the material feels  good. The shipment was very fast."
4.0,"They were slightly thinner than I expected., but overall very nice and comfortable. They will be perfect for my halloween costume!"
4.0,"Absolutely love the minimalistic colors and fun cut-outs on this one piece swimsuit! I'm typically a Size Medium and ordered a Size Large due to the &quot;83% chance it runs small factor&quot;, but I would honestly recommend going two sizes up. Fabulous style and awesome quality for a one piece and I cannot wait to wear this to the pool!"
4.0,I was really excited for this product because I have terrible tennis elbow in my right arm.  I was really disappointed in the lack of instruction and directions as to how to correctly put the brace on.  I ended up having to Google the correct application of the brace.  The brace does seem to apply a decent amount of pain relieving pressure.
4.0,"It is a little longer than my 5'2"" daughter expected. It's very pretty and comfy. She enjoys wearing it."
4.0,I love this dress! Especially the POCKETS!!
4.0,Very comfy but leave black fuzzys on everything!!
4.0,"Good, not great. It looks good and you will not be disappointing."
4.0,If you are chesty order at least a size larger. But other wise a nice dress
4.0,"Super cute and fitted. Sadly, I have to return it because it fits me too well. I'm 5' and so it's not short on me at all. However, I am 120lbs (32DD 25&#34; waist) so it does make me look like I have rolls."
4.0,Super easy to attach.
4.0,The length of the product is not adjustable. A belt is required for small people. But overall product quality is great.
4.0,"I have wide shoulders, but this fit pretty well. It’s a tighter fit, not like a boyfriend fit. I would say it was true to size"
4.0,I wear it  as a bathing suit cover up
4.0,"Good quality, great Buy and fast shipping. I would suggest ordering a size or two bigger because it does run small. I am a fairly petite and normally wear a medium and I purchased a size 14."
4.0,Using it for a wheelchair. It helps....just wish there was a bit more padding. It is very comfortable to wear and sometimes I even forget I have it on.
4.0,"My husband like testing out this leather belt, at first I taught it wouldn’t fit him as it look very small but it worked good. My husband is 32W mostly a small so this is a good size if your in that range. The quality of the belt is great, has a lot of insert holes and looks very stylish with jeans!"
4.0,"Works well ! Eant d to see what I would look like with a septum before committing to a piercing. It does make your nose tender after about an hour, so keep that in mind"
4.0,Like the size quality product
4.0,Matches other items very well
4.0,"It’s very beautiful and a nice shape.  The one I received was light in color which is what I requested.  I haven’t installed it yet, so can’t comment as far as performance.  I don’t anticipate any problems though."
4.0,Fits as expected. Sleeves are too long & no info on how to use the Velcro to tighten them. Can't figure it out. I am short but was hoping to adjust the sleeves.
4.0,"Well constructed, solid rubber soles, steel toe, fit pretty snug though. Normally I wear a men's size 9, but these are a bit tight. Hopefully breaking them in will loosen them up some, but if not, these are too tight for the long run. I would recommend, at this time, to order a half size larger than you normally wear."
4.0,"It fits fine except for the boobal area.  My girls are large.  The rest is fine.  Once I get in a pool, the boobal area will fit just fine.  I'm not a fan of the navy blue but who cares as long as it fits and I'm not forced to swim naked at the Y. I'm pretty sure they would throw me out if naked."
4.0,"My son loved this hat.  However after only one season of use at summer camp it started to get black mild spots on the visor (on top and underneath).  I have never experienced a hat doing that in the past.  Yes it was a damp summer, but the hat was dry in his cabin."
4.0,Love these perfect for comfort at work.
4.0,Epi pen user<br /> Great Medical alert
4.0,"I bought these to see if I’d like them, I do."
4.0,It fit just as expected. My hips are small. I inseam to waist is a tad short but over all a comfortable fit.
4.0,"Fit's snug, very warm, and the fleece on the inside feels nice, but like most beanies this one is a little too big at the top. Otherwise, it's so nice that I'm probably going to keep it."
4.0,8 ribs design
4.0,"Material too thin, so it gets a little see-thru when it's stretched. I'm 5' 3&#34; and while the girth of the socks are ok, I wish the length could be about 1 inch longer so I didn't have to stretch it so much. Not the most perfect pair of over-the-knee socks, but not terrible."
4.0,Product good for the money! Shipping double the price. Was delivered in a timely manner.
4.0,"Good quality, but not enough color choices."
4.0,I like it.  It's cute and summery.
4.0,I tried this on and I really like how it looks. I cant wait to wear it out and about.
4.0,Somewhat small in size for a large.
4.0,It fit as it was described. I wanted a semi fitted shirt to layer underneath other clothing. It was very soft and stretchable.
4.0,The gloves are a little small and the leather is thin.  It’s a nice lightweight version of work gloves.
4.0,I love the way these leggings fit. I am a curvy 14 and ordered the large. The material is a little thinner then I prefer but over all in love with these leggings. Color is the perfect blue
4.0,Nice quality and cute design but definitely bigger than most face masks.  Overall though I would buy again.
4.0,Okay if u don't have swollen ankle real bad hard get on and but daughter try love them except top socks seem little irritateing I had same issues but if u have arthritis was hard get on why gave my daughter
4.0,These seem to be comfortable when i tried them on and walked around the house but have not worn them outside yet!
4.0,Used these packing cubes for the first time and find that they do indeed help you pack more efficiently.  They appear to be well made too.  Note that they are called packing cubes but are more soft and bag-like until you fill them up.
4.0,Nice size bag with many compartments. Easy to carry. Looks nice. It will NOT however hold an IPad which is what I was hoping.  A smaller notepad maybe.
4.0,Nice bracelet. Just wish the magnet was stronger as the first one just came off during the day the first week I had it. I reordered as I like the style a lot but watch it constantly as the magnet is no stronger on the replacement.
4.0,"It’s not really an athletic fit. It’s possible that the sizes just fit large and I should have gone down to Medium in 6’ 195 with an athletic build though. So that didn’t seem like the right choice. It is very breathable though. It’s lightweight, the stitching is good, and the colors are deep."
4.0,Nice bathing suit
4.0,"The skirt is soft and very comfortable to wear. The main material is 95% cotton with 5% Spandex. It has only one layer, so very good for summer time. My daughter really likes the pattern. She just falls in love with stars and this is now her favorite outfit. We got the size M which fits my 6 years old daughter (her height is 44”) perfectly, the length is sightly above her knee. It has been wash few times and the fabric still keeps the bright blue color, fantastic!"
4.0,"I’ve been using these goggles for a few months now, and I’ve only had minimal problems with them. They dug into one side of my nose uncomfortably at first (enough to leave a red mark), but after breaking them in with use the problem went away. Otherwise pretty comfortable for hours long use as long as they aren’t too tight. They never leak either!"
4.0,"Comfortable and stretchy fabric, long in length, image is a big light"
4.0,"Style not exactly as advertised in photo,  but close. Comfortable fit, good price."
4.0,"Bought these to wear in uniform, and it's a relief to have the extras and not worry. They're just a tad smaller than I prefer, but that's on me for choosing the wrong size."
4.0,"Very nice material. I am 5’10 and the length was perfect.. something that I usually can never say! Loved this dress, except for the fact I paid extra shipping and recieved it in 4 Days rather than 2."
4.0,"I ordered X-Wide in a size longer than I usually wear, but I could tell that re-ordering in two sizes longer wouldn't matter because the shoe is not deep enough. I was sad to have to return them."
4.0,"The ring is beautiful but I was sent the incorrect size. All of my rings are the same size -- size 8 -- and this one is not that. I ordered 8, I got maybe a 7 or a 6. I can't wear it on the finger I wanted to. It also just doesn't look right because it's obviously slightly too small. It's not at all the same size as my other rings and it's too much of a hassle to return it."
4.0,Thin but work great in vibram shoes
4.0,"Have had it a week, haven't washed it yet, but I like the large shaded area and ventilation.  Only negative so far is that the drawstring closure slips, so it is hard to keep it tight on the back of my head (I prefer that rather than having it under my chin)."
4.0,Really like the hat.  The only issue is the elastic on my ears hurts.  I have to continue to move the band so that my ears don’t hurt.
4.0,Overall the skirt is very good quality considering the price. My only complain is that it's a tad bit short and I'm only 5'1&#34; so that's saying something. I would just recommend that even if you normally wear a size small if you're anything over 5'1&#34; I would go up to a medium for sure. Otherwise pretty good product!
4.0,Nice necklace set
4.0,"I like it very much, but when I put it on or take it off one place look very fragile and I afraid it will broke"
4.0,My grandaughter could not understand which anime they come from...but fit her well
4.0,It’s a little snug at the hip when getting into a vehicle but the length is perfect and overall it’s warm enough for very cold days.
4.0,I'm a fan of tencel fabric. This skirt is really cute and fit as expected.
4.0,"I carry these pretty much daily. They work for what they're meant for: pulling them out of your pocket or purse for a QUICK view of something. They are built to fit everyone so they don't stay on very well. Plus, there isn't a lot of viewing room, if you will (the lenses are real small). However, if you can live with all that and really only need a pair for a quick glance, I recommend them."
4.0,Cute and comfortable.  Not too thick or too thin.  Perfect for my loafers and running shoes.
4.0,The quality of fabric is very nice & soft
4.0,Tight around waist
4.0,There was no give in the neck. Many shirts have an extendable collar which is a great feature. This one did not.
4.0,"This is a nice, very light-weight black asymmetrical tank top and is great to wear in hot weather.  I received a medium sized tank for review and it fits me fine.  I'm 5/9"", 142 lbs and have 34B chest.  I like my tanks real loose, and I would prefer this  to be a little bit looser, but I'd have to get large size for that.  It's still comfortable, very soft and feels good to my skin.  It looks exactly as pictured on the product page."
4.0,Use whenever battery is actually charged. I only use for alarm and there's no way to turn it off when I leave for work. It'll wake you up and piss you off guaranteed.
4.0,"This is really cute! Good colors great pattern. It runs really small though… I would have preferred and XL but will keep the large. For reference, I normally wear a small / med tops and would prefer an XL in this brand."
4.0,The fabric is of a soft material an the pattern complements the top.  The fit is a little small.
4.0,My daughter loves it but too small.  Returned but ordering one size bigger.
4.0,Fantastic product! Still can't figure out what makes a piece of shamwow and a strip of foam cost $15+ but what are you gonna do?
4.0,Native horses are always fun.
4.0,I love this band.  Makes my fit bit look like a watch rather than a fit bit.  Good for dressed up occasions. The only drawback is the weight of the Fit Bit which unless you wear the devise pretty tight will flop around a bit.  I would order the product again.  Looks great.  I have received many compliments.
4.0,"Even cuter in person-the pink is a super cute pink. I found the fit very stretchy and roomy. Obviously the lettering and such is a bit cheap, but what were people expecting at this price point? I love it!"
4.0,Very sweet and pretty charm!!
4.0,"I am knocking off a star because of inconsistent sizing and material...like other reviewers have mentioned, some are softer/stretchier than others and there is no rhyme or reason. I have now purchased 3 black, one gray and one watermelon and they all fit differently and feel different. Most are comfy while two are scratchy. Wish they were more consistent. Will likely try to return the ones that are scratchiest."
4.0,I need more arch support than these offer. I like the style and comfort but....
4.0,Nice wallet and Passport cover
4.0,"While I love the color and the quality is very good, I wish it had a good pocket for my 6plus iPhone. As it stands, none of the pockets inside fit it well and there's nowhere else I can put it, so that's kind of an issue for me. If you have a regular sized phone, you won't have any worries. :)"
4.0,Product is great quality. Runs a little bit big. But that’s ok gives my son room to grow....
4.0,"Purchased to wear to a concert. Was wanting something pretty breathable as other reviews have said. I’d say it is but if you are a post menopausal, hypothyroid lady it may not be breathable enough. I got pretty hot and sweaty but again I am not the best judge. I would have liked it to be a bit longer. I am only 5’4 and it was maybe an inch short for me. When I wear this again I am wearing it with some Capri length leggings just for modesty. It’s made well. The shape is more of a swing dress shape than a T-shirt dress but again it fit well I just prefer more of a fitted shape. This dress is perfect for casual wear. I wore it with open toed booties for a birthday dinner out and then put on converse for the concert for more comfort. My family thinks I’m a nut but tie dye anything is pretty much my whole wardrobe. I will likely order this in at least another color."
4.0,"I would have given these really well made, pretty shoes a five star rating. But, they are one size too small. If you are going to purchase these, order one size up, and they should fit as expected!"
4.0,These were super cute and nice quality but ran small.  I bought a size 12 for my daughter who is just starting to wear 12's (so they should have been big) and they were tight.
4.0,French style charming scarf
4.0,"Bought these for an event, they look pretty good for the price"
4.0,"These are so comfortable and cute, now that I found my size in this style.  I’m 5’7”, 217 lbs, and just bought Terra & Sky blue jean jeggings in 1X, which fit great, except a little big in the waist.  That’s not crucial because they are more high waisted than mid, which the ad where I bought them stated.  I’m so glad because I love high waisted pants…that’s usually all I wear.  So I ordered 1X tropical jeggings and they were so small through the hips legs I walked like a zombie.  Even the waist dug in painfully and I could hardly sit down.  I was worried because some reviews said neither size fit but I tried the 2X and they fit perfectly.  They have the comfort I remember.  The only downside is that cat hair clings really bad to the black background and the pattern doesn’t detract enough.  I have no problem with my brown, purple, and green ones, maroon or any other color.  No more black jeans for me in this brand, as I have a fluffy, white cat.  I had a closet full of these prints in 0X that I was still hanging onto, so I looked for new ones…none in stores and few online.  I hope they keep making these.  I love them!"
4.0,All of the above but lens blur my vision slightly.
4.0,Works as intended.
4.0,This necklace arrived crammed into a box and was separated at one hook.<br />After working with it I got the hook in place. Just hope it did not weaken the<br />point of repair. It is very pretty on the front and is an attractive design.<br />The back is cheaply made but I won't let anyone turn it over. .
4.0,Very soft material and extremely comfortable
4.0,"Very pretty color, with silky fabric. Plain style makes it more of a comfortable intertwining at home dress."
4.0,"Found it to be darker than it looks on the picture, quality is fine though."
4.0,"Thanks to other reviewers and the Gaibest sizing chart I ordered up 1 or 2 sizes to an XL. I'm 5'10"" 165 33-34inch waist. So the fit is NEARLY perfect on the lower half of my body - and really not bad at all on my ""beer belly"", but like the last reviewer said, it is too snug up top (shoulders, deltoids, neck itself). The neck probably fits as far as girth, but I can't get the zipper up the last few inches; it is a matter of broadness of shoulders plus I suppose length of torso. Indeed their standard sizes are probably in better proportion for Asian men. But if I go XXL, I expect it will be a little loose on the legs, maybe the crotch, maybe even the waist or hips or even belly.<br />Otherwise, it is great material and a great realization of the concept. I'll post again about how long it lasts. I think my feet will be cold and sweaty, and the rest of the body will get warm and sweaty, but I'll have to wear it for the several hours I need. As somebody else had posted, though the integral feet are well done, I may cut them off so that the suit stops at the ankle."
4.0,They fit perfectly but i was expecting them to be a bit larger than expected. I would suggest buying a size larger that you think you need. They are made well and light weight.
4.0,fit right good out of washer and dryer
4.0,These seem like great rights however we ended up returning because the color wasn't quite what u was looking for.
4.0,"I'm 4'11 but have bigger boobs and wider shoulder, so I for M. Chest and weist fits perfect, but the off shoulder parts seems pretty wide and I wish it was little more tighter on that part, but over all I like the material, shape and color"
4.0,A great light weight zip up hoodie warm functional and well made for the price
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and it fit as expected, my only dislike are the side pockets. I am not a fan of dresses with side pockets, I don’t recall reading it had side pockets otherwise I would not have ordered. The other detail is the zipper was very flimsy. Other than that, the dress really is very nice."
4.0,"I love the fit of this sweater and it will keep you warm!!! The only drawback it by the second time you wear it, the yarn on the front will start to look very worn and knotty. It's a very flattering sweater though!"
4.0,"Loved it so much, I got one for myself and one for mom. Now two months later the strap is broken and i am not able to use it as a sling wallet. The wallet size and quality seem good otherwise. Really wish it could last longer.<br /><br />Update- 12/04/16<br />They got back by themselves and fixed the problem,Sent me another bag to try.<br />Customer service is awesome.They are open to suggestions, and willing to help out.<br />If you have any problems, get in touch with them.<br /> Will continue to buy from them. I am a happy customer.!!"
4.0,"I was a bit skeptical since the price was so good for 2 pair.  I was pleasantly surprised to find they fit well, have good support and are very comfortable.  I would buy them again for sure."
4.0,Gold and black are great! Only problem was that the silver was bent weird so I can't wear it
4.0,Dress is cute.  Not much give.
4.0,"Great jacket , good size from young to adult"
4.0,"This is a a wanna-be reserve. Mineral glass, not a sapphire or even flame fusion crystal. No ""reserve"" second hand either.  It is a great timepiece for the money though. Meteorite dial and being an automatic a major plus for this pricepoint! Have two!"
4.0,Color blue is a little lighter than picture
4.0,It took a while for this to arrive but I’m pretty excited about it now that it’s here! just in time for cooler temps arriving. This is the “grey” color and perfect neutral colors. I’m 5’ 4” and ordered a small - It’s a great length for my preference and is plenty oversized without being too much.
4.0,They are comfy. I like the color.
4.0,It was well received
4.0,"Beautiful, nicely constructed dress that was simply far too small. Ordered according to the size chart, but had to send back. I would suggest going up at least 1-2 sizes. At 5' 7"", 145lns, I am usually a small, but would need at least a large for this dress to have worked.<br /><br />I also have broader shoulders & a 34DD chest, which may have contributed to the fit, as there is not a lot of stretch in the material.<br /><br />Definitely recommend the dress, as well as being careful with the sizing."
4.0,"Fit as expected. Super cozy and warm for this cold weather. Love the pockets!! However mine had a tear in the left side pocket so I can only use the right one, bummer. Otherwise love it."
4.0,"Very pretty watch, the face is way too large for a female wrist, but the watch and the band are of great quality."
4.0,Wore these to a football game recently and I love the pockets and how soft they are. Only problem is the pair I received had small holes down the front that I didnt notice at first. That's the only reason for the 4 stars
4.0,"The glasses arrived in great condition.  They are very cute.  I purchased them for my two year old daughter.  Both my husband and I wear black plastic lenses and so my daughter wants to wear her sunglasses in the house all the time.  So we purchased a pair for her birthday.  She loves them!  They are too long and being that they are plastic, I don't have the slightest idea how to bend them so they fit on her ears better.  And of course the bridge of her nose isn't quite big enough for the glasses to stay up well.  But honestly I did expect this so I am not disappointed.  They are pretty durable but we have to tighten the screws every so often from her pulling them too wide when she puts them on."
4.0,"Only complaint is that the heart shape isn’t super distinct. Other than that, it’s super fluffy and perfect shade of light pink"
4.0,"The gloves are very form fitting - very comfortable.  My only 'complaint' is that there seems to be bulk at the end of each finger.  Other than that, a great set of gloves!"
4.0,"I found others that were better, this was ok"
4.0,These were very good and now my boots look clean in my closet
4.0,Good quality. Just too small.
4.0,I like the design and style of this shirt! Not crazy about the fit around my waist since I feel it doesn’t accentuate it but overall it feels comfortable. I am sure I will wear this often. I got it in a medium but for a more lose fit I recommend getting it size up.
4.0,"My daughter is very active and runs around--a lot. She goes through shoes quickly both for expanding feet and for running them down. Whether at the playground or school or just general out-and-aboutness, she's never with a pair of shoes for more than two months.<br /><br />These shoes have lasted for four and counting. She claimed these to be a bit small in the beginning, but even after four months she's still fine wearing them (but she'll complain every once in a while they're a bit small). The colors are fantastic; they really popped when they were new. They've faded a bit, but still retain their vibrancy. They seem light (I'm sure they're light on her feet, too), and cushiony."
4.0,I only put that the Fit was as expected because i know they run small. Should've been a little looser.<br />But the material is great.
4.0,It's definitely a blend of material but their alright I got them for Christmas time to have some festive pj pants. They are cut like yoga pants but don't breathe and feel like them. I think I'd like them better if they were more true to size and more of a cotton blend than synthetic.
4.0,"I'm 5ft and 95lbs and ordered an xs. I really like how they fit my upper area (hips, thighs, butt) but I dont like the fit around the ankles. They are a little to flared to be considered boot cut in my opinion. Other than that they are very comfortable and fit great!"
4.0,very nice!😄
4.0,"I am 5 ft 4.5 weighing 128 lbs. Even after washing and drying it, the fabric is quite soft still and did not notice much shrinkage. I did use cold water to wash n low heat to dry. The seam on inside pant leg to ankle before the shoe is 27 inches. The foot portion bottom measures 10 inches long by 4.5 inches wide so it is plenty big for your feet ...sleeves from shoulder outside to white cuff measured 21.5 inches while inside sleeve by the pit was 16.5 inches. Crotch area stitch to top of front zipper was 27.5 inches ...waist is 21 inches across. The white cuff on sleeves is about 2 inches long and 4 wide. It fits baggy on me but using it as part of a pig costume for Halloween but had it been for a pj would have gotten the small instead of medium..."
4.0,"Product was as described, fast shipping very beautiful yet simple gold ball studs. I got these to wear in my second piercing on my ears and they were a nice fit, good size for where I needed them. Very pleased overall."
4.0,"It is a beautiful Bra and the seller had good shipping time. Although the sizing was way off.<br />I wear a US 30G/UK 30F. Ordered this size but the cup was about 4 sizes too small, more equivalent to a US 30D.<br />I am wearing a US 34F right now and the bra is about half that size in the cup.<br />Returning to seller today in hopes of refund so I can buy this bra 4 cup sizes larger than my usual wear.<br />In short, back band true to size,  up-size your cup size by 4"
4.0,"They're light support sports bra with pretty thick padding. They have a little bit of an odor that'll hopefully come out with the wash, but other then that they're good. I love that they're reversible; tan/gray. You can't go running in them, but for light exercises I can't complain. I mean I received 3 of them for 7 bucks sooooo......"
4.0,"Fits perfectly,"
4.0,"i bought this spray because i wear eyeglasses and must wear a mask 99% of my shifts at work and they fog up constantly.<br />The spray works , i walk in and out of coolers and fridges , sales floor and back rooms with constant temp changes that effect my eyewear bad while i have a mask on , steam from dishes and water mist still gets them foggy but my breathing and temp changes dont do much with the spray on where before i was basically blinded, only issue i really have is that i need to re apply every 2-4 days because as glasses wearers we all know, if you have glasses on what ever you are doing its going to hit them and then we need to clean them off so it also clears some of the spray.<br />But over all im pretty happy it actually works unlike some ive tried here and there that basically make streaks and dont do squat"
4.0,Pretty sweet sweater for the price.<br />No complaints from me.
4.0,"The pros is beautiful design,exactly as the pictures showed,I hope I can wear them in many occasions, but the cons is the post are too thin, make my ears uncomfortable, I am afraid my ears will get irritate."
4.0,"Pretty!  Very long to wear as a sarong if you’re a short girl like me. I trimmed the fringe so that it wasn’t dragging on the ground, now it looks great !"
4.0,I purchased this after reading the reviews and upon receiving the package I realized that the skirt is a bit long since I am 5' exact and I am X-Large due to my size on my bottom half. Not bad purchase just I would have to make some adjustments to the length.
4.0,"I took a risk in ordering this dress as I wasn't sure how well it would fit and if the lace ruffle would land in the right spot on my torso. I tried it on and it was a very comfortable fit and I really like it! The lace and skirt has a bit of stretch to it which makes it easy to wear. The length was also perfect. I am 5'8&#34;, 155lbs so I ordered a large just to be safe. I think I could've fit into the medium, but I will be more comfortable in the large.<br /><br />My one complaint is not about the dress quality or fit, but of the seller. The dress smelled VERY strongly of smoke. Perhaps was stored in a place where there is a lot of cigarette smoking? I don't know, but it was an overwhelming odor immediately when it came out of the bag. Hopefully if I drench it with Febreeze it will go away....I don't want to smell like a chimney at the formal event I'm attending!"
4.0,No complaints about it at all
4.0,"This is a pretty effective way to stash id and cash while walking or travelling. But, my problem with it is that the belt stretches so it sags. For example, today i left my phone in its wallet case while i went walking. The case isnt very heavy but i had to keep tightening the belt because of sagging. Will look for another that does not have such a stretchy belt."
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress. However the bust area is rather big on me even tho the rest fits perfect. I ordered a small, im 5'1 34C 26 in waist."
4.0,"I can only speak for feel and fit as I am not able to prove if its actually nitrile.<br /><br />It is black, it is powder free, they fit as I would expect a large to (not to lose or tight) and thin so it doesnt take away my dexterity while using.<br /><br />The only star drop was they seem a few cent more expensive per glove based on a search of other brands."
4.0,Call me picky but I was expecting more cushion
4.0,"I would give this 5 stars if the sizing was correct the first time I purchased it. I am a women's US 12, and after carefully reading the reviews, I chose an XL. When it came I couldn't even get it over my thighs. I reordered a XXL and it fits me perfectly. I wish the fabric had more stretch, but it is a nice denim skirt. Love the fact the pockets are actually usable!<br /><br />I am 5'6&#34; and it comes up to my belly button and hits about 2in above my knee. Length is ideal for tights and leggings, even if you have some extra baggage!"
4.0,The quality kinda sucks and they adjust weird but they’re cute ig. Wouldn’t 100% recommend
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected for the size I chose, otherwise good quality, came on time and well packaged."
4.0,i got 20 pieces but i got a bunch that look a lot alike. wish it had a little more veriety.
4.0,"My daughter and I used these in 6 inches of snow in Alberta, CA.  Mine worked great and kept my feet very dry.  No rips, cracks, or leaks.  My 12 year-old daughter's got a small crack in them after one day's hiking.  However, she was a lot harder on them than I was.  Just something to keep in mind.  Probably not good for heavy use, but great for light to moderate use."
4.0,Small with enough room for some essential things. Very handy and looked quite good.
4.0,"Jersey fits well however, it does not stretch  and  doesn't layer well. But fits well and looks great! However slightly off white out of the box."
4.0,The dress was nice. It fits well unfortunately I was shipped the wrong color and it was not ombré.
4.0,"Because of other reviews, I was comfortable ordering a size down from what the size chart suggested, and that was nearly perfect, though we could have used an extra inch or two in the skirt, but that is a common problem for my daughter.  She was looking for a white lace dress and settled on this one, even though the description said cream.  We were pleasantly surprised to receive a white dress after all, so if it is important to you that the dress be cream instead of white, you might not be as pleased as we were."
4.0,Love these but unfortunately they get pilly and very linty so have to buy new ones every year<br />Fit great!!
4.0,"very comfortable, soft, and breathable. A bit smaller than expected but still a good fit."
4.0,"Super cute dress! It was a bit long, but I'm short (5'3&#34;). I received a lot of compliments!"
4.0,Nice big sweater.
4.0,This is very cute. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the hook on it is light weight and I was worried it would break causing me to lose my keys. I replaced the hook with a heavier one that I had at home.
4.0,Not stretchy enough they fit loose
4.0,"I'd give 5 stars if they had fit my brother's feet. He's an 8m and they were too big. So unfortunately, as much as he loved them, I had to return them. With that being said, make sure you order a full size smaller than your actual size."
4.0,Lots of compliments. Read reviews for sizing but still a bit large for me.
4.0,"I read to size up.  I normally wear a medium, but purchased an XL.  The bottoms fit perfectly.  The top was still too tiny.  Not skimpy just didn't hold the boobs at all.  I would say the XL top would be a B cup perfectly.  Order this outfit specifically for Burning Man.  Ran into a lady with the same outfit.  Looked great on her.  Also I have machine washed the bottoms and lined dried and it came out like new.  You certainly cannot beat the price point."
4.0,"The balls on these are a bit large, I'm sure it was stated in the description but I didn't see it. I.havent had any other issues other then that. Nice set"
4.0,"This top is lovely. Extremely short for a dress, but beautiful worn as a tunic. I wear it as a long too with skinny jeans and heels. I am 5'10&#34;, 190lb, 40C. Ordered the 2x. All things in this brand run 2 sizes small. My one complaint about this topic is the material seems very thin and flimsy. It did pull a little bit in the wash on delicate cycle cold.  Kind of expected more for a $20 top."
4.0,I love it! But the closure for the barbell fell off and wouldn't stay on. I just replaced it with a new screw and it's perfectly fine.
4.0,"Cute colors,  liked it"
4.0,"I initially wrote a 1star review because I never received them. They were held up even by today’s standards. I was so excited to finally get them, but I cannot use them in capacity for which I bought them. I work in the OR. The magnification area is so small that the ridge of my face mask obscures half it. Graciously I was issued a complete refund. These would be a nice pair of glasses for an application other than what I purchased them for."
4.0,"Muy largo demasiado , pero muy bonito"
4.0,Order two sizes up for proper fit per size chart. Great suit for swimmers and water exercise.
4.0,Exceptional customer service.<br />Fabric is extremely comfortable.
4.0,absolutely love the color on this!! i typically wear a 14-16 and got the xxl. it fits super well. the only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars was because I wish it was a bit longer
4.0,Product is well made.  Very plush for baby.
4.0,"The velvet was nice, suoer comfy.<br />The length was SUPER short! Like club dress short!<br />The chest area, there is SO much fabric and the shoulders are soooo thick. Im pretty small in the chest and it made me look and feel like a linebacker!"
4.0,"the decorative baseball hat for girls &  woman is nice, colorful & in chicago, illinois we need much color as it is a long cold winter we have had. I feel that I will purchase more in  different colors a small lquanity for the  girl;s at my church ages fourteen through seventeen, some of them love coloful caps.  A good fine.  thank you."
4.0,A little snug. I should have sized up. I bought a large.
4.0,It is very pretty but you need to order a size larger because it runs small and if a man better order 2 sizes bigger
4.0,Great thick fabric but snugger than my samba dress. A good 12.
4.0,"Could be cheaper price but worth buy, good place for an A.A. medallion"
4.0,"The product photo was somewhat misleading. Although the title clearly says &#34;Mirror Lens,&#34; I somehow missed that, going by the photo itself, which clearly shows what appear to be dark lenses. Yet the ones I received were very shiny/mirror-like, which just isn't what I was looking for (and is why I will be returning them).  However, if you're indeed looking for mirror lenses, then rest assured that the photo does not do the true shiny mirrory-ness due justice."
4.0,Super cute but it's runs small. I felt like the 3x was to snug in the tummy area
4.0,"Great, but can not wash. It comes apart."
4.0,"Nice, as expected..."
4.0,The only issue with this leotard we have is trying to determine the front vs the back.
4.0,A little tight in shoulders. Fits a little small. Get 1 size bigger than you usually would wear.<br />Overall it does what i bought it for. Keeps me dry and is long enough to keep pants dry too.
4.0,Popped quickly
4.0,"i bought this for my brother and he liked it so much , and its dureble too"
4.0,"Fit is perfect. I’m 5’10”, 170ish and athletic build. Neckline is a little higher on the chest than I’d normally buy ( bottom of V hits about 1,5” below sternal notch). But fits well and so I’ll keep it bc I like it otherwise and it’s cute patterns."
4.0,I had to send it back because I bought a small when a medium would have been better. Unfortunately I decided I didn’t love the red as much as I thought and there isn’t a green with the flower print which is what I think I’d like. But it is well made and I’d love to have one!!
4.0,Great bag for my 10 year old niece.
4.0,"Pretty simple pajama pant. 100% cotton so it's comfortable, blue-color is cute for my daughter. Size was true. It runs a little long (she's 5'2), so someone taller would be okay. Price seems high on amazon though ($18)."
4.0,This was part of my grandson's Christmas gift.  I think he likes it fine.
4.0,Too short and small. Petite sized.
4.0,"The ear rings were of good color, quality and size.  They were purchased for my future daughter in law for Christmas gift  and she loved them."
4.0,Wallet is roomy and plenty of card slots. The slots are VERY tight. The color is bright enough that it doesn't get lost in the depths of my purse and that's a happy thing. The price was right and I hope the wallet will last a long time.
4.0,I got this in a small. I am 5'6&#34; and 120 lbs. The length is perfect to wear with leggings. The color looks just as pictured. I may get the grey too. Wish they had it in black.  It is slightly boxy. Wish it tapered more at waist. For the  price you can't go wrong with this.
4.0,"I like the item, just wish it was actually a jacket and not a button down sweatshirt. It's warm and fits great though."
4.0,I don't like that there isn't a slot for the filter. The filter moves around while you talk since it is between the mask and your face free floating.
4.0,"Is Beautiful, always check the size, run small, and is short. but the Fabric is Perfect. Love it"
4.0,The colors are pretty but VERY subtle.  A great item but be prepared to have a hard time figuring out which color is which.  They are beautiful though and my daughter loved them.
4.0,"They feel a little weak and needed a bit of careful adjustment to sit properly on my ears, which I assume the fitting portion is normal. Bought these to use with a pair of elven prosthetic ears to hide the last bit without needing extra latex to blend out. They cover the portion well and don't look too flashy for the item.<br />As for being able to last, they are plated nickel, so after a couple of years they will end up wearing down. A coat of clear nail polish was enough to protect from an allergic reaction from the nickel. I would be cautious if my allergy was a bit worse than my usual reaction. Overall though, for the price it is a good item."
4.0,For a dinner party St Pattys
4.0,Nice and comfortable socks
4.0,"I wish the straps were thicker, they're just tiny strings and looked like they were already starting to fray when I took it out of the package. But I can fix that before any malfunctions happen! I've bought similar tops like this before on Amazon and they're all hanging on by a thread so I guess its something that should be expected. I love these types of tops for summer, they're cute and comfortable."
4.0,Cute earrings for the price.  I was a little disappointed because the edges are white leather and it looks cheap but you get what you pay for. They are lightweight and very cute.
4.0,This tank top is lovely but the size runs a bit small. I ordered a medium size and it felt more like a small.
4.0,"I was hesitant about using one of these, but my old standard wallet was driving me crazy with this big lump in my back pocket.  I have been using this product for about a month and absolutely love it.  I probably have more cards than I need in there , but it works great for what i need it for.  Great product, came on time and as expected.  quality seems solid.  i would recommend to others ."
4.0,"This dress is cute and comfortable, but it smelled really strange when it arrived. It took a couple of washes to get rid of the smell. The cut is nice as it allows plenty of movement. The fabric is a mid weight tee shirt type fabric with a vibrant space print. My daughter and I both adore the print. The stitching seems solid with seams both serged and finished. The skirt is a good length for modesty while still being easy to move it. A nice mix of feminine and practical. Love that girls are finally getting clothes with space, dinosaur, and technology themes."
4.0,These are cute little earrings that gives you an instant royalty feel even when they are a clip on.  They are made of plastic but not that noticeable while wearing but I would only use them with my hair down as the clip on is visible.  I love how nicely they came packed as well.
4.0,"Fit well, arrived timely, just wish they weren't so expensive!"
4.0,"I think it looks super cool online.  I realize its wild and colorful, unfortunately in person it looks more garish than stylish....The bubble gum pick is more prominent in person; so if that appeals to you go for it.  If it doesn't, beware."
4.0,this is great its payed for itself the second time i used it. why not the first time because you have to win something to be able to save it. just do not lose your keys i did and had to purchase another one because i had to bust it open. but over all its fits in your back pocket like a wallet. i love it i always come away with something from the casino.
4.0,I liked it but the blue was not what I expected.
4.0,Cute but a little smaller than the previous wallet I bought.
4.0,Looks good but shrunk somewhat after being washed in cold water and air dried.
4.0,"Product exactly as expected, does what it should.  Difficult to get on with arthropathy disease, and living in warm climate tends to chafe around bottom band during warmer months, but that is to be expected with type of material content. Would highly recommend these."
4.0,Cute skirt! I am 5'6 size 2 and it was a little tight in the hips but fit around the waist and the length was fine
4.0,"Nice slouched fit. It is not as distressed as it looked in the photo, it's darker navy."
4.0,Love these earring would have rated 5 stars but 2 of the 8 pair had extra extra long bars so I cannot use those 2 pair. Otherwise pretty happy with this purchase
4.0,Its beautiful but I thought it would be more bigger . Its a very elegant purse!!
4.0,Very nice I bought L it's good but if you 135lbs you can buy M
4.0,Wasn't what I was looking for but perfect for my mother
4.0,The gloves are extremely comfortable and fit great!
4.0,"The item arrived within the window (actually a bit earlier) and is adorable. The pendant is surprisingly heavy given how little I paid for the item. A couple of the rhinestones were loose when it arrived, so I painted over them with some clear nail polish to prevent others from detaching. Other than that, it's perfect and goes with a variety of outfits. Very fun."
4.0,"Loved these pants. Very stretchy, so as I wore them they seemed to grow.  But they were perfect for our 1969 celebration of the moon landing."
4.0,Love them! Great price!
4.0,"Fit as expected.  Body skimming and roomy without adding bulk.  Shrunk a little after 3 washings, but still fits well"
4.0,It not very soft at first but you get used to it. Its also my first pair of shirt stays so maybe I need to get used to em. Been doing good so far tho.
4.0,It’s a cool sweater.
4.0,"Wish I would have paid closer attention. This item is non-returnable and does not fit as advertised. My wrist is 7” and the description says from 6”. It is beautiful, but a bit of a challenge to adjust, and as I said, it won’t adjust down enough for me anyway. I did get immediate response from Oitman, no trouble with seller."
4.0,"A good tie, but a bit narrower than I preferred. Nice material and very convenient having the clip on."
4.0,SUPER value for the money. Exactly what I was looking for to use permanent vinyl on. Only reason for 4 stars is because about 1/3 of them had rough edges that needed buffing. Other than that they are perfect.
4.0,Really like these leggings they fit great a bit sheer but I wear a longer shirt to cover my bits
4.0,Sizing runs small. Cute and seems well made.
4.0,"This dress won't wrinkle which is great. Ordered for my upcoming Christmas party, thought of returning because it's a little more &#34;clingy&#34; than &#34;shifty&#34;. It's also longer than pictured. It's just a bit higher than my knees. Overall I like the dress so I'm keeping and hoping a body smoother helps the look. I was afraid if I ordered a larger size it would be too big through the bust and armpit areas. Maybe I can lose a couple lbs before my party."
4.0,"Pendant is nice, but the chain and especially the clasp are tiny. I have small hands and great dexterity and this necklace hard to manipulate. My neck is a little discolored from wearing it. I love the pendant so I will just find a new chain."
4.0,"Band contours to wrist perfectly and has a very light fit. The band itself is WAY long however, like I must use first notch. The run off goes all the way up to watch face, but was able to fold it down and in. Was honestly expecting to have accidentally selected a men’s size. Overall, would not change a thing - except length of band ;)"
4.0,"It's a T-shirt.  Really, that's all it is.  It's the most awesome t-shirt you'll probably ever own, but it's not as dressy as it looks in the advert.  Up close, you can see that the details on the sleeves are made of puff-paint.  I've never EVER seen anything decorated with puff-paint that I'd consider wearing... until this.  It's kinda cool.<br /><br />I pair it with skinny jeans and some leather boots, and use it for those semi-dressy, but kind-of-casual, events like social gatherings with my spouse's coworkers or with my in-laws and it's stylish enough to be polite, but comfortable enough to feel relaxed in.  Plus, if I (or my nephews) spill guacamole on it, I can just chuck it in the washer.  :)  It's only a t-shirt, after all.<br /><br />This falls nicely off of a large bust and is flattering for a plus-sized figure.  I wear a size 18W jeans, but usually a size 20 top because I've got a large bosom (42F).  I ordered the 3XL and it fits great.  I'm also tall, almost 5'11&#34;, so a lot of shirts are short on me and 'full-length' sleeves are only 3/4 on me - BUT this shirt is a good length and the sleeves actually go all the way to my hands.<br /><br />Overall, I like this shirt a lot and I'd buy it in a half-dozen colors (jewel-tones) if it were available."
4.0,Love this dress...it fits really good.
4.0,Love the dress and bold colors.  The bust is small.
4.0,The top is a bit rigid. Perhaps supposed to be pushup? But the bottoms are very flattering for my not-particularly-flat tummy while still being fun and stylish.
4.0,Stretches out after wearing
4.0,They stayed attached to the suitcases on its first flight to Copenhagen
4.0,Need to be bigger for a Samsung Note 8 I have to do some arrangement to used. Because not close the size of the phone if you don't place a Velcro on it.
4.0,"It’s small but it fits my breast pump and that’s what I wanted it for ! So I can take it to work ! Only down fall is that the suction piece that connects to the bottles doesn’t fit but I don’t mind that popping out of the bag ! As long as the pump itself fits, breast pads, storage milk bags and a deodorant I have in it fits I’m good ! So it’s small but quite roomy !"
4.0,This product is great for those wanting to look their best and keep your shirts tucked in at all times.  The straps are comfortable and adjustable.  The alligator clips are sturdy and will not tear your shirts.  I recommend this version less than the foot strap version.
4.0,some what small but cute still
4.0,Girlfriend likes it. Not too warm for mild weather use.
4.0,"I think it is very cute , but I guess it looks like it would be mote of a Crepey material in photo.<br />I bought one size larger for flow, which is great."
4.0,Love the bag and the little wallet that is too small to hold anything but a couple of cards.
4.0,So very cute! Unfortunately it was too small. I gifted it to a family member and they are loving it.  I would recommend ordering up a size or 2. In my case it fit someone who would have ordered 2 sizes down.
4.0,The mask it well made but unfortunately it was too big for my face. It fit the width of my face from ear to ear but it was way to long and created some bagginess under my chin. The fabric is nice and so are the mask strap clips.
4.0,"Ok so, the gloves are extremely soft and warm. My only concern is the size and the strap. The size fit my hand but didn't fit my fingers as i have smaller fingers than my palm if that makes sense. My fingers are shorter than the material so there's about a half of inch left when I put them on however the glove fits my palm perfect &#34;XL&#34;. Regarding the strap, I fail to see the reasoning for it unless it's purely decorative as it doesn't really offer the ability to wrap around your wrist to make the gloves tighter. Other than those two details the gloves are wonderful."
4.0,possibly a bit large for me but I do like it
4.0,They are cute but too tiny.
4.0,Gave to sister as a gift. Chain broke the first day. The heart itself is very pretty.
4.0,This dress is super cute but unfortunately it was too big in the arm holes so the sides dropped.  It’s possible that washing and drying the item would take take of that but I wasn’t willing to take the risk.  Overall though the dress fit my body like a glove and perfect length
4.0,This is a pretty necklace.  The chain is very dainty .  A bit longer than I prefer.  I can  wrap it around  my neck and then the &#34;love&#34;  hangs where I like it.  My neck has  become pretty  sensitive  to  jewelry  and  this one  does not  make it break out in a rash. That is  great.
4.0,Love the color and style. Just not interested in ironing after each wash.
4.0,"Wow! I can’t praise this product enough. Everything was perfect.. the quality. The size fit me perfectly, I thought it will be long as I am a bit on the short side I am 5’2 and weigh 163 pounds.  The Large fit perfectly. The dress is even more beautiful in person. The embroidery and stone work exquisite. I got so many compliments and a lot of people have come on here to order some hehe. I have ordered one more for myself and thinking of ordering even more. Thank you for making me look beautiful on Eid. Highly highly recommend this dress."
4.0,"I really like how thin and dainty this is but I was afraid it would be shoddily made. So far, it’s held up but I wouldn’t try to shower/ sleep with it on.<br /><br />It’s very easy to layer with other bracelets and complements almost all kinds of jewelry. I often forget it’s on my wrist but there’s also the fear that it isn’t there because it fell off. The clasp is strong and there are different rings to adjust the length but I can really only go up one before it feels tight.<br /><br />If you like thin dainty jewelry then this will work for you."
4.0,These look great when they work.  First set had one side that went dim.  Seller did send another set that seems functional
4.0,"Thankfully I read the reviews so I knew to get a size Medium (normally a 32/34 B-C). This is very comfortable as well as being much prettier than your average nursing bra. Because it's cotton and has a seam across the cup, there are some shirts it won't work with. But I haven't had much trouble with that. I love that I don't have to unsnap and resnap - just push the cup aside for nursing. Sometimes when I readjust I have to straighten out the pad, which can curl under when you push it aside. But this hasn't been a major problem for me. I wear these every day."
4.0,"Great fit, hides all the right stuff a 50+ gal needs hiding. I hear it with leggings around the house, with skinny fit jeans when I'm out and about. Because I'm tall, 5'9&#34; the shirt doesn't cover as much as I'd like to wear it with leggings out of the house. An average height gal would probably be OK though. The shirt is very stretchy with sleeves that actually make it to my wrists. It washes well and has gone through the dryer a few times. I noticed it is starting to pill up though so hanging to dry would probably be a better idea. I have a small chest and it fits nice in that area. The material is thin, I wear over a camisole which gives me the warmth level I need in winter in the house. I would purchase a shirt from this vendor again based on this experience. 4 stars because of the pilling."
4.0,Fabric was not as shiny as the picture.
4.0,"Lenses are very large, which I think will be nice for computer work. Definitely getting what you pay for when it comes to the quality of the glasses. They are light weight and wear like the free glasses for 3-D movies at the theater, just round and big."
4.0,"If you place the antlers on the front windows, they may fall off at speed so place them on the rear windows and keep them up. Also, we couldn't find a way to put the tail on our Prius V but they are still worth it!"
4.0,great sunglasses. Fit great and look good.
4.0,"You can run out of space quickly if your range gear includes electronic earmuffs and quality shooting glasses. Fortunately an additional small fanny pack that attaches to the main bag, or on your belt, is included."
4.0,Love this dress. It is the perfect dress. I had to size down to fit perfectly. It makes you feel sexy and yet not too revealing.
4.0,"Very Nice Dress. It's stretchy but if you're unsure buy a size larger. It does fit exact. So if you have a lil Kangaroo Pouch, wear Spanx or some type of support. It does hug curves. Oh and you will need a very good, supportive plunge bra. I'm a 36DDD and I hate my Girls sagging. Pet Peeve. The Royal Blue Color is Gorgeous."
4.0,"I am 5'7"" and about 140 with a sort of slender, athletic build. This dress is surprisingly flattering. The waist is actually an empire waist and the length is almost long enough. I prefer just an inch or two longer but it's certainly not bad! For the money, it's totally worth it. It is cotton and a little see-through so I'm a little worried about washing and drying. I plan to hang dry."
4.0,"pretty, but breaks easily"
4.0,"These are super cute earrings. I do wish they would put the earrings into a box so that when you open it, they don't pop out onto the floor. I got these for my 13 year old niece for her bat mitzvah and she loves them. I don't think they are so difficult to put on.<br /><br />I got these earrings at a discount for an honest review. I would definitely recommend them!"
4.0,I think I like them.
4.0,"Feels comfortable and doesnt look that bad , the only problem is that its too tight , thinking the smallest one would be perfect for my wrist since im skinny but it didnt."
4.0,"I like this dress. Fit through the body is good but through bust area runs a bit smaller then size measurement. Love the colors, but the best part of the dress is the 3/4 sleeves. Dress can be casual or dress up with jewelry and heels. Very pleased"
4.0,Good quality but their 3x is actually a 30/32... weird.
4.0,Medium weight soft fabric not scratchy
4.0,My son seems to be between sizes so I knew it would be a little big if they had a 16 it would have fit perfect. He likes how the drawstring goes all the way through to the back and not just in the front and the Room in the mesh lining is great.  It's definitely pool worthy and we will see how they hold up in the ocean of North Carolina.
4.0,"I bought this because it was cheaper than wool, and I needed a jersey for cycling touring that would not stink after one ride, and this jersey does not stink like synthetic jerseys.  It fits a little long in the sleeves, but I just fold up the sleeves.  I wore this jersey for 4 straight days, and it still did not stink, this is similar performance that a person would get from wool, but this fabric dries faster than wool does.<br /><br />The only negative, and thus the 4 stars, is the bottom of the jersey, the hem, will not lie flat, it curls for some reason, but like I said the cost was better than reasonable so I'm not complaining about that one negative but thought you all should know about it.  I have given it 4 stars and took off a half a star for the hem curling, and another 1/2 star for the too long of a sleeve.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? most certainly."
4.0,"It's pretty cute. The back is very nice although impossible to wear with a regular bra and no support whatsoever if you're thinking of wearing it without a bra. I'm 5'6"", 160 lbs, athletic built, 36D and I ordered a L. It was a little loose on me. Not terribly but could have been more fitted. For the price I didn't think it was worth keeping."
4.0,"The cape is made of quality plastic and comes in its own transparent pouch. With today's pandemic still on, it's a boon to have your own cape when going to the hairdresser or salon. I dye my hair at home so this cape is really handy in preventing my clothes from being stained.  The cape also has cute designs (mine is the one with makeup items). The only thing I've noticed is that size-wise, it seems smaller than the ones professionals use.  But since I'm a small person anyway, it works for me."
4.0,"I like the feel of this dress with it's soft material.  The fit was good (5'3"", 139 lbs, bought medium) but it was at least 3"" too long.  I hemmed it so it was no big deal. I have washed it once and laid flat to dry."
4.0,"Bought to give as a gift, Look nice, bigger than I thought they would be."
4.0,It's very light.  Feels like it's going to fall off but hasn't yet
4.0,It is nice and the color is also. It is 39&#34; long from shoulder to bottom edge and about 26&#34; wide laying flat. There is a lot of room in it. The only negative is the neck opening. It is small and should of been 3&#34; lower in the front.
4.0,Bought for mom to wear
4.0,So cute but a few horns weren't secured to the headband well
4.0,"Just a pictured, the length is perfect, but I wish it were made of dashiki material and the pockets were deeper. I adore it though."
4.0,I am very happy with this purchase. The temple arms are made of bamboo resulting in the glasses being light weight and very comfortable; the lenses are also very clear. I would have given it five stars but all of the glasses in the shipment that I received have one temple arm that is apparently more curved than the other. This could be a consequence of the packaging and shipping process. The glasses are shipped in paper envelope packaging (I'm assuming to reduce shipping costs) with little or no protection from shipping hazards that could potentially break or damage the items. The good thing is these glasses come with &#34;Lifetime breakage warranty on frame & lenses&#34; and also &#34;30 days money back guarantee&#34;.
4.0,"Really cute and sturdy, unfortunately, my daughter reacted to the metal. Altogether a great looking pair of earrings!"
4.0,"Got this for my gf. She said the fit was ok, a bit big but that’s the style. She loves that it has pockets."
4.0,"Definitely a baby blue, and super hard to read in the dark, even with the light. Looks really good on my wrist and has many functions. Overall I really like it."
4.0,"Very cute slippers.  Keeps feet warm.  The sole does not provide much, if any support, but great to wear on carpeted floors or for the purpose intended.  These were a gift to a 20- year old girl and she loved the dog cat black and white combo.  She also has difficulty finding slippers that fit a size 11.5 Wide.  The XL fit her well with comfort.  Would rate 5 stars if they had a little more support, but otherwise very happy with these cute slippers."
4.0,"Very comfortable! The lining is very soft. They are, for the most part, opaque. However, I gave a pair to a friend that is about a size 14 and they were fairly sheer."
4.0,Run a little on the small side. Otherwise great comfy tanks.
4.0,Works surprisingly well.
4.0,"I'd give this a 3.5 if I could. Great looking apron and canvas is quality. The reason this product is so affordable is in the quality of the hardware and the stitching. Hardware is light and feels cheap and single stitching means it this probably wouldn't stand up to restaurant use.<br /><br />Great, stylish options for average home kitchen use but not industry/daily heavy use ready in my opinion."
4.0,Runs on the small size and the color is not even close but I still like the shirt. I ordered a size larger than normal expecting it to run a little smaller so the fit is good. The color is much darker which was a little unexpected but I still like it and it is a great value.
4.0,tal como esperaba.  Me gusto bastante. Asi que le daré mucho uso.
4.0,"I got these as halloween treats! They're fun and exciting, but some of them didn't work. It was a bummer. I would say 30% of them had glitches."
4.0,"A little longer than expected. Overall, very nice."
4.0,I'm 5'3'&#34; 150lbs 34D and ordered a medium. The sizing was accurate however the zipper for some reason wouldn't zip. It's an easy fix not to mention it's worth it considering that the dress itself is beautiful. The sellers were great too!
4.0,"Ordered a set of 2 travel bags and were as described, and comes with 4 duster bags (each duster bag fits 1 shoe). I was able to fit a pair of heels in one bag just fine. For reference, my shoe size is 5.5 women's US and my heels are about 3-4 in. I will definitely prefer using these bags to the usual plastic store shopping bags I've been using until now. Gave a 4 star rating only because one of the zippers seems a little faulty. Still working though!"
4.0,"Soft, stays on, works as it should."
4.0,Be sure to double check the sizes. This one was too small for me but hope it will fit soon.
4.0,Tape is strong. looks exactly as pictured.
4.0,"If I went a size up they would be perfect. However, I can still wear them for a whole day with no complaints. My big toe is right at the point. Also, I get a lot of compliments on them which is a nice surprise. They're very light and fashionable when paired with the right outfit. Even though they don't have a size up I would still order these again just to have them on hand for the price and the value."
4.0,"I like it but it's hard to see the larger steal your face design, the dark brown needs to be black so it can stand out better. Still a worth while purchase."
4.0,"I use this for my safety glasses at work, because I wear a mask also. It works very well keeping the fogging to a minimum in a climate controlled area. I do reapply it every other day or so."
4.0,they are comfortable. They don't quite reach my knees but I do have large calves
4.0,"Cute dress and true to size, I'm just not crazy about the material"
4.0,"These are great fleece pants.  My Granddaughter is 2 1/2 years old.  I got size 3T.  She's bit petite, but stout.  They fit perfectly in the waist.  They run a bit long in the legs, but they are made to either roll up or hem yourself.  Absolutely perfect for a tall, slim child."
4.0,"With the Onyx tie flopping out, (See my review)  I tried this one. This one is very comfortable.  You put it on with some slack and then grow into it. Works very wel!  I was concerned with its width bothering her, but she has not complained. It is attractive too. Can be left lying around too. Looks like an ordinary strap with snaps. In case you are new to ties, put this under your jewels and over the top on your tool. There are 2 snaps spaced apart to accommodate various sizes of the male population."
4.0,"The emblems are a bit smaller than expected, but ok for the money."
4.0,Size up!! I’m 5’4 125 ish and medium fit well with a little skinny belt
4.0,Very cute I love this necklace but it's tarnishing already and the chain is as well. I wish there was a way to keep this metal bright! I wear it every day. I love the design and quote
4.0,it fit but it I have a big buttocks so it was tight there
4.0,These are so cute but they do kind of hurt after a while. Good for the ears but maybe a little to thick for the nose.
4.0,"Seriously overpriced, considering the $1.98 retail price printed on the package. But the insert that came with my wallet was falling apart, so I guess it was worth it. The seam binding is reinforced at the top corner, where my original insert failed, so I have hope it will last a good long time."
4.0,"Been looking for a band like this for a long time.  It's hard to find one with leather on the inside.  My only gripe is that the loops on the bottom are fraying.  Otherwise, this strap is perfect."
4.0,Super cute set! Haven’t used it yet so I’m not sure how sturdy it is but it’s exactly what we are looking for.
4.0,tis great to see your love one light up when she gets what she wish for and trys it on with out taking off the wraper haha
4.0,"Bought a women's medium; what arrived appeared to be a children's medium. Moved directly to XXL; when that arrived, it appeared to be approximately a medium (as this was intended for a gift, we did not try it on). The 2X unfortunately had a manufacturing issue where the machine seemed to have run out of thread without anyone noticing, so half the pocket was hanging off. Because of the long shipping time, it was now a month beyond my daughter's friend's birthday, so we did not make a 3rd attempt.<br /><br />Four stars because the first one was in good condition, if sized weirdly (I am thinking these are perhaps Asian sizes, which tend to run smaller than American) and because the seller was easy to deal with regarding refunds."
4.0,This is a great new belt design and I purchased three. I suggest a small not indicating how it works. The last time I had a belt like this I was in the Army and it is great.
4.0,Purchased for daughter to use after getting out of the pool. I like the purchase but is thinner than I expected. Overall it suits our purpose after swim class use.
4.0,"Very comfortable. Fits well, however, the straps are too big and stretchy, which doesn't help with support if you have big boobs."
4.0,This is just the wallet I was looking for.  It's not the highest quality as far as material goes. HOWEVER it is well worth the price!!
4.0,"I was skeptical of these when I pulled them out of the bag as they seemed a little short (more like capri length for me, 5'8) but I get tons of compliments on them and they are super comfy for running errands or gardening"
4.0,"This was an impulse buy for me . At first I thought it was way too cheap to be good quality but the joke was on me. The fit was as expected I ordered a med, fit complements my figure. And it's very good quality material for the price. I would order it again if they had a different pattern ."
4.0,"This review focuses on the design, construction and quality of the XoDo Intimates Smooth-Cup Front-Closure Padded Underwire Bra with Lace Beauty Back.<br /><br />I won’t go into the process of choosing the proper size, which seems (to this dude) to be fraught with opportunities for error and uncertainties about getting a good fit without trying the item on. Bra sizing seems to be all over the map, which makes it a hard product to order sight-unseen.<br /><br />With that said, my wife liked this bra’s apparent quality and attention to detail.<br /><br />She especially liked the coppery-hued front closure, which clicks into place simply and securely, the soft molded cups and the comfortable shoulder straps that adjust via similarly copper-hued fittings. She was less enamored of the floral-patterned lace back straps and band, which she felt won’t hold up well to repeated washings.<br /><br />With this bra, as with any others, double-check your size before you order it and make sure you can return it if it doesn’t fit."
4.0,This dress is super cute! I’m 5’3 145 and the medium was spot on for me. The only draw back to this dress is the material does not breathe...at all.
4.0,A bit smaller than expected.  The button doesn't seem to sturdy. The quality of design and fabric is good.
4.0,"The headline says it all.  It looks nice, ran a hair big, but the colors weren't quite as vibrant as hoped.  Not dull by any means though.  All in all.  A great shirt for the price."
4.0,The material and quality are good but the knees are too tight for hiking. Maybe order a size up.
4.0,Very  nice top.  Runs somewhat small.
4.0,Cute top but seemed to be a big difference in width between the Medium and Large. I probably would need something in between to fit right.
4.0,"I thought the fabric would be more cotton-y but stretchable but they're more of a spandexy/polyester blend. But I dont mind that. I usually buy mediums in shorts and so I did this time too. i probably could have gotten a small but i always wear a small in leggings and a medium in shorts because i don't want my butt hanging out. but the way all these brands are with their sizing on their scrunch booty leggings and shorts are usually out of whack. I got smalls in the textured shorts based of reviews and they were too small, and when I returned I tried to get a medium but they were sold out. so I go these instead in a medium and they fit pretty good, they are a little loose but they still aren't baggy around my legs or butt"
4.0,Sending back too small .
4.0,Nice lightweight. Had to order two daughter took the other one
4.0,The dress is beautiful but the torso is too long for me and I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that the dress is perfect.
4.0,"Top is small. Ballons out from waist. The red is a true red. Super see through. You will need at least two slips if you don't enjoy your panties showing. Also, mine was very long. I'm 5'5&#34;, came down to my ankles. Hem is terrrible. Not straight all around. Unfinished hem on hem and sleeves. Don't like that. Still cute though."
4.0,"Recommend to buy, doughter is happy"
4.0,"They look gorgeous! Very sparkly and the surgical steel is awesome for my skin. I highly recommend it if you have allergies to regular earrings! There are a few that have gems that are a bit loose, but this can probably be easily fixed with some jewelry pliers."
4.0,"These are very nice Jammie pants.  They are super dark black...many times black is not super dark.  But these are not fleece..they are like valor.  I know valor, I was a teenager in the 70s.  I bought several pair of the other patterns for my daughter in small and they are fleece...just like wearing a light blanket.  She got some years ago and wanted more for colder days.  I was a bit disappointed that the black ones I got in medium  are not fleece."
4.0,"Nice material, seems well made (but made in China), but the XL is w-a-a-a-a-y too large.  Sent it back and ordered an &#34;L&#34; size.  We'll see how that goes."
4.0,This is a very beautiful more rose gold scarf clip with a pin back included. The reason for only four instead of five stars is the item is rather flimsy and not very durable compared to other scarf clips and pins I own.  It is intended for rather thin scarves as the ring is no more than a little over an inch in diameter.
4.0,"What an awesome, easy-to-wear piece for work! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the color was very different from the picture (more of a light, carnation pink). I still love it, though!"
4.0,Great to have a flex band. Quick on and off.
4.0,I have a 23&#34; head and the large was &#34;some what large&#34; for my head but fit well enough to keep. I've only had it one day but so far I really like it.
4.0,"Super cute, decent quality fabric and stitching is good! This dress looks exactly like the photo! I usually wear a 6-8, I ordered a medium, it's a little too short for me for a dress so I'll be matching it with tights. If you're looking for something different, order it!"
4.0,This is a lovely sweater but it runs very small.  I wear a size xsmall- small but ordered a medium for a looser fit.  The medium fits like a small.  The material is really comfortable.
4.0,Good boot<br />Will buy again
4.0,"Very soft, comfortable. Would like it to be cut a little more fitted."
4.0,Very comfortable. I’m heavy and this dress drapes nicely. Doesn’t cling. Flattering
4.0,"I used these gloves for sorting through the freezer at work. They keep your hands very warm, the grip on them is pretty good so over all they were very useful for what I needed them. My only complaint is that they were a little too tight and that the tag fell off and left a hole in them. They still worked fine but they might not be as good for outdoor activities.<br /><br />*Correction- I didn't realize that even though it says adult unisex it has a size box which had women's small/medium soooo.... Yea I guess it's a good size"
4.0,"Fits well, a little stretch to the material. Color is like a cross between blue and grey. Length is good: Im 5'8&#34; and it barely covers my butt."
4.0,A gift for a working friend whenever the ground is wet his soft shoes don't work well I'm hoping these boots hold up to their advertising of water resistant fingers crossed???
4.0,"Overall I love the fit and cut of this dress. The pink velvet is almost a nude in some lights, but looks luxe.<br />I am short, but the front hem of the dress is extremely short leaving the area in danger of a 'Basic Instinct' moment. I cannot imagine how this would work for someone taller.<br />I did size up to a medium (usually S/M in asian sizes) and felt comfortable. I could probably size down, but I won't because of how short the front already is."
4.0,"This set of necklaces is pretty nice and would make a wonderful gift to those who’s enjoy jewelry. There’s a good amount of variety with the pendants, but they are all centered around crystals. Half of the necklaces are silver and come on silver chains, and the other half are glass/crystal and come on a black cord. They aren’t the best quality and some of them seem a bit cheap, but you get what you pay for here. It’s still a nice set of necklaces with a good selection of pretty and unique pendants, and the number of necklaces you receive make it a great value for money."
4.0,"These are cheap, comfortable pants. My only issue is that they seem to have been made for a much taller woman. (The crotch is, ahem, rather low....). Other than that, they are light and comfortable."
4.0,Kind of short but not too bad.
4.0,This is Romper  exceeded my expectations it is soooo cute on. The model online does not do it justice. I thought I was going to have to return this romper. But it ended up being the one that I kept & being my favorite -  it is so cute on the lace is perfect - soft and stretchy.  I would definitely recommend this & make sure you order your regular size that you always wear. I ordered a medium & my measurements are 34 DD waist 29 hips 40. I am wearing it to a birthday celebration & all white party I can't wait for everyone to see how cute this is !
4.0,Definitely saves space. Very efficient
4.0,Perfect fit and looks great.  It's not 5 star quality but it also is no where close to a 5 star price.  5 stars for value. ....will be ordering a brown one too.
4.0,Got this for my wife she loves it.
4.0,Wish the arm holes were a bit larger.  Everything else is fine.
4.0,"Had to get an MRI for my back and I have a bunch of piercings. Bought these to put in my lip while I had the test and it worked great! Good strong quality and long enough for anyone. The front piece is a bit difficult to put back in, but once I got it the stud stayed put!"
4.0,"Cool ring, but not true to size. Order up."
4.0,Love it fixes a little small
4.0,"I wear this almost every day....well it's my gym jewelry...super cute...just the size I wanted but I don't like the extended double hook in the back...it's annoying, should have just kept the chain all one strand/texture."
4.0,"I love these! I love your company and enthusiasm! I would love to see more styles and smaller frames for people who have pin heads like myself. My only complaint is that the arms? legs? of the glasses are a little pointy at the ends, scratching my pinhead over the ears when I put them on. Keep me posted on new styles! Thanks & keep up the good work!"
4.0,Nice but couldn’t fit it
4.0,I would have given it 5 stars but the sleeves were kinda tight on my arms even though i ordered a size bigger than what I normally wear . It was pretty however and I got lots of compliments. It’s lightweight too
4.0,Very pretty but top fits large.
4.0,Love it! People asked me where I got it fro and I said go to Amazon.
4.0,Worked great.  I used them while I was in NYC and needed my cell phone out a lot to navigate my way through the subways.  They aren't super warm but great for going in and out of places.
4.0,Es algo de poca calidad
4.0,"I got these for my 10 year old daughter to wear over her regular glasses.  They are slightly larger than a perfect fit, but I do realize she's inbetween a youth and an adult.  Overall decent pair of sunglasses.  I like the side shield for the extra sun protection."
4.0,Good quality. I put in on my bracelet when I bought item and it still looks new.  It is very pretty
4.0,"Quality of product:<br />high quality fabric<br />easy to tie once you get the hang of it<br />easy to adjust, fit me well, and i have a small neck, but would go much larger if i needed it.<br />looks good, even with a wing collared shirt, with little contrast on the band, so it almost looks like it was sized specifically for your neck.<br /><br />*my bowtie had a white stain on the bow where something was stuck to it in manufacture*<br />But. . .<br />i contacted the seller, they replied within hours, not days as some sellers do.<br />the seller was also very helpful sorting this whole thing out.<br />made the whole ordeal quite painless.<br />with a bit of luck, i'll have my replacement before the month is out, and i'll be rocking it around town in style.<br /><br />in summary: for a tie at less than $10, i could not possibly complain"
4.0,They are a little large but keep her fingers nice and toasty.
4.0,Nice little pin
4.0,Just what was advertised and I replaced a pair like it<br />that lasted 20 years.  Suggest you go a half size larger<br />than your regular shoe size.  I did and they fit great!
4.0,"good and very warm, i might just have to buy another one because my mom wants one now so i might."
4.0,"This shirt is so soft and feels really nice to wear. However, the cut/sizing doesn’t seem much different from other the t-shirts I own. I’m not sure the “custom” price is worth it for most people in a simple t-shirt, unless you just really love this fabric. It could be beneficial to have an option to add more measurements, or possibly bra size, in addition to the sizing photos. I’d be interested in seeing more customizable clothing options though, perhaps for dresses, jackets, and skirts."
4.0,"I really like these earrings. They are beautiful. However, they are a bit heavier than I anticipated."
4.0,Sadly one of my favorite ones has a decently sharp chip on one end. But the rest are gorgeous and totally worth the money.
4.0,"I really like this brand, but these do not fit the same as a pair I purchased some time ago.  These fit pretty tightly.  I will order again in the next size up."
4.0,"The earrings came with one of them broken, meaning it would not click into the hole.  However, my friend was able to fix it and now I have a very nice set of earrings."
4.0,I have several of Tesla capri tight pants and this fluorescent yellow are somewhat transparent but they feel great and they do their job.
4.0,The ring is beautiful. Good quality. The sizing is a little small. I normally wear a size 7 on my ring finger ask and this oneat size 7 fits my pinky. I wish the details were a little larger
4.0,This is oversized and would look great if I were slightly taller (I am 5' 6&#34; with a short torso and large bust). It hits mid thigh on the sides and accentuated my curves instead of hiding them. It's a beautiful shirt though and very comfortable.
4.0,My husband dislikes the double pockets.  I dislike the material but I still wear it.  It looks cute just wish it didn't feel like a cloth made from plastic bags.
4.0,Really great quality. Very well made and seems like it would hold up for a long time. Only down side is it does run a bit small.
4.0,Great necklace. Wow what a great price.<br />Debbie
4.0,"I love the print of the dress. The material is weird. I have a large chest so the top is tight and needs to stretch a bit. In doing so, this makes the material turn lighter since the fabric turns white when pulled on. It also has a sheen to it.<br /><br />I plan to keep it because it's hard for me to find dresses but will wear a cardigan or jean jacket to camouflage the difference in how the fabric looks."
4.0,Attractive and settle a very reasonable purchase.
4.0,This thing is terrifyingly awesome.  Scared myself and a few others.  It smells pretty bad though when you put it on...that is the only downfall.
4.0,"This dress has kept me warm this winter, I enjoyed wearing it. This dress is so cute."
4.0,Very nice belt and soft leather.  Does run very long so be careful of that.
4.0,"Ldurian Boho Long Fringe Tassel rope is a versatile fashion accent.  The rope section measures 45 inches plus 3.5 inch tassels on both ends for a total 52 inch length.  It weighs exactly 2 ounces.<br /><br />It is comprised of braided black yarn, a beige leather like strip and a string of gold beads with the ends accented with wood tone larger beads. It comes with a fabric storage bag which is good protection to keep it from being snagged or twisted.<br /><br />This Ldurian Boho Long Fringe Tassel rope can be used in various ways but I prefer to use it as a accent belt.  It is a very attractive accessory."
4.0,"I love the shape, so cute. I do wish it was a bit bigger but I love it for a small handbag"
4.0,person i gave it to liked it. still does.
4.0,It was missing 3 pieces. But my son loved them. So it didn't matter..
4.0,"Cute t-shirt! Nice quality, soft with a vibrant color. Sizing is spot on."
4.0,"As for US-Small (male sweater), it's smaller than I thought. I bought it for my boyfriend, but it fits me better. I'm considering exchanging for a larger one or ordering a new one for him.<br />I like the material and the color."
4.0,A little small but they are cute.
4.0,Keep knees and legs pleasantly warm! Plan to order a second pair
4.0,Very nice & the price was good..
4.0,"Good looking, sturdy band! The only issue I had was one of the pins broke. Be careful when switching between bands. Other than that, the band itself looks good. The link changing kit was very easy to use."
4.0,Would have been a five star 🌟 but there was no place for a pen...
4.0,"This ring is beautifully designed and true to size, but mine arrived with a blue stone missing on the butterfly. Also, it arrived in an envelope but no pouch or box-just bubble paper inside the shipping envelope and a plastic pouch.  Still lovely, but disappointing."
4.0,good for money
4.0,"I like these belts. They are simple, no nonsense, yet classy enough design. I've got three now. Use the old ones for outdoor activities. They are wide enough to support tactical components."
4.0,"Didn't like the padding,  I had to take it off lol but it's a really pretty top to wear it but high top shorts."
4.0,"only problem ive had with this sword is other people whining about how much it hurts and the tip and handle guards fell off, i would recomend the producers of this weapon strengthen the handle guards with something hard inside them"
4.0,"So thin he would almost think it's a Halloween costume. Why they would choose such thin fabric I do not understand. The dress looks good and I can't fault it for that but as far as durability goes, I just don't see it. It's really flimsily made. It's just sad that they just don't seem to care much about quality anymore it really is about quantity now, isn't it.<br /><br />Anyway, you get what you pay for the price was right shipping was remarkably fast from China and the dress looks nice. We're just going to have to really treat it with kid gloves that's all, I suppose.<br /><br />I deducted one star because the material is ridiculously thin. A dress should be made with better material especially if it has a hoodie."
4.0,"Great glasses, extremely clear the reason that I gave it 4 stars is because the end of the frame dig into my head making them very uncomfortable for me I sent them back due to that"
4.0,Cheap as expected but my 8 year old niece was in love with it. It held up after 2 months it's still in one piece.
4.0,"A simple watch that is used as an ordinary clock, alarm, and stopwatch. The only thing that I wish this watch had is 50m water resistance for swimming. For $16 this is a good buy."
4.0,"I’m very happy with my hat,. It’s a cute hat. It’s good with or without the plastic shield which easily goes on and off with a Velcro strip.  I need to find a way to smooth the plastic though. Any thoughts?  Maybe a blow dryer set low and watched very carefully ?"
4.0,Was too big for me. Would have exchanged for a smaller size if they made one
4.0,Great graphic Tee
4.0,"Awesome necklace for the price, no one believes it’s not real!"
4.0,"Beautiful purse!  However, I've never had purse with thin straps, so I sincerely hope the straps hold up."
4.0,I had hoped that other reviewers were exaggerating but no. The sole really is that slippery. I ordered half a size up but should’ve probably fine with my regular size. The criss cross in the back is unusual but looks good. Not the absolute best quality because you can see where the glue is by the sole and on the toe the fabric didn’t go all the way down. Picks up a lot of dirt/hair.
4.0,"Not sure if there are pictures that show this, or if it was explained that these gloves have those rubber grips on the palms and I just totally missed it, but these gloves do have grips on the insides. Still love them - just wasn't expecting it and it makes holding hands weird."
4.0,fit very well.  I am 6'4&#34; 200 lbs and it fit perfectly.  Love it
4.0,Love the hat but a little lose.
4.0,"very nice, look real and work fine for yourr craft projects or children that want key chain like yours."
4.0,I read the reviews and decided to go with a XL. It was too large. I am passing this on and will repurchase a medium. I normally wear large. I am 5'4 and 170 pounds.
4.0,I like it because my iPhone is too big for my pants pocket and this is great for my iPhone 7 plus!
4.0,I would recommend ordering a size up.  I normally wear XL shirts but this XL is too small after washing
4.0,"Just as expected. Not too big not too small. Took it on a trip to D.C. And walked a lot. Carried glasses, small wallet, lipstick, pill bottle and small book. Wonderful. Sturdy."
4.0,"Has more maroon color on it than I thought, but its cute.  Nice and soft in the inside."
4.0,It was the perfect accent to my son's suite! Loved it!
4.0,I like the dress very thin material but would be great for summer! I will get a large next time.
4.0,"I loved it, but if you have ANY bust at all, order at least two sized larger.  I'm a busty girl (5'2 and 36 D) and can sometimes get away with medium to large blouses when they are flowing like this one. Obviously not made for Americans, so I had to return it and get an XL.  It is very sheer, but I live in AZ so thin is good."
4.0,The bad is a little smaller than I expected but I love it. It's so cute and the quality seems really good. It's big enough for what you need and keeps me from over filling. I would definitely recommend.
4.0,This is one of my favorite rings and I have a lot.<br />I wear it at least four times a week now.  Goes Great with black or gray.
4.0,"You really can't beat the price.  They are well made, but they are very big.  I have little wrists, so I had to bend them a little so they wouldn't fall off.  I bought them to hold my hair elastic,  so that it would not mark up my wrist.  However,  the elastic slips off anyway."
4.0,not bad!
4.0,Ordered this for my wife. She used it as a necklace. Very pretty.
4.0,"Fun pair of boxers. Good for people who like a little extra material so that their thighs don't rub together. My only complaint is that the front tends to come open as you walk, which can lead to some... dangerous situations if you're wearing jeans."
4.0,Cute and comfortable! Live the baby blue color as well but material is not at all like it shows on the pictures
4.0,"The material is nice but it runs a little large, I ordered my regular size but it kinda loose. The waist tie helps as it allows one to have some shape. I didn't return it for this reason."
4.0,"Chain turned brown almost immediately, but if you wear your hair down it's very cute."
4.0,Very pleased.  It's just a quiet reminder at my work desk of what I value.
4.0,YOU NEED TO IRON IT....NICE YELLOW COLOR.
4.0,The shirt was cute. But it sheds.
4.0,I got these for my 2yr old granddaughter and she loves them. And the price is right
4.0,Great for ice skating party goodie bag
4.0,Kinda small but great for the price
4.0,Get the next size up
4.0,I recommended.. 100%
4.0,"The gradient is not as pronounced as in the picture. The fabric is not really sweater like but more of an athletic feel almost, but not quite. I could have sized down a size or two since it feels like of oversized as is. Otherwise it's fine."
4.0,Dress is super comfy and has pockets. This is a dress that needs to be ironed.
4.0,"Disregard the earlier review due to miscommunication. Nice shirt, comfortable."
4.0,Like everything about the item I’ve got plenty of complements
4.0,Was exactly what was expected.
4.0,Only complaint is that the guy mask had a piece that had came unglued and fell off. But used super glue and am hoping it sticks. Product looks nice and guy mask fit my face really well!
4.0,"Very nice looks exactly like the picture. I had to replace the one I got at hot topic because I forgot to separate it from the clothes I was throwing in the dryer and it was ruined. This one is better than the one I'm replacing. It's a lot softer and not itchy like the last one, and I think this one was cheaper. One of the ears was folded down when packed in the box so it doesn't stand up when I wear it, so I'm going to put something heavy on it to help it out. Otherwise great product I recommend it, and yes I'm a real person and not a spokesperson for this seller."
4.0,"I absolutely love these leggings. They're comfortable and won't slide down when wearing them (unless you're wearing real slick underwear) which is an issue I have with a lot of leggings and workout pants that I own. I bought these about 2 years ago and I wear them at least once a week. (I work with kids so I wear a lot of athletic gear). I am actually on here to buy a new pair because it's the time where common wear and tear have gotten to the inner thighs of these pants haha. I absolutely love them. The only complaint I'd have is that I didn't realize how high up the mesh would come on the side of the pants and I'm really short (5'2""), but if you're okay with that, then I definitely recommend them. As I said, I'm 5'2"" and 240lbs and I got a 2XL. They fit great!!!"
4.0,"I’ve worn it 3x and stored it in the provided cloth bag and the color is already flaking off, see photo!<br />addendum- the company reached out to me and replaced the belt"
4.0,Good length for upper ear cartilage.
4.0,"Loved this! It’s a cozy shirt. The pockets are a little awkward, but otherwise a great shirt especially to lounge around in."
4.0,designer look without the designer price
4.0,Works great to put on my bracelets. Handle is a bit thicker than I thought it would be.<br />Does the job.👍
4.0,It was of good quality but the size runs small
4.0,I like the fit. I didn't like how low the neck line was.
4.0,While this bag looks like a military bag it is not. It is a good bag with lots of zippered pockets and looks like it will last a long time. I bought it as a gun bag and it did work for that but I didn't like how everything fit into it. While everything did fit I had trouble finding which zippered compartment I put things in. It has shoulder straps that work very well and a strap for across your chest to help hold them in place. I think that added strap is useless. For the money it's a good bag but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted and as shown.  Somewhat small.  Arrived very quickly.  Very happy with it,"
4.0,"Such a cute swim suit! It did run slightly small, so you might want to buy one size up."
4.0,hi i am a little confused with my medina I wonder what is the size that fits me. I have 6 feet two inches.<br /><br />I measured with a centimeter and have the sigueintes measures.<br /><br />magicians over 26 inches.<br />Waist 38 Inches<br />30 inches long<br />Chest 39 inches<br />back 17 inch measured with a centimeter.
4.0,me equivoque de talla pedí de niño y yo quería para dama. lo devolví pero todo ok.
4.0,These were perfect for my mermaid costume!<br />They can be a little hot at times but they are very fun!
4.0,"Bought these to bike. I bike approximately 180-200 miles per week. The shape of the glasses is not conducive to keeping those nasty little bugs out. In fact, the curve entraps the bugs on the inside of the frames. I do like the clarity of the glasses and they are a good shade for early morning biking when you need eye protection, but you are not in need of stronger lenses. The frames seem to be somewhat large for me - 5'2&#34;, 133 lb woman. Yet, they have taken some hard hits on the payment and have not incurred any scratches. Hence, I'm a happy cyclist!"
4.0,Very soft and roomy. Does need to be pre washed so the lint won’t make it to the clothes. Very good quality.
4.0,"iDON'TKNOW HOW<br /><br />I don't know how durable it's going to be, & the tab on the end of the belt looks funky, but it stretches nicely & I'm sure to get some good use out of it.<br />I believe that the ad said that the belt stretches approx. 1 inch, but I can get a lot more out of it than that, & it still seems to hold firmly."
4.0,"This skirt is pretty nice! It looks and fits just like in the picture. I am 5'5&#34;, ~127lbs with a 25.5&#34; waist with a 35&#34; hip, so I ordered a small. It wasn't too tight or too loose.  The lace is soft enough, but over all I feel that the material or design could be slightly reworked to increase the natural flow of the garment and its allowance for mobility. The liner skirt underneath the lace does not stretch at all at the bottom which constricts the breadth of your step. It's a light weight item perfect from Spring/ Summer. Over all for the price, it is a fantastic buy :-)"
4.0,Fits her good
4.0,I like them - but they are tight
4.0,Good. Really nice
4.0,This could be casual or you could dress it up. Shrunk a little in the wash but I would recommend you size up to get the off the shoulder look. I plan on getting more in different colors.
4.0,Will wear with jeans just like the picture.
4.0,It looked really nice on my daughter.  Her only complaint was the fabric was not as soft as she thought it would be.
4.0,"Comfy, Cute, just a bit small. Lost the backing of one in 30 minutes. Good tho."
4.0,This watch is beautiful but it's large and very heavy.
4.0,"I have a big nose as my friends like to remind me. The problem with that if I'm wearing a mask it either rides up to high where I can't see or it slides down to low and I'm forever pulling it up. This fixes that problem. These mask work well enough and comes with a few filters that will last a couple weeks you can buy more on Amazon for cheap.<br />My only complaint about these mask are the straps that go over you're ears are a bit thin. These mask are affordable and useable for everywhere , but Hospitals and Dr's offices where they will ask you to use a disposable or one of there disposables. Overall I would advise to buy these and a set of disposables. They are a good mask at a decent price."
4.0,"It's wonderful!  The only thing is that it's really, really little!  Neat wedding cake toppers, though."
4.0,"This dress is a hot mess and I really can't understand the good reviews. It is horribly made. The bottom looks like a homemade no-sew tutu and is smells like FISH. The shabby flower is cute but there is nothing of substance to clip it to so it pulls at the thin excuse of a sash. I am really disappointed.<br /><br />Update: Alright, I'm not going to lie, I HATED everything about this dress. DD had to wear it for her event since we didn't have time to order anything else.<br />This dress no matter what else I said about it (all very true) photographed BEAUTIFULLY. I mean incredible.<br />I'll some of my words."
4.0,"5'4 / 150lbs. Ordered a large first, too loose, but would've worked. Went to a small, and they are a tad too tight, but just fine for under my short green and white dress. The quality isn't great. But the lace looks really nice, which is all that truly matters with these shorts. A medium would've been perfect for me."
4.0,Looked and fit my granddaughter great#
4.0,"I made multiple purchases for this top and most of them are wonderful. They fit well and there's little to no puckering. However, the black one that I ordered gaps very badly around the armholes by the chest. I will post pictures for example soon."
4.0,It’s a very well made hat so the quality is definitely there. I purchased it because I wanted a slouchy hat and although it appears to me in the picture...it was not.
4.0,Good layering garment for working out.
4.0,"Cute, but was too short for my personal liking. Great quality for the price"
4.0,Very nice. I was in doubt about chain length so i bought a 18&#34; chain to be on the safe side. Other then that great item
4.0,"I have bought different colours of this bag and so far, it is one of the best in terms of durability, simple good looks and works for me."
4.0,A bit stiff initially but easy to replace.
4.0,This case fits my Oakley Five Squared as well as my Ray-Ban New Wayfarers perfectly.  I bought this case twice because I liked it so much the first time.  Four stars because they don't fit my Oakley M-Frame Strikes.
4.0,Im used to be medium but I chose large after read all the comments and correct!! One size up! To be sure!
4.0,"These are decent sunglasses for $9.95, but they are not close enough to your eyes and kind of small."
4.0,"I wasn't ready to spend $100+ on a pair of blue-light blockers, but I do spend alot of time in front of screens and wanted to try them out. I paid $11 and yes, they are cheap, but they block blue light very well and the lenses are clear and magnify slightly (+1.25) without causing eye strain. Overall, I'm glad I bought them and will surely get my money's worth and then some."
4.0,"Perfect material and fit, just order two sizes larger, not one. M to L was not enough in my case."
4.0,I so loved this dress but it was too small. I would size up at least 2 sizes maybe even 3. I had to send mine back!😞
4.0,"If you are looking for a nice, thin silver chair this is the one."
4.0,It fits ok. Just wish it was longer
4.0,"Super comfy, great for pajama pants!"
4.0,"Can't help but grin when I see they slippers. So cute! They are made like other slippers that look like this. They maybe have more padding on the bottom. Very squishy until they flatten out.<br />They run big. My 4/5 is an adult size and my size 7 foot fit in fine except for my big toe straining a bit. My experience with slippers like these is that they do wear out fairly fast, but your kid will probably outgrow them by then anyway.<br />*tip* There is no left and right because they are exactly the same. I label the bottom with permanent marker."
4.0,I got these for my mom for her birthday they came pretty fast and she loves them. There’s only one thing we disliked and it’s that the hoops are huge. But we can fix it
4.0,"Amazon very good.<br /><br />The band seems to be leather, at least it smells like skin. I thought it was thicker but it's fine for not too thick watch clocks. It is very pretty, flexible, colorful, only the bands of adjustment are of Vinil, it is not leather."
4.0,Super casual & comfortable.
4.0,The value is very nice.
4.0,This dress is pretty and looks like a A-Line.  The dress is a bit form fitting but still pretty.
4.0,"Excellent buckle and workmanship. However, appears to be made of thick silicon (not rubber)  and picks up a bit of lint. It appears to be a short size -  fine for my less than 7inch wrist - wouldn't recommend for larger wrists. If it were made of FKM (or natural rubber) and a 1/2 inch longer, it would be perfect in my opinion."
4.0,I always love  her cloths
4.0,"My hands always cold. These worked very well. Took a lot longer for my finger tips to get cold amd after moving my fingers to get more circulation, my hands warmed up and my fingers became comfortable again.."
4.0,This bracelet is geat.  It looks very expensive and is comfortable to wear.  It is very light and goes with everything.  The catch is easy to use
4.0,Loved the shirt but had to return it because it was too small. I should’ve sized up.
4.0,"I bought these earring backs to go on the back of some pearls my daughter be gave me Christmas.  I almost lost the earrings because the original backs didn't work. These work really well. So we'll, that I had to have one earring repaired because the stem came off with the back. No problem, because I knew the would truly hold my earrings in place."
4.0,"These gloves are comfortable once you get them on. I don’t feel any ounce of cold and they’re thick. However, the touchscreen fingertips do not work well. You have to use your finger at an angle to do anything with your phone, and there’s not much finger dexterity with these. If you’re clearing ice off your car or doing something outside in low temps, this is for you, but definitely do not use these while trying to Hotwire a car! I have long slim fingers and they make me look like Michelin man ! But the comfort of feeling 0 cold overrides all the cons"
4.0,Runs huge! My 11 year old will have to wait to wear it when he’s about 15 lol
4.0,I like the shape but it is a little big.
4.0,"Good hat, not great."
4.0,Very pretty and I love it
4.0,Good every day wear shoe. Don't like how it looks with dresses or skirts so I wear them only with pants.
4.0,A very nice additions to my bracelet
4.0,Good material and fit perfect. Only issue is that they are see through. Wear black boxers and you'll be fine.
4.0,I should have got a size bigger. I like the shirt.
4.0,"I love Under Armour tanks. I could have got this in a small, but the medium is comfortable and long enough to cover my butt when I'm wearing tight yoga pants. I'm 5'4&#34; 134 pounds for reference."
4.0,Nice quality.  Doesn't do much for my shape but it fits nicely although it is a bit larger than expected - I used the size chart to order.
4.0,"I've had this for about two weeks. It seems like it's keeping up pretty well. It's a bit difficult to get bills all the way into pocket, so if you regularly have more than 10 or more bills on you, this might not be the wallet for you."
4.0,"I didn't realize how big it is, but it is well made and sturdy.  It also came with really pretty pearl top pins (also large, ~ 2&#34;)  And it was wrapped in a nice clear plastic case.  I didnt have the room for this size but if I did, I would definitely have kept it.  I would definitely recommend this.... and I am a tough to please when it comes to my jewelry.  I only gave it 4 stars because I did not use it, so I cant say how it holds up over time."
4.0,"Love this corset... the construction is great.  Definitely the kind of corset you can tightened well. The reason why I didn't give it a 5 stars is I think they sent me the wrong corset.  The top part of the corset I received is straight, and doesn't have that scallop design for under the breasts.  I could return it... but I love the corset that they sent, so I'm keeping it!"
4.0,Product good wish larger size was available
4.0,There are alright they were a little thin
4.0,It’s pretty and it’s not exactly like the one in the picture but it’s very pretty and it fits good
4.0,"Very cute. I will put a stitch in the v as other reviewers mentioned but otherwise grear value and very cute. I am almost 5'5 and it hits right at my knees which is perfect.<br /><br />Edited to add that it does pill after washing and material degrades a bit, not as nice feeling. But it lasted for the price  about 6 months before it seemed more drab then cute. Perhaps if you didn't dry in the dryer you would get a longer life, but with 3 kids I don't have time for that!"
4.0,I love this skirt but the tie belt I had to take of . I want different patterns without the belt.
4.0,It looks beautiful and it is easy to clean.
4.0,"Beautiful, arrived quickly."
4.0,These are adorable! They say size 2 inside.
4.0,"Gorgeous statement bracelet and very sparkly. I do not belive the bracelet is sterling silver, but the clasp is..  The stones are glass and rhinestone. The quality is very nice overall for costume jewelry. I had an impossible time clasping it, so I had to add a sturdy jump ring to the loop on the end. The green stones are vivid and look gorgeous with my emerald green sweater."
4.0,"Dress us beautiful, however the zipper broke and had to pin the gap"
4.0,I would have loved these but ordered usual size and these were huge beside the extra stretch they were disappointing May try to order a smaller size and hope they fit.
4.0,Perfect for little artist at camp!
4.0,"Love the design and everything but I feel these run a bit snug. It's like when you get a pre shrunk shirt that's your normal size by accident. I can still wear it open because the buttons will never close for me lol and since it's not a jacket, no worry for the arms or shoulders being a problem. I find it like an open corset or what I think corset fit would feel at the smallest level."
4.0,"It’s a pretty convincing pair of jeans, but the waist doesn’t stretch as much as I expected. The stitching keeps it rigid."
4.0,Satisfied with product. My mistake for shirt fitting a little big. True to size. Shipped quickly. Will buy again.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:457756a81bee50797e539a6c75dc2cee]] very nice gauges and they came the day they were suppose to, all the sizes are right and nothings missing but I ordered the pink ones and they are not matte they are glossy and see through which is still cute, but not what i wanted or what was pictured and i already had these kind. still keeping cus i needed the plugs just keep in mind they might not be the exact color"
4.0,It looks amazing but go a size up if youre going for a looser look. Material is kind of cheap but you get what you paid for
4.0,it’s pretty cheaply made but overall I’m satisfied.
4.0,"Very cute dress. Quit see through, so wear something underneath."
4.0,I am IN LOVE with these! The ooonly issue is the midi rings do have a tendency to slip off so make sure you don't lose your new favorite rings ;)
4.0,"The Ouija pin is exactly as described. I have it attached to the outside of my handbag, and even taking it with me everywhere hasn't dislodged the back. Stays in place, and is a great little pin to accessorize any witchy/goth outfit."
4.0,"i am 5 ft 6"" 146 lb and i got an L and it fits fine; comfy not at all big. Very soft. love the pink heart on the black background. can't wait til it's a little colder out so i can wear it. but i have a serious feeling this thing can not be washed in a machine. i'm gonna wash mine by hand. prepared to buy another if it shrinks."
4.0,"The material is nice! I just made the mistake by ordering the wrong size, but I still wear them because they are that comfy."
4.0,"This purse is Not what I anticipated. The picture & description say it is 10"" wide, though this purse is actually 12"" wide, so instead of being petite, it's just too uncomfortably large.  It's not a bad purse/style, ... & if someone is wanting a 12"" wide purse then this is a good buy, although if needing-wanting a 10"" wide purse, best to keep looking."
4.0,I don’t write a lot of reviews. It this dress is a must have! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 star is the back does not have the criss cross straps like shown in the 1st picture or video.
4.0,Really like better then regular mask
4.0,"I was expecting it to not be as oversized as it was but it was way too big for me. I am 5'4, 250 lbs and wear XL-XXL and always size up just in case how things fit because it varies on Amazon. This was definitely too big and boxy for me and my shape so I bought a L to see how it'll fit. It will be a boxy fit, but it didn't flatter me because it was so big."
4.0,5’8” 180. I usually wear large sweatshirts.  This one fits wel in the chest but the sleeves are very baggy I prefer something a little more fitting when I go out.  However it would make a great lounger with this fit.
4.0,The watch is absolutely stunning. The arm band is a lil small and it took about two months to be delivered.
4.0,"Pros: Really nice and flowy, love the pockets, and material is super comfy.. Cons: despite the dark color, dress is completely see through. Also speaking of the color, it's a smidge lighter blue than it appears in the photo.<br /><br />It is very long which could be good or bad depending on your height. I'm 5'1 and it will drape the floor even with heels on. I ordered size Small."
4.0,"Fit is rather snug. Could be just a little bit more strechy. I prefer hip length, this shirt is a bit above hip and closer to waist level. Overall  it is a pretty shirt. I am 5’3 and weight 127 lbs and ordered size Small, I do recommend."
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but they looked great!
4.0,"Stretchy Fabric, but very comfortable. Does run somewhat small."
4.0,"The shirt is slightly stretchy, but was a slight bit tighter than I thought (since the picture made it look loose on her) If you want it to look loose like the picture, order a size bigger, or else it will be a fitted tee. Super cute though, not disappointed at all, but 4 stars for misleading sizes."
4.0,Cute and very feminine bought pink and white I wish it came in larger size
4.0,"Even though its a little big,i love this dress."
4.0,"Its a very cute ring, just had some missing stones."
4.0,"The necklace is very dainty and pretty. When I first opened it, I was a little disappointed because it looked a bit too frail (and somewhat cheap). However, when my friend put it on (it was a gift for her), it looked very nice!"
4.0,Exactly like pic
4.0,These are cute but... don't fit like faux plugs should.
4.0,"I like a large, bold pendant and I loved this pendant when I saw it.  It's about the size of a 50 cent piece and doesn't look, &#34;cheap&#34;. Has a pretty true rose gold tone.  Have only worn it once, so not sure how well the plating will stay on  in time."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:fefbcfeaeb95d44c35694044e9d06f23]] Love the style and design, even the material used in the shirt. The fit is off, at least for a full figured 2XL model. This shirt fits tight and is restrictive along the pecs and tummy. When lifting up the shirt pulls up as well and bounces back to waist height. The arm cuffs seem fine but the neck area is also somewhat tight. This shirt may fit a more athletic 2XL build more appropriately. Compared to the fit of other brands this is one size off."
4.0,"Looks good, could be a litter better made, but serves it''s purpose for the price."
4.0,"I love the idea of this. However, I am a size 4, 27-28 in jeans. I got the medium. The elastic was too tight on my stomach and too fitted over my hips. I need it slightly looser.  I’m gonna try a large."
4.0,Goes will with my Christmas collection.
4.0,Got for my boyfriend he loved it all except the neck part is loose fit so that’s the only thing he didn’t like about it
4.0,"These leg compressions aren't itchy and are tight enough to make a difference but my legs are too short. The sleeves extend above knees at the top and past ankles at the bottom, but I love how they fit my calf muscles. I really like them better than any of the others I bought to date, I am on feet 12 hours a day, I work in nursing and am trying to protect my legs. I'm 5'31/2 and don't like compression socks because they hurt my toes."
4.0,Really nice cufflinks.
4.0,I love these delicate little things. Just wish ida paid attention they don’t have locking hoops ... I’m afraid I’ll lose one
4.0,Pretty teal blue robe.
4.0,awesome I love it
4.0,Cute but doesn't lay well on the arm to read.
4.0,I wanted a stiff brim and its floppy
4.0,"Timely arrival.  A little bigger than I anticipated, but my daughter may want to use as an ornament, for the tree."
4.0,"Holding up pretty well; however, the bar that screws into place to attach to the remote has unscrewed itself a couple times and I had to put it back, also the Mazda emblem has fallen off the one.  But I do like them."
4.0,I ordered the 0-3 month for my son. He fits into Carters size 3 months right now for a comparison. The sweatshirt was a little short and the pants seem like they have to be pulled up high. I think I would have preferred to order 3-6 month and just use the sweatshirt with jeans instead of he pants. For the price tho it's good I like it and he's gonna wear it for thanksgiving :)
4.0,They are so soft and nice. They fit great except the elastic in the bottoms are so tight. I’m trying to figure out how to loosen it.
4.0,Great looking homage watch of a Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean Corno.
4.0,"To me the Ldriance CZ & bar is a hit. You get two trendy necklaces (complementary designs) for the price of one. One is a bar and the other is a circle. They can be worn together or separately. They are dainty and very feminine. They are 14kt gold plated pieces, and I did not notice any irritation to my skin. These necklaces are nickel free and hypoallergenic. They can be worn casually or dressy. They are super cute, fun and reasonably priced.  I’d recommend these for yourself or someone else."
4.0,"This open cardigan is more of a t shirt material. It is very thin. So it does not keep you warm, but could work for a summer evening or just to add more eye appeal to an outfit. It is longer so I have liked wearing it with leggings so my bum is covered."
4.0,The beanie hat looks pretty much like it does in the stock picture. I ordered the bright orange color. It looks good. It is a nice combo that it has the Bluetooth audio feature and also a flashlight feature attached. The wire for the Bluetooth audio seems to be sticking out though. I am not sure why. I can kind of tuck it into the beanie but then the wire always ends up popping back out. I found it kind of odd that there is nowhere I can put the wire out of sight. I guess I can try taping it down.
4.0,Bought it for my girlfriends birthday because of her love for all that is Bees! Fyi... she loved it! And I loved seeing her happy!
4.0,I wear a medium in tops and large in bottoms. I ordered an xl and I guess it fits ok. Took forever to figure out how I was gonna fit in it but I finally did by just playing around with the strings so it was wide enough to get in.<br />Took about a month to get here but it still came 2 days earlier than expected date
4.0,These are very comfortable in the pouch are but the coverage in the rear is minimal. Nice product for the price. I wear a 34-36 and the xxl is the only wAy to go
4.0,attractive watch but difficult to open and close clasp
4.0,Very pretty outfit. You have to order one size up
4.0,Fit my teenage daughter 13 perfect. (Size 5 she’s tall n skinny ) for the price it was worth every penny!  Got it for her to remind her of my love while away for work ! She’s loves it! Hopefully it won’t turn colors !
4.0,My daughter really likes these boots
4.0,This ring is so unique. I love the design and looks like real diamonds!<br />Not so comfortable as the cubics rub on my fingers but I wear it a lot.<br />Only wish it was slightly wider
4.0,"These frames are thin and if you are looking for light ones, these fit the bill. I prefer a more substantial frame. Often I break the ear piece on some of my glasses. Not sure how much blue light intensity these actually suppress or block. Considering how inexpensive and how light the lenses are, I am not sure.<br /><br />They do seem to help reduce my eye strain some and are comfortable to wear. Like the case."
4.0,"The back and butt of this swimsuit are not lined. Very thin fabric there and you can see light through to the other side, so beware of snags - the fabric of the butt may not hold up sitting at concrete pools or rockier beaches. The rest of this swimsuit is lined, and overall has a flattering fit for me (5’10”, 165, B cup). Big fan of the adjustable straps at the torso/chest."
4.0,The color is not totally as what I seen online. It is light blue rather than Sapphire Blue (but darker than the skyblue one).
4.0,The is definitely not something I’d wear out of the house. It looks more like a bath robe rather then a jacket. It is very cozy and nice to wear around the house. As far as sizing I bought a large and I’m usually an xl and it was still too big but like I said I only wear it around the house so I don’t mind.
4.0,"Beautiful. I ordered this to wear with my outfit when I went to see Black Panther. It fit great, and the colors were beautiful."
4.0,"These were perfect and exactly what I was looking for, except one thing.<br /><br />They are shown to be solid black. As in the entire thing including the waistband. Unfortunately that is not the case with what I received. The waistband on my package had a silver stripe on it.<br /><br />This may not seem like a big deal, but I purchased them for my autistic nephew who SPECIFICALLY wanted ALL BLACK. It was a big deal.<br /><br />Other than that they seemed like they would be pretty durable and comfortable. I just wish they would of sent what was pictured."
4.0,"Really cute swim suit! Fit just about perfect! I have a narrow ribcage so it was a tad bit loose there, but besides that- perfect! I just needed it for a theme night on a river trip I'm leading, and I got more than I expected… for a price WAY lower than I could possibly find in any store. Quick shipping too! Good little fun buy :)"
4.0,"This is s beautiful necklace. It looks like a handcrafted piece of jewelry. The stones are vivid in color than it looked online. Very pretty. I like the length, not to long. I did find the chain is very delicate and could tangle easily. Shipment was quick and the box was beautifully made. I did receive a discount on this jewelry if I gave a review. I am happy with it and wish there were earrings to match. I checked out their other items and loved their creative designs and use of materials."
4.0,"This works well, it holds lots of earrings. The nice thing is you can see them all for easy selection - no more rummaging in a jewelry box."
4.0,I'm always on the lookout for very lightweight t-shirts and this fits the bill.  Nice and thin for the hot weather.  It doesn't state what color it is.
4.0,Very cute and comfortable!  Nice and light and breezy.  Only issue is they do sometimes ride up in the middle when I'm walking.
4.0,"Ordered this band for my husband . He likes it for going out. Work day's he wears the sports band because he gets pretty dirty. Comfortable fit. It is magnetic,  which is actually pretty easy, and cool to have !!"
4.0,"I am 5'4&#34; and wear a size 14/15 in jeans so I ordered these yoga pants in an XL, they fit me perfectly. These are definitely made to be more fitted (not loose or baggy) and this gives them a very slimming look. I was looking for a lighter weight yoga pant for spring with a wide waist band, had been looking for several weeks in my local stores but could not find exactly what I wanted. So glad I decided to check here, as soon as I saw these I knew they were it! Was a little nervous when I took them out of the packaging as they looked like they might be a tad too small, then I put them on and they relaxed instantly into the perfect fit. The only downside, and why I knocked off 1 star is because the printed design at the ankle disappeared after the first wash (which I thought was strange!) But this doesn't bother me at all, I wasn't really looking for them to have any type of pattern or design on them and now that I've washed them several times you can't even tell it was ever there. I will definitely be ordering more of these super comfy, super flattering yoga pants!!"
4.0,"Works fine, but small"
4.0,"Loved the look of this dress for Harry Potter inspired Helga Hufflepuff. Color is beautiful. Not sure I like the lacing in both the front and back. I’m wearing a petticoat under the skirt to fill it out better like in the picture. All in all, I was very happy because I achieved the look I was going for."
4.0,It came just as advertised
4.0,"I love KN , although this is very comfortable I wish they didn’t put elastic in the sleeves. This is not comfortable and the only reason I didn’t give 5 stars."
4.0,"Unlike my other nurse mates socks, these are made of cotton which wicks away moisture and saves me from damp feet I get after 7-8 hrs in my other pairs. They're very cute. You do lose a bit on compression but they're definitely within the stated range."
4.0,"Hopefully over time breaking these in, they will loosen some. I bought them for my daughter, her shoe size is an 8.5, I purchased 9 to be safe and they are a little snug. Mucks are fabulous and last years, but women sizes are snug."
4.0,"The pants are adorable. Maybe a little higher and looser at the waist, than expected... however I really enjoyed wearing these. They were super comfy, and I could see if I worked in an office, how they'd be comfy and stylish, all day long. After washing and drying, the wrinkles didnt seem to come out easily but a steamer helped. I ordered according to the chart but could have most likely sized down."
4.0,Love this belt! It goes well with so many of my clothes. I bought it when I was in search of a braided belt that matched a pair of wedges I have. It matches perfectly and looks cute too!
4.0,great feel. very heavy. sheds alittle to much.
4.0,The weather stripping worked just like it was supposed to.
4.0,"Nice pants for the price. Made well, fit a little big but they will grow with my son. Would buy again!"
4.0,Pretty Print. Arm holes needed takeing up
4.0,when does a scarf have a fit?
4.0,"Very Nice dress, does Not look cheap būt Not expensive too. Size is larger."
4.0,"Yup! The previous reviewer is quite right .... it's purple, not the least bit blue, but cute enough to keep! As to the sizing, I'm a 6 and it's perfect. Can't imagine it fitting a 12 so don't be disappointed!"
4.0,Shorts are thin but comfortable. Run a little smaller than expected
4.0,"I'm on the fence about this, just because I bought it to wear at work and it makes me look...er....extremely busty. Everything makes me look busty, but this *really* accentuates. I feel a little embarrassed to wear it in meetings and such. You definitely have to wear a camisole under it. I think I'm getting away with it but, er. It definitely draws the eyes of even the most well-meaning people.<br /><br />The tie thing that goes around it is several feet too long. It must be 8 feet long altogether. I cut mine in half so I can just tie it behind my back in a bow. When you wrap it all around under the bust, it draws even more attention. I'm sure for some people that would be a positive, lol.<br /><br />I'm usually a Large, it's a Large, it fits. This has not been the case with most of my Patty clothes. This one, at least, is accurate."
4.0,"Good quality, but not the color shown. The green was much darker."
4.0,For the money this is a very nice watch. For such a big watch it still does not fit a big mans wrist. Beware of this. Minus 1 star
4.0,"These are nice socks, however they are very thin which makes them breathable but unsure if they will last a while. Although, they look exactly the same after 4-5 washes, so only time will tell."
4.0,"The pen tip earrings are perfect, aside from my piercing holes turning black after a while and the gold rubbing off due to wear. The cherry earrings I had a little more trouble with though. The original bit that hooked onto the ear never sat right, so I had to do a little bit to ""fix them"". Another 2 issues I found with them is that the wire is thin and is easily bendable, so just be careful. The cherries also like to slip off of the wire if they get cought on something. But other then that the earrings are adorable and I get lots of compliments wearing them. Just be aware of there flaws and you will be ok."
4.0,"Super cute! And pretty sturdy as well, seems a tad bit low, maybe I just have too small of boobs for it."
4.0,Runs a little small but there is nothing wrong with a snug fit.
4.0,Alot bigger than I thought. Those that want to be able to carry a tablet or a Kindle it will work for u. I just wanted it for my wallet and phone
4.0,"I’m normally Small (121 lb and 5’3”).  The firs time I ordered a Medium based on reviews and to have enough space for squats, because Most of my leggings tear while squatting... Medium was incredibly big and lose, perfect for squatting but does not look nice... but still liked the design, color, flexibility of the fabric and wanted to give them another chance... So I ordered Small this time, it fits great, but I don’t feel as confident squatting in public, I have the feeling that it can rip anytime."
4.0,"Nice products, not all picks are exactly what you want but so far so good."
4.0,Let's get right to it<br />5'6<br />38 waist<br />44 hips<br />For comfy<br />Great to dress up or down<br />Ordered XL
4.0,"Nice, quality jacket one would expect from Mt. Hardware. The baffles are sewn-through, and the loft approaches 1&#34;. Combined with clothing one would expect for light to moderate outdoor activity, this jacket would keep most people warm into the mid-teens and above. Elastic drawstring around the hem and elasticized wrists keep the chill at bay."
4.0,Very comfortable for my husband but they were a bit see through
4.0,"I previously purchased a pair of black leggings from the same company. I fell in love with them. They are not see-through, they fit perfect, not too tight. I ordered a size small in both the black and these fig colored ones, and am typically a size 6. They fit GREAT."
4.0,Last only 8hrs not that good.
4.0,Looks like a designer watch.<br />Need to handled carefully.
4.0,These are super cute just a little smaller than the picture leads you to believe
4.0,My 8 year old son digs the old school look and size. Just wish it was water proof but understand with the price
4.0,"My 4 year 2 month son, 70th percentile height, fits in these well. They are a couple inches shy of the knee. Can be pulled over shin guards but tend to skip down an inch below the top of the shin guard. Material is sturdy but not overly thick/fluffy, more of an athletic feel. Overall good cheap soccer sock for a 4 yr old."
4.0,LIke the dress and it fits well.  The slit is a little weird but I plan to close it somewhat with a few hand stitches.  Nice dress to dress up or down.  I would recommend.
4.0,"Fabric is very stretchy.  The tie quickly becomes a rope, but that's ok if you're just wanting to close the robe.  I'm thinking about opening the seam an applying some interfacing...??  The inside tie is handy.  Chopped a little piece off to add a helpful loop inside the neck to hang the garment on a door hook (it stretches out an unsightly &#34;pooch&#34; without it).  I'm also contemplating a button or pin-thing on the outside closure to keep the front top layer controlled.  Other than these little alterations, I love this garment."
4.0,"Just a bit small across. Wish it was just a few inches wider. That being said, it's very pretty. It's made from pretty colored yarns, blacks, beige, and variegated greens, pinks, yellows, browns and blues. The yarn is very soft. It has long tassles and when I put it on, the point on the poncho is long enough that it brings the tassels down below my knees, and I'm 5'7&#34;. So, it's pretty long! It also has pretty gold sequins sewn in, all thru the bottom half of the poncho.I really did want to give it the full five stars, but couldn't because of how narrow the poncho is.<br /><br />I did receive this poncho at a discounted price for my honest opinion. I would recommend this to my family and friends!"
4.0,nice prom dress for preteen.
4.0,material could have been better but it is oh so cute
4.0,"Much, much too short! Kind of look like ordinary house dress."
4.0,"This sauna vest seems to be very well made. Nice solid zipper, inner flap on zipper to protect your skin, snug (compression) fit. After reading reviews I did buy one size larger than I normally wear and it fit great. Also, several reviewers said it was hard to zip up, I agree, so I just zip it up about 1/3 of the way, pull it over your head like a t-shirt and zip it the rest of the way up afterwards. Problem solved! Really makes me sweat, the compression seems to help me lower back while lifting weights and cardio exercises, I say (for me) it’s an A!"
4.0,"Looks great very sparkly, Howe the braces holding the stud does become dull after a week or 2"
4.0,"The boobage area was a bit small, not for women with A cup. still fit nice on other parts!"
4.0,Nice color.  I wear it often and have gotten nice compliments!
4.0,Product brook a couple of applications to actually work. Kept the vast majority of fog from my glasses. Since I have to mask up in different temperatures this is very important.
4.0,Order a few sizes up. Bought this for my daughter and it was very tight. Cute design though
4.0,Bought this for a session with a dark red dress. The pic shows more. Prominent dark red flowers than the one I ended up with. Otherwise nice.
4.0,"For the price--good deal. The reason I gave this 4 stars is that some of the lights didn't work. For the lights that did (about 75%), this was a great deal."
4.0,"Doesn't really pull everything in like I wanted, but is comfortable and looks nice."
4.0,For the price it’s a very nice rain jacket. I was disappointed to see a “made in China” sticker on it when I first opened it as I assumed it was made in Europe.  The large fit true to size for me and it’s a good looking jacket. But again just disappointed about where it was made.  Time will tell how well it holds up.  Again this is made in China not Germany like other reviews have suggested.
4.0,"Loved the boot, color, style.  Had a couple imperfections (scuff, small damage in leather)<br />Didn't see the option to exchange just return, returned and went to reorder price had increased $43.  Decided not to pay almost $200."
4.0,hard to put on
4.0,"Nice dress, however the ribbon for the lace up back could be longer. And I didn’t receive a crinoline like the description said. A couple of spots I’ll have to mend. But it is a nice dress for the price."
4.0,The reflective tape were not stretchable around the chest area…
4.0,Keeps my feet warmer than most compression socks.
4.0,"I love the wide-angle view of a swim mask as opposed to goggles. I've only worn these once, but I think they'll be my new 'go-to' for swimming. The suction is amazing. I've always been prone to face marking from goggles, and these are no exception. Also, because it's a swim mask, rather than goggles, the markings are bigger and more pronounced, even without tightening the goggles overly much."
4.0,"I really like this dress.  It hangs down and covers most of my bumps and rolls.  However, I would never consider wearing a dress made from this type fabric without wearing shapewear.  While it skims over most of those, they show at some point.  The fabric is lightweight and very stretchy.  The twisted knot at the bottom adds a great focal detail.  I just had to adjust it so the under stitching was not on top when knotted.  I will probably sew that in place.  I don't like raw edges showing.  This dress fits pretty true to size.  I normally get a 1XL in tops.  I got this in the same size.  The shoulders fit fine and the V-neck is not cut too low.  The only negative I have on this dress are the sleeves.  They are too short for my liking.  They may be fine for others.  But, I need my upper arms covered.  These sleeves only come down about 5"" above my elbows.  I need them to at least come to my elbows to cover all my problems areas there as well.  The sleeves are a tad tight too.  But they're stretchy so that's not a major issue.  I am 5'8"" and the knot comes to the top of my knee and the rest of the hem is right below my knees.  I did wash this in the washing machine even though it says ""handwash"".  I hung it to dry.  Did not shrink at all.  It's made of 100% cotton.  It does have to be ironed.  In order for me to wear this dress, I will have to figure out a way to add length to the sleeves.  Other than that, it's a really cute dress that covers a lot!"
4.0,"Gorgeous top with great artwork. I ordered a large, and it was too long. I took it up about 2 inches, and it's great!!"
4.0,I went by what everyone else said about them fitting small ..I ordered a Med and should have ordered a small....If you are looking for a tight fit like myself order down...if your looking for a comfortable fit order your regular size.
4.0,These boots are roomy and warm but could use a little more padding in the sole for those long days on your feet.
4.0,Very cute. Great price. Horse is a bit heavy though if that bothers you on your handbag.
4.0,No me agrado que cierre levanta el area de la bolsa. Todo lo demás es lindo.
4.0,"The green ones are super cute and have made it through several washes.  These would have been 5 stars, but the black ones are just ugly.  I wish that we had been given a different color selection.  The graphic just doesn’t work as well on the black."
4.0,They're okay. Lot for your money. Haven't used long enough to see if they hold up but appear to be very good quality.
4.0,"The leather had a strong odor to it when initially unwrapped, but that faded within a day or two. The shoes held up for an entire summer of my toddler's abuse and the bottoms still have a significant amount of tread and no threads came loose. Would buy again as long as the price stays under $20."
4.0,I love wearing this with all my special dresses. I am very glad I finally got one of these. It works so good!
4.0,"I bought this as a gift and the person loved how it looked, the image is clear. It lost one star due to the fact that the cord won’t slide one the one side."
4.0,"I bought these for my son & I ended-up playing with them more than he did, but it is great that we can roll play characters & be silly together with inexpensive props like these."
4.0,love it only complaint is its slippery  which sounds weird but setting on a chair couch ect falls every time
4.0,"This is such a nice simple, modest dress. It is just as described. I ordered it in four different colors."
4.0,I wear these to ride all the time. Keep the wind out of my eyes.  Prefer the darker lens then the yellow ones but awesome product for the cheap price
4.0,"It fits really well and feels nice. It comes down far enough on my legs that I'm comfortable, and it covers my cleavage well. The only thing I don't like is how easily it wrinkles. If you're in between sizes, go for the larger."
4.0,"They do a pretty good job of keeping my ears warm and are soft. The “leather” looking ones look like cheap, shiney plastic vinyl. If I bought another pair, it’d be the cloth ones."
4.0,Love this top. I ordered one size larger than normal.
4.0,I received these today. I like the sturdy feel. They are not made of thin cheap material and i like that. I normally wear a US 10 but read reviews that these run small so i purchased an XL they a bit large in the waist but i was able to adjust them with the drawstrings. My only issue is the thigh area is a little small. They fit exact like skinny jeans. I would have liked a little more thigh room but if i go up another size the waist will be extremely too big. But overall nice pants.
4.0,"Love it. I’m 5’4”, 160# bought a M and it is perfect. AND it has pockets!! Super comfy as well."
4.0,"I changed my review on this from a 1 start to a 4.  Although I'm not a fan of the material, I have gotten a lot of compliments while wearing this blouse.  So, I guess maybe my opinion was a bit skewed.  :)"
4.0,"Nicely soft, good!"
4.0,Convenient little bag to use at concerts that require clear bags.
4.0,Didn’t fit so sent back without issue
4.0,"This is a very pretty bralette offering medium support (I am a 38D).  I wouldn't try to run or jump in it due to the lack of support.  I purchased this item for when I am lounging, and am very satisfied with it for that purpose.  However, as some other reviewers mentioned, the fabric is itchy.  I have washed it once without any change in that fact.  And just so you are aware, it is also see through, with the exception of the cup area.  If this were a softer fabric, it would be a five star item."
4.0,This is a beautiful pancho! The only thing is the buttons on the side don't stay secure and unbutton constantly. I always have to button it over. So I use safety pins to keep them tightly secure. However that is small. The print is beautiful! It can really dress us an outfit!
4.0,"Used it one day, since unboxing and it already has a chip off the lens (small)<br /><br />Otherwise love the unique design of these Halfrims, wish there wasn't a defect already.<br /><br />Green pair do not have chips/damage and I've had them for longer. 😒"
4.0,"This sweater, although pretty will swallow you. Way too BIG"
4.0,"These are beautiful and seemed to be well made. For the times we’re in, though, this is not sufficient for protection. So, you have to either sew in more material, wear a mask underneath it, or somehow make a filter pocket. Otherwise, these are really pretty!"
4.0,Cute.  Was just what our daughter wanted. Only 4 stars because it looks a little cheap.
4.0,"I had surgery so I needed loose fitting dresses. This dress is what I was looking for. The print is fun too. Being short, I wish they offered petite sizes too. I bought small & it is a little long."
4.0,They bend inwards a little and they’re not completely clear they’re a little foggy/cloudy even when you clean them
4.0,"Best Nana Ever is a very well made V-neck T-shirt.  The T-shirt is manufactured by Hanes so it is good quality.  As soon as I received the T-shirt I washed and dried it and it came out beautiful, it is sewn good and no loose threads.  The screen print is well done and well placed on the T-shirt.  The color is a nice medium to dark purple and the lettering is lavender and white making the whole T-shirt a nice color combination.  The fabric is very soft and feels nice on. It is a very comfortable T-shirt.  I am a Nana to my four grandchildren and I am very proud to wear this T-shirt.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received  the Nana T-shirt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  This disclaimer is part of Amazon's reviewer guidelines and in no way influences my review.  I am not paid for my reviews, and my opinions are my own."
4.0,Excellent buy for the money. Just right for travel.
4.0,"I received this yesterday 5/11/16, opened the box and wow! Just like the others have commented was that a stone was in the box, that had fallen out. Well looks like I have to get the good ole glue out! I will give this necklace a good shake-up to see if anything else is loose and glue away!"
4.0,"This is dress is just too cute not to love.  My daughter is 2.5 years old and a solid 2T in Carters.  I'd say that this dress runs a little big, comparatively, but maybe is more along Baby Gap sizing, which I also think runs a little big (at least bigger than Carters).  I love the design and all of the details, like the pleats along the hem and the ruffles around the neck.  The fabric is not super thin, but also not so thick that it's stiff.  It's a nice weight and fairly soft, especially after a wash.  It does wrinkle quite easily, but since it's 100% cotton, I would expect that.  The tag, and I feel this is important to note, is a soft fabric tag, and not like the ones that come on cheap T-shirts that have sharp corners. I also love that it is all one solid color fabric, which I feel is hard to find for young children.  EVERYTHING has a print or something on it, and I really appreciate the simplicity of this fabric and design.<br /><br />The photos show the dress when it arrived, after a wash (wrinkled), after a pass with our handheld garment steamer, and my daughter wearing it after it was steamed.  If I could improve on it, the one thing I would do is make the button loops elastic.  They do not have much stretch, which makes it a bit difficult to button and unbutton on a wiggling toddler.  It probably wouldn't be an issue for an older child though.  The dress arrived yesterday and I had to wash it because my daughter wanted to wear her ""new pretty dress"" today!"
4.0,"it was a very cheap deal and I wasn't sure if I really was going to like, but if I didn't there wouldn't be that much regret.  But guess what?  I really like it, they are not big scarfs but they will be nice for the summer time."
4.0,"First of all its a great sweater. The quality is good and seems durable so far. However, I washed and dried it for the first time and it shrank more than expected. Now I have a lot of sweaters and only the cheap ones have shrunk like this. So, expect shrinkage like cold water boys."
4.0,They won't fit on glasses that has a bar like across the very top of the glasses. Unable to use them.
4.0,"Great material, soft lace, fits very well and surprisingly my nipples were not exposed,  my only was that it wasn't deep enough,  like I wanted to show my cleavage a little other than that it's great. Received a lot of compliments. True to size!"
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" 135lb and the large fits well/almost snug. The letters feel kind of sticky and wrinkle easily. It's a cool shirt with a good length. Would buy again."
4.0,The only thing I dislike about this belt is having to remove the end clasp to take it out of most of my pants belt loops.  the head is too large to go through together with the strap.
4.0,"Great quality and fast shipping, but sizes do run big."
4.0,"Really tight across the bust for more top-heavy girls such as myself. I wear a 36C bra and am absolutely squished up top. This also causes a gaping at the neckline- the top front won’t lay down againtst my chest. A bigger size wouldn’t fit my on the waist, though. I still wear the dress because it’s really cute even though it’s smooshing the girls."
4.0,As advertised. They're nice shoes.
4.0,"Love my brushes! Very cute & suprisingly soft to the touch for the cost. Works well for applying hilight, blush & blending eyeshadow. Only gripe is that I wished there was a foundation brush to use as well. Other than that they are perfect! 👌🏽"
4.0,"It's a beautiful little dress, but is too short. It will definitely needs to have pants on under it."
4.0,It looks great.  There isn't a way to regulate the length.
4.0,I do like the material. Size runs big. I could have ordered a small instead of a medium. I am keeping it. Maybe it will shrink in the dryer.
4.0,"The dress is a classy take on the cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's, except it has a somewhat sweetheart neckline to accentuate your chest without showing too much cleavage (unless you want to use a stiff corset/extreme push-up bra to bring those puppies out). There's a bit of stretch to it and I bought the black color (without any lace). Reasonable price for a classic dress. Size as usual and I recommend dry cleaning this dress. I like it and it replaces an older dress I had in this style which I loved, that no longer fits me (ah the joys of aging)."
4.0,"Fits well and is made of heavy material, not flimsy at all. Got lots of compliments so, I ordered another one. LOL!"
4.0,"These pants are amazing. They fit perfectly, especially since I am pretty short. They sit right at my ankles which is something that I don't get often when buying jeggings or leggings."
4.0,Sweet fit
4.0,Not super comfy but my tits look fabulous
4.0,"I love these and they are very warm.  If they didn't shrink so much, I would've gave them 5 stars.  Luckily I purchased a size large (I am a medium), and when I tried them on they were very baggy (which is how I like jammies to sleep in), but after washing and drying, they shrunk and are now a perfect fit. Not so comfortable to sleep in now, but comfortable for wearing around the house on cold winter nights."
4.0,Awesome  it was just as described!
4.0,Title says it all. The clips seem reasonably secure and of a decent weight. No obvious way for keys to come loose.<br /><br />Minus one star for the rather thin and light duty leather. I suspect this key case will not hold up well with time and use. Leather is thin to the point of not inspiring confidence!
4.0,Little hard to get on and off the ear but not as fragile as it looks.
4.0,"Kids love these things! They're pretty cute, but if the kids play hard, this may not be the watch for your kid/grandkid. Ours didn't make it 2 weeks! Not really the watches fault"
4.0,Great  the top just won't stay up<br />Put feels wonderful  on my feet
4.0,"Necklace is very nice, but this is certainly not cultured pearls.  These are shell beads.  Please adjust the description to reflect what the necklace is really made from."
4.0,One size fits most flex fit. I usually wear a small/medium. This fits like a medium/large it's a little looser than I'm used too but fits ok.
4.0,Cute shirt but the fit was bigger than expected.
4.0,"It is amazing that this skirt is not offered in any but &#34;one size fits all.&#34;  I read other reviews and since I wear a size 4 and am 5'3&#34;, I took a chance and sure enough this skirt fits me just fine.  For the price, (very cheap in my estimation) I think it is a good deal.  It arrived very wrinkled so (absolutely no label on it, no washing/care instructions at all) I ironed it by sprinkling with water and dry iron set on wool.  It came out just fine.  You have to wear a slip under it but once again, for the price it is just fine."
4.0,I like the material and the bright colors... the sailboat logo is cute too. I just wish they were smaller I wear a 5 and always have a hard time finding socks that actually fit. They don’t offer as much compression as I’d like because they’re too big.
4.0,"The coat came a little big but once i washed it, it fit much better. The bottom part is a but bulkier than I imagined. The fabric is thin including the pockets and is probably better for an autumn day rather than a snowy one. I still think its a good jacket, its just a little out of my comfort zone."
4.0,Deceived with length. I have a relatively smaller wrist and this was more for teenager. I felt the length specified was not with the extra chain to make larger if needed.
4.0,"For the price, I absolutely love this. I usually wear an XL, I ordered an XL, and it fit perfectly. The color is wonderful. I got this on a lightening deal for under $20.00 so it was worth it. The contrasting color is nice, but the sleeves don't exactly match up (see photo.) Overall I do like it."
4.0,Fits well. I'm a 36B and got a medium. But i can understand the other ladies who said that this runs small. I doubt this will fit any of the larger cups.<br />Very cute and comfortable. Can't beat the price.
4.0,My granddaughter liked it. It was a gift for her.
4.0,Touch screen fingers don't give the best control but otherwise perfect
4.0,This is a very pretty blouse.  Went according to the size chart and the fit is great.  Great for a night out or to dress up a pair of jeans.
4.0,I love it. I get so many compliments on it and it's well made
4.0,Really impressed with quality for such an inexpensive dress
4.0,Excellent for the price setting not the best but very clean cz's. Would recommend these to a friendS and family
4.0,nice hiking pants. they are lightweight and comfortable to wear. The material has a light stretch to it making it move with you. The sizing seems pretty much true to size - with a little extra give for movement. You really don't want tight hiking pants for hiking. I have washed these a few times and they wash up just fine - no shrinkage. The lightweight material also makes it great to stash in my backpack on days when I start out in shorts but we either end up having to do some bushwacking or the weather turns chilly - so long pants are needed.  I did not get the convertible pants - the ones that have the legs zip off and they turn into capris/shorts so can't speak to that.
4.0,Thin gold earrings!!! Got lots of compliments
4.0,"Very thin, but good support. I wear a soft sports bra over it for more coverage."
4.0,Almost impossible to find replacement band forID131 COLOR HR.  This band is not a ‘perfect’ fit but it can be used!  It’s slightly narrower than the fit device.  It works tho and I happy about that!!
4.0,"The shirts ain't that stretchy,  that are tight fit.  Shorts fit good."
4.0,"nice masks, soft,comfortable  material, vibrant colors.hope they last after washing."
4.0,It is now my favorite winter hat. My daughter calls it my &#34;Fat Albert&#34; hat. Otherwise I would give it a 5.
4.0,Cute. Nice quality material. Has not been washed so I don't know about durability.
4.0,They fit a littler tight on my ankles. I still wear them. But a bigger size wouldn’t hurt
4.0,the dress is beautiful and fits perfect
4.0,"Great detail, super cute; just not a posable as its human counterparts seem to be... Got a great thank you note & origami in package as well!"
4.0,"A little faded, but most likely how the product comes."
4.0,Doesn’t ride up feels great on.
4.0,Nice socks but can’t get past the color. They’re kind of a terra cotta flower pot color and I was looking for more of a UPS brown. Other than the color they are a good fit and nice quality.
4.0,Pretty dress. Worth buying
4.0,"This dress is beautiful! I was hoping the lace would be a little less white more of a off white but still beautiful. It fits great everywhere but in the arms, its a little tight under the arms honestly that is my only issue, but I can get over that part. It slims nicely and love that is has a second lining so its not super thin and see through like so much I have purchased online.I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review"
4.0,"The suit is beautiful, but much much smaller than I would have expected."
4.0,The watch was great for about 7 days then the band began to tear and then the watch stop working all together.
4.0,"It is a watch that has the value for what you pay but it looks good,,"
4.0,"Cute dress, fits like expected. I’m regularly a size 5 in women’s and the small fit perfectly."
4.0,"Purchased floral cream in sz large. I’m 5.3” 155. Fits a bit loose. Could have used a medium. Perfect length to the floor, required no hemming. If your taller than 5.4” it’ll be above your ankles. This lighter color required a slip, but very comfortable"
4.0,I like the soft fabric and pretty colors.  They  pad behind my ears which hurts from the glasses.  My daughter has them on her glasses and sunglasses and they stay on well.  Not so well for me.  They slip off when I take my glasses on and off.  I think my glasses are a little too thin for them. About once a day I have to hunt for one of them and put it back on.
4.0,well built and easy to read
4.0,"Size down! Material is super soft and very cute, cozy to longe in especially during the cold months."
4.0,It wasn't the best veil but it definitely did the job. It was long enough to go over my long trail but I had to trim around the edges because they were very sloppy cuts all around the lace. Once I did that it was a better look overall and worked for that 1 day.
4.0,My friend joked that it looked as high-end as his $8000 Tagheur haha. The watch clasp has a tinge of discoloration but the overall watch is beautiful nonetheless. Can't wait to show it off! The polka dot canvas case the watch comes with is a plus :)
4.0,"Looks really great but is so thick the material, it's like for winter."
4.0,It is a nice hat but I was looking for warm and soft feelings. Unfortunately it is soft but not warm.
4.0,They look really cute. Wish I could have the real color in small but still happy with the way it fits.
4.0,The cut and fit is a little off and out of style
4.0,"I just received the coral and although it's such a pretty color, it's very see through. I am going to return it and try a darker color. The fit is as expected based on the reviews. I'm around a size 10, 5'3&#34;,  36DD breast and a large fits me pretty well. It hits below just at the bottom of the knee on me and I like that."
4.0,Fit good and looks good
4.0,Bigger then looked
4.0,"Dress is true to size. The sleeves and torso are a loose fit, as seen in the seller photo. Material is a little thin, better suited for warmer weather. Would be nice if the ties were a little thicker to add volume to the bow, but this look is subtle. The elastic band hides well under a belt, looks a bit odd without one. Overall happy with my purchase."
4.0,"I'm 5'6 and I believe that the sweater is longer than what is described in the picture.  I like the material, but with the length and pockets, it reminds me more of a lab coat.... I like it, but not exactly the same sweater as in the picture."
4.0,The color is a lot darker then pictured.  Same color as Vivid blue.
4.0,"it had some extra frills on it, the bow fell apart and she didn't even get a chance to wear that but my little looked so cute for the holidays in the rest of it"
4.0,The top runs small but the bottoms fit as expected.
4.0,"absolutely, maximum comfort and support"
4.0,"Runs small, and not breathable at all. Not sure if I will actually wear them"
4.0,"This is the second pair of Robeez I have bought for my infant son, and they are worth the money.  I also bought a pair for my 3 year old son at Christmas (so they would match!), but he's not a big fan - very active preschooler and he tore his up pretty quickly. But I would highly recommend them for babies who are not walking yet - very comfy and wear well!"
4.0,"These are really cute slippers, but the sizing is off. I ordered my child's current size and they were huge. I reordered a size down and they fit much better."
4.0,This kitty is so cute! I have ordered other items from this company.So far the only problems with the jewelry has been a loose piece on the clasp or where the pendants are attached. This was easily remedied with a little pair of pliers! I just think it's the cutest and i am ordering more for Christmas gifts. And for the price~ my goodness just order it already! :D
4.0,"My wife really likes these slippers I purchased for her for Christmas. Why I picked these for her:<br /><br />* They're smaller than most slippers. Slippers tend to be huge, floppy, and hard to walk in. These are more like very warm house shoes than traditional slippers.<br />* They're stylish. Cannot say that for most slippers. If she accidentally wore them out without changing, I doubt most people would notice.<br />* They have more rigid soles that traditional slippers. A quick trip to the outdoor recycle bin? No problem.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* No arch support. I didn't really expect arch support since they are firmly in the slipper category, but still it would be nice.<br />* Since they have the warm lining, the first pair she tried were too small. We went up 1 size and they fit great."
4.0,"Our son has become a true gamer just like Dad.. the fabric soft is not to thick and perfect for sleeping in. It appears true size.<br /><br />This is a holiday present so we haven’t given this to our son yet but, are anxiously excited for his reaction on the big day. (I’ll update my review once they been played with a bit of anything changes)<br /><br />All and all a great product for the younger DB fans. I would definitely recommend this product"
4.0,"Great dress, especially for the price!  It's a tiny bit awkward on me because I have big ribs, but the floral pattern distracts from it."
4.0,"This dress is sooo pretty its really form fitting, of i lose about  50lbs it would be just right,  but i can wear a cover up for now to cover my bottom. Im more on the modset side so it really bothers me to have my clothes really tight.  But other then me needed a bigger size the dress is gorgues gorgeous. I wish they had different colors maybe solid colors, that would be awesome . Plan o  posting pictures at a later date...."
4.0,"The shirt was as expected, fit nice and price was clean and clear."
4.0,"Kind of stiff and not as comfy as I had hoped for, but looks cute on and fits true to size. Definitely not stretchy or baggy so size up if you’re in between sizes"
4.0,Great quality. I'm 5'7 130 and don't have any boobs thank goodness or I wld not have had any room for them. Fits small so order a size up for sure.
4.0,"Good quality cufflink. Size a tad larger than i thought, but still alright."
4.0,Very cute but not for mobile baby.  Colors wear off quickly.
4.0,Chain came loose and broke I was able to fix it and I really enjoy using it. It would have gotten 5 stars if it hadn't broke.
4.0,"Took a long time to get here, but finally received them yesterday after a month or so waiting.  Very nice, good size."
4.0,"If I was buying an actual ski mask for skiing, I wouldn't buy these. You get what you pay for. I only have to wear them 10 minutes, tops. Not very comfortable, the insulating foam is scratchy and not very good quality. The mask itself is a bit too wide, and my forehead is 21.5 inches around. Fortunately, it fits where I need it to, which is under my eyes and across my nose. If I was buying it for skiing, I'd have probably given it 3 stars, being generous on account of the cost."
4.0,I'm keeping it because I love the shirt it just doesn't stretch much
4.0,Wish that the sleeves unsnapped completely on top.  Only the top of the shoulder and under the arm and down the side unsnap.  Makes it difficult to put on and snap shut with my arm immobilized.  I do like the fabric.  Very soft.
4.0,Sups. It’s the only reason I gave a 4star is bc it doesn’t have sizes for plus size women
4.0,The shirts are beautiful but fits as if they were size 5T not 6.
4.0,"I absolutely love these...only issue was that they were a little loose/too big on my face and I couldn't wear them. Gave them to a friend, who loved them. Wish they were a bit tighter on the head."
4.0,"I purchased a beige one and really like it. I then purchased a spare one of the same color. I have a big head and never like tightly fitted hat or shallow hat.This hat fits me well and look nice. Quality is great too. Hat comes with a plastic bag, which I can use to store the hat in trunk or back seat."
4.0,I really wanted to love this top but the fit was so off for me. The material and bright blue color are both great. The fit was off for me. It was wide and real baggy.
4.0,This dress is nice and flowy. I ordered this as a second Milumia dress that I wasn't sure about and ended up liking it
4.0,I truly like the product. I least liked the delivert. I am very happy to.receive it. Better late tjan never.
4.0,Did not like the colors...
4.0,THIS MASK IS MADE WELL BUT VERY SMALL AND UNCOMFORTABLE for someone with a larger face.<br />the strap across the back of the neck was too short and it pinched the top of my nose. the quality is there just not the size. would be good for a child or teen
4.0,My daughter loves it. very cute and made in America.
4.0,I gave this to my sister in law as a gift. The jewel is gorgeous but the box that came with it was ugly so I replaced the box.
4.0,"Pretty but size is cut a bit smaller than described. Nice fabric, Fits at mid upper thigh in length and Im 5'4&#34;."
4.0,Exactly what I expected. Thank you.
4.0,Was a gift...
4.0,"I really like this tee.  The strappy neckline gives it a little more interest than just a regular crew neck or V neck.  I also like the curved hem, I always think it is more flattering than a straight hem. The material is very soft, flowy & not too clingy.  I would say it runs big.  I think I'm on the lower spectrum of a size 12...around 39 in. around the chest area.  I ordered a medium and it fit comfortably.  I wish they had this top in patterns.  I'd totally order a bunch of them.  **UPDATE...lost some weight.  Liked this top so much, I ordered it in a Small in two colors."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I think it's super cute. I'm 5'2&#34; and it's quite long on me, past my knees. I really love the belt it came with and have used it on other dresses. I ordered a size up just in case, but I don't think I needed it. The only thing that stinks is that I have a large chest and the stripes on the shirt don't totally align to wear my breasts fall, so it looks a little odd. But, I think I'm the only one paying attention that. I think if I were to buy it again, I'd probably only buy the skirt and buy a similar belt separately. Live & learn!"
4.0,Very nice will be great for dress up or staying in. Whichever is your preference. I love the style.
4.0,small and cute
4.0,It made a really nice gift.
4.0,"As they indicated, it took some time to receive but the retailer was totally upfront about that.  It is a great size and, for the cost, I think it's a good value."
4.0,It's small but still looks nice.
4.0,I like these. It removes the constant irritation of heckling my kids to stop everything and tie their shoes lest the world come to an end. Wish the colors continued into the larger sizes.. I guess people with big feet need serious (black) laces.
4.0,love those pants and as expected only issue is the quality. After the second wash little linen things will come out and starts peeling or threading.
4.0,Exactly what I needed. Sent one to my husbands niece and his sister-in-law.  Few words mean a lot.
4.0,I bought a large
4.0,These are comfortable socks. I love how the bottom is thicker than normal socks and the fact that they are bamboo natural insulation and order resistant. These are crewsocks and go little above ankle so not the type to wear with shorts.
4.0,Love the shirt I sized up a size but not as flowy as I expected
4.0,"These work just like they stated they would.  VERY difficult to open!  I tried by hand and managed to get ONE open but since my nails almost broke I gave up on that idea!  Finally found a phillips head screw driver that fit into the hole but was larger than the hole so when I pushed down into the hole, as the screw driver progressed through the hole the charm popped open!  I had to place the charms on a pile of papers in order to allow room for the driver to go though.<br /><br />I guess overall this isn't a bad thing since you want the charms to STAY ON after you close them!  I do wish the rubber grips would have helped provide for a tighter grip because the bracelet I put them on wasn't thick.  On a thicker bracelet the grips would be fine.  Since I wanted my charms to stay in place that was important to me.  I converted a bracelet into an ornament to hang from my rearview mirror and neeeded these charms to act as spacers so to speak.<br /><br />For my spacer purpose I would have liked them to be thinner but overall they worked.  If you are looking for just charms I'd recommend these for sure."
4.0,"UPDATE: Initially they sent me the 6mm earrings when I had ordered the 3mm earrings. After contacting the company they were kind enough to send me the correct size directly from their shop. They also told me to just keep the larger pair as well. Really great customer service. And I love the earrings so much. Really pretty and great for the price. And I have very sensitive ears and these dont irritate my ears at all. Highly recommend!<br /><br />I was so excited to get my 3mm earrings in the mail today. I opened the box immediately and put them right in. Once I got them in though and looked in the mirror I realized they were way too big. The box is labeled as 3mm, but after measuring them and comparing to people's pictures in other reviews, they are definitely they 6mm earrings. I am supper disappointed now... They are actually really pretty, but the whole reason I wanted them was because they were small and would look good in my second holes. This companie's quality control needs some work. Guess I just wasted $17."
4.0,Kinda bulky and stiff
4.0,Is a little weird in the arms but honestly is a nice fit
4.0,This fits well and isn't as uncomfortable as I thought it would be. Definitely recommend!
4.0,My husband is hard to fit for sunglasses and these fit him perfectly. They are dark enough to avoid squinting while driving but not so dark that he's unable to see through the window tint.
4.0,"I quite like this shirt, which lands somewhere between ""shirt"" and ""sweater"" for me. It's very soft and very warm. The style (especially the neckline) has something about the ribbing that says ""inexpensive"" but overall it's so comfortable that I'm happy to wear this on a regular basis in and out of the home, though not at work or anywhere appearance is relatively important"
4.0,It doesn't lay flat and the elastic rides up.  I don't usually wear scarf like things so maybe it's me.  It is pretty.
4.0,Perfect for my daughter's Sarah and Duck Halloween costume. The zipper broke after about 2 months (the pull got stretched out somehow) but she still wears it as long as there's no heavy rain
4.0,I like it but a little big
4.0,The watch has been working well for me. It looks good and so far its kept perfect time.
4.0,"I am very pleased with this dress. It's beautiful. Recd my order in 4 days.....I am 5'4....about 170lbs.......ordered a Large. It's perfect, the material is very nice,very elegant."
4.0,"According to the size chart, I needed a medium but that size was out of stock so I ordered XL to see if I could make them work. I had a really hard to time getting them on.. very tight. Good quality but I returned for a refund."
4.0,I ordered the correct size based on shoe size I wear. These slippers are nice and cozy but they go stretch and end up loose
4.0,"I don't hold high expectations for inexpensive suits on Amazon, but this one really is pretty sharp. The ivory color looks like a natural linen, but in a way it's better; doesn't do the instant-wrinkle act so typical of linen that makes it look like you slept in in last night. I wore it to a long party, much of it outdoors in the heat. It retained its shape nicely and still breathed reasonably well.<br /><br />Unlike many imported suits on Amazon, this one gives you some size guidance, and I found the guidance to be accurate. I'm a slim 5-8, 150, 31"" waist, and ordered the size 38 package. Great fit. Had to hem trousers, of course, but that's normal.<br /><br />Some reviewers have called the pants ""see-through."" Not at all my experience. True, it's not the best-made suit you'll ever wear. For example, jacket button holes are a bit tight.<br /><br />But it works. This suit is going into my arsenal for summer weddings and parties. Best 85 bucks I ever spent."
4.0,"Great Sweatshirt, but it is short. If you want this to be big and baggy, it is not.  It isn't tight but it will sit right at your waist line."
4.0,"This is a very substantial bracelet without being too heavy to still feel feminine. The heart is clearly etched with ""Sisters."" The lobster claw clasp is a little tricky to get on yourself at first, but will definitely keep the bracelet secure. The stainless steel should keep this bracelet looking nice for years to come. I think any sister would be pleased to receive this thoughtful gift. I feel certain you will be pleased with the quality."
4.0,I gave this a 4 because it is a very nice piece. But was to small for my rist.
4.0,I love the product but the items that are shown were not included in the shipping.  I didn't receive the travel wallet and pen.
4.0,"These are ADORABLE! I loved the options and am quite satisfied with the white unicorn pair. I've gotten loads of compliments and plenty of people telling me they're jealous- including coworkers in my professional, grown up office. The shoes arrived quickly and we're packaged perfectly- no defects. The outer material is strong and they seem really well constructed. They're a tiny bit tighter than I was hoping- I do have a wide foot and can go anywhere from a size 10-11, but with most flats a 10 is fine. This 10 feels a bit tight on the top of my foot and around my toes, but I feel like if I wear them a bit more and break them in it might not be so bad. Plus they're seriously so adorable that I'm willing to keep wearing them even until they're broken in!<br />Disclaimer : I did receive this product for a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review."
4.0,"As always, Carolyn  Pollack jewelry is outstanding!"
4.0,Once they are in they don't move or pull hair.
4.0,It is very comfortable to the point that you wish that you could wear it outdoors on the best spring days. The ONLY downside is that it stains EXTREMELY EASILY. If you wear lotion. oil or a grease in your hair you are in for stains that won't come out no matter how many times you wash it! Even detergents somehow leave stains!
4.0,"International sizing is a challenge. I have to be realistic about my measurements and use the sizing information as it was given. in this brand I am a large. In US sizing I am a medium, so aside from this I LOVE this top. The color is accurate and it looks very nice on my middle aged figure."
4.0,"A little awkward fit, but overall happy with product."
4.0,Don't know if she likes it. We're don't speak any longer.
4.0,"I wore this to a wedding! I am 5'11, 150lbs,  and wear a 36B bra. I typically wear a 4/6 in dresses. This fit great! I found that the front was pretty low cut, I wore a navy low cut Bralette under it and that was quite cute because you could see a bit of the lace. Made this dress sexy and not too exposed. I marked the dress down, because when I stepped outside in the sun, you could see through my dress (according to my fiance haha) and sure enough, you could! I had to go and locate a slip to wear underneath this. I have another wrap dress like this that had extra material already sewn in for this reason. This one did not. That is my only complaint. Regardless this dress is adorable, fairly modest, and on my tall frame hit just below my knees as pictured. This dress is nice and cool for a hot summer day and can be worn like a kimono!"
4.0,"Like the tunic, but it is too large. Need to exchange medium for a small. No return label in the package"
4.0,"I like the versatility of this outfit. I'd it's too king it's ok, you can tie the bottom. I bought this for my vacation where the color for our dinner was yellow. I wear a size 12. It doesn't smooth you out, if you know what I mean. Material is light but not thin cheap looking."
4.0,"I am currently fluctuating weight due to weight loss and was looking for a belt that could last a long time and be adjustable. So far this has been a great choice. I have only one gripe. The pull tab has fallen off a few times. I ended up using a pair of pliers to bend it out on the inside so it fits more snug and that seems to have resolved that issue. Other than that it does what its supposed to, looks great, and functions well."
4.0,"This dress is so comfortable, nice stretch, flattering in the front with the gathered material. Material feels like nice jersey material, does not feel ""cheap"".  ""Dark Blue"" color is very nice, like a deep stone blue but not too dark to look navy blue. The lower portion fits like a glove, the upper/bust portion is a big baggy and looks frumpy, I felt like it was two dresses sewn into one to fit someone's top-heavy shape perfectly, just not mine.  I'm 5'6"", 33/29/33 and a 34D."
4.0,Loved the selection and quality. Wish they didn't all have the same color palette.
4.0,I was going to give this 5 starts but just saw that there is a hole in the seam after only having this beanie since Christmas. That's a bummer because it looks really cool and definitely slouches like its designed to.
4.0,Not expensive looking  but good for the money. Of course my toddler granddaughter liked it!
4.0,"I would recommend ordering a size up, other than that, the quality of material is extremely nice and tight instead of thin and loose"
4.0,"I love these shirts! I have four different colors all with beautiful paisley prints. I just enjoy a nice Aloha shirt but I get complimented on these shirts every time I  wear them. Here in Hawaii, they are suitable for dressy dinners and business meetings. A few washes in and they hold up well. The button collar really separates these from all the rest. But if you live in Honolulu, please don't wear yours the same day as me!"
4.0,Nice soft and light feel great fit plus fast delivery. Would recommend.
4.0,"These are good,the cushion in them seem pretty good, I haven't worn them much,the color looks like the ones you see online,I like them enough to order another pair !"
4.0,"I got lots of compliments when I wore this for the first time to a birthday lunch on Saturday.  Flowy, comfy, breezy...so pretty and easy to wear.  Love it."
4.0,"nice, priced right"
4.0,"Look good , fit well and are a good price."
4.0,My Focus in Silence does exactly as advertised. I am happy with my purchase.
4.0,Nice looking time piece!
4.0,"It's a cheap watch but looks very professional and is durable for those trying to dress up without dropping a small fortune on a fancier watch, real leather on the wristband is nice"
4.0,These are super quirky and I love them. I received them as a gift off my wish list. I'm a Spoonie so I take a lot of meds and they're kinda perfect for me.
4.0,"the torso is a bit short and there's not much stretch, however, the overall fit is pretty good. The look is slightly on the cheapish end but not trashy. Meets my needs for a backup vacation suit. I generally wear a size 8 pant, 34C bra, I ordered the large and the fit is about right."
4.0,This ring was very nicely packaged and looks great. It is only slightly snug. I am concerned about the breath-ability of it. I will update after longer wear.
4.0,Way too big for a small size!
4.0,These earrings are so delicate and pretty.  Looks like a nice pair to wear for Christmas.  I'm satisfied.  :-)
4.0,Odd markings in some of the cabs
4.0,"The beret is super thin, but love the gray and black print!"
4.0,I have used this type of band on other watches/trackers and found them to be comfortable and adjustable. Would have been 5 stars but I think I got a return as the clasp was a bit scratched. Kept it anyways as I didn’t want to reorder and wait for another.
4.0,"I love this dress, I’m 5’8 and 135lbs and ordered a size small. It fits great, the length is a little short but that’s expected since I have long legs. Nice flowy dress for summer!"
4.0,i just got it today the ring is nice but the picture is a bit decieving it shows the ring really sparkly and nice but in real its not the same as the picture. but not to. bad
4.0,It’s durable and it works.
4.0,runs a  little fast but solid.
4.0,I like that the robe is thick and the length of the robe works well for my child. I wish that the color was a deeper purple but that's not a deal breaker.
4.0,This PJs are super soft and casual but still sexy.  I like the material a lot.  Great purchase!
4.0,"Came vacuum sealed so all the fluff was flatten. However after I washed and dried it - it was plush, soft and comfy. It warm enough to run around and comfy enough to wear lounging."
4.0,"Im a 32b and the smalls a bit tight, I can still wear it but a medium wouldve been perfect probably. The racerback style makes  it more comfortable and it is a nice bra with removable padding."
4.0,"A cute suit!<br /><br />Ordered the 5/6 for my 5 year old, it's a bit big, but my daughter is on the petite side. I think it will fit her better next year.<br /><br />Love the colors and the tropical print. For $10 it's a nice enough suit. It'll be a lake suit for us, so the price is right."
4.0,I love the fabric and it fits quite nicely
4.0,I was very pleased with this purchase.  I received it in time for my trip..it fit perfectly. I received several compliments on it...the only negative thing I have to say i is it needed to be ironed....I would buy it again in a different color.  Thank You
4.0,Bought this for my bf and so far it works like a carm. He was getting headaches from the string from his other cap and this one is more comfortable and does not give him headaches. It also brings his waves in better than the other wave caps he use. Great product.
4.0,This was purchased for my son and he wears it all the time.  Very comfortable and warm.
4.0,Good product but somewhat small
4.0,"Sufficient for my purpose, but nothing special."
4.0,Love them but I had to bend them back in shape. Also the box has an expired coupon in it lol I'm going to look cute in them
4.0,4 stars because just a little bulky for me.  Other wise I am really enjoying this watch with a leather band (that should last).  It was no problem getting it ready to set itself .  It gives me all the information in a moderate voice that is easy to understand.  Really love it.  Not sure how it will be to put the new battery in it but shouldn't have to worry about time change extra .  The time is very accurate and easy to read.
4.0,"They get a little messed up after a couple months of sweaty feet-&#62;wash-&#62;repeat.  That said, they made it through an entire summer before the silicon stopped working so well, which is all I really needed."
4.0,Great for Church
4.0,"I ordered this jacket after my order through Sports Basement was cancelled due to a stock error. I was surprised to find it significantly cheaper on Amazon (by >$50) but the seller seemed reputable. No issues with the jacket so far, and it seems authentic. The arm areas look a bit baggy but the jacket is warm and comfortable. Looking forward to wearing this as a lightweight, warm outdoorsy jacket once the weather is cooler."
4.0,"I'm 5'9 and the dress is a bit too short, but other than that it's super cute."
4.0,As advertised. Fits well. Appears to be quality construction. Shipping took a couple of weeks but this product is obviously not something that I needed right away.
4.0,It's a good sized unit that is built a bit better than similar models and was purchased at a fair price.<br /><br />It seems to be durable enough  to take any reasonable use and continue to function well
4.0,shes look great and true to size but the strap tend to cut if worn awhile. still a good buy
4.0,"These are relatively thin rubber (and weren't packed the best for shipping) so there are some visible ""creases"" in the rubber even after almost 2 weeks. The liners look good, though they pop out of the boot every time you take them off. Overall though the issues are really minor for a boot at this price point."
4.0,Bought for someone for a gift for the upcoming holidays.
4.0,Not quite as white as I expected and the fabric is a little thin but it's soft.
4.0,"Very pretty earrings!  Light weight and kind of fragile feeling...but they have not broke so...<br />I bought these because I got some similar for a friend and she can't keep them in the upright position.  These stay upright for me as long as I'm not very active.  If I were to just wear them to dinner they would probably be fine and stay up, but when I try to wear them to work where I'm active all day I have to fix them several times to get them to stay up.  I just don't wear these to work or for long periods of time anymore.  I am happy with them as long as I wear them accordingly."
4.0,Great price for a good dress. I attend a function every year with the same people and I like to have a new dress every time. I don't want to spend a lot and this was perfect. The material is not the best quality but for $19 It was great.
4.0,"Makes me look pregnant, but it really is so comfortable!"
4.0,Great boots! Fit perfectly. All as was advertised.
4.0,"It fit well and the high neckline is great. The colors are lovely! I thought it was green on green, but the leaves are green and dark blue. The scalloped edge is a nice detail, too."
4.0,Love them. A little big but ok
4.0,Material is kind of cheap but gets the job done. Wouldn't expect more than 2 heavy uses out of this
4.0,I found that when I removed these goggles my glasses came of with them so they may not work well depending on the size of your glasses.  Otherwise  these googles were comfortable and were well enough vented not to fog up for the most part while also apparently giving good eye protection.  I work as an RN in a non Covid unit so we are required to wear googles when we are in patient rooms.  For the most part I left the goggles on for the majority of my shift for several days and they were reasonably comfortable.  Okay to fine depending on the size of your glasses.
4.0,"I love these bras, they're exactly what I expected. They are not seem less though! I can see the outline of the bra under any shirt. The nipple covers are nice but you can also kinda tell that I have something covering them under my shirt. I'm sure nobody is really looking but I can tell because thats the first thing I looked for. I do like them and will continue to wear them. Very sticky, keep the plastic that covers the sticky side for reuse! Supportive if you postistion it correctly for your body."
4.0,"Very cute dress ,love it .<br />The one thing I did not like is the cut auround the hips ."
4.0,They look a little different that wha I was hoping for but they do the job
4.0,this is prettier in pictures than it looks in real life but nice nonetheless
4.0,"I really really love the style of this sweatshirt, but it is made too small! I normally wear a medium, and I ordered a large. It fits me great, everywhere except the sleeves. They are just way too short! If it weren't for that I would absolutely give this a 5 star. It is extremely comfortable and soft."
4.0,I bought a size Small. My son usually wears a 6-7 and the fitting was good. The print was really nice but the quality of the tshirt was on the thinner side (see through). The blue was a different blue than the picture but that wasn’t a big deal for us.
4.0,"I wear these out, not tucked in.  Wash in cold water to help with fading. Pen holder on the left pocket only."
4.0,Lakshmi pooja return gifts
4.0,Color was a little darker than picture.
4.0,"The blanket hoodie is SO soft! I was a little nervous bc I'm plus-size and I wasn't sure if it'd be snug on me but it was so loose and felt over all, comfortable to wear. It's pretty thick so definitely good for cold days/nights. The pocket is also huge and convenient.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is I didn't like the wrist part of the sleeve. They're a little scratchy and slightly uncomfortable. But it's something I can get over for sure.<br /><br />Definitely recommend for any blanket lovers out there!!"
4.0,My daughter loves these. Stylish and a slip on. Exactly what she wanted.
4.0,"I love the pendant, not so much the chain.  Too delicate for the weight of the pendant.  Too small for my neck.  I had requested return, but decided I liked the pendant."
4.0,"It fits larger than it looks.  I'm normally a Medium size 8, so I ordered what was recommended.  However, it fits really large and baggy.  I'm still keeping it because I'm using it more as a &#34;mumu&#34; around the house.  With a belt to bring in the waist, it's actually cute! Very soft fabric."
4.0,Wore this dress to a wedding and it was a hit! The fit was comfortable except for the straps. They didn't sit on the shoulders like the image. I had to put them on my shoulders but  it kept dropping down so i had to constantly adjust them all night long.  But i still loved the dress and received tons of compliments on it. And the color wasnt quite black. It was more of a deep purple or blue tone to it. But not really noticeable to anyone who wasn't really paying attention
4.0,I absolutely LOVED this bra. It was so comfy and soft. The only bad thing is one of the latches popped off so I cant really wear it anymore 💔
4.0,"This skirt looks as it does in the picture. Purchase based on the sizing chart that is available in the pictures! I made the mistake and did not do that— I wanted a more fitted look and thought I could fit in a small. I was wrong. My waist is 30” precisely, hips 39”, and my height is 5 ft 3”. The small was far too tight on around my hips and had I taken a seat, it likely would have torn. Based on my measurements, a medium would have worked. Unfortunately, I will be returning because a medium size won’t arrive in time for when I need it. Also, this material is not stretchy so keep that in mind when ordering. It does have an elastic waist band though! Still too tight for my waist."
4.0,"Great price/value and great quality.  Just took a long time to arrive (from China, I suppose)."
4.0,I bought this for my husband and serves it's purpose for a good price. Hasn't been washed yet but so far so good!
4.0,"Super cute, fits perfectly, and very flattering. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the material. It is shiny. I wish it was more of a cotton blend/matte look."
4.0,Nice quality knit shirt that is exactly as shown in advertisement with vivid colors. It is truly a crop top so keep that in mind if you have a long upper torso. Washes well maintaining good color saturation. Fit is normal and as expected for a knit shirt running true to size.
4.0,I didn't expect much for this outfit but its actually very cute. The fabric is thin but not see though and it is a mini skirt just the picture. The shirt comes with shoulder pads inside that are useless so I cut them off. The elastic waist is not too bad. I like that I can wear it separately or together.
4.0,"These boots are nice, they look just like the picture. I was worried they would be funny shaped but they are not as weird as the product picture. I love them, great with leggings."
4.0,"Prefect size, beautiful design, great quality!"
4.0,"This dress is shapeless and doesn’t look as good on me as it does on the model, probably because of her pose and the fact that she’s a tiny stick person. If you’re not a tiny stick person, you will look like a cute little brown potato the way I do LOL. I don’t care. It’s comfortable, it has nice pockets, and the fabric is great. See pics!"
4.0,The length of the dress is great. I’m 5’3” usually a Medium. I went up a size in this after reading reviews and definitely glad I did. This is not a swing dress. It has a hi-low hem but then there is a seam at the waist. I wish I would have zoomed in on the pictures to see this. I’m keeping it because I tie dyed it and it will be cute as a tunic top.
4.0,Definitely should have ordered up a size. I'm a normal c but there's didn't cover my entire breast. They work great just not quite the right fit. I would buy again but bigger.
4.0,Looks good. Didn't realize it was really small but overall it was okay.
4.0,Love the collar - it's really cute and well made. The bell is a bit large for me so may try to replace it with a smaller one.
4.0,Very comfortable fits great. Good deal for the price. I my opinion it is not leather. A nice synthetic material but not leather. Would I buy again knowing its not leather .... Yes! It is a good product.
4.0,"To say the least it arrived on time, earlier than expected. Im very please should have gotten a size bigger but its ok. Will order again soon."
4.0,"The quality was great.  I was looking for something a bit more supportive than a sports bra and I think I overshot with this one.  It is Padded.  A little showy for me, but well made and well fitting."
4.0,They were ok but a bit big!!
4.0,Adequate but definitely not leather or quality.
4.0,"Whew - I've GOT to start looking at the descriptions.  I thought I was buying a t-shirt and this is a silky material.  That said, it looks cute and fits me.  I'm 5'2&#34;, 170lbs, top heavy and apple shaped.  It is a nice length to wear as a tunic with leggings."
4.0,I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and my finger joints hurt once in awhile.  I purchased these to provide support and help with the pain.  They work but I wish they had a little bit less flexibility.
4.0,Decent bunch of earrings. Nice variety. A few pair of the studs were already tarnished but what do you expect for the price paid.
4.0,"Im not sure how practical these are and im not sure if they actually give any UV protection like they say they do, BUT wow do I look good in these haha I don't need glasses but these make me look amazing which personally I can't get enough of. Tons of compliments and they are fun to wear around. They may give one sun protection I just can not tell. So with that being said I have had tons of people ask me where I got them and If they do protect against UV rays than these are FORSURE worth checking out!"
4.0,"The bottoms fit perfectly, but the top was way too big. Its cute and good quality material. Just disappointed in the top. Could be fixed with a few adjustments. Its meant for ladies with a bigger bust. Im only a 36 b. The xl bottoms fit but an xl top was too much. Wish the sizing for each item was separate."
4.0,"I find the liner is always visible, and is very eye-catching since it's white. The outer shorts need about 2 more inches. Then I'd buy more. As of now, I'll wear them but won't order more."
4.0,"I love this pin so much. It's huge, sturdy, and amazing. Only complaint I have is that the glow in the dark feature is lackluster. Only Dracula's shirt glows. Nothing else, I guess I was hoping for a bit more. 4/5 stars."
4.0,"I like the skirt, length and material of this dress. The only thing I don't like is the tank top is too low under my armpits. It shows my bra a little bit, so I always wear a shrug or jean jacket with it."
4.0,The pendant was beautiful. It also has a heavier weight to it that makes it feel expensive. I do wish the chain size was longer.
4.0,Like the cord and ring well made and the glasses does not slip off.
4.0,I like it for the price.  It is more of a drape than a shirt so to speak.  Open on the sides.  I think it will be great for a cover up by the pool.
4.0,Good.nice
4.0,"This is a nice coat. I have had other Lands End coats in the past and the quality and sizing are consistent. I wear a size 8-10 on top, and the medium fits well.  The coat has a relaxed fit, which is great for layering. It's great for winter sports when paired with appropriate thermal and fleece layers. I find the pockets are a little far back for easy access, but it's not a big issue. The hood on mine isn't adjustable as described, but that's also not an issue for me. Lands End could improve the design by adding an internal pull at the waistline for snug fit and waist shape. Either way, I'd buy this again. It works well for Colorado winters."
4.0,Ran 7 miles with the new band and it absolutely stayed exactly where I wanted it-no slipping or jiggling!<br />You just need to remember it is magnetic...I may or may not have stuck myself to a shopping cart!
4.0,Straps can't hold much weight.  Broke 1st time I traveled with laptop
4.0,"My 2 year old absolutely loves these shoes! They are good quality, especially for the price. They are a bit smaller than expected since she's a size 7 in normal shoes and these are a little snug."
4.0,"It's nice, what I expected for the money."
4.0,"This necklace is nice and seems like it will not break easily. I like having the option of a 15 in chain but is does sometimes feel a little tight around my neck. Overall, I think this is a nice product and am considering order a 16 in chain from this seller. Would recommend."
4.0,The stress fit well. Seemed a little bit shorter than expected and I wasn’t able to tell which side was the front from the back. I wore for Halloween so perfect for a one time wear.
4.0,I haven't wore it yet but its goid quality and fits ok. I think i could have gone a size up though.
4.0,It's a gift for my wife. She really likes it. Fit her just fine....
4.0,Arrived as expected. Fit as expected.
4.0,Maybe a little big. Used as gifts.
4.0,"Great look, guessed too small for my wife will need to return and replace.  A quality issue was a seam which was missed in sewing the bodice in the back."
4.0,Feels good to wear so no complaints.
4.0,"I like the fabric, perfect for summer. I don't use it to go out just to be home, it's very comfortable.<br />it has adjustable straps and at least the black one is do not see through."
4.0,I would get a size up I’m a small and the medium was even a little snug. Also the material isn’t cotton it’s more of a workout material. Other than that it’s cute and seems to be made well.
4.0,Just a hair too big
4.0,"Beautiful glasses! Very pretty and stylish, a little disappointed that one of the jewels is missing on the side ornamentation but not worth the time and effort to mail back."
4.0,"Right, so they're not bad for their price so 4/5 but they came in a bit bent and the glass was scratched. It's not hard to bend them back so it's an easy enough fix. The glass part is probably going to trip some up, the scratches are fairly small but they don't affect your ability to see... but I mean, scratches are scratches. I might try to fill it if it really bothers me later. Until then, they're the perfect things I needed for cosplay."
4.0,A tad too big. I ordered large and fit loosely.
4.0,"I like the dress.  Unfortunately, the size M was too large on the skirt.  However, the top fit perfectly.  Size small would be too small on top.  Had to return the dress.  I have broad shoulders so my top is always larger than my bottom."
4.0,They fit over my glasses. They are polarized.
4.0,"These are very nice.  A little extra length, which I prefer.  The material is shiny (not my favorite) so they are a bit more loud than the photo. But they are very comfortable."
4.0,I purchased size medium. I’m 5’5” and around 145 lbs. These hit past my ankle bone (when wearing high waisted) and are slightly to big. Should have returned for small. They are very shear but very comfortable.
4.0,"Bought this for our 6 year old, who is just starting ballet.  The leotard with skirt hits well, and appears to be well made.  She's worn it to 4 classes plus a few &#34;dance-offs&#34; with her little sister, and it's still in one piece.  I really like the fact that the skirt is attached.  It's one less think I have to look for every week.  Plus, it's thick enough that you cannot see through the material."
4.0,This chinstrap has worked the best of those I've tried so far. I like the cut out for the ears.
4.0,Kinda small. 2x is like a large. Still a good Jersey.
4.0,I love the fit and look of these glasses.  I just wish they would hold up better.  The screws tend to come out easily and rather quickly after use.  This is my third pair.  I'm hoping third times a charm.
4.0,I purchased a medium. I’m 5’2” and 145 lbs.
4.0,I really like the shirt. It worked well for what I purchased for but it runs a little big. I had to do some creative adjustments to make it a little tighter across the waist
4.0,Like them but have a tendency to come loose
4.0,Okay so it came almost a week early and it fits so damn good I love it!! The only down fall is the leg strap is pretty tight so I'm gonna have to tamper with it a little! I'm 5'2 118 lbs I ordered a small. I saw this costume on yandy.com for $80 so glad I found it on here ..also the skull part isn't as bright white as I though but still sexy as hell! Waiting for my tights to come in the mail (: overall very excited with my purchase. Excuse my Mitch match sockies lol
4.0,"Short waisted, makes your boobs look bigger. Beautiful dress"
4.0,"This is the second of this exact hat I have owned (the first sadly perished at the teeth of a puppy), and I really enjoy the color and style. It is a cooler weather hat, as it doesn't breathe remarkably well. The only problem I have is that they sent me an XL instead of a large, so it is bigger on my head. Otherwise 5 stars, a great hat for a great price!"
4.0,The bag was smaller then I expected I needed something small but it was way smaller the bag is cute though
4.0,"This is a really beautiful, delicate necklace. Looks great by itself, but I think it would look good with a couple of charms. Hasn't knotted or become tangled. The box shape of the links sort of gives it a 'twirl' effect when worn."
4.0,"I received this dress on time, just as was ordered.  I am a US size 24 at the moment.  The dress I ordered was a size 3x because they were out of 4x.  It fits me perfectly, however, I would order a size or two larger if you like the dress less clingy.  I would order a 5x in this type of dress in the future.  The only problem with it is that the arms are a little tight.  I do not know why plus size clothing manufacturers make the rest of the dress larger yet keep the tight arms.  If one is larger in the waist and hips, one is usually larger in the arms!  I haven't washed it or worn it yet, but would think from the material, I will hang it to dry."
4.0,Fits snugly. Order the next size up.
4.0,Super cute. Right sizes. Lots to choose from
4.0,"Cute, but not quite as pictured"
4.0,"This sports bra has pads in it that can be taken out.  The pads feel hard!<br />The straps do not adjust and this fits me good.<br />The elastic around the bottom was not tight, and did not curl up.<br />Not as comfortable as I expected, but I will wear this.<br /><br />I got a Large.<br />I’m 5’2, 130 lbs, 34, or 36, B or C"
4.0,They were smaller than expected and if there were measurements in the description then I totally overlooked them. All 3 flip flops are the same size which is unusual as I would expect the 'charm' to be slightly bigger but overall I am satisfied with my order. Fast shipment. It's a really cute set.
4.0,I wear Xl and ordered a 1x because I love my tank tops to be really flowy and it fit like and xl. Really cute otherwise and I can still wear it.
4.0,Really cute and useful! Pain in the butt to put on but still cute and useful.
4.0,"This is a really cool, very stylish, and well-made belt with a lot of options for wearing. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with the dress I was hoping to wear it with, so I may be returning it or passing it on to a friend..."
4.0,"Love it. The stones are way too obviously fake.<br />Wich was one reasons i got it. It advertised high grade stones. Ive seen Cz stones rainbow like crazy while this kinda stays dull. Bot the best in stone shine. Otjer then that, this piece is VERY NICE has some NICE WEIGHT also 925 STAMPED n came with a nice mirror polish thats jaw dropping all together i give 4 out of 5 stars. Them stones coulda been a bit shinyer. But overall  A MEGA GOOD PURCHASE"
4.0,"Very nice watch, love the look of it and the simplicity. Exactly what I wanted, except that it is a fair bit larger than I expected from the photo and description. Even so, it is super comfortable. I just wish there would be some way to be clear about the physical size of these watches when ordering sight unseen online."
4.0,Soft material however runs quite small in width I ordered one size up and length is perfect covers my behind but width is still a bit snug and I am not a heavy person a little roll from age & 3 children but I can usually fit into a M-L top depending on style I like my tops a bit loose
4.0,"The material is soft, breathable, and lightweight. It is rather large for a woman’s face. The filter pocket is separate and seems to stick to the face. The nose piece is not very rigid causing the mask to slide up the face easily.  I like the adjustable ear pieces. Overall, it seems to be a quality mask. However, I have other masks that are better fitting."
4.0,I like the fabric and overall quality of the dress.  My biggest complaint is that it was very high-waisted on me.  I'm only 5'5 and don't have a long torso.  It just lays in a weird place on me.  I purchased a size medium and it fits everywhere else so I don't think going up a size would be good.  I have a wide belt that hides the waist of the dress so I'll keep it.  Just wish I didn't have to wear a belt to make it look right.
4.0,will wear this tee often
4.0,"Cute dress shoes, they are no tie shoes, which is a plus for me. They do seem to run a bit big and they don’t seem to be made just for skinny feet as my little one does have a wider foot and they seem to fit comfortably. They don’t really form to the foot or ankle though and they fit really loose around that area, not sure if it’s because of the packing material inside the shoe that may have pushed out the sides too far. But they do look good on and the price is pretty reasonable."
4.0,I like the pajamas but mine slipped through quality control with one of the pockets sewed almost closed so I had to take some stitches out to be able to put my hand in the pocket.
4.0,"The material was heavier than I expected. Not cheap and flimsy. Nice fit and slimming, too."
4.0,"Nice triple color pin. I thought it looked a little bigger than it actually is, but nice all the same."
4.0,"Use this at a special event, The kimono fit well and was comfortable to wear."
4.0,From other reviews I knew to expect it would be thin. So I got them with that intention. Overall the length was fine and it seems like the stitching is good!
4.0,Ok  product. The quality is ok for the price.
4.0,Cute! I am a bigger girl but am lucky to have a smaller waist (34in). I wear an XL and was able to hook it around my center.
4.0,Bottom elastic is a little tight but over all I love this sports bra and it’s a great price!! Very happy
4.0,This is a great belt so far my only complaint is that it's a little long for me.  I'm a size 6 and it goes to my side close to my back.
4.0,Great looking ties but quality is suspect.
4.0,I really like this fabric. It is nice and light but comfortable. I do feel like these run a little small but not so much so that they are uncomfortable. It is just a more fitted cut than I expected. Cute patterns!
4.0,Nice jewelry but it can get a little bit twisted
4.0,Looks good and is comfortable.  Only complaint is that the watch back is made for small wrists.  I am no a big guy and there are only 2 holes left on the watch band.  Hardly enough band left to secure under the hoops.
4.0,"Love the hat but the fitted or ""stretch"" runs a bit small. Only reason for 4 stars. Very high quality and quick delivery as a prime member."
4.0,Should use with disposable mask with the nose ridge metal for better fit
4.0,"The length of this sweater makes it great to wear with leggings or skinny jeans. It comes just below the butt. Another great feature is that it's ribbed - I personally love that look. The material is just a little scratchy so I'll probably wear a camisole (light tank top) underneath it. That aside, it looks great and makes a nice addition to my winter wardrobe."
4.0,"These are much bigger than what is said in the description so they slide down my nose after a few minutes. In comparison with other cheaper sunglasses purchase here on Amazon, these are much more flimsy.<br /><br />Update(2-26-17): These have held up better than expected. They dont slide down my nose anymore, and have started to peel under the bridge a bit. Overall they are nice for what they are, but I wish the tint was a bit darker."
4.0,Definitely look at the size in the image.  Way smaller than I realized.  Nice though.
4.0,A little thin. Feels cheap
4.0,Purse is good. Card holders is kinda hard to place cards in.
4.0,Cute and fit well for my 1980's themed birthday party!! :O)
4.0,Very lovely! Reasonably priced
4.0,sleeves are just a little short.  no other complaints.
4.0,Fairly plain and straight forward and durable to boot.  This is a leotard that seems to last and fits fairly well.  I did follow the other reviewers and bought up one size and that worked out for us.
4.0,"Lanyard works and looks great, the only problem is that the fastener for the loop is made of velcro, so after about 2-3 months the velcro wears out and the loop doesn't close."
4.0,It's very nice I'm satisfied but the wallet quality could have been better
4.0,Fun Beads
4.0,"I like this bra, I sized as a medium but it was very tight. I bought the large and it’s much more comfortable. I don’t recommend the white because you can see it under light colored shirts. I took the pads out and that helped a little. I normally wear a 36 A/B"
4.0,This is a very nice boot..
4.0,This necklace looks like a queen should wear it....thats me. Yes honey
4.0,"Although it's a tough blouse to iron, my daughter looked beautiful wearing it in her concert! It fits her well and was worth the money!"
4.0,"Extremely soft,  fits very true to size (purchased a medium) packaged well. My ONLY small complaint is that when I took the item out of the package, it had a very odd smell, more plastic or burnt plastic type smell. Easily fixed with airing it out or washing it. Great purchase!"
4.0,"This material is very soft. I'm a large. They fit me great. My only dislike is that the top rolls over from time to time.  I don't like to keep adjusting my clothes.<br />If you don't have a bit of a tummy, these after perfect."
4.0,"Nice handbag, is exactly as it showns, thanks"
4.0,"Been through a lot different gloves. These gloves are best I have had. great on walks with the dog, clearing the drive will buy again."
4.0,very nice looking and looks like the pictures
4.0,Difficult to get packing wrinkles. out
4.0,Gave my 14 year old. Enough said.
4.0,this product was very good until it broke when I threw a ball to a friend. It slipped right off my hand and exploded.
4.0,"I love this however it is small. Im 5'4&#34; 137 pounds, and I ordered a size up which is a med and I should have ordered two sizes up and got a large. Its not as long as in the picture. The back is short."
4.0,Size was alittle small
4.0,LOVELY BUT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY NEEDS.
4.0,"You know how you can never tell how some things will fit when you order them on-line? You order up when you think they will be cut short or run small. For some reason, this is what I thought would be the case for this cardigan. I ordered up thinking that it would run small. I was wrong. It runs true to size. It was way too big in the shoulders and arms. However, if I could have worn it, it would have been lovely. I liked the striped (rust/burnt orange, tan, brown and black) pattern. The fabric was thin, so perfect for layering. It would be super cute with a t-shirt or mock-neck. It stopped a little above my knees (mid-thigh), but I’m short only 5’4. And finally, there are pockets, and everyone loves a good pocket. In conclusion, this is a great little cardigan with a lot of potential. Just order the right size."
4.0,Not bad at all for price. Light weight.<br />Fits good.
4.0,Fabric somewhat thinner than expected. Image not too clear.  But overall great buy
4.0,"Good quality for what I paid! I bought the medium size and I kind of wish I'd bought the small, but they still look cute regardless! Would definitely buy from this company again."
4.0,"I was hesitant to purchase these because I didn't know how they would look with the swim tops or if could be worn with a tank top out on the beach. I'm glad I ended up purchasing these. They are comfortable, flattering on the tummy and work well with most of my tank tops/swim tops that I'll be wear on vacation. They were a little thicker than I had expected which I think helps make them fit a little better."
4.0,Its a tad on the large side but ut is so gorgeous. I always get compliments
4.0,Very nice bag for the price. It feels like leather and looks sharp.
4.0,"I LOVE this dress, but it does want to show more of my cleavage than I'm comfortable with at work.  Pairs great with a cardigan that covers the girls.....unless you want to show the girls....In that case, you will love this dress even more."
4.0,It's beautiful gift for my lady friend......classy gift!
4.0,Definitely a summer hoodie. It's thin. Works well
4.0,Not as thick as I was hoping but all and all a good deal for the money
4.0,"This is quite a flattering dress. I have a larger bust, so because that part of me requires more fabric, it wound up being a little too short. (And this is supposed to be a short dress.) I ordered my normal size, but I am sure the next size up would have been a perfect fit. The red color is very pretty--definitely more scarlet than fire-engine red in person."
4.0,"Super cute.  Even when stretched over my large chest, the fabric image wasn't distorted.  I wish it fit just a tad longer on me though, so I could actually where it as a dress.  Print is only one sided.  The opposite side is white.  Think light weight bathing suit material.<br /><br />One thing that happened my first time wearing it was I had a course glittery lanyard around my neck/laying on my chest (holding a camera).  I didn't notice until much later, but the material beneath the lanyard got ripped up from the course glitter, I guess. It was a bummer, because for being a one size fit all (I'm a solid 10-12 across the board), it hugged my body just right, and felt really comfortable, and sexy on.  I'm going to try and lent shave it...and hopefully that will do the trick."
4.0,The material is not leather but the belt looks lovely despite. Love the look it gives
4.0,"Loved the print and fabric, however the size runs about 1 size too small of your average. If you wear a 2-3X (18-20) I highly recommend sizing up to a 4x if they have it available."
4.0,I was Satisfied with my purchase
4.0,"I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />This order came within the time span stated at checkout.  The color is very deep indigo, very pretty and thin which is nice since I plan on wearing this in the heat and humidity of summer.  The lace is very delicate and I hope it can withstand normal wear and tear, but it is also very pretty and feminine so gives this shirt a sense of style.  The fit is a bit small so order a size up, but it lays nicely along the body. I never order by size but by measurement, and even with ordering by the numbers, the fit is still a bit small. The length is not as portrayed in the picture, it sits more directly at waist level than at hip level.  The stitching along the seams appears to be sturdy enough to handle a wash in the machine, but I will hand wash to be on the safe side due to the delicacy of the lace.<br />Overall a very nice blouse that I plan on wearing quite often since it can be paired with just about anything."
4.0,"The dress that I ordered looked to be red with white flower print, however it is more of a dark tangerine color.<br />Still pretty, but not the red I was expecting."
4.0,"The backs that are given with the pin aren't very sturdy and I've lost a couple of them, but these pins are so incredibly cute and I love how the colors look in person."
4.0,"These fit perfectly, and are a great plaid.  My only complaint (which is true about many Hue leggings) is that they are a bit butt-flattening.  Hue, come on!  I am 5'10&#34; 135lbs (long and lean), and beyond the disappointment about the butt, these fit well."
4.0,I sent this case back. I ordered the wrong size
4.0,"The dress is really comfy and was all I wanted. It was a bit roomy in the bust area, I am 5ft 1 and about 125lbs. Most of my weight is on my thighs and butt hopefully it will shrink after a few washes."
4.0,Outfit is adorable but unfortunately the top is a little tight
4.0,It came on time...the quality the fit is perfect!! No flaws he wears size 12 but the only had 11.5 so I bought anyway an it fit...have potential to stretch
4.0,Good well-made socks. Seem to run a little small.
4.0,"Nice quality so far, have not used it yet but feels thick and nice"
4.0,"Beautiful dress and beautiful material. The only problem is the attached slip, which due to the front slit, isn't long enough. I'll have to, unfortunately, return it."
4.0,The shoe is absolutely adorable! Unfortunately the sizing is way off! I ordered a 5 toddler and it says inside the shoe size 22. When I looked up the conversation chart the shoe is a actually a size 6.5-7 in US?! So I’m very disappointed!
4.0,"Very pretty earrings, got them for a friend who loves dolphins. They are smaller than expected though."
4.0,They are nice quality and wear well.
4.0,"Was looking for a new and versatile shirt to wear to a Dead and Company show this summer and this will work. You can wear as advertised or opened up with a tee shirt underneath. It does seem somewhat delicate but I don't intend to wear it on a regular basis, just on special occasions."
4.0,it was just what I expected wish there was a way to put in a zipper
4.0,"It's warm, though I don't think the inner layer is fleece.  But it makes you look like a conehead.  A warm conehead."
4.0,"It's a much lighter blue than the picture, very comfortable and very light weight. Only issue I have is I I am a 34C and the small it tight on top and the straps are placed in an odd spot and so they keep falling off."
4.0,"I wear a size large and I brought a size large and this dress fits me perfect.  I'm in between a 12 -14 but I'm short at 5'1 so this dress fits me perfectly not too short but not long either. Great to wear with some cowboy or Ugg boots with or without leggings.  This runs true to size, I also ordered the olive green and it looks just like the picture its a true olive green color."
4.0,"I use this rubber strap on my Omega Seamaster to preserve the original. The quick release feature is secure and super easy to use. I can swap this one with the blue one I bought in about 10 seconds. It's not an expensive strap, so I didn't expect it to be perfect, but it's great for the price. I highly recommend it."
4.0,Im 5'1 165lbs ordered a M. It fits perfect! Had a smudge on it like it was rubbed against something dusty but will wash it. It fits perfectly
4.0,"this is a nice purse. the color in the picture is more of a grape purple. I was a little disappointed in the color, as the actual color is more of a plum than the rich purple in the pic. other than that its nice and bigger than I thought"
4.0,Material is OK but it was too big
4.0,Can't beat them for the money.
4.0,"Almost perfect except they run way too big even for all the men in my family, had to stitch some to make it work."
4.0,"This is a comparison review between *DooWay 28"" Leather Gloves* and the<br />*KIMOBAA 26"" Long Leather Gloves*. I was looking for real leather ultra-long gloves and these two were pretty much the only options, and each has some pros and cons... I shall outline them below.<br /><br />**Measurements & Fit:**<br />- DooWay gloves are about an inch longer overall (see last photo; left is DooWay, right is KIMOBAA), not a big difference.<br />- Width/fit are roughly similar, both are pretty slim fit. However, DooWay gloves have no lining, which makes them harder to put on and likely less durable as well. KIMOBAA gloves have lining.<br />- I thought both gloves are equally comfortable; however, due to lack of lining, the seams on the DooWay gloves will leave an imprint on your skin after wear. KIMOBAA gloves don't have this issue.<br />- DooWay gloves have longer fingers, which for me is a plus. KIMOBAA gloves have shorter fingers and that was a problem for me... but depending on your hand shape, that may be a plus.<br /><br />**Stitching Quality:**<br />- DooWay gloves do not have blind stitching around the fingers, which make them less refined... could actually be a better fit if you are going for a more masculine look, but overall KIMOBAA's gloves are more well-made (see first two photos, left is DooWay, right is KIMOBAA)<br /><br />**Leather Quality:**<br />- Both pairs of gloves are soft, and the grain on both is pleasant - DooWay's gloves have a rougher grain, while KIMOBAA's look finer... both look nice though.<br />- Unfortunately, I note some durability issues with DooWay's leather; there are small tears in the leather between all the fingers, and on the left glove there was a sizable tear at the base of the thumb (all pre-existing prior to my wearing them, may be this was a returned item? Regardless, doesn't bode well for durability)<br />- I observed no imperfections in the leather on the KIMOBAA gloves, both before and after trying them on. That along with the lining likely bodes well for durability.<br /><br />**TouchScreen Compatibility:**<br />- The DooWay gloves are touchscreen compatible (I tested them), while the KIMOBAA ones are not."
4.0,"Cute hat!  It was a little too big for my head, however, so I had to return it."
4.0,These sunglasses are perfect!  I love mine and highly recommend this item to others.
4.0,looks cute well made
4.0,"This is a very simple pair of oversized sunglasses. They are nicely shaped, comfortable to wear, UV resistant, and priced nicely. I'm not usually a fan of big sunglasses, but after a recent trip to the dermatologist, he confirmed that I have a lot of sun damage and I need to try to cover up a little more, so this is my attempt to do that. And they do help.<br /><br />I really like that these not only look good, but they protect my eyes from harmful UV rays, and since they are larger than normal, they also help keep my skin covered as well, so really, theres lots of good things to say about these. The black plastic is shiny and looks good, and the tint of the lenses is actually perfect to give you a good amount of sun protection without being too dark. They work well for those days that you've had a bit too much to drink the night before too. Haha.<br /><br />Overall, they are a very simple pair of sunglasses. Nothing fancy, and nothing too exciting, but I do really like them and am glad that I got them. I would definitely recommend them.<br /><br />**I did receive this pair of sunglasses at a full promotional discount for the purposes of testing and reviewing, but my cost has absolutely no bearing on how I rate a product. I will never give a positive review to an item that does not fully deserve it.**"
4.0,A little thinner material than I expected. But cute set! Good for early fall.
4.0,Nice weight and design
4.0,"I like these masks, they are lightweight and comfortable.  I just wish my glasses wouldn’t fog up."
4.0,It's a pretty good little wallet for what I need it for. It holds a lot!
4.0,"Wanted to give this 5 stars but the tushie coverage needs to be improved. The swimsuit is beautiful. I am not a small person and was happy to have a stylish bathing suit for a middle age woman that is pretty without looking like I'm trying to be 20 again. The suit ran true to size and is well constructed. My top is covered sufficiently, nothing muffin top sticking out and no &quot;side boob&quot;. Went to the beach with it on and felt comfortable. Apparently the style now is to have one's derri&egrave;re sticking out the bottom. I do not need my tush on display and my only con for the suit is to have more fabric in the bottom. I try to dress fashionably and modestly, this suit gets 4 stars out of 5 for a nearly perfect suit. This is the first &quot;new&quot; bathing suit I have bought in a long time and was happy to have had success with. Good quality, well constructed.<br />I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for leaving an honest and unbiased review. The thoughts and feelings expressed above are my own from my own experience. I rely heavily on Amazon reviews for my own online shopping and know how important detailed honest reviews are for Amazon customers. I hope my opinion helps you decide if this item is worthy of your purchase too"
4.0,"Even though the material isn’t the best and is very thin,  not quite see through, it’s a great little dress. I bought specifically for humid summers and this will be perfect. It fits well. I am 5’3 126lbs and 32DDD. I ordered a small and it fits just the way I wanted. I will probably hand wash to avoid shrinking. Over all for the price I’m happy and will probably order some other patterns as well"
4.0,"Gorgeous boots, although one fits a little tight they should be fine after a while."
4.0,"I love it, their soft but summer friendly,  it's hot but I keep my home cold so i can wear them lol.."
4.0,Fits a little  baggy
4.0,This is a really nice necklace I bought this for my mom and she loves it!
4.0,"Good product, have good design and size is correct. Recommended for price"
4.0,"It is a very nice piece, though mine arrived with the chain broken.  My hubby fixed it easily though.  It is nice but it is a lot bigger than it looks but I still wear it and I like it."
4.0,"Nice fabric, well made. Will be purchasing more."
4.0,"First, for those who are concerned whether it's genuine or not. We bought it from a seller Shopbop, who is an Amazon company.. And the product we received was very genuine looking.<br /><br />My wife returned it because the iphone 12 she carries sits level with the top of the purse.. Wasnt too comfortable with that.<br /><br />We later bought another bag from the TB website and the packaging was the same as with this one.. So most probably genuine.<br /><br />The leather quality is very nice and so is the hardware.<br /><br />Only problem is a little bit too small for today's gigantic phones."
4.0,"Great material that isn't to cumbersome and great price.  I am used to the lose feel of clothes so this probably fits true to size, I just feel like it's a tad snug."
4.0,"I am brand new at this riding-a-bike-thing again, since I've been driving everywhere for over 12 years now, lol, but honestly, these padded shorts did help a good deal with all the lovely bumps and different road terrain that exists.  I'm glad I purchased these, but honestly, they take some time getting used to. You should know I've only worn them once so far, but they helped, trust me."
4.0,"These masks fit really nice and wash up really well, but they are THICK! I found it hard to eat then for prolonged period because it was hard to breath. I ended up having to cut out one of the layers, which made them perfect!"
4.0,Perfect for favor boxes!
4.0,They arrived on time and as advertised.  Thank you.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, the only reason I’m not giving a five star is because the dress is longer as shown in the picture. Other than that I really like it!"
4.0,"The bag is roomy, well made and great quality. It is however a bit off color. Otherwise I'm entirely happy with it."
4.0,A bit shorter than it looks in the pic but it is really a nice fit and nice and light and elegant.
4.0,It was cute for the price & went perfect with my Bday outfit!
4.0,"It's lightweight, very comfortable and fits well.  No complaints.  Would buy again."
4.0,"This is a nice, comfortable sweatshirt, however, the drawstrings look tacky.  They are way too long, and are frayed on the ends, which detracts from the look of the sweatshirt.  I'm not expecting these drawstrings to last beyond 10 washes.  I may be wrong!  I will give an update after washing this number of times..."
4.0,"Cute and awesome; however, I've had to use black nail polish to touch up the paint from time to time, as it seems prone to flaking and chipping."
4.0,I was torn between sizes but listened to what was recommended and I’m glad I did. Accurate !
4.0,Would  have scored perfect five if the bra part of it had underwire.  Bottom line is if you’re wearing larger sizes the girls need to be uptown!<br /><br /> Otherwise a great south.
4.0,"A little thing on fabric, had bold detail. Also the sizing chart was helpful thanks"
4.0,"Nice looking horse charm. Both sides look the same so you get a solid horse charm. It's really cute and a nice size, not too big."
4.0,Very difficult to install. I thought I was going to break my watch.
4.0,"This corset is built with a lot of sturdiness. It will do its job. Fits pretty comfortable except around the under breast line, feels like it pushes your breast up too much, the sizes run small. If you're pushing anything above 35 inches around the waist you better get the 3X. I had to repurchase my right size."
4.0,"I got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she still talks about how much she loves it, four months later. The print is clear and so cute but the material is a little thin. You can tell by touching it that it will likely rip"
4.0,"Wanted to like this, but wasn't a good style for me as a pear shape, so I returned it."
4.0,Nice for shopping trips or family gatherings
4.0,Nice product.  Quality is middle of the road.  True to size.  I ordered the blue.  Purchased it for a cruise.
4.0,I wish the dress came with tool under to make it look puffy like the picture... had to buy a separate petticoat to go underneath! The fabric is soft an stretchy which is nice for fit but the lace seems rather cheap
4.0,Super cute but the rear area wore out super fast and faded after like two washes
4.0,"El vestido es lindo y confortable, la tela divin, pero no se ve igual a la imagen en la parte del cuello, el que me llegó tiene un interior en la tel blanco y no se ve bonito….!!"
4.0,"This bag is a lesser quality leather,  but it's the perfect size and a hands and shoulder - free crossbody.  I have always been a large, heavy handbag person until back problems forced me to re-think that. So this is the perfect solution to that problem. The three pockets allow me to carry everything I need, including a large wallet, makeup, cell, keys, tissue pack, mirror compact. You get it. I do recommend.<br /><br />1/18/16 update:  this is a cheap bag and not worth the money I paid for it; maybe it's worth $25.  If this is real leather, I'll eat my hat.  It fills a size need, however, and it'll have to do."
4.0,"It's a fun outfit, but it was way big on me. I got a large.<br />I'm usually a small in clothing, but reading reviews made me think a large would work best. I'm hoping to get the medium and see if that fits better. I do know it fits small, so I know for sure, a small won't fit."
4.0,would have given a 5 star but the seams are just weird. They are large and unfinish.
4.0,"Great price,  great quality. Other stores are definitely ripping you off with their expensive pricing. Reccomending these to everyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money in order to look good."
4.0,Very cute shirt but was too big for my son.
4.0,It fits perfectly and I like the material is not too thin. The length is good too. I'm 5&#34;2' and it hits at the mid part of my thigh like a 6&#34; length. It's not too short.  I plan on getting more.
4.0,It's a really beautiful bracelet. My wife loved it but I thought the stones could have been a bit brighter.
