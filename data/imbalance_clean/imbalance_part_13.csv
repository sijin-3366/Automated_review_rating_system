4.0,"So far, I like. If it lasts a while I'll like it even more."
4.0,Good buy for cost
4.0,"This sign is so much fun and was easy to hang with some push-pins. I thought it was one sign, but turned out to be three seperate letters, which was a little disappointing; however, the color changing can still sync up if you want it to."
4.0,"I haven‚Äôt washed it yet.<br />It‚Äôs a little big at the waist but in all fairness I had to buy XL for my bust.<br />Really cute summer dress though.<br />I‚Äôll just dart it or belt it.<br />I loved that they take a pic of the front door where it was delivered!<br />I was laughing because it wasn‚Äôt my front door, it was my sister-in-law‚Äôs.<br />I live further back on the same property.<br />üôÇüôÇüòÜ"
4.0,Granddaughter likes these!
4.0,Decent purse for the price. Thought it was a cloth material turned out to be more canvas like still like anyway!  Lots of space.
4.0,"These are if you wanna show muscle, not lose at all. Got these for my son and they were too tight and he‚Äôs too skinny lol. Otherwise good"
4.0,"I have a pair and bought another for my friend, who was sick and stayed home most of the time.  These helped her feel special with their great red color.  They're the ruby red slippers for home!"
4.0,"The waistband on this skirt makes it look really cheap. I would suggest covering with a ribbon or belt or something because the elastic band is not flattering at all. Overall skirt was ok.  Very poofy, I removed a layer of tulle and cut it to be tea length. Also I noticed the top layer is made of tulle while the layers beneath are not- they‚Äôre more of a cheap netting. Kinda disappointed by that because I feel like it would lay much better if they were all tulle."
4.0,One problem with hats like these is they don't quite fit a large head and these work well! Colors match the picture accurately and they work greats as gifts!
4.0,"Weight, fit, metal zipper, hood"
4.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, 160 lbs. The leg length was fine (the elastic leg cuffs help with that), but it was a little tight in the hip area."
4.0,Nice but the ones I received were more sized for kids wrsit.<br />Including the tie's theses bracelets were barely 6&#34; long.<br />They are a multitude of colrs just wish they were bigger.
4.0,I love this shirt. It was a bit tight. Fits like a crop top. Material does not stretch.
4.0,This nightgown is very pretty but a little snug across the bust. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and weigh 148 lbs. and ordered a size Large. It falls a little below my knees.
4.0,Very nice and delicate.  I think it was well worth the money with the price of 14K gold.  I am a Lion so I really enjoy wearing it.
4.0,LOVE THIS TOP!!!
4.0,"A lot of room inside for the overall size of the bag. The bag portion of the item seems rugged and well made, but the handle portion seems a little flimsy. No problems so far, but I expect that it were the item will eventually fail. However, the price is still good in comparison to the quality."
4.0,The fabric miss a little of support. But very sexy. I like it
4.0,I‚Äôm using these for UV protection for my face. They probably can double for covid stuff. My only complaint is the neck area could have more material so that it hung looser around the neck.
4.0,Little small fitting and short. But feels nice.
4.0,Pretty but the color is not as bright as the picture. I was expecting more of a hot pink and got more of a light pink.
4.0,"Looks beautiful, doesn‚Äôt fit on Pandora bracelet tho."
4.0,i guess its ok was for my MOM
4.0,"The suit is a great fit. I had to go a size down, they run big. The only thing i dislike is the flap on the upper part of the suit, it is very loose. I would order again."
4.0,"I am transitioning from a full size bi-fold to this so it feels small. The reality is that it holds quite a bit. The fit is pretty tight but seems work fine. I have never been a money clip kind of guy so am still getting used to it. Especially for the price, this is a very good value."
4.0,"I'm used to getting cheaper watches from Walmart, so this was actually a bit of a splurge. That said, I love the look and feel of it. The design is very sleek and easy to read and the watch is very comfortable.<br /><br />The only downsides are it doesn't have a second hand and the latch takes some getting used to (but once you figure it out, it's fine)"
4.0,Works fairly well on my honor guard hat. This is what the brush was made for.
4.0,"I ordered this watch as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old granddaughter because it was on her wishlist. I received it promptly and in excellent condition and would buy from this vendor again. However I failed to carefully read the provided information and the watch is rather large for my granddaughter since it is sized for a woman. Hopefully if she still likes it, some of the links can be removed so it will fit her. As for the quality of the watch, I am very satisfied, and it came in a nice black velvet bag with drawstring."
4.0,Size is small. Great quality but order a size larger than you need
4.0,So nice and warm!  My son loves it!
4.0,bought these for some college student workers of mine. They are nice and comfy on the inside and the screen touch works. Just what I wanted.
4.0,"I usually wear size 7-7 1/2 in women's wearing a thick sock. I read a review that said she ordered a size bigger to wear thick socks, but it's still too big. I had ordered a size 8 and need a 7 1/2 instead. I just don't like the return and repurchase process vs just an even exchange. The company is willing to work with me to get another size for the same price, but it's a process."
4.0,Great quality but run bigger than what I thought.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô5, 126 lbs, and my jean size is 26 or 27 depending on the brand (high waisted skinny jeans). I ordered a size medium, and it fits comfortably. The fabric isn‚Äôt the highest quality, but I didn‚Äôt expect that for the price. I‚Äôve been washing it very carefully by hand and hanging it up to dry and it still looks good! The fabric isn‚Äôt super breathable and it‚Äôs a bit sheer so I wear it with a white cami underneath and it looks really pretty. It‚Äôs perfect for wearing to work where I have to dress business casual."
4.0,Super cute I just got it I have a stretchy I‚Äôm afraid it will bust easily but it‚Äôs super cute
4.0,Difficult to find someone to print that size picture for this locket. Other than that zero complaints. Excellent construction and looks great. Good detail and fairly sturdy for the size.
4.0,Hat fits great. Beware the scarf fits very tight.
4.0,"Super soft shawl.  Packs down really small for travel, even in a midsize purse.  Not too thick that it's too warm for most temperatures but not too thin that it doesn't ward off any cold air.  Perfect for plane travel to give that little bit more warmth from A/C and air blowing.  Looks good with any outfit from dressy to jeans."
4.0,These were a little tight on my son.
4.0,"These gold teeth were a nice addition to my son's Lil Wayne Halloween costume. He could barely speak clearly with them in his mouth though. I wouldn't try eating with them in your mouth, either!"
4.0,Daughter loves this. We only wish it was a little deeper.
4.0,These truly are giant. I ended up returning them but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.
4.0,Love the saying on these necklaces
4.0,Very loose fitting but soft comfortable material.looks really nice tucked into jeans or skirt or i used it loose fitting over shorts and it was really nicely paired. I purchased all the other patterns as well.
4.0,Runs a bit small but feels great
4.0,This is a perfect dress for my daughters school dance. Fit very well. The material is a thin chiffon.
4.0,The dress was flattering.
4.0,Not roomy enough for me.
4.0,Halter top does not provide enough support.
4.0,Nice but larger thanexpected
4.0,"Have not used the watch yet, however the style and quality looks great.  I kept two watches because I couldn't decide which I liked better. This looks very expensive.  Hope it works well in the future!"
4.0,I love this long hoodie so much I ordered 3 in different colors!  Only negative is there is some fabric peeling after a few washes.
4.0,"To me, these look like the old-style Ked's I wore as a kid.  They are slip-on, tieless, flat bottomed, and comfy to wear for casual out and about.  Like many other reviewers, I picked them sight unseen and feel like a winner.  I have a difficult time ordering shoes on-line but these could not have suited me better.  Winner!"
4.0,Super cute and inexpensive!
4.0,"This jacket is supposed to have a pink lining and it doesn't, but it's still a great jacket for under $35."
4.0,These glasses take away any glare and fit perfectly for my head size. I just wish the lenses could be black and not show my eyes but that's my personal opinion.<br />If you are fine with having your eyes be seen and just want anti-glare glasses then by all means buy these.
4.0,Very nice. Keeps dif keys seperate with the easy to use key ring. My only drawback is that i wish the leather tab was alittle longer
4.0,A solid addition to improve the comfort and fit of your red-wings. It definitely made the iron rangers more comfortable to wear.
4.0,Very nice necklace ESPECIALLY considering the cost.
4.0,Its a great cardigan! Definitely thinner than expected but I don‚Äôt mind. If you want it to fit like the photo I suggest ordering two sizes up!! I usually wear an xs and I got a medium and it fits almost picture perfect
4.0,Thought there were be little stones but there are just spots for them.
4.0,got this for a concert! color is super bright
4.0,A little large but very comfy.
4.0,The dress was great for vacation. The material feels good and it's cute to wear casual and dressy. I gave it four stars because the draw string came out of the dress on the first wash.
4.0,Great fit and padding. Only complaint is they came with a 1 inch hole along the seam near the waist. Fortunately my jersey covered it for race day!
4.0,"The glasses are super comfy, relaxing to wear."
4.0,"ummm, don't know yet haven't worn this but it works nicely."
4.0,I use this all the time.  I just wish the one compartment was just a little larger as I can't fasten the snap with my cell phone in it and that was the main reason I bought it so I could carry my cell phone without losing it.
4.0,When I saw this dress I knew I had my NYE dress. It looks good and even in person the stones are nicely placed and have good sparkle. I would advise buying the dress a size down. I purchased the medium and feel that it is a bit loose for the look I want. For reference I am 63.5 inches and weigh 190. I am sure it will look good with a good strapless bra and good shaping panties but I just wish it fit a bit tighter. I am fine with the mesh being lighter than me and plan on either spot dying it with a synthetic dye or using a lace wig tint to help it match closer to my skin tone.
4.0,I‚Äôm not completely in love with the shirt. I expected it to be further off of the shoulder. I‚Äôm assuming I should have gotten a bigger size. Overall it‚Äôs still pretty okay.
4.0,Comfortable hair covering and good fit. I like it
4.0,I bought these and promptly scaled Kilimanjaro.  These shorts are lightweight and great.  Even the sherpas loved them
4.0,Haven't worn it yet looks nice
4.0,I am long and thin and the dress pattern was not suited to my shape.
4.0,"Fabulous hat! love it! love purple! love this hat! love this purple hat! It's very, very, warm! Great purchase! hair tie was cute."
4.0,"Body Type: 5'8, 190 lbs, Athletic Build<br />Add a necklace and heels to look your age!!"
4.0,"The earring was a bit smaller than expected and only fits the left ear. As with any clip on, the part that crawls up the ear hurts. I recommend bending the tip of that metal flap to lay at so you don't have a point digging into your ear all night. Otherwise it was cute."
4.0,"Edit to say: I ended up paying someone to trim the bottom and hem it again since there was almost a 3‚Äù length difference in some spots.<br /><br />The blush color is beautiful and it seems to be very well made. It is very long as expected, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 3‚Äù and it‚Äôs still brushing the floor when I wear heels. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because the bottom is somewhat uneven although it doesn‚Äôt show up very clearly when I‚Äôm wearing it. The lining is nice and thick and not see through so I don‚Äôt have to wear another slip underneath. There‚Äôs a very good chance I‚Äôll order this in other colors in the future. I usually wear a 14/16 in bottoms and ordered the XL, it‚Äôs fairly tight but the back of the waistband does have elastic."
4.0,Nice dresss but a little on the large side
4.0,"Una pieza muy bonita, y llego perfecta."
4.0,Beautiful fitting n cloth.<br />I loved it
4.0,was as described!
4.0,Very soft and cozy! Cute design and good fit!
4.0,I love the design and it's a great looking piece.  My only issue is the post is very thick and I'm having to stretch my pierced ear a little more....
4.0,Make your feet stink
4.0,"My kids really enjoy the finger lights, well, the ones that work anyways!  Of the 40 pieces, 4 were on when they arrived, so of course the batteries were dead in those 4."
4.0,"This is a pendant like I've never seen before. It's similar to a mustard seed pendant my grandmother had that I always wanted to wear when I was little. I've never seen one with a dandelion seed in it before.<br /><br />The pendant is done very nicely. The seed is encased in what I assume is Lucite, centered nicely with only one extremely small air bubble off to one side. The Lucite has a metallic band all the way around it that the chain attaches to and a small silver-colored 7/16&#34; wide rectangular charm that hangs above the pendant and has the word &#34;wish&#34; embossed on it in black letters.<br /><br />The dandelion seed is so delicate that it is difficult to see. I'm going to wear mine with dark colors so it stands out more.<br /><br />The chain is better quality than I expected, 24&#34; long and does not have an extender chain, but does have a nice lobster claw clasp.<br /><br />I almost missed seeing this necklace when it was shipped to me. It comes in a small resealable plastic bag with no outer gift box or drawstring bag. It was shipped with some other items I ordered and I almost missed seeing it in the bottom of the shipping box.<br /><br />I am glad that I received this necklace in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,"I was happy with almost everything of this this product, except the color that is much lighter than it appears in the picture. But still nice yellow sweater, I will keep it."
4.0,They're nice and waterproof but I was not expecting there to be separation between the fingers inside the mittens
4.0,It fits OK except for the fact that you cannot tell where the back or the front is and if you have a big but it tends to have a lot of gathering in the back not leveled out but it‚Äôs fine I got lots of compliments it‚Äôs it‚Äôs OK otherwise I would buy again in a different color
4.0,"No real wow factors, so it's not a perfect score, but overall this watch is really neat. It's kinetic, so you have to keep it on you to keep it relevant. Otherwise no complaints! Great watch, would recommend."
4.0,These bands are excellent quality.  I just wish they were a little smaller as I have skinny wrists.
4.0,"Looked great the fit was awesome, I felt sexy in this dress'"
4.0,Everyone like it but I should of ordered a smaller size.
4.0,it is hard to find PJ bottoms that are long enough for a 32-33&#34; inseam.  These are.  Hopefully they don't shrink too much.
4.0,Beautiful jut too short unfortunately.. 5'8&#34;
4.0,Very snug and warm
4.0,"Just received today, beautiful, soft, I would &#34;love it&#34; but this one-size is way too big. It fits me &#34;just&#34; and I'm not tiny, I wear an XL usually. I was thinking I'd be on the far size of barely fitting, but, I could easily weigh 50lbs more and this would still be a bit big. It's more like a Plus-size One-size. Five stars if it wasn't so large, I'll take it in some, so not that big of a deal. Otherwise it's very lovely. This was the Black one-size boho flare sleeve off the shoulder dress."
4.0,It was so cute and fit perfect but i had my hair down and it got caught and bent backwards almost immediately. So bummed about that. I still have it but its broken now üò≠
4.0,"I use this for target shooting during the winter months and it really does a good job of keeping my head warm. As the picture shows it can cover nearly your whole face, leaving just enough room for you to see. I have had issue with wearing sunglasses and covering my nose with the face mask; it's hard to keep my glasses from fogging up, so the material doesn't tend to let enough of your breath out, and throws it up and out towards your eyes, but this is probably one reason it works so well at keeping your face warm. Great product overall, just kind of wish I could cover my whole face and wear sunglasses without the fog issue."
4.0,"REALLY thin fabric, but comfy!"
4.0,The material is not overwhelmingly thick. The sweatshirt is a little more thin than the typical sweatshirt. Its very cute and comfortable. I bought two and depending on how they hold up in the wash I plan to buy more
4.0,"Based on other reviews, I ordered up 1 size.  I typically wear a size Large, but have trouble with button-up shirts gaping/pulling at the chest.  So I ordered an XL in this shirt.  I should have stuck with my usual size.  The XL is very roomy on me and the sleeves are too long.  For reference,  I'm 5'4&#34; and 175lbs.  I got it to wear as sun protection when boating and gardening and it works fantastically for that.  It breathes very well and is lightweight.  I also like the zippered pocket, other than that anything I do put in it tends to weigh down that side of the shirt.  But for what I use the shirt for that's not a big deal.  Also, I prefer to wear my shirts untucked and I often layer this over other shirts - tank tops, etc. - so I would like to find a similar style shirt to this, but with a hemline that is meant to be worn untucked."
4.0,"Very comfortable feel and fit. Fits as expected. Simple, but love that the twist at the front adds some style to it. I'd definitely purchase again!"
4.0,Need broken in
4.0,Love this dress! Only thing I might change is have a lining for the bottom because it is a little scratchy.  It looks great on though!
4.0,Fits  well. Great design with doggies and teal color different and bright  . Many compliments on mask
4.0,"My only complaint is that the pink color actually looks red in person. Otherwise, the item was as described. Each band is individually packaged and shows example ways to use it, which makes it easy to buy one set and give each band to individual people as a gift."
4.0,"I wish I could just wear these everywhere. The most comfortable, lightest,  and airy track pants I've ever owned.The only complaint is that the small ""Russell"" logo is screen printed on the side quickly starts to crack and chip off.<br /><br />I'm a big 5XL and finding clothes that fit is tough. These were great. plenty of room and comfortable. Maybe a little on the long side, but not horribly so.<br /><br />I plan on buying several more pairs."
4.0,The material wasn't what I expected.
4.0,Lots of room to carry what I want. Strap is great length for me. Color more vibrant than in picture - glad for that!  Zippered pocket on inside right size for wallet. Only negative? Wish this bag had &#34;feet.&#34;  We'll see how well it holds up without those.
4.0,My kid bit a hole in the inside liner the first time he wore it. I know it shouldn‚Äôt be chewed but only mask we‚Äôve had this prob with. The non-organic version is much sturdier. We have had no problems with those... which are great
4.0,The dress is cut small a size smaller it would look nice on someone with the right size
4.0,Loved this dress...it was a xl...getting another color soon üòç
4.0,"This runs a little small but is more supportive than most bras this price, and made of a much sturdier material while still being soft. Very good for athletics but buy a size up."
4.0,"The dress is pretty, but the material is heavier than I expected"
4.0,Still got em‚Äô!
4.0,"The mixed matched sox were a great treat! I&#34;d like to see a smaller ply,and a softer yarn. The colors are duplicated in each sock."
4.0,"Very pretty. The posts are short, only long enough for a piercing that is 100% healed"
4.0,Decent pair of sweat/jogger for the price. Runs big.
4.0,They hold like a vise.  Sometimes difficult to get them back off...
4.0,Confusing at first but after 5 min I figured it out. They are really cute and they're comfortable. The gold part is plastic and not metal like I thought but it still looks really good. See picture for how to &#34;put it together.&#34; The left sandal is how it comes and the right sandal is how I put it together. I believe that's the correct way. Correct me if I'm wrong. That's the only way I was comfortable to me.
4.0,very flat and skinny but I guess you get what you paid for lol. No pockets on the inside and if you‚Äôre a older teen looking for a chic crossover that‚Äôs spacious this isn‚Äôt for you. I‚Äôd recommend it for 9-13yrs.
4.0,It was soft. Fit as expected. I returned it because I did not care for the lining.
4.0,I like the length of the necklace and it is very pretty
4.0,Si me gust√≥ las piedras lo hacen m√°s diferente a lo que estamos acostumbrados a ver. Pero est√° peque√±o parece gargantilla.
4.0,Adorable but too big and I ordered a small
4.0,"I love this dress and get lots of compliments every time I wear it. I had read all of the reviews from other buyers before purchasing this product, so I knew that it would run large. It does run large, but I was looking for a dress to wear with leggings. I'm happy with the product so far."
4.0,Very comfy. Love the pockets. Falls below the knee for petites.
4.0,"I ordered 4 of these in different colors.  I loved them all!  Good fit, good quality, well made, no flaws. The material is medium weight, not like a heavy sweatshirt and not tee shirt material, and VERY soft inside!  Warm and cozy, but not too warm.  They all fit the same, and size is true.  Not too tight or loose; order one size up if you want a very roomy fit.<br />This was my original review. However, I had to drop it to a 4 on my rating, due to my disappointment about the color.  I ordered this color a second time (first order cancelled for too long ship date). I ordered grass green.  One place the order says the color is GRASS GREEN (a subtle color) and the other Kelly green (vibrant)!  Color is NOT as pictured either, grass green.  It's definitely Kelly Green.  I didn't really like it, but really didn't want to make any more returns."
4.0,"These are the only hoops like this I could find so I got them despite the other reviews that weren‚Äôt too positive.<br />The color is really nice. Upon opening we had to get creative with opening the clasp as it seemed welded shut? Sealed shut? Not sure but it was shut. Ended up putting my finger in the hoop and slamming the clasp on a countertop to pop it open. My husband got smart and put scissors inside it and opened them, that worked. Once they were opened though it‚Äôs been easy to close and open them again. LOVE the variety of sizes but the bar that goes in your ear is so large! It won‚Äôt move when in my ear and took some pushing to get it in there. Might‚Äôve gauged it lol. They‚Äôre cute and I can‚Äôt find any other so far like them so they‚Äôll do for now. Expect a ride on the struggle bus if you do get them tho"
4.0,"While the socks aren‚Äôt as transparent as featured in the image, they still look cute on. The sizing for me was a bit off. Held up through a wash without shrinking too much."
4.0,The belt itself is great quality and the buckle is very heavy and seems durable.  I had to cut the belt by about 6 inches for a perfect fit.  I‚Äôm a size 30.
4.0,At first I didn't like it .my daughter has the same brand hat she got from hallmark that I love but it is not the slouchy hat.i thought it was the same thing but it wasn't.the hat is a little tall on the top of the head but if you smash it down it's ok.if you wear your hair in a pony tail under the hat the hat fits good to.
4.0,The socks are really cute but heavy.  More of a winter sock so I will have to wait until after the summer.  It has bee in the 100 already and it's the hottest yet.  I'm sure they will feel good this winter.
4.0,This arrived fast without defects or damage. Great first impressions! Very cute. Printing is delicate and not as dark as I thought it would be. But otherwise makes for a nice gift.
4.0,"This is a really nice piece. It fits loosely and is comfortable, breathable fabric. There's a hood, and there are sections of transparent net behind the sleeves - which is a really unique feature. Not as heavy as it looks. Hangs nicely and falls at the top of my thighs. Like this product!"
4.0,"Fit as expected,but animal hair all over the dress try and keep your animal away when making clothes to sale for public some people are allergic to animals and you wouldn't want your customer to get sick simple because they patronize your business."
4.0,"Very cute, but one ball wasnt threaded correctly so it fell off a few times within the week. Luckily I had other jewlery with extra parts, so i switched it out."
4.0,Love the socks but I thought they were longer than they are. Nice quality!
4.0,LITTLE TO SHORT ON THE LENGHT
4.0,"Do not go by the sizing information given, go up at least 1 size. I wear a size 10 and ordered the corresponding size and it was WAY TOO small. I loved the style but there was just no way I could wear it. I was really disappointed. If you go up a size you should be fine. It is such a cute bathing suit and would be flattering especially if you want to be stylish but also cover your stomach. I would recommend this suit! The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because in my opinion the sizing is a little off.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my opinion."
4.0,Love these but they are cheap. Quality matches price. Worn them several times but the lenses are popping out.
4.0,"I have only had these on about 4 times so far, but they sure do make a difference in my tired legs while at work. I will buy another pair if they hold up, but right now it is too early to tell"
4.0,I formerly lived in Hawaii and have bought many Aloha Shirts.  This shirt is ok although I think that it is a little on the bright side.  I will wear it many times with a lot of joy.
4.0,"It‚Äôs cheap, but it‚Äôs good"
4.0,My son is 12 and usually wears a 12/14. He doesn‚Äôt like anything too baggy so I went with the 12/13. It fits him but probably not for long. Length is good but sleeves are a tad bit too short. Overall it‚Äôs super soft and comfortable.
4.0,"Really pretty dress. Fits as expected, but it‚Äôs loose and flowy without looking like I‚Äôm wearing a bag‚Äîthe tie waist definitely helps with adding some shape. I am short, so it does fall longer on me, almost like a maxi dress but not quite that long. I wish this came in more colors, as well as in a short-sleeve option, which I would prefer over the sleeveless. However, this sleeveless style is nice for layering with a cardigan. Very cute overall!"
4.0,My daughter loves them they fit her great.
4.0,Works well.  Had to start wearing reading glasses after surgery.
4.0,Very staticky. No matter how much fabric softener or anti-static spray you use. Coarser than expected but still pretty.
4.0,Size description is not accurate
4.0,"This came faster than expected, I enjoyed watching it track since they come from China. I wear a 7, and I ordered 7.5 because I was going to wear a thicker boot type sock for additional warmth. When laced up they fit well. The shoe is fur lined, but I think if you have a narrower foot then these probably wouldn't be suitable as the toe box area is wider. I got them for walking trails with my dogs. They grip pretty well in the snow/slush/ice. They don't have the support factor of a walking/athletic shoe and so that is why the 4 stars. I can't wear them all day because of that. I notice that my arch gets fatigued from lack of support, but considering the price, really they are more of a fashion type shoe. I mainly wanted them for the lace up factor, and the warmth in winter. In other boots in (-) temps, my feet were too cold, these I can feel my toes, and they stay warmer. I love the color."
4.0,"These capris are versatile: you can wear them to play tennis, Go swimming, or just lounging around."
4.0,"I'm 5'5, about 125lbs, C-cup boobs, ordered a small. Overall looks like the picture, runs a little small. Bottoms fit well but the top is a bit too short, like the shoulder straps could be an inch or two longer and it would fit perfectly. Unfortunately the straps aren't adjustable. I maybe should have gone up to a M."
4.0,Cute- but largest size was still too narrow for thicket hour glass shape.
4.0,Nice dress but to small. Ordered size larger than normal because it was a knit dress - still to small.
4.0,Surprisingly good quality seam work and fabric is not thin.  The slit up the back it too much for my office so I'll be seeing that down a few inches.  The sleeves aren't very flattering on my board shoulder it makes me look boxy up top.  I say a definit buy unless you have broad shoulders.
4.0,I bought this gift for a friend for her birthday.  She is a younger girl and I think she will like it.  It is very pretty.
4.0,well made novelty doormat for the fisherman...I smile when I come thru the door... just a door mat but much more to one that loves to fish for this species.
4.0,I really like these bags but they're a bit smaller than what I would like. I like the fact that I can just throw them in the washer. I also like that I can bring in 5 bags and keep them in my purse
4.0,This frame just fits me right. I love it!
4.0,"This tunic is very pretty, but it is very thin and you need to wear a Cami under it."
4.0,I don‚Äôt love them nor do I hate them .. the crotch area definitely fits a little funny on me
4.0,"Love it. I wear it 24/7. It's real I know because I'm allergic to nickel, but no problem!"
4.0,"Looks really cute in person , a little bit heavy but in general it‚Äôs beautiful"
4.0,"These are close to LulaRoe, but not quite. Nonetheless, for the money, they'll do."
4.0,"Yes they are super soft, they fit great, and are NOT SEE THROUGH!! Only four stars because I'm not a fan of the thin waist band(knew that before buying) or the fact that I pull them up so high. I consider my torso long, but these can go up to right under my bra. I feel too constricted. If you don't mind that, I would definitely buy them!!"
4.0,It's roomy and cute.
4.0,The horse is beautiful. I'm getting a stronger clasps for it though. I ordered two and both horses fell off the leather chain. The horse is beautiful. The size of a golf ball.
4.0,"They are of cheap quality but still very cute.  I bought these last year and they lasted about a summer with me wearing them 24x7 for 4-5 months.  You get what you pay for with these, but you can't beat 8 anklets plus 4 toe rings for this price."
4.0,I love them but they are a little narrow at the toe and wide at the heel. Super cute though!
4.0,nice shorts!
4.0,These are fun little bracelets at a reasonable price.  Just a little bling to make your wrist shine.  I would recommend them.  They are available<br />with many different charms.  I give them as gifts all the time.  For myself I wear 2 or 3 at the same time.
4.0,"Our grandsons eyes lite up when he saw Mickey.<br />It isn't as heavy as I thought i'd be, but it will work just fine."
4.0,"Style is good.<br />Although, after wearing them for a few months, the cloth has gotten a little thinner."
4.0,"Ran a little small, but came with a extender."
4.0,"I purchased these for my maintenance team at work. They find them easier to breath in, however the strap around the lower back part of the head is a little awkward and requires some finagling to get it to hold in place."
4.0,"I just got this watch today.. it's beautiful, the reason why  put 4 start only because it's a bit big than what I expected.. over all is good .."
4.0,It was a nice necklace and it is exactly like the picture.  Good seller!
4.0,Great basic nice and soft stretchy elastic short.  Ordered the 8-9 for a little extra room but still had the fit of a girls med 7-8 . Pink was slightly see through. Good shorts for the right size
4.0,liked the shirt but it runs large
4.0,"I was very hesitant to order a suit online. But I after reading the reviews and agonizing over how badly I really needed this sugar skull suit I went ahead and ordered the 8/10. I'm 5'4&#34; 135 lb. Over all it fits great. It is tight to get over your hips but slimming once it's on and quite comfortable. I'm smaller up top than most people with my measurements and the reviews said it was small busted. It fits me great in the top. The reviews also stated it was a little loose in the bottom area and it is, but I have a flat behind and I face that problem often. I'll just wear swim shorts over it, which I probably would have regardless. I think I may order the other skull print because I really like this suit for the price."
4.0,"These headbands are just as described, very nice colors, good material."
4.0,The needle part can get pulled out.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but a little too cropped for my liking
4.0,These work great with most of my tank tops and cocktail dresses.
4.0,"Nice bag, great space for everything but the opening is small which makes it hard to get stuff in and out."
4.0,It looks and fits great!
4.0,"Really liked this dress! I am normally a dress size 10, bra 38C, height 5'7, and weight 160. I got a size Large and it fit me very nicely. I only wished that the bottom part started lower down closer to my belly button. It rests just under my boobs which isn't my ideal fit, but I still like it!"
4.0,The quality exceeds the price paid.
4.0,"I am a size medium I'm 5'4"" tall and am a 36B cup. The top fit just right. It's made of a breathable fabric but not see through. The button on the back is not too hard to unbutton yourself with one hand. Overall really nice top."
4.0,A little bit smaller than expected will not work well with teenagers but is perfect for elementary kids
4.0,Was a gift. Recipient was pleased.
4.0,"The Fenti Women's Bridal Lingerie in Ivory White is really pretty. The material feels more like mesh instead of lace, but it is very flattering. The only down side is that I bought the largest size available and the top is still slightly too small. I wear a 40 DD and the top is tight, however my husband really likes it, so I guess that's what matters."
4.0,"I really love this skirt but it is a little small, I will have to drop a few pounds before I wear it. I should have ordered a size up. Otherwise this is beautiful, well made, exactly as pictured and I just love it!"
4.0,"Happy with the weight of this tunic, as my workplace gets rather warm.  The button details and top-stitching is a. Ice touch.  After several washes (always washed inside out, air dry), it is starting to pill a little.  Runs a little large at the neck/shoulder area.  I am 5'8&#34;, and this tunic hits me above mid-thigh."
4.0,I could have done without the tiny Spider-Man nipple pasties. But the rest were decent.
4.0,"Really love the quality of TOMS, and i have been looking for a goo pair of rain boots at a decent price. I usually am a kids size 3, but these shoes ran a bit large, I do have larger insoles that I put in which make them fit better. These boots get the job done and are cute and I can tell they will last me a while!"
4.0,"I love the overall style of this swimsuit. I am very self conscious about my midsection due to fluctuations in my weight. I was pretty skeptical about buying, but thats because I rely on other customer photos when making a decision to buy. I purchased an XL due to me having wider hips. The top fits just perfect. If I had bigger breasts, the top would not work. The straps are adjustable, and can be unhooked (I‚Äôm assuming to change to a crisscross back). For those trying to decide, I‚Äôm a 38B, usually wear size L tops and size 12-14 pants. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 233 lbs."
4.0,"Color and style- exactly as expected in the pictures.<br /><br />Fit- ordered a large as I am 5‚Äô8 and my normal size. It fit perfect with room for my shoulders and waist. Even the arms were the right length.<br /><br />Only knocked one star off as I wanted a fluffier fabric, it is a texture thing for me and should be perfect for most.<br /><br />The seller is great! 5 stars for them."
4.0,Great for the price. Short on me. 5'9. 200lbs. No butt cheeks showing but pretty short. Silky soft.
4.0,Good cushion while riding
4.0,The undies flanges the crouch. The protrusion made the dressing odd. Bought undies less comfortable that did the trick.
4.0,Fast shipping great quality. I got one size to big but my father can help me get it the perfect fit. So order your correct size that you are and not one size up.but other than that I like it alot
4.0,Youth/medium which is what my grandson normally wears and it is super tight. He was still able to wear under his football pads but will not be able to wear for long.
4.0,"It's very soft and comfy. I like it. It fits me really well. I do think, though, that it is a little bit pricey."
4.0,That a nice jacket! I'm satisfied.
4.0,"Nice shirt, good quality. However, the tag is missing off the shirt."
4.0,Using as my Midwest winter coat
4.0,"The swimsuit is nice, and good quality. My only disappointment is that I ordered the red one and the color is not the beautiful deep red that is shown in the picture. It's more of a poppy red. I still like it and will keep it but I was looking forward to the color shown in the picture.  Other than that it is a very cute swimsuit.  Some of the reviews said that the swimsuit runs small so I ordered a size larger, but I had to end up re-ordering because the size larger was, well, a size too large.  However, the bottoms are definitely very small.  They cover about half of my behind!"
4.0,"Such a cute, well-made earring. I could never get the gem in between the twist."
4.0,I love the color and style of this dress. It‚Äôs a little long for me but I expected that.
4.0,"I ordered these for my mom. She wanted to get medium but after reading reviews advised her to get 2 sizes up as everyone was saying the cardigan ran small. After she got them, she said they fit but were a bit snug and wishes she had ordered 3 sizes up. She is 176 lbs and I think the 2X would have fit her better, instead of the XL."
4.0,My daughter owned another pair if these boots previously. She loved them so much that when her old ones finally started showing wear and tear we bought another pair. They are stylish and comfortable.
4.0,This product was a good fit and well made
4.0,"As a scarf collector,  I must say this is very pretty.  Advertisement picture is true to print and color. Very beautiful."
4.0,"You know, if you're going to charge that kind of money, raise the price if you have to, and put a decent chain on it.  My wife has already replaced it!  Yes, she loves the pendant, but the chain's a joke and it cheapens the gift!  And as a gift, you don't get nearly the points you should for something like this!"
4.0,"This is my first  time trying these bra, and its so amazing. Feels comfortable and fits perfectly fine in my dress and also very easy to put on. Thinking of getting more for myself i love them  100%"
4.0,"Soft, comfortable and not too tight around the ankles, even for bigger calves. Warm, too."
4.0,"This shirt is a little too big, especially in the underarm area.  It's also a little strange that the ties around the neck tie at the side, rather than the back, but it's still a cute style and the fabric is nice, so I've decided to keep it."
4.0,"adequate goggles. cost efficient, received 3 goggles. Goggles were decent quality.<br />Mainly used during the winter to shield eyes from wind and brightness while shoveling snow.<br />Worth the purchase."
4.0,"This is such a cute Summer dress, but you will need to have a great figure to pull it off.  It is adorable and sexy cute.  It is short but not too short.  Furthermore, it has adjustable straps and the material has good stretch but is not transparent.  I ordered a size large, and it would work if you wear a size 9/10 junior or 8/10 women's."
4.0,Very nice coat!! Very comfortable and just the right length for driving. I give it 4 stars only because it hasn't had to be cleaned yet...
4.0,These suspenders have a pattern that I did not notice when I ordered them. Just a heads up.
4.0,Its a little small and thin.
4.0,"Ordered for my dad, and he loves them."
4.0,This top is cute & good quality for the price but I usually wear a xl so I ordered a 2xl to be safe with overseas sizing it fit like a snug large so I had to return it. Return policy is great!
4.0,I ordered 3x and it fits like an xl. Hair and lint stick to it a bit.
4.0,Love the color but disappointed with fabrics and wash instructions.
4.0,Cute hat! You can get it alittle cheaper then I
4.0,"I got a large thinking they would fit. I'm 5'8&#34; and 160 lbs. I don't look large, but I always order things too big. The waist gaps. Next time I'll order a medium."
4.0,"Even though I got this purse at a slightly discounted rate for my honest feedback I would have paid full price for it anyway!! I have a medium size purse which is great for every day use but way too bulky to carry to a nightclub or out on a date. I have been too lazy to look for a smaller purse but when I saw this one was discounted, grabbed it right away. Just got it today and although it is fake leather the material looks quite good for the price you are paying. The hardware is also fun and very polished. The only challenge to the design of the purse is that one of the zipper pockets is almost impossible to get to because of the way the strap is attached. You can certainly remove the strap to get to that back pocket but it takes more effort than is worth considering that you have two other pockets to use. I guess one side benefit to the pocket you can't get to is that it's a great place to put money or credit cards because that will deter thieves. The color of the purse is pretty close to the photo although the material is slightly more reflective. I actually thought the material in the photo was suede or at least a really matte leather but the material is definitely a little reflective but not shiny."
4.0,A bit heavy but fits great!
4.0,I bought these for my three daughters for Christmas.  I have worn mine daily and I haven't had any issues with it.  My only complaint is I wish they made them for multiple daughters (more than two).  I had to buy another set for mom/one daughter.
4.0,The inside is very comfy and soft.
4.0,"Fits really well, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. I will look for similar bathing suits from this company in the future."
4.0,"cool shirt, If you want the one from lockout its this."
4.0,"These are super cute, slimming and thick fabric,  ( not see through ) although I was worried ordering a large, I have a similar pair of pants bought form VS and they were large so I did purchase the large but I wish the had an XL option because the large was just a little tight."
4.0,its gorgeous. can't wait to wear it at the Ky derby next month.
4.0,Very cute but a little small. Would work for a kid.
4.0,Very happy with what I received and the only reason for one less star is because the material doesn't feel the same in each one and I like some of the material better than others. I'm not talking about the pattern print I'm talking about the material itself. The delivery was quick and I appreciated that. I would buy from them again.
4.0,"These pants are super comfy to lounge. They are a soft material. They are stretchy and with the way the pants fall, they should comfortably fit a wide range of heights and sizes.  I am 5' 3&#34; 112lbs and they fit perfectly. For the price these are amazing."
4.0,The dress was beautiful. It runs small.
4.0,My granddaughter loves her cardigan.
4.0,Was surprisingly comfortable and stylish great purchase
4.0,"Boyfriend loved them! They are a tad thin, you can see toes through them, but he has washed and worn them everyday this week and loves them. Wubba lubba dub dub!"
4.0,Good Wallet for the person who wants to carry less
4.0,"I like that it was the peanuts and that Franklin was included. It has plenty of room, I just wish it had pockets on the side for my water."
4.0,Even with high heals it‚Äôs WAY TO LONG and I‚Äôm not short.  I like these with sandals and this is crazy long will have to hem üò©.  It does fit well otherwise and it‚Äôs very pretty and true to pictures.
4.0,Great Deal for a great price. If you like ear cuffs and to mix up your earrings this is a great addition. I bought two of these because I love cuffs but am irresponsible about loosing them. It's a great set to fill out your ear if you like a lot of jewelry. I have gotten a lot of complements on all the earnings but it's the ability to mix and match if you have an uneven amount of piercings  that sets them apart.  They look good in any combination.
4.0,"More like 3.5 stars, really. Keeping in mind the price... I ordered my normal Grace Karin size (S) which are a tad big on me, and the dress I got is a totally different label which is super frustrating, but has happened on several other ""Grace Karin"" orders so I just expect it now. However, this dress is almost too small. It definitely seems pretty well made for the money, though I'm a bit nervous about the stitching at the zipper at the waist. It's quite snug, but no zipper resistance. This is since the fabric has no stretch, so moving in the dress causes some tension on the stitching in that area I think. It juuuuuust barely fits in the bust with no bra. I'm only a 34B so this is odd for a small. Yet it's simultaneously a bit baggy in the under bust area. If you're busty, this dress may not fit great. I feel like it's absolutely cut closer to Asian sizing. The size of the belt on the biggest notch is SMALLER than the  dress waist, so it's totally useless. What redeems it is: it's a true full circle skirt, it looks cute with and without a petticoat, the plaid is beautiful and bright, seams and hem are even, few loose threads, darting is even, inexpensive but doesn't look it. Would order again as this will make due for photoshoots, competition and styling for short wear (honestly, my intention for it anyway), but I will need a size up for regular wear due to the lack of stretch."
4.0,"These are dainty and beautiful.  The ones I got weren't especially bright,  but pretty just the same"
4.0,It‚Äôs a really pretty blazer with Good material but it run big I got a large but wish I took got a medium  . The seller doesn‚Äôt communicate at all with any questions and it took quite a while to get here with no tracking what so ever .
4.0,"Really attractive glasses, worth the money. I do wish the lenses were a little darker."
4.0,"Good product, good delivery."
4.0,I really like the dress. It's a little polyester type of material but it stretches.
4.0,Seems to be good quality - fits pretty tightly
4.0,This hoodie pairs with my leggings perfectly! I love the fit and the length. I also like that it's not as thick as traditional sweatshirts!
4.0,Bought for my son and he loved it !!!
4.0,Love the watch! Removing the pins to shorten the bracelet was difficult.
4.0,"Soft,cuddlely,Favorite"
4.0,I was truly surprised at how well this jacket kept me warm on days that I thought the weather might be too cold for it.
4.0,"Super soft material. Great color. It's longer than I thought. i'm  5'4""  180lbs XL comes just above my knees. The shoulders  and chest fit good, sleeves are roomy nice and long. But when zipped it's tight around the top of my thighs and rear.  I kind of wish the zipper started up higher.  I will mostly wear it open."
4.0,I ordered a 38mm band and Amazon shipped a 42mm. Returned and ordering again. The product looks good but is clearly not leather as advertised. Packaging is poor.
4.0,"I gave this as a gift, recipient loved it!"
4.0,Works great. Hard to get on with arthritic hands.
4.0,Great sunglasses ! Got it for my boyfriend for Valentines !!!<br />Comes in a really nice solid case. Would recommend to any guy !
4.0,"Love the thin socks. The colors and patterns are super fun. The ankles were a bit snug, but not uncomfortable. Great purchase."
4.0,"Very odd fitting blouse. Only one button, the belt is required to hold the blouse together. The odd design of the blouse makes you feel like you're putting it on wrong but after it's on and you're over the awkward feeling, it works."
4.0,Very pretty small and delicate
4.0,this sweater is quite thick and heavy. I was really surprised based on the price. It is warm and comfortable and can be worn with many different outfits.
4.0,Stylish flower shirt. Button down. Not feminine at all. Blue flowers with white background. Good for wearing to a party or social club with a pair of blue jeans. Fits true to size. Really good price.
4.0,"These glasses came in a nice hard case with cleaning cloth and neck rope.  They work as they are supposed to and I have no complaints.  I have a small chip in one prism, the quality is not super, but not cheap and flimsy either.  The included rope to hang around my neck slips off all the time, not a good design there."
4.0,"The outfit was very good looking, material was durable, but the top ran a bit too snug but I worked it!!"
4.0,"great value for $11, love the shades they look so cool plus they keep the sun out. I only gave 4 star because i received 3 bags for my 4 shades instead of 4. Still I would repurchase because they were still good enough products"
4.0,"Very attractive watch. I have bought several Seiko 5 with the desireable 4R36a automatic movement. This movement  keeps time well, not as accurate as a quartz movement, but totally acceptable at this price point. It offers hacking and hand winding features to get up and running quickly when you want to change watches based on mood or attire I rated 4 out of 5 stars, because no matter how many times times I manually hand wound, would not stay running, whether on the wrist or off. My other IDENTICAL 4R36a models after hand winding 25 times, would keep running off wrist for a good 12 hours. This one would run several minutes to about 2 hours off wrist. Hand winding another 25 times and wearing it after didn't yield different results. I decided to send it in under Amazon's Assurion 2 year warranty. They made it fairly painless to setup and get the watch sent in to repair, with prepaid shipping label. Just about a month to the day, I received it back, let it acclimate to room temp before doing anything with it. I hand wound it 35 times as it was not running when I opened the packaging. I then set the time and calendar. I also placed it on my wrist and headed out to take care of a couple of errands. I assumed it was running fine. I glanced at it and it was stopped for 42 minutes as checking my cell verified.  Amazon repair said they put it on a watch winder for at least 24 hrs. They then claimed it was observed for up to 48 hours and is working properly. This is quoted off the paperwork sent back with the watch, along with a pressure test reading. If the watch was not opened, the pressure test means nothing at this time. If the watch winder was the fix, I maintain the movement is defective and does NOT live up to Seiko's marketing of hacking and winding capabilities. As stated, I own several other Seiko 5 models that run well and keep running after first start 25-30 times handwound. None of the other 4R36a models have seen a watch winder at this time. I plan to send it back in to repair again, updating Asurion of what needs to be done. If it comes back the same a second time with same results, I will request a replacement SRP557 or my purchase price refunded."
4.0,The shirt is perfect. holds its shape and washes nicely
4.0,"My new favorite shoe. Very comfortable true to size and fashionable. Only issue some may not like, the silver ornaments on top do make a jingle while walking. In a busy traffic area, not noticeable.  If you work in an office environment,  it will be noticeable.  The shoe is very cute. I receive alot of positive compliments.  Extremely comfortable. Good for dress or casual wear."
4.0,"Trying to find a knee-high men's lace-up boot is next to impossible. I was looking for something similar to a 1930's jungle expedition boot. This is an affordable alternative. I am happy with the fit & finish. Whether or not it will last remains to be seen. The materials are man-made, but very comfortable. I am very happy so far."
4.0,"Working in healthcare, I need something simple, easy to read, and don't need to worry about the watch end flapping around, it's great!"
4.0,I like everything about this dress
4.0,My daughter loves the  padded kite wrist straps. She can now fly her kites in comfort and no stain on her wrist
4.0,The only problem was that the picture appears as a bright red and this dress is burgundy and not red.  Disappointed as I bought red jewelry and it is definitely not the red color in the picture...it is definitely dark burgundy.
4.0,"Only had this watch for a couple of days but so far, I really like it.<br /><br />It's tough, stealthy black (which I like) and most importantly for me, easy to read the time and other functions.<br /><br />I've got another Nixon watch which I've had for a couple of years without any issues (just replace battery). This watch supposedly has a battery with a 10-year life cycle. We'll see.<br /><br />The watch is supposed to be Nixon's answer to G-Shock. So far, I think I prefer the look of the Nixon Super Unit to G-Shock (I have several of those) as it's understated and stealthily looks make it look unique (and more expensive than it actually is).<br /><br />Time will tell (pun intended) if it holds out but so far so good. The only con for me is that I wish it was a little larger (it's not small by any means, just my own preference towards large watches).<br /><br />Oh, and it's super comfortable and light."
4.0,"I fortunately have not had to brave any snowstorms as yet (and hope none are ahead), but the construction of the boot and sole seem to be very sturdy and waterproof. There are grids in the thick sole which should help to prevent tripping.<br />Though some of the designs are attractive and colourful, these are not 'fashion boots.' The design is a bit tacky - fine for wearing in snow and rain, but not as a fashion accessory. The material would cause terrible sweating, were one to have them on all day.<br />I never wear boots indoors, and am concerned with sturdiness and protection from rain and snow, so they suit me well. They run a bit small."
4.0,4 stars because its as described but I dont like it on me. too lazy to return
4.0,"I love all of Zenergy Gems products. This one is definitely a beauty. It has very good energy, in addition to the quality product. However, I did not recieve the puffy selenite cleansing heart. It is promised in the description."
4.0,"I brought this dress for a cocktail party.  I received so many compliments.  I love the backless design and floral lace neckline.  The fabric is soft and comfortable. The dress looks very sexy, classy and fashionable. I ordered a size small (I am 5‚Äô6, 118lbs and 34D).  The dress was a little big on the top but not too noticeable.  Due to the design of the dress you can‚Äôt wear a bar. I used the Hollywood Silicone CoverUps which can be reused several times. They worked great with the dress."
4.0,I love it... It was just right in length and size. I would recommend this to anyone.
4.0,"Fun shirt! I would order a size or two larger than you normally wear though. While this stretches, it's still a little small."
4.0,Very comfy to walk on my concrete floor... though memory foam loses some give after a couple of hours of wear.
4.0,Super cute but too tight. Got something else but I‚Äôd buy it a size up if I needed it.
4.0,"The hats are very cute and quite easy to assemble until you get to the elastic chin strap.  The teeny, tiny, frayed elastic pieces are extremely difficult to attach with an average-sized adult hand.  Instead of the standard hole where you would just tie a knot on each end of the elastic, these have a cut-out requiring you to tie a knot around the paper cut out without damaging the hat."
4.0,"Super stylish and trendy knit beanie hat by BabeMall. This beanie arrived nicely packaged, and is made of a nice quality and stitching. The colors are nice and vivid. The design and the skulls on this beanie make its super cute to wear for girls or boys. I personally purchased this hat for myself, but it is one size, and it actually runs fairly small. I would more consider it to be a hat made for smaller children. It is nice and warm, and my 5 year old says this is now his new favorite hat. Great purchase, just keep in mind that this will fit a small child and I recommend you buy it for a child versus an adult.<br />***I received this product at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest review.***"
4.0,It's a wonderful bag. Holds a lot of items. The only problem I have with it is when it arrived it had a terrible odor and took a while for it to go away. Wasn't sure if it wasachine washable or not but it definitely needs something to get the smell off.
4.0,"A bit thinner than expected and the ties are a bit awkwardly placed, but I enjoy it nonetheless."
4.0,"Ok dress, not great material."
4.0,"nice color on stone, earrings mat ch well."
4.0,"Item is great, but fit is larger"
4.0,"I was amazed by the quality and finish of the beads. I do agree with some reviews on the engraving of the Dragon (there are some imperfections but lucky me color was not smudged and design of the dragon was okay!). It came in a nice package. The reason for my 4 stars is the size. When I looked up this product, it stated 7 inches around wrist but when I measured it it turned out to be 8 inches around wrist. I cannot gift this now due to the incorrect size. I would have returned it but I read that I would be responsible for paying shipping. Not worth the shipping cost for what I paid. Never the less its good quality and for the most part a good finish. If the company is willing to change the size for me at no additional cost, I will add another star. I would still recommend this product for anyone looking to buy....just make sure to read up on the size!"
4.0,"SUPER cute but baggy. If you are short, they‚Äôre gonna be awkwardly long on you. I roll mine to avoid looking like a child playing dress-up, and they‚Äôre actually pretty cute rolled up with the right shoes. They‚Äôre a keeper for me, but if you‚Äôre under 5‚Äô9‚Äù and going for the look on the model, you‚Äôre gonna be disappointed."
4.0,I have a small frame and chest (barely a 32 B) and the cups on this were still a little close together for me. This doesn't stop me from wearing the top and it's good quality material for what you pay for it. But I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with a broad figure or anyone above a C cup because of the very open side boob the cups create
4.0,this is a nice neutral style for under a sweater or light shrug.
4.0,Haven't used it yet but it looks like what i need.
4.0,Looks nice and worked well. Better than I expected.
4.0,Dope glasses. What more can I say. They have polarized lenses not just some dark shade  and the matte black is very clean.
4.0,"Great band, works great!"
4.0,This dress was very comfortable and what I wanted. The chest area for a little different then the picture and the underlining is a little odd. But it looks great and very comfortable.
4.0,I used these as decor for signs that I make.  they are nice additions
4.0,VERY &#34;Jackie O&#34;!
4.0,"So I love mostly everything about this dress. The material is nice, it fits well, the deep plunge on the dress is annoying but doable with a bralette underneath (see pic)... but the cheap elastic bands holding the buttons on the sleeves are just that -- cheap. One was broken on arrival and the other is about to break. I cant decide if I want to figure out a way to secure them myself or just return."
4.0,"The sizing is a little off, but my daughter loves them. They are big on her now but will eventually grow into them."
4.0,Its a good thing that is a pull cord to tighten up the hat its quite large. It will probably fit my daughter until she is 2! The little sun charm on the hat is made of Styrofoam of some kind. I have a small worry that as much as she likes to pull and chew on things that this might become a choke hazard. I'm thinking of removing it to be on the safe side.
4.0,"Very comfortable...but I hate there isn‚Äôt a cutout in the front. Other than that, they are great. I‚Äôve ordered twice."
4.0,It was loose but yet fiting and is super cute. Id buy again
4.0,"Very warm inside, I'm suprised on how thick it is because of the price. Only complaint is that it smelled really weird so I'd wash it as soon as you get it."
4.0,It is so much easier to give my car key to the shop when it is fixed now that I can just slip my other key ring off. Went from a several minute process to seconds...
4.0,Work socks
4.0,"I was using them every day. They didn‚Äôt hold up all too well to all the wear and tear but I also wasn‚Äôt as careful with them as I would with a 300 dollar set of sunglasses. So I‚Äôm probably partially to blame for that. For the price, I will likely buy another pair."
4.0,Very well made. No one would tell this is plated.
4.0,Stayed in place while running.
4.0,"Bought for my husband. I like how it looks, but wish I‚Äôd gone a size up from his normal jacket size. It‚Äôs a little small."
4.0,I love these earrings. Perfect lenght for me. I would've given 5 stars if the hooks could've closed
4.0,"This dress is cute, soft and comfortable. The print is adorable. Can be dressed up or down.  My only complaint would be the sleeves are a little long, but I have short arms so maybe not everyone‚Äôs problem."
4.0,Fabulous design
4.0,Cute shirt. Only problem with this shirt is the material is thin.
4.0,"Recieved them pretty quick. Seems like a decent headband, although a little tight at first, they do stretch out after awhile. They help to keep my hair back while working."
4.0,Great dress fits to size 5'6&#34; 130lbs .<br />Only fault is pattern not center.<br />I had desided to keep anyway.
4.0,"My 4 year old son would rate this a 5. It's definitely fun and well-made.<br />I give it a 4 for the following reasons.<br />1) The tongue is gross. Enough said.<br />2) It is quite bulky.<br />3) It takes some adult effort to put the masks together.<br />As I said, my son loves it, so if your kid (probably a bit older is better) is a Spider-man loving fan, go for it."
4.0,Cute hat but it's not Slouchy one bit.
4.0,"These pants are very comfortable, they are excellent, I think I will buy others."
4.0,I luv it but was a little disappointed in the colors. Theyy appeared to be much more colorful in pic. Most were a brown color. I ve seen many like the one I received but held out for a more original color look.
4.0,Not sure I like the fabric
4.0,"Some people mentioned thin fabric, but mine wasn't. The only real problem was the fabric snags easily. Don't wear bracelets, rings, purses, jackets that have snag potential. My bracelet caught in a couple places. I don't think it's too noticeable to anyone but me, but I took my bracelet off halfway through the reception after it snagged twice."
4.0,"For the price, this is cute and I really like it. It is fragile but can pass as dainty."
4.0,"Great price, prompt delivery.  Great product, except that my wife likes these leggings to keep warm, and these are a little thinner, lighter weight, than expected.  Still, great product for the price."
4.0,Bought for daughter for Halloween costume they do the job she likes them.
4.0,I like this chain although it took a long time to arrive. It's not a bad chain.
4.0,"If I were going to improve this watch, I would make the hands easier to see, day AND nighttime....otherwise no complaints whatsoever"
4.0,"Pros:<br />Cute, stretchy, modest<br />Cons:<br />‚Ä¢Different pattern and fit than on the model in the first picture<br />‚Ä¢The waist high up makes me look bigger on the hips<br />‚Ä¢Looks a little cheap<br />‚Ä¢Sleeves are an awkward length<br />‚Ä¢Hole in the pocket upon arrival"
4.0,"I actually ordered 3 of these, one for myself and the other 2 were presents for my sisters. We are all pleased with the bracelets, the sisters love silver. The charms should be a choice of 1,2,or more sisters, that would be nice to pick how many sisters you have. But we all are happy with our bracelets. Thank You!"
4.0,Cute! It's adjustable and looks nice. Haven't worn it out yet.
4.0,"I just received my gloves today. I put them on. ‚Ä¶wow, they're amazingly soft and warm, but not too warm, just right. The touch pad fingers work just as expected on my iPhone. I'm only giving 4 stars now because I want to see if they continue to hold up to my expectations. I will update my review later to 5 stars depending on how well they do. The Italian nappa leather experience is new to me and if it's as durable as they say it is, It will be the only leather I look for in the future. I hope I can find a nice jacket made of the same Italian nappa leather. Buy these Gloves, you will fall in love!"
4.0,"A little small, tight on the fit, however the material was gorgeous and length great for 5'9&#34;"
4.0,It fit real comfortable! 150 lbs size small fits great
4.0,"I like these boots.  They are comfortable and work well for slipping on and off for snowy days.  If these came with more arch support (they feel like Vans flat soled shoes) and steel toes, I would have given them a 5 star.  Good quality and great fit."
4.0,"These earrings are bigger than I thought they‚Äôd be. I got a lot of compliments; however, I lost one of my favorites... the white pair, the 2nd time wearing. The back was too lose and it didn‚Äôt stay on. This happened with several pairs!"
4.0,These are very comfortable. They fit well and give good support.
4.0,Found it strange that my ring the bigger size took a couple extra weeks to get. shipped from overseas but smaller was prime.
4.0,"You can count on Easy Spirit for a good quality shoe or boot and these fit the bill, but all of a sudden their size 9 is running small so I'm going to go up a half size and see they work.  Otherwise right now even with a thin sock they are feeling too snug."
4.0,FiT is good for me. Fabrics seem to be quality.
4.0,"I purchased this for my mother for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it.  It's a little long on her but it works.  They give a lot of extra beads so as the family expands, so can the necklace."
4.0,Great fit and support!
4.0,"I bought these after trying and giving up on the tubey anti-slip guards. The kind that are sleeves over the ends of the legs? Those. They only stopped the slipping to a marginal degree after a while, but the real issue was that they created a lot of friction against my ears/head as a result. It got quite painful. I preferred my glasses slipping constantly, it was that miserable!<br />Enter these little comma-shaped bois, which act more like anchors. They're much better at holding my glasses in place, and while there's still some friction if I move my head too much or adjust them too often, it's a lot more bearable and easier to correct.<br />It's rated four stars because it does take some figuring out how high/low to slip them! At first I had them too high against my ears, and they'd ""climb"" up the curve of my earlobes and come close to falling off; I have the left one set in a different spot from my right because it was worse there.<br />Once you figure out what works for you, though, this is a pretty solid solution. It's nice that I got so many additional pairs, too, in case something happens to these (which I don't anticipate, because these are solid silicone not liable to tear lol), but options are good."
4.0,I wanted to return it because I ordered 24 months size for my 8 months old baby and the pants were hard to put on because of how narrow they fit.<br />The stiff cotton is unforgiving. I love the quality and design and decided to keep it because of the cutest design top....not sure if we‚Äôll get to use it before the top doesn‚Äôt fit either!
4.0,Needed a black blouse for an interview but I didn‚Äôt want to spend too much $. This top worked well for me but I‚Äôm not crazy about the padded sleeves. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 130 pounds and I got a medium. It fit well but I think a small would have fit me a little better.
4.0,"really nice earrings, they were slightly smaller than i thought they'd be - but still nice. lovely colour"
4.0,For 35 bucks this is a good deal. I needed some bras that actually fit me and these did the trick. I purchased the lace front not all lace The bras seem to hold up pretty well for my 36DDs
4.0,"These are exactly how they were described.  I'm happy with them, they will be perfect for my needs."
4.0,"My daughter loves dark colors and straight, stylish cuts. But she is also wanting to incorporate a little bit more color into her wardrobe. This offered the perfect solution. She wears it with skirts, dress pants, and jeans, and has been able to use it for both dressy and casual occasions. The fit is as expected, and the style is good. It hangs well and works well. The color is good, the quality is good, and my daughter expects this to be a part of her wardrobe for a while."
4.0,"So...a few things about this.  I got it in the pink and the yellow.<br /><br />The fabric is stiff in both, not drapey and soft.  More like cheap curtains.<br /><br />The yellow one was OBVIOUSLY worn and returned, because it had stains ALL OVER IT.  BAD QUALITY CONTROL.<br /><br />Other than that, they look nice on me, despite the fact that I'm larger busted (I was worried because this type of dress can make us larger-busted, smaller-waisted ladies look pretty pudgy, and with the stiff fabric, it seemed like a certainty), so...all in all, for the price, I cannot complain.  It's a great dress for the price."
4.0,Cute on my 13 yr old daughter and fit was great. Material soft and washed up great
4.0,How come their cars are so expensive and their watches are affordable? Go figure? Looks nice no I didn't buy it but just thought I would pass that comment on.
4.0,Perfect Christmastime earrings.
4.0,Purchased for my son. He likes it. When wearing it he tries no to go &#34;over the line&#34; and get &#34;out of his element.&#34;.
4.0,Besides Lotus flower is good luck!
4.0,This bathing suit pretty good. The cup just needs to be a bit larger for the size I purchased but you couldn't tell when I have it on.
4.0,"This transaction was handled in a timely manner and the product was received in excellent condition but did not fit my pandora bracelet, but I will use it with something else."
4.0,My daughter is obsessed with baby shark at the moment but she‚Äôs also super girly and loves jewelry so this was perfect for her! The only issue was that the star came off the ring immediately right after we opened it
4.0,"I love this bikini, it‚Äôs definitely my new favorite! I am usually a size small but I got a medium after reading the comments. The bottoms fit great but the top was a bit loose. I had to take in a couple off the back and sew it, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I cut the strings of the bottoms too because I didn‚Äôt like how they looked. Besides having to make some minor adjustments, this swimsuit is great! Good quality and a cute color."
4.0,Nice hat. Good quality
4.0,I had to return because they did not fit like I thought. I have much wider feet after pregnancy. Being completely aware of this I ordered a size up. Definitely didn‚Äôt work out as planned .The boots were cute and well made they just didn‚Äôt fit my short wide feet.
4.0,NICE PURCHASE
4.0,"I bought this for a my little pony/sailor moon crossover cosplay. I'm going to be Pinkiepie :)<br /><br />Size ordered: Medium because a lot of the reviews said it ran small. the thing with this skirt is that you need to unzip it all the way and pull it up to your waist then zip it up and pull it down. The shirt does stretch but if you are bigger in the bust it might be an issue. As for the skirt if you are bigger than me in the hips/waist or taller than me then buy large because its a bit tight but not too bad, it zips up all the way. Its also really short so wear something under it if that's a problem.<br />Ordered: January 4th<br />Estimated delivery: February 16th<br />Arrived: January 21st<br /><br />My measurements (rough estimate of my measurements but i did do the math so you don't have to sit here trying to figure out measurements in CM)<br />Bust: 32 inches = 81.28 centimetres<br />Waist: 28 inches = 71.12 centimetres<br />Hips: 32 inches = 81.28 centimetres<br />Height: 5,1 (61 inches inches = 154.94 centimetres)"
4.0,Pretty good. Part that goes through hole is not too thick like some earrings of this type. Only disappointment is not as sparkly as I‚Äôd like.
4.0,Runs small and clings to your body
4.0,The hat is well made but not really my style. The bill is longer than I expected.
4.0,"Nice shirt, fair price, good fit--you get what you see."
4.0,"The socks were almost what I am looking for. They are stylish and don't look medical in public. It would be nice if an earth tone (brown) argyle were available. Also, I was really looking for a little less compression. But, these are comfortable enough that the extra compression is not an issue."
4.0,"The only issue I had was that it fit a little tighter than expected,  but the quality is great"
4.0,"This dress was extremely comfortable. The bottom portion is made with stiffer stretchy material and you have to be careful if it is a windy day. It does not lay as close to your body as the picture shows. However, it was true to size and I do enjoy wearing it."
4.0,Neck not as pretty on as in picture .But still pretty.Bunches around neckline.
4.0,"These are fun, but dont always stay on the glass"
4.0,"I got 2 adult sized masks for my son who‚Äôs 11. Kids masks are too small for him, so I got adult and they were huge. Even on my fluffy self they were uncomfortable large on my face. I ended up returning them, got a full refund with no issues, and am debating if we try kids size or not. Over all they were exactly as expected for a mask, and as they are pictured. My my kid was disappointed they were so large even with adjusting the ears."
4.0,"Average quality for $20 bathing suit. Bottoms fit great. Bought 2x, wear 1 or 2 at Torrid, 16/18 at Lane Bryant. Cups  built in bra are made of a odd starch like material so they squeak when the material is rubbed together. Adjusting the straps helps fix the odd shaped cups. Overall cute cheap bathing suit."
4.0,Were not that easy to put on the wig and not have the ends poking out.
4.0,Very good product for the price !!!!
4.0,"Everything else was fine except for these two pair of earings, id still say it was worth it.<br />The left two were only meant for the left ear due to how it was desinged. The right pair dont connect to their other parts. I wouldnt be able to use them due to these problems, yet the rest of the earings didnt seem to have any problems."
4.0,"I love the style of this ring. I have been looking for a chocolate ring for some time now, but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. The CZ's look like diamonds. There is one flaw but it isn't too noticeable. In one of the row's of CZ's, one of the stones does not look like a diamond. It has a pinkish brown tint to it. It looks as if a stone fell out and they replaced it. Also, that stone seems a bit loose to me. I will have to wait and see if it falls out. But like I said it really isn't noticeable unless you inspect it. It blends in because of the stripe pattern on the ring.<br /><br />I have already received three compliments and it has only been two days. My SIL says she will be ordering one for her BFF for Christmas. I hope this review helps you decide if this is the ring for you."
4.0,Very nice size and color
4.0,For the money is a lovely watch. But the tag inside the box said 238 Yen. I am not sure where they come up with a list price of $159.99 USD.<br /><br />Unless you are superbly skilled it is better to have a jeweller adjust the bracelet.<br /><br />Makes for a good gift. I'd buy a few.
4.0,"The reviews are accurate, they are quite thin. However, for the price, I didn‚Äôt mind sewing two together. My kindergartener says this is WAY more comfortable than his mask that has elastic sides. So far has helped up well in the wash too."
4.0,The product is too small in the body and arms. The seller is absolutely a joy to work with. They will take care of you. One of the best sellers out there today!
4.0,Good product. Size...fit and printing all good.
4.0,Beautiful but broke after a week of using it :(
4.0,Great Pair of Jeans. I will be ordering another pair.
4.0,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is for the silk ribbon used to tie the tail on. I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Halloween. Even with her being thin it was a little tricky to get the ribbon tight enough to stay secure due to the length of the ribbon and the weight of the tail. It would be much better if the ribbon wasn't silk and was 6-8 inches longer so you could really tighten it down because as soon as the tail is free hanging it pulls and loosens the already short ribbon. Not enough of a negative to not buy the tail though, I'm sure you could buy a large safety pin, hot glue it to the tail and you'd be fine."
4.0,Good Quality. Love the presentation! excellent gift.
4.0,"I bought a pair of Pepper Breakers last year at REI. Love them so when I saw these on Amazon I ordered them immediately. they are exactly like my old pair except they changed the lens color from grey to brown and the effect is not good. I'm very disappointed. However, I will commend the company for including a nice hard case with a cleaning cloth. That was a great surprise. Wish they would go back to the grey lens. All in all, a great experience, just liked the old lenses so much better."
4.0,It doesn't stay up.  I think I have a normal size head.  I sewed some ear loops on and a flexible nose piece and then it worked well.
4.0,"Fit as expected, true to size."
4.0,"Will be contacting seller to see about exchanging for a smaller size. This dress is very cute but I ordered my regular size and it fits a bit large. I like that it's a linen material, unlike a similar style dress I ordered from a different seller. The yellow color is very pretty, not harsh. The buttons are real buttons, not just for show.<br />Overall I think it could be very cute, hope to be able to exchange for a smaller size."
4.0,great value and reasonable quality for the price.
4.0,"I'm 24 weeks prego and bought this dress in olive with the hopes that it would solve all my fashion dilemmas. It will... but only when it fits properly. I'm 5'7&#34; and weigh roughly 155. I ordered a size large becasue I do like my clothes to fit loosely. However, sometimes too loose becomes a problem. The material of this dress is slinky and somewhat heavy (not in a bad way) but the fabric in general weights itself down so it natrually gets a little bigger the longer you wear it. I love this dress and have returned the large for a medium. I would recommend staying true to your size, even if you are expecting, the fabric is stretchy and comfy enough to give your bump room!"
4.0,"Got it for my 79-year old mom who is always cold.  Quality is nice, but my mother thinks the style is too &#34;Old-ladyish.&#34;  Any sexier-looking (to a 79-year old) warm flannel negligee-looking nightwear?"
4.0,Its nice if you want to cover your entire eyes
4.0,"Like the fit but the color is a little different from the one shown in the picture, not a big deal but I just like darker colors."
4.0,The price is reasonable item/beads much smaller that it appears it will be great to have larger beads so it doesn't like like a woman's
4.0,"I was sooooo excited for this top, but it‚Äôs not exactly the thin loose feminine fit like the photo made it appear. The shoulder width isn‚Äôt nearly as wide, and it‚Äôs a much thicker tshirt than I expected. It looks and feels more like a men‚Äôs tshirt. And it‚Äôs pretty long, which is fine since I typically tuck in the front anyway. It‚Äôs tough to explain, but it‚Äôs just not as flowy and relaxed as I had imagined. And the v-neck cut isn‚Äôt nearly as deep as I had hoped and expected. Also for some reason I thought those were buttons on the v-neck, but they‚Äôre holes haha. I got a medium, but if you‚Äôre between sizes, you could probably size down."
4.0,"It is just the extra room I need, when I need it. Works well and easy to use. Will definitely pick up the three hook extenders as well."
4.0,"It was thinner than I thought.  Will have to wear something under it, but it fits well."
4.0,I would like to see this made with a cotton fabric. The pajamas are cute and they will like them.
4.0,Good deal and very nice looking. If it's little bit bigger than I will rate it 5 star
4.0,"If you don't have a lot of hair or short hair, then these will work.  Anyone with a lot of hair, these hats are too small."
4.0,Very cute charm but the chain leaves a bit to be desired.
4.0,"Love this, Love this, Love this. The material is awesome not flimsy or cheap. Super sexy and definitely worth it"
4.0,Bought this for a Christmas gift.  The receiver loved it stating she can wear it with just about anything.
4.0,"Better than I expected for the price. Nice feel and seems like it would absorb plenty of water and keep a person warm. Sheds like crazy at first, but that probably goes away with washing. THank you!"
4.0,These pants are lightweight and seem to be made well. I only gave 4 stars because they are a little short in the crotch but otherwise fit well
4.0,My hips are bigger than my waist so this fit snug on my hips and perfect in the upper body area.  I may hem the length so it doesn't fall below my knee so far.
4.0,I ordered this in the largest size possible and love the results. It's super comfy and I like the side pockets alot:)
4.0,"For the most part these are okay.  Two pairs in the set are still holding up.  One out of the three pair that came it the package, separated from the metal piece.  They are great for the price but, I will probably not buy these again."
4.0,"This pendant is tiny. It would make a nice earring or bracelet charm. I just received it, and am almost certain all my silver chain necklaces are too thick for it. So, I will purchase a thinner chain. The pendant is very pretty and I look forward to wearing it. I appreciate the symbolism of the tree of life."
4.0,"I am normally a medium/large (my waist size is 33in, bust 34DDD) in dresses that expand but this dress was very oversized. I bought the large and it fit like and XL. Plus the dress it self was a lot longer than expected, it stopped below my knee. (I'm 5'4)<br />The fabric was worth the price and the elastic part was comfortable. I would recommend this dress overall as long as you get the correct size."
4.0,Smaller than I expected. I bought it to attach to the zipper on my purse but the clasp is too small. More appropriate for a charm bracelet.
4.0,"This bag is really cool. It has the right amount of rigidity so it can stand on it's own. It seems well constructed and of good quality leather.<br />Check me back in a couple of months, we'll see how it stands up."
4.0,"Second shirt like this. I really liked the gray one I bought first, so added this one as well"
4.0,These sun glasses are great for the price. I like that they are matte and polarized.  They are lightweight but a little stiff to open up. The big frame isn't too big and overwhelming.  I have a round face and it flatters it. All and all if you are looking for a cheap pair of polarized sunglasses these are a good pair to buy.
4.0,Very pretty and arrived much sooner than they estimated.
4.0,Style off dress is awesome
4.0,"Awesome sunglasses, seem to be indestructible, after dropping them on asphalt and pavement more than enough, no big scratches. And the frames are moldable metal so I can easily fix any warping. After a while the hinges became unbearably loose. Easy fix but I need to do it over and over again."
4.0,"Pretty and easy to use but don't really do a good job of blocking really bright sin, especially from the side since they aren't wrap around."
4.0,Kind of bummed that it didn't fit my nose. It would be good for a septum ring though it's not big enough to use for a hoop in the nose
4.0,"Fit was big for a 5'8"" teenage dancing daughter."
4.0,"Pretty good overall, especially for the price but the black coating on the money clip started chipping off right away"
4.0,"Birthday gift from my daughter to my other daughter, they both loved the fit and comfort.<br />My oldest was thinking about getting herself a pair after buying this for her sister."
4.0,"This is a nice braclet, I love the stones and the way it was made. The only issue i have with it is that sometimes the stones catch my arm air and it pulls a little bit on them, either than that, i love it."
4.0,I wish it was a little larger should be a large for a man.other wise it was ok.
4.0,Todo bien muy bonita y buen dice√±o
4.0,I have a pretty large head and this fit. Not the highest quality so there will be some stretch and maybe even a loose thread. Still a great look and I get tons of complaints on it when I go out.
4.0,Product is lovely and well made. Rings are a little too big but not so much that they are unwearable.
4.0,I loved this dress I may get another!
4.0,Good price... Made with good quality.
4.0,Nice little gloves.  They stay on fairly well.
4.0,The only thing that I don't like is that it looks like there are faded spots all over the dress.
4.0,"This sweatshirt is amazing! Super comfy and cozy! I wore it hiking and it was the perfect thing to keep me warm. I only give it four stars because after washing it I got a slight hole in the stitching on one of the sides, but that's an easy fix!"
4.0,"Pretty nice for the price. The engraving is somewhat lacking, but overall everything else looks great. Perfect for my sweet niece whose first love is definitely long in the nose!"
4.0,The product was expected and received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"The fabric feels nice and had some stretch. I have a larger bust, and despite getting larger size, the waist was right under my busy line instead of at waist or lower. Also, the golden yellow is more of a baby poop brown. So despite liking the feel, and length, the color and fit weren‚Äôt good for me."
4.0,Bought these for Halloween & just what I was looking for. Plus it fits my personality so I wear them anyways just because I can. Luv them & the price.
4.0,"Great product especially for the price, however a lot of the ankle bracelets were to big for me however I did find a few that fit and have done wonderful so far!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a bit uncomfortable but other than that I love the design
4.0,"Material feels amazing, so comfortable. I went with a 4/5 because some details like the extra fabric flopping about take away from the overall finished product. These are also pretty long, so for those of us that are vertically challenged, be prepared to drag them pant legs around. But I‚Äôm happy with this purchase. Would buy again."
4.0,The cap was small for my head otherwise the cap was okay. The removable plastic cover was uncomfortable for me to put on especially in public settings.
4.0,"Not actually baseball jacket fabric, iorned on stickers for logos, but it actually showed up, keeps me warm and had the labels, so I'm not complaining too much."
4.0,Items fit how they are advertised too fit .comes with a pair of the metal shock wasn't not expecting it and made of great similar material
4.0,"I bought these to see if i would like the black diamond look before investing the money in real black diamonds.  the little prongs that hold the cz in are a little wonky, but that's alright.  one time during cleaning them, one of the cz diamonds fell out.  Being handy with needle nose pliers and superglue, I effectively repaired it.  no noticeable repair marks, and good as new.  haven't had problems since.  for that they cost, i'd say it's alright, they get worn and put in and taken out very frequently.<br /><br />I have somewhat sensitive ears and have not had any irritation or allergy issues, I believe the steel is fine.<br /><br />They look good, I've gotten compliments on them before, so overall i'm happy with them.  I would say that this has definitely motivated me to spend a little more money on better quality earrings though."
4.0,I like the gold color. Wished they were a little larger for my particular craft. They easily go through the hole in the bead.Nice
4.0,"It feels nice, the tie is a little weird because it doesn't provide extra material to tie, you definitley do not want to wear it untied."
4.0,I switched from a coach wallet to start an envelope system. Worked well for my envelope system. I wish it had a coin space and the material on the wallet is cheaper quality than I would like but it worked fine for what its use was intended. The calculator was a nice bonus. Ulitmately I switched back to my higher quality wallet.
4.0,"These fit as shown in the picture.  On me they were a touch tight through the hips, but on a less curvy figure they will be very flattering."
4.0,For less than $10 this hat is perfect for college parties and mixers!
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet,seems to be good quality, lovely design"
4.0,I was nervous that the color would be different than the listing but it was not. It‚Äôs a really nice cap. I have 4 stars because it‚Äôs really stiff. I wanted something softer. But if sturdy and stiff is what you want this is a five star cap.
4.0,I ordered this bc honestly I wanted a new LBD!! So comfortable and the lining of the material makes it an easy base layer for this cold front that finally hit. Fits perfect!!! My new closet fave hands down!!! More than happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Good ring for the price.  Got this as a stand in ring wore it for almost 2 months still looks good, no green finger."
4.0,"I bought this for work, church and the usual places I need something a bit more than casual.  I like the comfortable fabric (and I can be very picky about softness/itchiness!).  I can wear it as is but when I need to dress it up I use a wide black belt and a pretty scarf and I'm set to go out.  I'd buy it again."
4.0,Very comfortable lens is a little lighter and more brown tint then red tint
4.0,"Great, cheap band. I really only use this while exercising or doing yard work. It's been great for what it is. I've seen many reviews saying the color rubs off. I wouldn't be surprised if it does, but I haven't personally seen that issue. I purchased this expecting it to just be satisfactory, not great. It's worked perfectly fine for me, but I only wear it a few hours a week. I found a far nicer band for a similar price with Clockwork Synergy. I prefer that band over this quite a bit, but I still wear this for physical activity mostly. The Clockwork Synergy band sees some casual use as well.[[ASIN:B01DUNLM0U Clockwork Synergy¬Æ - Silicone Watch Bands for Apple Watch (42mm Grey Bands / Black Hardware)]]"
4.0,"I liked the blouse but as some of the reviews indicated, it ran small. I've returned and will likely reorder in a bigger size."
4.0,"This shirt fits as expected and looks good. The polyester/spandex blend makes for a breathable fabric that works well for hot activities.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the feel of the fabric. Many polyesters blends that I've worn are very soft and a bit stretchy. This polyester is not stretchy at all, and it is a bit rough and scratchy.<br /><br />Shirt is good for the price point it is at!"
4.0,fades quickly although never dried! Loved it in the beginning though.
4.0,"I received a medium size pair of Forcool 80% Merino Wool socks for review and I am surprised that they are kind of small.  I love wool, especially merino wool because during the winter wool socks are about the only socks that keep my feet warm.  I haven't washed these yet and am thinking I should wash them by hand with Woolite and then lay them out to dry because if they are small now they will be tiny if I put them in the dryer."
4.0,Asian fit.  I wear a large got the XXL.  FITS PERFECT AND COMFORTABLE
4.0,"Most of the earrings I own are cubic zirconia in the 5mm-6mm range. These are twice the diameter but they still work well. A &#34;gemstone&#34; that large would be garish but these look good. I think they'd be more attractive if they were 1mm-2mm smaller but 10mm works OK. I wouldn't go larger.<br /><br />The quality of the earrings seems fine. The stud is sturdy and easy to insert and the earnut fits snugly. I even wore them in the shower and in bed with no loosening.<br /><br />I do question the original retail price. No way these would ever sell for 70 bucks! I'd even hesitate spending 20 bucks on them. But, at less than 10 bucks, they're a good purchase."
4.0,Wish I ordered a size smaller
4.0,I like the belts look and style.  I found it had an unpleasant odor though.  It must be the materials used to make it.  Anyway I sprinkled  with essential oils and now it's fine!
4.0,"Sexy night gown with robe, the downside Its a bit loose at the breast area.. overall its great"
4.0,"Good quality, very cute. But these are very shallow. Just a warning."
4.0,The mask is lovely. My only suggestion is to purchase it only if you have a small face.
4.0,"Was a bit disappointed that the Velcro on the strap started to pull away from the strap after a few weeks of wear.  Other than that, it's a great shoe for my daughter's wide feet."
4.0,The fit is good even after washing. It must work well as I've remained covid negative.
4.0,"Seem like nice gloves. Hasn't snowed yet so I don't know how they will work and hold up. They do run a bit big but they fit ok and will last at least another year for the kids. They are very stiff but I assume that most snow gloves would be the same. Colors are good. But the purple is kind of a muted purple. I'd like it better if it was more vibrant. We also got the green, blue, and pink. They are more vibrant."
4.0,"The reviews on sizing were correct. They run small. I went up a full size. The workmanship isn't as good as I had hoped, but the cost was very low. They don't last very long as I wear them all day in the winter. The soles crack at the bend. However, with a thick pair of socks, they function well inside  and the price is very low. Even compared to the big box chains!"
4.0,It‚Äôs cute and I enjoy wearing- it‚Äôs not quality but fun.
4.0,"No issues, pleased with purchase."
4.0,Was very pleased with the quality and delivery
4.0,Nice material and seems to be made well. Better quality than expected for the price. Very comfortable to lounge around in but not so great in my case for running and higher impact sports.
4.0,Love these<br />Have to stretch waist sometimes to make them comfortable for sleep
4.0,Bought a medium as I usually do with sweatshirts.  I am a small in shirts but I like the extra room in a sweatshirt so that it isn't riding up all the time.  Seems like the imaging will last a while.  Decent product.
4.0,"Nice. The picture perfectly shows the product. I am wearing the bracelet now. Moves freely on the arm. Does not catch on the arm as it slides. I recommend.<br />10/24/17. Bracelet continues to wear well, except the picture of the purple ribbon has now peeled off and tore in areas. What I did was to completely remove the ribbon decal since it was useless anyway, and I painted the area with purple nail polish. I applied several coats and am really more happier with the result than I was with the original decal. Still very happy."
4.0,These will do...not thick but quite adequate.
4.0,Nice sleeve and compression I was looking for and washes up well and the price is right!
4.0,"They do a good job on Silver, Gold,  &  Brass !!! Jerry J."
4.0,"My daughter got this for her stepdad. Is worth the price, the letter is nice and small as he doesn‚Äôt like a lot of chains on his keys or in his pockets. I do wish the chain the letter was one was little smaller, but we‚Äôd buy again."
4.0,"Beautiful top, unfortunately it did not fit over my breasts.  Gave it to a friend, though, and she likes it."
4.0,Very nice sturdy Keychain.
4.0,"Husband loves them & they actually look nice. It's easier to get him to wear these than jeans to an event, so I'm pacified."
4.0,I haven't used them yet I'm waiting for it to snow in Connecticut
4.0,"The colors were more neon than expected, and some fit a bit small."
4.0,"Overall a good watch.  Exceptional looks at a great price.  Unfortunately, the dial is not grey but rather a dirty beige color.  That‚Äôs not enough for me to send back.  I have worn it every day for a week and it has kept time to within 20 to 30 seconds.  Definitely would recommend this watch."
4.0,"Overall they're decent tank tops but they're definitely not what I'd call compression. Rather, they're more form fitting, so they really won't work for the reason I bought them. I'll keep them because I like the look, but I'm a bit disappointed."
4.0,Yes it fits good
4.0,"First off may I say these boots are good for their price and the fact that they're not leather. Up close they do not look like leather, but I'm not all that concerned with that. I like the material overall and its rugged look. The toe has some support to it, which is nice. They look like they'll hold their shape unlike some pleather boots. I have relatively slim legs, so it's nice that the calf part of the boot isn't huge. It accommodates my athletic calves with skinny jeans on very well. If you have very built legs these may not be the boots for you. I also wouldn't expect them to be waterproof or good work boots. Still they're good for what I have in mind for them, and they're super cute. I'd say they run average to small in size. I generally wear a 7 or 7.5, and the 7.5 in these fit me snug in a good way."
4.0,"These shoes are just amazing. My daughter absolutely loved them. They are adorable and when they squeak my daughter gets so excited.They encouraged her to walk. The soles are rubber but not too smooth that they don't provide any grip.. they actually worked great that way. They are a good quality and were still in excellent shape by the time she outgrew them. Even the velcro was perfect in-spite of my daughter playing with it all the time.<br />Drawbacks: They took a while to ship. Almost 2 weeks.<br /> I bought the smallest size they had and they still ran big, but of course, one growth spurt later (which usually happens overnight) they fit well. They also run wide so if your baby has real narrow feet, the right size  would be big.<br />The verdict: Good purchase. I would recommend these."
4.0,"I like the fabric. And the zipper on the front is unique. Comfortable fit,  but I would reccomend being careful with zipper as when you zip it down a<br />Little it can move down farther by itself.<br />Other than that, it‚Äôs great!"
4.0,Super cute! The skirt could be bigger or made with more expensive tulle.
4.0,Super cute but it's a little larger than expected.... my baby is the size of the baby in the picture and it's took big for her
4.0,A well made belt at a very reasonable price.  The tension is just right.
4.0,"This is a such a cool hat! The material breathes nicely, never gets hot under it. The top of the cap is a little high for me, but if you got that Peyton Manning head thing going on...this is the hat for you."
4.0,"Fits perfect and works well, the hair flips"
4.0,"This shirt runs extremely small....  I'm 5'3&#34; 110 lbs (always wear a small) I ordered a large based on other reviews and I'm glad I did. The large fits very comfortably. This top will be great for leggings and boots.It comes down below my backside. One thing about it is the side with the buttons does not look like the picture. it hangs the same all the way around, and the buttons seem to be an afterthought. I did take a safety pin to the button area to make it look like the shirt- worked out well. The shirt is very soft and i would get another one."
4.0,"Very warm, not much stretch but gets the job done."
4.0,Nice and holds everything I need.  Have found that the zipper has started having some issues sticking a bit at the bottom after using it for a while. But over all good.
4.0,"I like this, I like it a lot.  It is thick and lovely and warm.  The dual pockets are really good.  I just knock one star off for two reasons: firstly, it has no draw-string around the hood.  With the hood down it would be nice to pull the neck a bit tighter to keep out the wind on a cool evening.  Secondly, it could be a few inches longer.  I can just sit cross-legged and it covers me, but it is a bit of a stretch.  That little bit of extra length and a draw-string would make it perfect."
4.0,These looked really good and were very durable. They don't have pre-punched holes for the string/bobby pins so that was a little annoying but it wasn't terribly difficult to do ourselves.
4.0,"Very stylish and comfortable! I like that they are unusual but still appropriate for all occasions,"
4.0,"So I actually love the dress itself. It fits perfect, very flattering, the flow and length is great but it‚Äôs (the skirt part) see through. I‚Äôm so sad! At least the coral color is anyway. I‚Äôm undecided if I‚Äôm going to try to get some kind of slip for it... I mean do they even still make those?! Or return it..? Boo"
4.0,Coloration is weak. Better to have been just one color.
4.0,"Well made, fits as expected. Im a Dempsey fan."
4.0,Actually I think these socks are a great deal for the money.  I like the stretchy fabric and the colors.  They are fairly soft - not the softest but not rough either.  Not really thin - a nice level of thickness without being too thick.  I don't care for socks that are really thick myself - these are the perfect level of thickness for me.  I gave it a 4 start rating simply because the inside of the socks have a lot of loose threads and I can see this potentially being a problem for anyone who doesn't keep their toenails nice and tidy.  The other socks I wear look pretty much the same on the inside as they do on the outside whereas these do not.  Having said that it would not keep me from purchasing them again - in fact I think I will purchase another package because it is such a good value to get 5 pairs of socks for only $8.99.  They have a lot of pretty patterns and you can't beat the price.  Other than the strings on the inside I think these are great!
4.0,"Beautiful piece. slightly less elegant than the picture, but nice all the same."
4.0,This dress fit a little strangely in the bust area.  It kind of squished my boobs and made them look flat and boxy.  I ended up returning it.  Otherwise fit well and decent fabric.
4.0,It‚Äôs finally
4.0,Cute shoe but I would say they run small my daughter wears a 3 but got a 4 and they fit perfect
4.0,"They are a really light, and great color pair of plugs. They are a little small imo for a 00 but they fit nicely anyway just wish the flare was a little bigger and that there were just a tinny bit longer. Over all I think they are a wonderful pair of plugs and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for some great organics."
4.0,This was beautiful as a summer dress. It was airy and nice and fit quite comfortably.
4.0,"My son loves Batman.  I couldn't find a wallet with just Batman on it, at least with a picture that wasn't scary or hokey.  He likes Superman too, so this was a good compromise.  It seems to hold up well, was a reasonable price and received ahead of schedule."
4.0,I loved everything about it except it is very thin. You can see thru the shirt a little bit! Otherwise I would have no problem rating it  ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
4.0,Eveything great about them but very hard to fasten once you gen in yor ears
4.0,"So far so good, the belt appears to be of good quality, and was relatively easy to shorten to the appropriate length - while a tool is indeed provided to punch a hole to facilitate shortening, I found the provided tool to be too dull to successfully do the job - it barely marked the leather even after hit with a hammer a few times.  Luckily for me, I have a multi-sized hand held leather punch that took care of it in no time."
4.0,"When I saw a watch this cheap I thought I was going to get a crappy product. I was so wrong. This watch is great and stylish, can be either dressed up for a formal wear or dressed down for a more casual look. I'm a 5'3&#34; guy and only weigh about 130, so I'm always worried about how things fit, but this watch fits great on my wrist. My friends think I spent over $50 for this watch, but they don't know. The leather strap does feel a bit plastic like out of the box, but after wearing it for an hour or so the plastic feel goes away, must be a fresh out the box thing. Would recommend."
4.0,"I'm rating this thing high cuz it's so cute after the reviews n sizd chart went with XL.. I'm 5'2 145 lbs 36D btw...have to say again sooo cute..now the bottoms I had to take to my friend to adjust and make smaller because it's a bit large the cups are somewhat small only if they were a cup bigger they'd be perfect..the top doesn't provide much support so it's not the ideal bathing suit for heavy chested girls to be too active in, no running jumping etc..the straps I had to get cut and adjusted for some more support because the black part is made of flimsy material though it looks good..the blue is gorgeous n not cheap looking like the black part. Cute suit wish i could order the top n bottom separately.. Sigh!"
4.0,"Only needed it for one item, returned product."
4.0,"We bought baby sweatbands for our son who was selected to be in a baby diaper derby (crawling race). They look awesome, and he didn't mind having them on at all. My only complaint is that they're not extremely well made - after 2 washes, they're starting to unravel. But they're made for fun anyway, so they definitely fit the purpose we needed them for!"
4.0,"For the price, it‚Äôs good to have a pair of cheap glasses around. You can feel that these aren‚Äôt quality glasses, but I‚Äôm happy with the price and the look. I‚Äôd buy again to have them on the boat etc."
4.0,"I bought these for myself initially, but ended up giving them to my mother. Apparently my arms are too skinny, they just look pitiful on my arms. The lace just sort of shrivels up at my wrist and looks really ugly, like they got stretched out and are baggy now. I had my mom try them on and they looked great on her. They aren't the length of any adult's elbow however. The gloves are short and sit a few inches below the elbow. They seem to be made of good quality and they look cute on &#34;normal&#34; sized arms which is why I gave them four stars."
4.0,Nice but not the strongest frames in the world. I'm using these as a part of costume. Don't think they'd last very long as &#34;real&#34; sunglasses.
4.0,Make sure I wash them in cold water because they will shrink.
4.0,"They run kind of small. Bought them for my 8yo and they won't fit long. They should be sold as ""toddler"" not children's."
4.0,"They are a nice belt, what I really like is how they adjust to your waist. I like them enough I bought three"
4.0,"Use these under my scrubs in the colder months. I‚Äôm normally a large but went up to a 2xl after reading reviews. Glad I sized up, they fit perfectly."
4.0,It fit a little smaller than I thought it would but my son has extremely narrow feet so that was an advantage.
4.0,"This is a nice simple necklace and arrived just as pictured.  My only issue, and this is subjective and specific to my lettering, is that from a distance the letter ""T"" charm looks very much like a religious cross which was not what I wanted.  Again the product is exactly as pictured and wouldn't affect any other letter charm.  Indeed some customers may enjoy the fact it could be mistaken for a cross.  Unfortunately for me it's not quite the look I had hoped for."
4.0,Vary nice. Well made
4.0,A little tight. But maybe I‚Äôve put on a few pounds
4.0,I love these leggings. Very soft and comfortable. I wish they were not so expensive so that I could buy them in every color. I had to take 1 star off for their high price - $40 per pair is just too much.
4.0,"Really nice watch for someone looking to add to their collection on the cheap. It has a great look to it with the gold roman numerals and white face. The date window is classic, and something you don't usually find on watches in this category. It's lightweight which can be a plus or minus depending on your school of thought. It has pins for reshaping the band to your wrist and with a proper adjustment it looks and feels great. No complaints of wearability. This looks like a much more expensive watch than it is. Great deal!<br /><br />I received this watch in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"Beautiful watch. Good quality. I wear it daily and it even goes well with date night outfits too.<br />I‚Äôm new to purchasing watches online, so if you are in the same boat, make sure you measure your wrist...I don‚Äôt think I have super tiny wrists but the band is a little big on me."
4.0,I purchased this for my husband and he really liked the look and feel of the watch. The compass is a little in the way however it does not impact the usability of the watch. Overall he is really happy with the watch and enjoys using it on a daily basis at work versus his stainless steel watch.
4.0,"It‚Äôs as expected, I haven‚Äôt had the chance to wear it yet. Lovely dress, perfect for spring"
4.0,"Haven't used that yet. But, looks good."
4.0,I ordered a small for my kiddo. It fits me... I am normally a medium/large. This was a perfect fit for me. I‚Äôm not complaining cause it‚Äôs super cute... but definitely order smaller size
4.0,Fits the 7plus well. holds the item tightly. I like that you can rotate the phone
4.0,Nice dress but too big
4.0,Should buy this item a size up then what you wear. Nice material.
4.0,"The material for these pjs is soft and comfy. The pants are a bit large but the top is a little on the small side. The pants have an belt through the wide elastic band waist that seems to serve no purpose. The bottoms will work well for tall individuals as they are pretty long. These probably won't be your favorite pair of pjs by high fashion expectations, but they will be something comfy to wear around the house."
4.0,Nice style and fabric but I have to agree that the color is not as represented.
4.0,Very sweet! Needed it for a Christmas dance recital and it was classic. Only 4 stars because the ribbon faded after a few washes.
4.0,Very nice. My son really likes it but it was missing the battery cover.
4.0,Compression is really good and they're very comfortable but the zipper doesn't stay up well and they're too long (petite sizes needed)
4.0,I like the design and style.
4.0,"These are certainly as advertised.  I would almost say too flexible.  These were purchased for my 8 year old to play soccer with.  They do fit well, but my son doesn't like them because they don't hug his face.  He can pull them out to the sides almost straight.  Added a head strap to secure them and he is happy now."
4.0,"I will have to post a pic later - I was really hesitant to buy these pants, since there had been no previous reviews. They arrived the other day in the mail and I like them! They are a little sheer, but nothing crazy.<br /><br />I typically wear a size 10 or 12 in pants, and I ordered a size Large. It fits, but I wish I would have sized up, as they are a little more fitted than I would like.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad purchase!"
4.0,"This is a very beautiful, Was a big hit at my xmas party! It is slightly shorter than I expected, i used it with black leggings and looks great. I read other reviews so I knew to order a larger size than normally would. It then fit as I expected it to. It was a perfect fit. I ordered M and normally wear XS."
4.0,"Love this necklace.  Have not taken it off since I got it.  Only thing is it is beginning to darken so need to clean it to see if it brightens it again, but love it."
4.0,"After reading reviews, I expected this dress to be big in the chest/shoulders/arms . But it was a great price, so I ordered it in a large knowing it would need tailoring. My daughter absolutely loved it! She plans on wearing it to her music banquet. The top part of the dress was ill-fitting, as most reviews advised. The waist fits perfectly, and we will take it to our seamstress to have the skirt length shortened up a bit and have the top taken up to fit her. The material is satin-like and thick enough that you can‚Äôt see through it. From the reviews, I expected the belt to be cheap-looking, and it was! So, toss the belt and add a belt to your liking! Over-all, I‚Äôm very pleased with this dress and glad I ordered it!  (I deducted 1 star for the cheap belt and out-of-proportion fit in the top part of dress.)"
4.0,The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about this product is the dress was really thin. But it is cute when you put something underneath it.
4.0,These face masks have the piece of fabric that goes over the chin which is super helpful for keeping it in place. The fabric is thick and feels durable while still being breathable. The fit is unfortunately inconsistent because the masks are all slightly different in size.
4.0,"I love the look, but it‚Äôs a little long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and have to wear heels to prevent this from dragging on the ground."
4.0,"I should start by saying my calves are NOT big calves. As you can see in the photo, the sock is clearly accommodating for wide calves. I have a surgically repaired ankle that left me with long term mobility issues  arising out of a shortened Achilles and nerve damage. This is exacerbated immensely by altitude - flying and mountains. I ordered these to try for flying and traveling to high altitude cities. I mention this because the nerve condition is insidious: compression socks can feel like an anaconda wrapped around my foot in particular. So! The open toe is very important to me and the ability to have compression, but still not so tight I can‚Äôt stand to keep it on. This is why I tried a sock that really is a little big.<br /><br />Now, that all said: for someone truly in need of a wide calf, they will likely get more compression than I am and love it. I‚Äôm not complaining! The band at the foot end is setting off the sensation of too tight, but it‚Äôs bearable. On a healthy foot/leg, I‚Äôd imagine this would feel even better. My ONLY complaint is in the second photo: the top stretched a bit, now I‚Äôm pulling them up. All in all, 7/10."
4.0,My son really likes these boxers. We purchased them for Christmas. They are soft and sizing was as described.
4.0,"I can't believe how much I like this. I plan to buy one in blue when I can. The chain is awesome but too long for me. Its not perfect, my tear drop is chipped and am missing a stone but its not noticeable at all. The size surprised me. Its bigger than I thought. I love it."
4.0,Love it !! I Wear it all-day it's so comfortable
4.0,Was a gift. I liked the size.
4.0,"Was my Christmas dress this year and I'm so happy I got it! Got lots of compliments! Styled it by wearing a lace tank underneath, leaving the top half unbuttoned, scrunched up sleeves, the belt it came with, thigh high boots and lace  top thigh high boot socks. Material is just ok but not bad. The fit was flattering and short but not too short for my 5'2"" frame. Materiel isnt very thick but it kept me warm and comfortable in the winter weather."
4.0,"Shoes seem to fit as expected, bought them a little big for room to grow. Decent shoe for fast growing feet."
4.0,"Overall I like this belt but I'll have to see how it holds up to say for sure.  If it remains looking the same then I think the comfort and flexibility makes it a keeper (though I'd like it to be about $25 cheaper).  I bought it for an upcoming trip since it seems like it would work well for travel, hiking and still be passable in some (business casual) dining occasions.<br />Pros:<br />  *  slightly stretchy makes it easier to adjust and adds comfort<br />  * no problems being between sizes<br />  * no metal makes airports easier<br />  * magnetic buckle is cool and simple to use<br />Cons:<br />  * the price is high for what it is; personally I think ~$30 is more in line for the materials<br />  * it's too darn wide.  This hasn't been a problem in most of my pants but it can be annoying to thread<br />  * the velcro &#34;keeper&#34; for the excess is a nice idea but often slips off when threading through loops.  If the belt were slimmer this would be less problematic.<br /><br />I haven't had any problems with the buckle getting scratched and it's supposed to be carbon so in theory should be resilient but others have mentioned problems.  I guess we'll see over time."
4.0,Great work pants! So hard to find professional high waisted pants.. these fit great. Crotch hangs a little low but nothing too bad
4.0,"First, this gown is warm and made of good flannel.  Two things however to protect yourself, however, first, the gown shrinks a good half size when washed, maybe more, so order big, and second, these sleeves are only slightly longer than 3/4 sleeves, luckily there is a loose elastic band on the &#34;wrist&#34; or lower arm as it were, and it is not binding so the sleeves don't bother too much, still it would be nice if the sleeves came to the wrist."
4.0,Loved this! It looks so amazing and fits great! It took a while to get it but other than that I loved it and wud recommend it!
4.0,The shirt was cute but made me look like I was pregnant so I returned it.
4.0,Product is great but really intended for smaller breasts. I am a 38D and one boob smaller than the other so I needed some lift on just one side but these were not made for a full sized bust. But great product!
4.0,"Cute and inexpensive, fun for special occasions. Seem fairly sturdy, and have good tint. Obviously not Ray Bans, but an affordable treat! I actually slightly prefer the &#34;USA&#34; American Flag Sunglasses (Stars and Stripes) sold here on Amazon. Check 'em out, too, and you decide!"
4.0,"Dress is just as pictured and seems to be good quality. It is rather long (with quite a long &#34;slit&#34; in it), so I'm hoping my little (short for her age) gal won't have an issue with that. Looks like she will be able to get lots of play times out of this durable dress."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c002af943d572ef8e94b56d78bb3967f]] I see reviews say that it was small, but my hand is not so big so I thought it could fit me, but even my hand and fingers could barley fit this thing. Be careful with this, it could break if you're not gentle and cautious with it."
4.0,Too small to look nice. Great fabric and color.
4.0,"It's comfy and soft and cute!  However, I think the sizing is off. It ended up being too big and long for me. I would still wear it though and just pair it with yoga pants and boots."
4.0,The goggles fit very well and they don't fog up when I ride my motorcycle.
4.0,"Nice simple design; as advertised, a soft light cream color; perfect size - noticeable but elegant. I've seen no blemishes. I have worn it constantly since it arrived. It probably deserves 5 stars, but I it is a button setting and I prefer round. I would add a 1/2 star more if I could. It also comes with an 18&#34; chain and I prefer 22&#34;."
4.0,Thought it was bigger. But all around nice looking.
4.0,My mom loves it. It looks good on her. When it comes to the quality we just need to wait and see.
4.0,"I must have really long arms, it's so hard to find sweaters with sleeves that are long enough. The fabric wasn't as soft as I expected based on other reviews. Also, since I have just had a baby the size was a little small based on what I expected (the large fits more like a medium) so if you have a little more in the middle take that into consideration. It's also more like a spring/fall sweater even in CA it's not warm enough in the winter. With all of that said, I still like the sweater and wear it often with either a pencil skirt or jeans."
4.0,"Very comfortable I'll order one size smaller so if your 36B go 34 B I think. But they are very soft but, handwash them because it not washable safe"
4.0,"It‚Äôs okay. Kind of a ‚Äúget what you pay for,‚Äù mask. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a fortune on a mask for my 8 year old for his school Halloween parade so this fit the bill. The straw hair, as other reviews said, is really cheap, shiny orange plastic. But my son didn‚Äôt care! He was happy and so was my wallet so it‚Äôs a win."
4.0,This dress is beautiful although a little big I should of ordered a size smaller it's super pretty but not very flattering
4.0,Loved the fabric and length of these. It can be really hard to find ones that‚Äôs fit as a tall girl. The waist is a littttttle tighter than I would prefer but still a great product.
4.0,"I read all the reviews and decided to buy a size smaller than I otherwise would have. I normall wear a medium size t-shrt and since all the reviewers said to buy one size smaller I bought a small. The shirt doesnt fit. Its fine if you arent moving, but as soon as I do anything the tight elastic on the bottom rides up my belly and the elastic on the wrist gets pulled down my arms. Ive cut the shirt and tried to stretch it out (I live abroad and cant return it) and it still is uncomfortable. Be cautious on sizing.<br /><br />But that is a complaint on the comments, not the shirt. Had I bought a medium, I would have been very happy. Its a high quality sweat shirt."
4.0,"They came in a very oversized amazon bag not great for the size of the product, i had to fish them out of the trash"
4.0,The charms are small so you have to be careful. One of the small pictures fell off so I had to glue it back on. (the small picture charm has two sides with a picture on each side.)
4.0,"Love this case. Would give it 5 stars if you could just fit a couple accessories in better. It would be nice if the google claw could fit as well as the charger. All in all, good product."
4.0,The becoming cats eye sunglasses are working well for me.  I appreciate that the sunglasses fit well over my prescription  eyeglasses.  I  only wish they were somewhat darker.
4.0,"In general I love it. Only complaint is grip on the cards is a little looser than I would prefer, and it sometimes doesn't fan them out completely. But usually it works just fine, and for the price I'm happy with it."
4.0,Bottoms fit per size.  Top is a bit snug.
4.0,"Super comfy & soft! I wash & hang dry (it dries quickly.) Only thing I did not like is the length.  The photo makes it look floor length.  It is not, it has kind of a mermaid style going good on in front.  Still very nice & comfortable."
4.0,"I would love to give it a 5 star rating.  The only problem is it runs small. It is clinging.  I am 5' 3&#34; tall, about 160 lbs. I am solid. I wear 8 to 10 panta and a 10 to 12 dress.  I am a 36 DD. the large should have fit. My husband loved the dress on me, he dared me to wear it to church. I did.  A man from church at the end came up to me shook my hand and said thank you.  Then proceeded to walk away.  I guess he liked it also."
4.0,"Fun and definitely a great buy as party favors. I read a lot of reviews about the lenses being scratched and popping out but I had no problems with the ones I received. Kids loved them but keep in mind, they are bigger size glasses (more so adult size)."
4.0,Cute ...stylish and warm
4.0,I bought 3 to give as gifts and they all arrived in very good condition. Nicely packaged in a gift box. The only thing I don't love is the chain length but for the price they are adorable
4.0,Fits weird in some places...not high quality but like the colors..will probably take this to my seamstress to hem in correct areas.. I wouldn't do this if I didn't love the colors.
4.0,"Cute top! It‚Äôs a different material than expected kind of polyester i think, and a little cheap looking but cute. I like that it‚Äôs long."
4.0,"Not a bad novelty item, my friends said I have to have a captains hat for my boat"
4.0,"Boot is good quality and fits well. I really like the boot, it is very good looking. My only complaint is that the boot is not red like in the picture. I work of been ok if it had even been a darker red, but it really is a wine/maroon/burgundy color. It‚Äôs a lovely color, I have a lot of clothing it will go with well, it just wasn‚Äôt what I needed for my outfit!"
4.0,"Great product, easy to use, good workout."
4.0,"I love this shirt! I normally wear a large, but seeing the the reviews, I ordered a medium just in case it would be too big, and I have no regrets! It doesn't fit like the model but then again, all bodies are different. It's really cute and good quality."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and the fabric very nice. However I'm 5'5&#34; and the dress was too short for me, about 5&#34;above my knee. I'm 63 and the dress is not age appropriate (for me)"
4.0,"Comfortable, good fit and great colours (I‚Äôm too old to wear pastels)!"
4.0,Comfy material.  Love the pockets. The only thing is the waist has a distinct elastic seam which I ended up buying a high waisted decorative belt and it styled it up nicely and covers that seam.
4.0,Good quality product. I had an issue with the first (the light didn't work) but they replaced quickly
4.0,"I was looking for something to wear around the house that would hold the girls without real support or binding or wires.  These are VERY comfortable and I can sleep in them.  Purchased an xxlarge because reviews said they run small.  I could have worn an Xlarge, but I am happy with these."
4.0,As the title says. I'm not sure if they are meant to be but it seems like the sleeves are sewn wrong... upside down? Inside out? I am wearing a cover up with it so it isn't noticeable.
4.0,This is a beautiful watch of great quality. My only complaint is that is is difficult to read because the glass lense is very tinted.
4.0,The ‚Äúcashmere‚Äù liner is pretty lightweight.  Good to about 25F.
4.0,Super cute.  Does need a camisole underneath
4.0,"I love the pattern, shape and detail on this although it has zero stretch to it. That's a bummer."
4.0,"I ordered a 2xl. I was basing on everyone's reviews. I should went with my gut and ordered up just because I like overly big. It fits fine,just not as loose as I thought it may be."
4.0,The fabric was soft and comfortable to wear. I returned the becas the waistband band an elastic that was uncomfortable.
4.0,"I‚Äôm not a small guy. But I‚Äôm also not a huge guy. Bought the biggest size they have and the sleeves are just a bit too short, and overall a little snug for me. Still using it. Hoping it will stretch out some over time."
4.0,A little hard to stretch over the glass arms - would have liked the option to get all blue
4.0,Just what I was hoping for. I have a longer torso and even though I am a size 0/2 I still have some hips going on. This was flattering (in my opinion) and fit just like I assumed it would. It is one size - so take that into consideration. The hem is more scalloped that I had thought - it rises a bit higher under the armpits - but I think it is just a cute detail. The pattern reminds me of something I would come across at Anthropologie. I can tell it is not the most high quality in the stitching and I will cross my fingers when I wash it (probably hand wash and hang) - but what do you expect for the price? Overall very pleased.
4.0,"The bag is a pretty nice size. When opening it does have a strong plastic smell, but once you start using the goes away."
4.0,"I prefer simple style belly rings (without the stuff hanging down) and it seems like they're getting harder and harder to find. In fact this is even my first blingy belly button ring!! I am super happy with my purchase of this belly ring! The belly button ring really sparkles so its perfect for wearing with a swim suit for a day at the beach. It is noticeable and cute without being overly flashy. I have had several other belly button rings and had issues with the balls not staying tight, and falling off. So far, that has not been a problem with this belly button ring. The bling seems secure and they arrived in perfect condition. No issues. Super cute product at a great price. In fact, you actually get two belly button rings for the price of one! Awesome deal! I would definitely recommend this belly button ring to my friends and family. I was given the opportunity to purchase these belly button rings at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,These socks weren't just fun and visually stylish but they are very well made. 9 months later and they still look and fit very well.
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but don‚Äôt be fooled by the model‚Äôs photo. This doesn‚Äôt provide any support or push-up effect at all."
4.0,"It's cute but looks pretty cheap. But then it was cheap, so I guess that's to be expected."
4.0,Fits perfect nothing that I didn‚Äôt like about them .
4.0,I liked the short glove  but the seem was not totally sewn shut so I had to sew them when they arrived
4.0,"These are awesome as a quick giveaway, we attached them to Valentine's for preschoolers. Two arrived broken (pins missing to home them together) but for the price still worth it"
4.0,These fit very nicely and I think my grandson likes these better for comfort than regular briefs.  The graphics are very cool.  Downside is they faded quickly after washing.
4.0,"These seem fairly nice... I'll know more after I wash them. Be aware, the &#34;tagless&#34; part only applies to the top. The bottoms have that nasty, plastic-coated feeling tag in them."
4.0,Purchased for a flower girl dress. Was ok
4.0,It's a beautiful light weight dress and looks just as expected. My niece loved it!
4.0,"Lovely, flowy top!  Good for Dress Up or Dress Down!"
4.0,This dress fit as expected except that it was too long.
4.0,I love the color and the feel of these flats.  They go quite well with some of my other outfits.
4.0,The CZ is larger than I expected. Would have preferred it to be smaller to allow more focus on the dolphins Love the tight fitting backs to avoid losing an earning.
4.0,"I wish I waist band was longer, it kind of cuts into you weird and doesn‚Äôt support the lower belly area."
4.0,I am extremely satisfied with the customer care David's bridal offered me. Unfortunately the dress was too small and I had to return it.
4.0,my daughter loved them so they worked for her/fun and a good cause
4.0,"Cuts a lot pf glare. I've got a mild cataract and for me this glasses lessens the hurt from bright headlights, front and rear."
4.0,Very nice slide.  Looks like the picture.
4.0,"Bought this as a little gift to go with a care package for my sister, she's been fighting covid. It was a gift from my daughter to her Aunt she adores. Giving 4 stars for how happy it made her, she absolutey LOVES it, did not come scratched like some reviews said and she said it feels well made and is beautiful. I would have given 5 stars but this took FOREVER to be delivered! It came days later after everything else in the care package I assembled. Like almost a week later so. Other than that I'd buy again as they have different ones for different people but I'd order way ahead of time if gifting for a dated special occasion."
4.0,Good just need stronger elastic bands.
4.0,Very pretty jade.  Exactly as described .  Large posts though
4.0,Doesn't look like the picture. The shirt I received had sewn on sleeves. I was disappointed by that so I gave it 4 stars. Other than that it's a great shirt.
4.0,"Very cute dainty earrings for my three year old.  The only issue is the post is longer than other earrings we‚Äôve bought.  They do hang down a bit, but not enough to bother her or look funny."
4.0,Bought this for my 11 yo daughter. She uses it for her bus pass and school ID.  She loves it!<br />I love that there is a double sided window. so far it's held up well. The color is pretty cute too.  Would buy agian.
4.0,I bought  this for my mother for a funeral and she looked  amazing.  It fit very close to size. Very free flowing and comfortable.
4.0,"I can get a lot of necklaces and rings on here. Not too bulky and doesn't take up a lot of space. Decent metal construction, sturdy"
4.0,"The dress is beautiful! Really. It didn't work for me because I have lost a considerable amount of weight, and the arms don't look very attractive as is. I will wear a 3/4 sleeve until I firm up more. In the meantime, I would HIGHLY recommend this product. It's ABSOLUTELY lovely. You aren't going to find a dress of this quality anywhere else for this price. Buy it!! (And that's from someone who had to return hers!!) : )"
4.0,"Comfort, fit, adjustable to body type. Does not affect archery shooting.<br />Not exactly quiet for bow hunting. Can be used, but have to pay attention once deer are close.<br />Small side pockets, I put cough drops in. A value for me.<br />4 stars due to material not quite quiet enough."
4.0,Holds up
4.0,Great for the$!
4.0,"My daughter probably should have ordered an XL.  She is curvy.  But the dress is beautiful.  Just didn't fit her well.  Very low cut in the front. If the XL was available, I would have ordered that but it wasn't.  I took a chance on the large.  She normally wears a 12-14."
4.0,"The band fits comfortably, and looks good just like the original. However the buckle pops off when it is snagged against any obstacles ex. carrying boxes in a tight space and the watch buckle gets caught up on something around it. I had to return it."
4.0,"this looks very cute on and goes with all my outfits, it is easy to layer with others, it is light weight, wears well. The only complaint is that .. well the pearls are no real and are loosing the coating. I think next time I will buy one that doesn't imitate, go for real stone or metal. I was going for cheap, but what you get is cheap. I give it a 4 because for the price, it is great!"
4.0,"I love my bag it's very roomy easy to keep clean, stays on your shoulder when you want to carry as shoulder bag, one of my best dooneys."
4.0,These glasses bend easily and have already lost shape after a couple weeks of wear...:but for the price they are good!
4.0,"While the bracelet has many good points, some of the charms are not so enchanting."
4.0,"Well at first I couldn't zip it but, when I start to stretch the wrap waist trainer. I could zip it up perfect. Plus, I order the correct size for me too."
4.0,You want to spice up you night in the bedroom this is the perfect thing to spice it up it is very breathable it is a soft rubber ball with holes so you can breath it got a  adjustable strap so it can  fit anybody‚Äôs head all in all it‚Äôs just something to spice up the bedroom fun
4.0,Great comfy jeans (they feel like leggings!)  Only problem is after wearing them for about 5 hours they started to stretch out and they got baggy.  I'm hoping after I wash them they will not do that anymore.
4.0,"This bracelet is adorable in person. The quality and weight are nicer than what I expected for the price. Unfortunately, the bracelet is too big for my wrist, and there is no way to adjust it, so I will be giving it away to a friend."
4.0,"I wanted an option for full coverage under strong sun, but I‚Äôm afraid this doesn‚Äôt work for me. And that‚Äôs a disappointment. I‚Äôm an older woman and, well, they‚Äôre just too tight for me in the upper arm area. For reference, I ordered the XXL. Otherwise it would be perfect, except I immediately regretted not ordering white. But that‚Äôs a personal preference and doesn‚Äôt affect my rating. I do wish manufacturers of sportswear would understand that people starting out on the path to more exercise aren‚Äôt already slim."
4.0,"This is a cute summer top. The print is pretty and the style is flattering. The material is lightweight with some stretch, great for bustier ladies. I'm not crazy about the flutter sleeves, wish they were longer but overall an adorable summer blouse."
4.0,"The shirts are great and feel like they‚Äôre solid.. I had to return mine because they appeared too big for me, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 weight about 165lbs I picked the medium but the small should be best"
4.0,"Colour just as advertised. I am 5,7 180lbs, with a bit of a tummy. I initially got a medium which fit but was close on the tummy. I got a large because I am conscious of my bulge. Otherwise medium will be a fit"
4.0,"I love these socks! very comfortable, but some pairs didn't have the silicone grip in the heel. Also when i ordered, there was prime but now they don't offer prime, so there is a $4+ shipping fee. It's basically the same price, but prime came very quick."
4.0,"We received duplicate ""astronaut"" vests.  The ""baker"" vest was missing.  They are basically the same color so it was just an oversight.  All the other vests were there and really cute.  My grandson will love playing dress up.<br />Thanks,<br />Lucy"
4.0,Luckily I didn‚Äôt fall off my roof to test it but it seems to do the job.
4.0,Bought these for a SuperGirl costume.  I was worried about comfort and bought them in a size bigger than usual. Are not tight but are in no way big. They are surprisingly comfortable although I put in a gel insole. They are squeaky but it's not a big deal. I'm happy I bought them!
4.0,These glasses are just as advertised. Good value. They look great. But they're pretty flimsy. You might want to invest in a hard casem
4.0,These are the first sports bras I've found that actually fit me. Being an E makes that a challenge. The pad inserts are strange but are removable if they prove to be too small. This is probably the first time my boobs have felt secure in a long time.
4.0,Great pair of goggles! Does the job.
4.0,"Very nice blouse but was a little too large.  It's long, too, fits taller people really well. I am 5' tall and just didn't work for me."
4.0,Usually I size up but in this case i went with my normal size L and probably could have used a M. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 185lbs. I like the fabric a lot. The color is beautiful. I know a few people who have other colors and they are all beautiful as well. For the price you can‚Äôt go wrong.
4.0,"The sizing was perfect for my man. He loves the sweater. The material fuzzes up though, giving it four stars."
4.0,order size up! but very fly jacket
4.0,"Loved this necklace. Even though it was inexpensive, I was expected it to be a little &#34;tougher&#34; than it was - and I managed to break mine within days. (I have always been hard my jewelry!!)"
4.0,"Fit everyone great, except me, because of my hieght"
4.0,arrived quickly; Grandson very happy with them!
4.0,Is a nice suit but very small.
4.0,"Great pattern and flattering fit, but too short for me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù). Fits like a skater dress. I loved how it made my top half look but it‚Äôs too short to wear without leggings and it‚Äôs almost summer. I‚Äôm a 44DD and got the 4X and it fit great except for length so I will be returning. Fabric is a little thin, so it might need a slip or add a lining."
4.0,This dress is awesome.  I am giving it 4 stars because the material is very see through.  You will need to wear something under it if you do not want your underpants to show.
4.0,I liked that I got a good price on them wish I could get a couple more at same price as before
4.0,"These are great glasses for the price. They were purchased for my husband. At first they didn't appear to have the quality we had expected. But, after using them for a week now, he loves them. They are so light and comfortable. I will probably order an extra pair of a different color for him."
4.0,"Love this pin! Color of cat was slightly off, a bit greenish. A little pricey as well, but i really wanted pin. Reminds of my white cat, she drinks my water all the time!"
4.0,This is $16 on their actual website. You'll just wait a while for shipping but good option if you're looking to save money. $5 is $5 amirite? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4.0,"My 5yr old niece can fit them, but just right!!"
4.0,"I was a bit apprehensive about ordering this, as there were no reviews on it.  But I'm glad I bought it now.  The fit is good and the material has some stretch to it.  And I also like the sleeve length, too.  As I had ordered it in black, I'm not sure if the lighter colors are sheer enough to where you'd need undergarments.  The shoulders feel like they're too wide, but they also don't feel like they'd slip off.  Otherwise, the upper 1/2 feels like it clings to your shape. The bottom 1/2 also feels a bit clingy, too, but not as much as the top."
4.0,This helped my sensitive skin. I hand-washed with sensitive skin and delicate fabric detergent.  They just don‚Äôt look as great once they are washed.
4.0,Sleeves and chest  fit little tight.  Bottom flears out so that fits fine.
4.0,"They are cute but the turquoise ball is a little bit on the big side bigger than what the picture of the depicts, I wear it for work, it adds to the professional classy look."
4.0,Smaller than expected but still nice and very well built
4.0,Just as described and pictured. Chain is of course a little cheap looking but given the price it makes sense. Love it all the same though.
4.0,"Cute jacket, but Came stained."
4.0,had to return.. doesn't look right on my body or April wedding 2018
4.0,"This is a beautiful necklace. I'm a bit obsessed with it, I did think it would be bigger for a real statement but it still worked for my needs."
4.0,"So I gave it 4 stars because it does its job however if you jog/run while wearing it, it rides up. I kept having to pull it down."
4.0,Love them! Got them in very short time. I usually use size 5.5 or 6 so i got a 5.5 since my feet are narrow and the was great. Love the way it looks. Will probably but a diffrent color. Only reason not giving 5 starts is because i havent used them so dnt know how stable they are. Other then that loved!
4.0,Thin but nice and comfortable!!!
4.0,Very sexy dress but runs small. I ordered the largest size and it was still too tight. I know I have some extra pounds but it‚Äôs not too much. It never gave me the extra fabric room I usually get when order up a couple sizes. Not the sellers fault. Just didn‚Äôt work.
4.0,Just as the picture WORKING GREAT  so far
4.0,"The beer glass hat is great.  The beer bottle hat, as many have said, has a small head opening and the top does not stay erect.  I opened part of the seam and placed crushed newspaper in the bottle neck of the hat and below to make it stand upright. I considered opening one of the side seams and adding a little fabric to increase the head size; however,  I did not resew the seam together because by opening that seam, the hat fit me better (and I have a small head). Perhaps the manufacture should consider a lining of the hat that is stretchable.  I think the outside fabric has some stretch in it, but not the inside fabric. Still, this hat needs a bigger head opening."
4.0,"Product is great, but a little expensive"
4.0,Many complements very light weight .
4.0,Love the look..looks like a nice watch wit new band's
4.0,Honestly it‚Äôs a nice belt but it‚Äôs too long for me. Even on the tightest loop it was too large. I do like the quality of it and the fact that it‚Äôs reverable though.
4.0,"It is very flattering but a lot more dress than I anticipated. The material is also a bit heavier than I anticipated. Overall, a good dress but not quite what I am looking for."
4.0,Really pretty dress! Great for a simple wedding cerimony or whatever really! Delicate and nice.
4.0,"seems to be good quality, lens are very crisp"
4.0,so far so good!  Love the look & the way these fit...very comfortable
4.0,Little big. Material loose
4.0,More breathable than plastic bands.
4.0,Very cute..thin material but for price great deal. Runs small order a size up. Will be great for the beach!
4.0,Good but hollow back. Should have known for the low price.
4.0,"It is so hard to find a bra‚Äîespecially buying online‚Äîthat supports my girls and is beautiful too. Just because I am super huge, doesn‚Äôt mean I want to wear gawd-awful looking under garments!  Finally this one hits the mark!  Gorgeous!  Love the way the cups lift and separate giving me open space for cool breeze in the cleavage. I love the racer back and the lace and the color options. The only reason for only 4 stars is because the wire under my pits is too high, cutting into my chub. Is the problem the chub or the bra?  No clue. But the only thing that can change at this point is the bra üò≥ü§£. So I just wore this bra for the first time and had it on for about 7 hours. That is pretty much as comfortable as underwire is going to get. Bottom line: love it and ordering two more!!"
4.0,Yarn is thicker than shown. I was looking for a hat that would be comply in spring not too hot. This is definitely a cold weather hat. The color and style are great.
4.0,Pretty. A bit small. Order one size up if you are chubby! Its not super stretchy so i get more muffin topish lol but under the boobs is great!
4.0,I like it and it is good for casual wear
4.0,"Both lens are very loose in the frame, and one pops out very easily, making it hard even to wipe them clean. I knew I was buying very cheap sunglasses so I suppose I shouldn't expect too much, though I was surprised at how loose and easy to pop out the lens are.<br /><br />UPDATE: I emailed the seller about this issue and they sent me a new pair, which did not have this issue at all. The new glasses are great, and exactly what I had hoped for when I initially bought."
4.0,"They are a good fit and reduce glare significantly. All in all, a pretty good product at a bargain price."
4.0,Nice bra that fits nicely and looks great
4.0,"Fit, great for walking"
4.0,liked my shirt I like them big.
4.0,"i struggle finding masks that fit me from how petite i am, kids masks are a little small on me but regular sized ones typically swallow me. these masks are right in between the two sizes with a good amount of coverage. they‚Äôre thick and easy to adjust. wearing glasses, these masks prevent fog. the only complaint is they get a little stuffy but it‚Äôs not horrible. definitely would recommend"
4.0,"The colors and designs are great....my head size is small, so these work fine for me.they do run small"
4.0,This dress definitely runs very SMALL.  Adorable dress but order way up.
4.0,Men's size large.  Nice sweatshirt for the money.  Very soft and comfortable.  I am a women and this size fits like a women's XL.
4.0,I'm happy with the earrings. Great product for the price.<br />Just wish it came in something other than a cheap small cardboard box.
4.0,I returned because I didn‚Äôt like the hearts printed in the elbows
4.0,"One issue really, the package was open a tad an had what looked like a couple of  cookies crumbs on it?"
4.0,Fits great and doesnt move or pull out of your pants like some shirts do.
4.0,I must say that I love this piece I worn it for mother's day and the color I worn was a deep coral and this necklace just popped..I got soooooooo many compliments can't wait to were it again!!
4.0,I really wanted a red one.  Someone wrote that they wore medium but ordered large and it was ok but a little loose.<br />Well I ordered large because red was not available in medium but it was too large for me.  I gave it to my daughter and it fit her and I didnt have to return it.<br />I keep checking but the red does not seem to be available in medium.  I may give up and order it in blue or black.
4.0,The neck line is loose and baggy and the tank top is very long. My son is usually an xs and we had to get the medium so please measure and follow the chart. The material is pretty thick as well. I will say though I ordered in the evening and it arrived on my steps by morning! That was unexpected and awesome!
4.0,"The wife said &#34;These shoes are so comfy!&#34; She also loves the blue color. However, she's a bit disappointed that it came with only one blue shoelace. What the heck is she supposed to do with just one!?"
4.0,It's fit as expected.
4.0,This was so fun to wear. I should have gone with an XL..but i made it work.
4.0,It is just what I needed. Light weight and stands without falling over
4.0,These are super comfy and fit me great. I work doing window installation and I love the day I wear these because I can forgo my bulky tool belt. They aren't flattering by any means but they are good for work.
4.0,"These are cute slippers, NICE quality. The sole of the shoe is very sturdy for the outdoors which is perfect. For my daughter they seem a bit bulky for her, the shoe size is correct, but the shoe itself is a little big if that make sense. She also has to wear these without socks and only for a short period of time because then her feet start sweating and the inside of the shoe gets damp because of that. Unless it‚Äôs a super cold day then it‚Äôs fine because I know her feet are nice and warm. I do wish that the 2 bows on each shoe would be more durable, my toddler ripped them off so I had to super glue them back on."
4.0,These  socks were what I was looking for. They fit perfectly. Thank you so much.
4.0,The skirt is fine but very long<br />I had to cut and then sewn a hem
4.0,"Good deal, bought in red and blue."
4.0,"Works well, great for the cooler weather."
4.0,Great little kit. Nice colors
4.0,No the best quality but my daughter loved !
4.0,"Wore this to work the other day and it got a lot of compliments. The top zippered part is a bit awkward, but the fabric is a nice heavy weight. Sometimes I get nervous buying dresses online because they're often too sheer. This is not the case with this dress. I can see this being good work work, some weddings, winter holiday dinners, and afternoon theatre performances. The print is a bit too festive, but would be good for winter holidays. Not bad for a blind bargain online purchase."
4.0,"This bracelet is really awesome! I love the overall feel and look, but the lava stones feel slightly like plastic and not so much stone. I do also have a few issues with the bracelet becoming too stretched out on my wrist causing it to roll up and down at times, but this is easy to get used too."
4.0,It's hard to tell some of the times on it because of the shape of the clock face. Or maybe I'm just dyslexic.
4.0,On small growth will approach better
4.0,"Was a little skeptical with all the great reviews, but I'm so happy with my purchase! Took other's advice and sized up. The 12 fit perfectly on my larger hips, but needed a seamstress to bring in the waist just a bit. I felt beautiful for my event and got many compliments! I will definitely be shopping this brand again."
4.0,"There great, but no wsy am I going to be able to use them for my beard! I need larger ones! That's way only 4 stars"
4.0,I got this for my Grandmother and she loves it. It is the perfect size for her. The only issue is that the clasp is so small that she can't put it on or take it off herself.
4.0,Love the color and style. Very different. Just wished it opened wider. Think I will enjoy it anyway.
4.0,Only part of the cup changes color that has the zombie &#34;print out&#34;.  It's why you only see one side of this thing in the pictures. :)  But it's still really cool.
4.0,It works like a mask should and it is easy to pull up and pull down from the nose and mouth.I like this style rather than the earloop mask.my opinion
4.0,"I was very excited to get these pants and am mostly satisfied. I ordered a small and they were still a bit bigger than I was hoping. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 123 pounds - usually a 4/6 pant these days. Bootilicious. The top of the wastebsnd is really tall and folds over. The fabric is very soft. On me the pants are long, but I can scooch them up. Great for hangin at home. Could be dressed up a bit."
4.0,"If you are expecting a pair of gloves that you think will last in your hand for some time, you will be disappointed. The stitch quality is poor and you will find that it will not last long enough. Mine actually came with an open stitch, I returned it next day. After I saw the open stitch, I noticed that the stitch quality overall is not good.<br /><br />The material is good and stretches nicely. This is a good product sans poor stitch quality."
4.0,Great jacket but runs small<br />Returned it.<br />4 Stars because runs small
4.0,"it is a comfortable fit. The seams on the shirt curve to the front, besides that it's a great buy."
4.0,"This is a nice faux fur vest with hood. It has a couple of hook clasps in front and two small pockets for the hands. Unfortunately, it was way too small for me. I think I would need a plus size in this vest; it seems more of a misses size. However, it is really nice and I consider the sizing issue my problem.<br /><br />This is dry clean only."
4.0,Great for daily winter wear. I only had an issue with crotch seam started a hole right away. Insides are smooth and no irritating feather pokes so good down loft. The material is somewhat rip-stop but not as high end as expensive named brand ski pants. I would keep these guys around for extra warmth for windy cold winter days. I will most likely repair this set again with double stitching to avoid a larger whole. Keep an eye on your pockets too. I had a whole in the left side after packing keys and other sharp objects that can cause a whole in the threading.
4.0,Very good cap!
4.0,man for the price you really cant beat them...crystal clear...NOTE they would not be my first choice on the sunniest days....but 90% of the time I wear these glasses even on my Harley...
4.0,"I was excited to get my new pants.  The waist was a little more snug than I anticipated but I think they will be find.  Just don't need to wear them on a Monday, after I've had an indulgent weekend!"
4.0,my daughter loves it the only thing I didn't like is that the words come off when you wash it so try washing it with images inside other then that it's nice.
4.0,"Nice and comfortable,  but the pick holders are a little loose so make sure you don't lose your pick."
4.0,"Really love the size of the gems on the front, cute shapes, just keep a heads up that the posts are very short"
4.0,The quality is great and its really pretty but I'm sad that it only comes in one size so the ring only fits my pinky but it does look cute on the chain too.
4.0,material a little thin would of like just a tad thicker other wise it rocks
4.0,So Cute . My Kids Foot Grew Too Fast So It Didnt Last 1 Month But Definatley Would Buy Again In A Bigger Size
4.0,Got so many compliments on this necklace ;)
4.0,A good value for the price especially if you do not have pierced ears and do have allergies like contact dermatitis.
4.0,I wear these in winter and summer. They are perfect for lounging around at home or moving around. I am wearing them now!
4.0,"I got SO many compliments on this top, but can‚Äôt give it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è because the sleeves are a bit batwinged. Other than that, it fits true to size and is a great value. Not the best material, but definitely cute. Glad I have a decorative racer back to wear under it."
4.0,"Fully lined and a very good fit. The hat band is not gray as seen in the photo. The band is black. For this reason I gave four stars, not five."
4.0,"""I really could not tell what they would look like from the picture that is on the site...<br />[[ASIN:B01E551XGU WPF Retro Polarized Sunglasses Aviator Sun Glasses for Men (As Picture, Silver White Frame Ice Blue Lens)]]<br />3 out of 5 stars given...<br />&#34;I shall see how long they last.&#34;<br />Remember, you get what you pay for...$21.99<br />If you expect more invest in AO $50+ / Randolph $130+<br />&#34;I personally buy burners due to breakage, theft & general stupidity...LOL&#34;<br /><br />UPDATED: INCREASED STARS TO 4/5<br />"" Dam good glasses for the price."" I had these for a couple years! finally broke & discarded.<br />It sucks that I can no longer find them. They were the perfect fit for me!!"
4.0,Very good suit! Looked as advertised.
4.0,"Beautiful beach bag, a little on the medium size not large like it notes. Sturdy and seems like it will do the trick. Love the smaller bag that it comes with. Perfect for cell, wallet, smokes, or whatever your heart desires to tote to the beach! üòä"
4.0,Very warm and thick!
4.0,"I really liked these glasses they looked great, felt great on but they were too wide for my narrow temple/face and looked too big on me. Unfortunately I returned them because of this, if you have a larger temple area they should look great on you, narrow face not so much unless you like bigger looking glasses on your face.."
4.0,"I‚Äôm not a fan of the fabric. It‚Äôs a non stretch polyester, but the fit is just right. I got an extra small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 115 lbs. 5"
4.0,"This top is SUPER cute and fits exactly as I expected to. My only problem is that there seems to be some sort of plastic thread they used to embroider the chest, and it can get really itchy. I just snipped the excess threads, but you may be better wearing some sort of high neck bra with it. However this definitely isn't a deal breaker and I still love the top."
4.0,"Picture is the same, but colors are more vibrant with a smooth polyester sheen as opposed to fuzzy. This is a gift for my 10 1/2 year old and it should fit for having to wear it when she has to go into a store. I tried it on and it fit, but would probably shift if I talked a bunch or chewed gum (some adult masks do this anyway). Had ordered same size (S) Dabi from another seller that hadn't shipped and I cancelled that to get one in an adult size (M) just to be safe.<br />I really like the sides being stitched so they are flush with your cheeks and don't poke out. Straps are nice and strong. Tightened them to see if that would help the nose clip and they had my ears bent forward.<br />Took a star off because the adjustable nose clip isn't very firm/strong. There's something there that can be bent, but it doesn't form to the nose."
4.0,"Bracelet and packaging were both nice, very pleased.  The charging heart had a flaw/nick on it which was a little disappointing.  I bought it for a gift which I need to send to my sister tomorrow."
4.0,I like rings that adjust to any size and these do. You can stack them or wear one on each finger.
4.0,Es muy bueno para mi hija ya que es muy nerviosa le sirve para distraerse y no comerse m√°s las u√±as
4.0,screw dimensions off just a little; will not hold right toe.
4.0,"I love the cut of this shirt, it's got princess seaming so it's not that boxy look. I was disappointed though that the color isn't the blue teal, it's an emerald dark green instead. I almost sent it back but I decided to just get used to the color. The other thing I wish was that it came in an XL. I'd like a little more room as it &#34;just&#34; fits now, it runs a little small. I'm 5'7 and broad shouldered."
4.0,"My 5 year old daughter and 4 year old niece were so excited to have cute earrings! But, the backs do come off easily and do get lost. Oh well, its for play. Just wish they were clipped some how?"
4.0,Not too well made. Many threads left hanging but my granddaughter loves it.
4.0,"These are not high-quality earrings, but they are festive and I will wear them again!"
4.0,"Seems to work like they said it would. With the boot stretcher I was able to stretch a pair of boots and two pairs of tennis shoes.I should have said two NEW pairs of tennis shoes. Either my feet are getting wider or shoe makers are getting cheaper. I'm 53 years old so I think they are getting cheaper. Really ticks me off too. Got news for ya shoe manufacturers, my feet are NOT going to shrink just because you go shorter on materials and still stamp a &#34;size 13&#34; on them."
4.0,"My three year old granddaughter has her ears pierced.  With these earrings, she can match all of her outfits."
4.0,Definitely a loser fit. Would size down
4.0,These are elegant and seem to be of reasonable quality. I do like the way they look - not too flashy. Have only used them a couple of times so far but they do feel like they will hold well.
4.0,I ordered two of these. Both XXL. The Gray fit a little snug but I can deal with it.  The beautiful blue vest was like a MEDIUM!  What the heck is going on?  China has a long way to go with standardization in production.  I just don‚Äôt get it.  I‚Äôm ordering another in a larger size because it‚Äôs a cool cheap product!
4.0,This bag is useful and the weave design is very trendy right now. I use it often and it's spacious.<br />The quality is not great. One of the straps in the weave is coming out in the front and there seems to be no way to fix it.<br />The inner pocket is annoying and makes things hard to find.
4.0,"These compression socks are not super hard to pull on my feet and then my lower leg.  They are comfortable, for compression socks, and have a soft feel to them."
4.0,Small enough to fit my 6 year old. We wish it was a little longer which is why we gave it to our son. Does a better job at covering his whole face.
4.0,Probably have to take to a seamstress for a better fit on me .
4.0,"Super cute sets, ordered a size up for my 2 year old and they are still really tight so they wont fit for long but still good jammies."
4.0,They do what they need too and are cheap.
4.0,Just what I needed - silver colored and beaded bangle stack.  Works great for my hippie costume in a play.
4.0,"This is a nice top for spring or summer.  I bought the white background with a tiny black design.  No need for a camisole, it is not that sheer.  I do use a ‚ÄúCami Secret‚Äù to make it more modest.  It opens up in the front more than how it looks on the model."
4.0,"I purchased these for work as a dressy/casual pant. I like them alot, they fit good and are very comfortable. Even better that they have pockets!"
4.0,"I got these to fit a girl who wears between an A & B cup with a 40&#34; band. Very hard to find!! These came in very fast despite coming from China. They are cute and true to size, although the edging is a little scratchy and seams could have looked better."
4.0,Like this top a lot. I have it in pink too!
4.0,Within a few seconds of my child putting on this mask the eye shield began to fog up. I had to take it off and put her on another mask because she could not see. I would not recommend anyone buying this. Also I did remove the plastic over the shield prior to use.
4.0,I like this ring its cute.
4.0,It served its purpose but you can't read any of the writing on it when you put it on... it's comfortable and sometimes I forget it's on...
4.0,"It fits really good, aside from the bicep area. It is a bit tight when you bend your arms, but I think it would just need broken in."
4.0,"I am a paramedic and unfortunately have to be outside in the early mornings, late nights and in between when it is very cold outside.  I bought these head bands to keep me warm while I'm out in the elements treating patients, and they are perfect.  I've used them not just for work but also on cold winter outings with the family and I was so incredibly happy that I had them."
4.0,Nice quality.  Light weight but runs a size too small
4.0,"Got this for a trip to Mexico. Very flattering and you can throw a skirt on over it and wear it out during the day. Legs are cut a bit high and a little booty shows. So, you have to be ok with that. Not for large chested women. Decent quality for the price. I think it'll last about 6 months."
4.0,"These earrings look expensive and sparkle beautifully.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have preferred them to be a little larger, but they are still beautiful."
4.0,"Overall I really like these shirts and have ordered them about 3 times. My only complaint is that the quality control on sizing isn't the best. Never far off enough to be a worry, but some will be snug and others loose. For this I docked 1 star, but I'll probably continue to order from them."
4.0,"Its some what large, but that's ok it'll shrink."
4.0,"Normally I order belts much larger than my actual waist size (36).  In this case, I just ordered the 40 and it is perfect.  It's still new, but so far seems well made."
4.0,"Nice piece, good ample size, delivered very timely , didn't like closure personally but looks nice and leather"
4.0,Great workout shirts. Very breathable and light
4.0,"comfortable and convenient, but without a nose bridge part did not seal to my particular face."
4.0,This is a good product but color of product shipped does not match photo in description.  Will try again sometime.
4.0,"I'm 5'5 and weigh around 140 lbs and I got a size medium. I love the dress and the length, the only thing is it's a little tight in the back but I feel if I would have ordered a large then the dress would fit loosely. Other than that I'm satisfied."
4.0,This is a pretty cool band. I find I am looking at it all the time especially outdoors. Colorful is really variegated. Don't know how they made it. Must have heated up the stainless steel mesh in an industrial oven or torch to get those colors. Had to do a little dremel grinding to get one end to swivel on the watch lugs. But other than that I really like it.
4.0,This fits even though it kind of squashes my boobs.  It's cute but I find the fastener at the back of the neck takes some practice to hook by yourself.
4.0,Looks just like the picture. Thanks
4.0,Shirt was delivered on time.  Tried it on and the fit was perfect.  Shirt looks very well made.  Will order another one when more colors are available.
4.0,"A little bulky, but exactly as expected."
4.0,"Fit a bit tight, maybe i have too much hair or my head is tad big. Otherwise it looked amazing. Just hard to hear since it covers your ears"
4.0,"This is very pretty! It‚Äôs smaller than what I thought, but it is very nice. It comes in a nice box."
4.0,Made with genuine leather has a nice matte buckle that is also well made. Nothing cheap about the construction of this belt. This belt is not one that will wear out quickly but one that will go the distance.
4.0,"This mostly fit ok, but is a bit short for a thermal and isn't as form fitting as the others that I own. Otherwise it is fine so far."
4.0,My only complaint is that the band won‚Äôt stay in.
4.0,"This robe is big enough to fit a wookie. I'm swimming in it, however for a robe that's okay. It's like wearing a blanket."
4.0,"Not the most comfortable bikini. It is not quite high waisted or low waisted, so it sits kind of weird at your hips."
4.0,Beautiful dress but it's made for tall women. I'm 5'3&#34; 115lbs and the small was ankles length and had an extra 3-4 extra on shoulder straps.
4.0,very pretty but super long for my 5'1 frame. Heels couldnt even help. I wish that it fit better because it is really pretty
4.0,"If you're looking for a robust NATO-style strap with good hardware, this is one to consider. BUT - it's pretty rough & certainly not soft like the newly available &#34;seatbelt&#34; styles.<br /><br />It's also stiffer than usual because it is so &#34;high density.&#34;<br /><br />I'd say it's worth the price. Just be sure you know what you're getting: Thick, semi-rough texture, high-density strap with good, somewhat unique hardware."
4.0,Much better quality than I was expecting.  Was a great Christmas gift for the horse-lover in my life.  She put it on right away.
4.0,Got this for my brother who does Taekwondo and my boyfriend who is a gym rat. They say they love the vest and have become sweat kings. They are pleased with the vest and I am pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"Ten Seconds Non-Waxed Hockey Laces White Referee, 108 - This item was of Great Quality, As Described, Quick Shipping, and fit the shoes we bought them for, Perfectly! Thank you =o)"
4.0,"So beautiful, elegant & cute airplane pin.. thanks"
4.0,"I like these glasses very much they provide all around protection, I also like that should I flip them on from my head they don't get caught in my hair. Visibility is very clear. I often forget I have them on. It does state UV protection."
4.0,The grad loved this item.  It will be with her each day!
4.0,There is a black scotch in the back side. Does not work with pink butterflies
4.0,great for PSU football games. very fast shipping
4.0,"My Dad really likes them.  Says they are a little tight at the top, but still very comfortable."
4.0,The quality of the shirt was surprisingly superior to what I expected.  I haven't washed it yet so not sure if it shrinks once washed.  It is a thicker shirt. Wish they had some made out of workout material.
4.0,"Love these earrings, only thing is that the  packaging has the worst lable placement. Makes it hard to want to wrap it up as a gift. Even when  you try  to remove the stickers some of it is hard to get off the plastic."
4.0,My kids love traveling with this luggage set. Cute design too.
4.0,"Before finding these rain shoe covers on amazon.com, I tested at least two cycling shoe covers that did not keep my feet dry and were cumbersome to put on and take off. I like the fact that I can put these on right over my street shoes (Nike Air Pegasus '83), and can cover my rain pants right up to below the knee. They aren't very stylish, but who cares.<br /><br />I bought the &#34;Extra Large&#34; and they fit well - going on and off with ease. I wear shoe size 10.5/11."
4.0,"Super cute swimsuit with fun design and beautiful, bold colors. Covers the bottom well. Top has nice straps that are easy for child to maneuver. I'd give it a 5-star rating if the elastic band didn't twist on the bottoms. It's not bad enough for my daughter to notice, so take that as you may."
4.0,It will not keep you warm. Extremely lightweight.  It is more like a pretty drape.  NOT meant for anyone over size 16 (U.S.)
4.0,didn't give it 5 stars because it leaves fuzz on your hair until it has finished shedding
4.0,I got these for my sons smo braces. For the summer they fit the braces well with velcro extentions
4.0,It's a great piece for the price.
4.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it didn't quite fit right. The skirt design is adorable and I loved it, but the fabric is very stiff and doesn't move well with your body. The top is a nice, soft material and if the bottom were made of the same I think it would fit better. I was going to keep it even though the bottom was a bit weird due to the fabric, but I ended up returning it because it was a little too large. I bought a large according to the size chart and was surprised that it was too big. The top fit fine but the waistline was too loose. For size reference I'm 5'4, 36DD, 180lbs. A medium may fit better but I'm not sure if I want to repurchase this dress because of the stiff fabric. Absolutely love the black with blue rose pattern thought!"
4.0,Cute dress...shows me I need to tighten up
4.0,Nice for cost.
4.0,"This product did the price was great, but I wish it was a little softer."
4.0,This belt fits perfectly for my wife and three color variations helps to wear for different occasions.<br />I wish the seller reduce the price a bit so that many can benefit.<br />Also prefer an option of color red in this combination instead of white.<br />Overall it works great
4.0,This product needs a little refining on the placement of the crank handle...it is too far up in the umbrella so when you raise or lower it is difficult to reach. Other then that issue I am pleased with the umbrella.
4.0,"Love it. Bit small than I thought but still love it. The flap is magnetic so it occasionally sticks to it's own chain, but I like it."
4.0,"Very happy with my purchase,got the red and dark blue."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:30da19e22403b0755850936e133a7410]] F√°cil instalaci√≥n, buenos materiales."
4.0,So far so good seems to fit well except the rear straps that hold your heel and the sandals were not trimmed 100% had to trim them myself for a non chafing fit. They seem to be fine now.
4.0,"I love this style and think it's flattering for most figures. I ordered the army green color and it fits very well except it's very short, almost mini length. Since I'm tall, I expected that, so pair it with bike shorts and it's perfect. Love the side pockets and how cool it is during these hot summer months. I also use it as a coverup for swimwear. It's very thin so you have to wear a bra with it and the material shows a bit of stress. Not sure if it's supposed to look like that or not. But I like it well enough, I plan to order another one."
4.0,My daughter loves these!  They run big so order a half size down.
4.0,"Very warm, very Minnie. Good foot grip."
4.0,"I love this top. It fits perfectly. No gaping armholes, covers my bum and my front and its cut well at the neck."
4.0,Watch looks good and works. Very light weight.  Can't complain for price. Delivered on time.
4.0,Fits great and looks good. Just not quite as bright as I expected.
4.0,sleeves are very long
4.0,I like the contoured fit and the copper content.
4.0,Beautiful but I had to return because the snap closure hit right against my phone screen (Samsung S8) and I was afraid it would scratch the screen. It also couldn't be snapped shut with my phone inside.
4.0,These sunglasses felt durable and worked great for my needs.  They are very basic.
4.0,"The watch is lovely and I'm excited to wear it. It did take a while to arrive, but was delivered in the time promised, so I have no complaints. Removing links was very scary and a bit tough, but I managed to do so without damage to the watch. I cannot wait to wear it!"
4.0,Purchased for husband. His stomach is a little bigger but these worked fine. He likes the fit and the amount of compression.
4.0,"First forgive the difference in photo colors. It is a navy blue unlike what it looks like in the first 3 pics. It is a cotton blend feels like a polyester/cotton with a bit of Elastane thrown in. It is soft and comfy. I am short and curvy. Being 5'2"" most things are long on me this dress is not. It comes to about 3 inches above my knee and makes more sense to use as a nightgown or a long top with leggings. I washed on cold tumbled dry on low. It came out very nice with no noticeable shrinking or color loss. I do recommend this dress as long as you are ok with the length.<br />I hope this review has helped in your decision on this product."
4.0,"I know this says it's for men, but I enjoyed the simple design and figured I'd check it out for my self. This belt is extremely well made and clearly very durable- I've been so sick or belts that are glued together and fall apart just pulling them on. comes in a useful tin box to neatly store it away as well. The one issue is that they do run a bit on the small side- I bought a size up and have to wear it on the second to last hole. Just something to keep in mind when ordering this otherwise well made, simple and stylish product.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest review, and as someone who also relies on reviews for making purchases, I hope this is useful information."
4.0,"I LOVE this dress--so many compliments!  Only drawback is that if you wear anything larger than an A cup, you'll probably wish for more support. I don't feel comfortable with only one layer of the fabric up top, so, to make the halter, I wrap the fabric around my neck, then down the other side in front so there's two layers. I pull it down under the waist, then back up to tie in the back. This gives thickness and support.<br /><br />Thinking about adding bra pads to alleviate the problem...still, beautiful, comfortable, flattering, and very feminine."
4.0,"They are adorable! Cuter in actuality.  Somewhat narrow, compared to other little fashion shoes I've purchased for granddaughter.  She'll just wear THIN socks with them."
4.0,A gift for my granddaughter. It looks really nice for the price.
4.0,I loved this dress. It fits perfect
4.0,The quality was good and I like the color and design.  I didn't wanted it to be so form fitting so I bought the wrong size and had to send it back.  Otherwise it was a good top.
4.0,"Very beautiful skirt. I received numerous of compliments. However,  my zipper has broken and I only wore it once."
4.0,Bigger than expected. Nice!
4.0,These are great. And 4 pair for the price of one. Ill defiantly be buying more styles of this earring.
4.0,"great shirt with great material and adorable cuffs, but I can't close it, so I have to wear it open with another shirt underneath, but it is still great!"
4.0,Just what I've been looking for to wear with leggings.  Have gotten lots of compliments on the outfit.
4.0,Love this but its more black than navy blue
4.0,These leggings are super comfortable and flexible. I also love how high wasted they are without squeezing too much. The only downside with the mesh leggings is that they are very easy to accidentally make holes in along the meshed sides.
4.0,Liked it but I wished I could have got it in full frame.
4.0,"This review is for the Black-2 belt. It's well made and a flattering and versatile design, once you find the right size. My waist is 30"" and I first ordered the small/medium because the description said it would fit a 29""-32"" waist. But I found that I had to put it on the loosest hook, which gave me no leeway to wear it over anything bulkier than a thin top. I liked the belt enough to re-order it in medium/large, which is supposed to fit a 32""-35"" waist. This one I have to wear on the tightest hook! But there is a lot of leeway to adjust it, so I am keeping the larger size. By the way, they do include a metal hole punch in case you want to make another hole."
4.0,"Waterproof, warm but ran a little small"
4.0,The dress looks nice on....
4.0,Good sandals. Sole is a little stiff. Like the arch support.
4.0,"From the picture I expected a brightly colored shoe. They are far from bright. If you take them out into bright sunlight they do seem to brighten up but otherwise they aren't bright at all. The shoes are a little larger than other brands I buy. Wearable with a heavy or double sock. Being from China I didn't expect them to have much cushion, but to my surprise they are nicely cushioned."
4.0,"I love this dress! I was skeptical at first because I‚Äôm picky when it comes to dress fit, so I bought one first. It fit so well, I bought three more.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äù3, 138lbs and a Medium was perfect for me. Just a smidge longer than I wanted‚Äîright under my knee, but it still looks good. Very light material and flattering!"
4.0,Love how it looks. Get a lot of compliments when I wear these. I will say they are a bit narrow though
4.0,"I removed the strap, put Velcro on it and stuck to the dash, for an easy to read timepiece while driving.  Works really well, only gave it 4 stars, as the face is a metallic background, and sometimes picks up glare from bright daylight."
4.0,"After trying this dress. For a second time and losing a couple of lbs, I am loving this dress.I am bringing sexy back..YEA!!"
4.0,Feel nice on.  Seems to be good quality.  The only dark spot is with the regular tightening required to keep it snug.  Not so bad it's irritating but bad enough to warrant this review
4.0,"Things I liked: 1. The cost, $14 for 7 pairs of compression socks, great price.  #2 The colors, nice vibrant colors, good selection.  #3 The compression, nice and tight but still go on easily and they stay in place.  Things I didn't like: #1 My feet got exceptionally hit while wearing these socks with short hiking boots and while wearing very breathable Crocs.  Uncomfortable.  #2 The seams at the toe area are not smooth.  Not noticeable with the shoes I wore the socks with but if I was wearing tight shoes, I think they'd be noticeable.  Summary: Although not perfect, for $14 they're a good buy."
4.0,The watch is amazing. It certainly looks and feels much more expensive. My only complaint is that it is a bit hard to use. Mine did not come with any instructions and I did not find a manual online.
4.0,I love mine.  It's beautiful  I was so worried by reviews that I was going to cancel my order. Glad I didn't.
4.0,The Velcro on the small one is sewn sideways.
4.0,"This is NOT a complete Squid Game costume. You'll need to get the black shoes, gloves, belt, and mask separately.<br /><br />The red jumpsuit is actually decent quality, with a study-ish textured synthetic material. The zipper runs well, there are pockets on the back, and it generally fits per chart and looks good. (I bought Medium as a 5'7 man.)<br /><br />There is a mask included, that I'll have to find a use for in the future."
4.0,"Cute idea, all of us got a piece. Just a little something to remind my daughter how precious she is to me and her dad!"
4.0,"First off, I wanted to mention that this jacket was a little snugger than I expected for the size, so if you want to wear it over other clothing or use it to ward off the chill of air conditioning, you may wish to size up. Material is nice and light with fine perforations that offer very good sun protection while allowing fabric to breathe so you won't overheat while exercising. Thin fabric does tend to show every lump, strap, or buckle beneath it, so it's not going to hide figure flaws, but the styling and light blue color are nice. Great pockets and full front zipper. Well-constructed garment."
4.0,Loved how comfy they are! The pockets are a bonus!
4.0,"Met my expectations, but s bit small."
4.0,"i enjoy this necklace, it's great for V-necked shirts and added that added touch of 'edge'. It does get tangled VERY easily, and that is my only critique."
4.0,Interesting design. I'm a little scared about the material so haven't washed it yet. You can wear a contrasting slip inside and really make this top pop.
4.0,I really like it it fit exactly how I want it to...
4.0,"Good quality, flattering fit. All cotton so can shrink"
4.0,Pros:<br />-vibrant colors<br />-well made and has double lining<br />-ties- not Velcro tips so it can fit and size head length<br />Cons:<br />-advertised for &#34;baby&#34; but sizing is definitely for a toddler<br /><br />My only problem with this product is the advertising. When I ordered it it said baby sun hat but the sizing is clearly made for a toddler. I tried it on my daughter who is just under six months and it was huge on her. I do like that they are fully tied strings (rather than the little Velcro like on baby hat at target) because you can make it fit any China neck/ chin area.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the product it is really nice. The hat double lined- the inside is lined with a nice breathable white fabric. The outer fabric- I ordered polka dot blue- is a really pretty vibrant color and black out the sun but is still breathable so it doesn't get too hot. The hat also has little ears on it as an added cute factor- but one of our little ears never wants to stand up<br />Review by P. Thomas<br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for the promise to give an honest review after I have thoroughly tested the product. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I do not give good reviews just because I received a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  Use the &#34;helpful&#34; button if you liked my review.
4.0,These cufflinks are better looking than the picture
4.0,"True to size, very soft material. I will purchase again!"
4.0,"So if you have big thighs it‚Äôs not gonna be black when you wear it...the material is good, stretchy, and warm but the back of the fabric is white! So it stretches to look gray/white. If it had been black it would be a 10 star product.."
4.0,"I purchased this bra because it looked great online and I thought let me try it. To that end, it is pretty, but the fit for larger women does not equal the look. The cups are too soft and so the breast hang over the wire. The elastic straps do not hold, therfore, there is too much bounce. But they are okay for wearing around the house. I would not buy again or recommend them!"
4.0,Adorible but it broke but it's ok I fixed it it works well cute
4.0,The bow is tacky. Didn‚Äôt know one came with the dress
4.0,I like this top-the neck is a little high so I stretched it out a bit and I love it!
4.0,"Fits well and is made of a nice weight cotton.  Needs a few washings before it feels completely soft, however."
4.0,"This is a very nice sports bra - I love the 'happy' color, it is well constructed with what appears to be quality material, and it has a nice, smooth and flattering shape. My only complaint is that it runs small and so is a bit tight on me (tight in the band area). I am petite and normally wear an S in tops, and have recently moved up to an M in sports bras (I'm a 34A). I had ordered this in an M and I assume that is what I got (there is no print or label on the bra and it came in a clear plastic bag without any tags). It is not awfully uncomfortable - it's not like I'm distracted by it when I have it on or itching to get it off of me - but it's tighter than I would like and tight enough to leave a band mark on my skin afterwards."
4.0,They are a little tight
4.0,Very roomy and fashionable
4.0,I love everything about them case is so cute! they are comfortable and stylish! would recommend them to everyone for sure!
4.0,Nice comfortable flowy dress. It's too long for me and I'm 5&#34;3. I had to tie a knot so that it wouldn't drag on the floor. I normally wear a size M or L and ordered the Small and it still fits loose. I love that it also has pockets!
4.0,"I adore this dress, material is good. Sizing is spot on. A tad short, no bending over in this dress. Perfect for a wedding or any summer social event."
4.0,"I love the watch, but it beeps really loudly every hour and it can be very distracting at home and at school. Is there any way to turn it off?"
4.0,"I bought this with the intention of fixing my own watches ( most of which are about 32mm however; I did find myself wishing I had small sizes( seeing as how a buddy's watch also needed fixing) or just the 32mm bars but I just couldn't beat this price. These spring bars are durable, robust, and have certainly stood the test of time (which for me is a little over 6 months). I also found my self wishing that this product came with a spring bar tool but, with patience and a little maneuvering, they should install quite nicely. If you at a watch collector like myself, you should find that this product is well made and fairly priced. Only, I would recommend using a spring bar tool if you don't already have one."
4.0,"These are smaller then they appear. I was a little surprised but otherwise these are fabulous earrings. No matter what you wear these stand out (in a good way). Great, simple way to add a pop of color to any outfit. Inexpensive for sterling & turquoise, these would be 2x or 3x more in a store (I know, I sold earrings like this for years). I love turquoise. Turquoise never gets old or goes out of style. It's my favorite stone."
4.0,"The price of these Polaroid sunglasses was awesome. My husband has a pair but these lightweight plastic don't seem like they would be as sturdy as the metal frame ones. For one, when I had rec'd my glasses the envelope had been crushed and a lens had popped out. Luckily we were able to pop it back in but like I said the price is excellent."
4.0,I expected it to be bigger but all in all it was really nice for a 4yr old she loves it
4.0,"I snagged this tie just as something to try out, and I wanted to learned how to tie a bow tie, but this really is worth every penny. My buggest issue with it was that it smelled kinda funny and at first the smell was super strong but it fades and eventually there's no smell. Really good tie, easy to use. Definitely going to be wearing this one as often as possible."
4.0,Ok so I read the reviews and I tried it anyway. This dress is VERY short but I also have a tail so maybe if you don't have one it won't be so bad. This is more like a peplum top than a dress and the only place I could probably get away with wearing something this short will be on vacation. The material is stretchy polyester so because Im a bit chest heavy it seems to stretch but the material looks almost discolored because of the fabric stretching. It's cute but I'll be limited where I could wear this and feel comfortable.
4.0,Very well finished and useful
4.0,I love the color very vibrant. They fit just right. I just wear them around the house and they are very comfortable. Received numerous compliments from friends on them. Will be purchasing more in the future. Highly recommend.
4.0,It's very cute but very thick fabric
4.0,Very nice & comfy. Kids used this all the time for football practice for extra protection
4.0,I'm not sure about the other reviews because I just got this shirt in the mail and it is really really cute. It has a lining under the shirt so it's not super thin like some of the reviews say. And I ordered a large and I'm normally a medium large so the sizing wasn't too far off. I didn't give it a 5 because I haven't washed it yet.
4.0,I loved the design but the weight of the broach on front pulled it down a bit and it didn't look as nice or as fitted as you'd want a choker to look.
4.0,"Well made, not too heavy wish I would have noticed it wasnt black but it's hard to tell. Beautiful earrings."
4.0,Order one more!!
4.0,"Men's small is very short in the leg.  The military softshell pants I've gotten in the past have all had the variable waist around 30"", and an inseam around 32"" - The waist on these is in that range but the inseam on the pants I received is max a 30"" and seemed closer to a 28"" really.  I even laid them down on top of another pair of pants of mine (to compare inseam), and they really are short.  I double checked the size to make sure these weren't a small short, military size (they are not).  Honestly disappointed - these appear nice, but the fit isn't even close for me."
4.0,Pretty but took so long to get I forgot I ordered them.
4.0,"Bought 2 boxes 4 bands and they all were nice! Quality made and looks good on my watch. They only thing I didn't like about the bands were the width, I thought they would have been a little bigger and wider, Instead they are  the classic watch band size. Which isn't a problem because I have a pretty decent watch collection but upon purchasing i assumed they'd have more a broader stance like they bands I previously had on my watch. Nevertheless still a great product."
4.0,Good support.  Fits well. Definitely a casual shoe
4.0,"its not the wool or silk version, but for the price its great. I anointed mine with oil and put some frankincense & myrrh perfume on it."
4.0,"At 5'4&#34;, 170lbs, this shirt fits a little snug and long.  I ordered an XL, but could have pulled off the XXL. I may try to alter the bottom, but if not, it will still look fine with leggings. I typically wear a 12/14.  I ordered up one size to the XL.  It's not obscenely tight, but it's not loose.  I would order this again."
4.0,I‚Äôm going to exchange them for another pair.
4.0,Would like to be able to choose length also.  Seems the bigger they are the longer they are.<br />I have to get them shortened which adds to the price.
4.0,"Bought these to replace a pair of slightly ""fancier"" mask / snorkel bags we took to the Florida Keys two years ago. Despite careful rinsing, the metal hardware on both of those rusted to pieces. Exposure to a week of salt air and water is brutal.<br /><br />So this time I looked for a set with no metal, and found these. All mesh, except for the vinyl-type mask pockets, which close with big-toothed plastic zippers. The main bag is an easy drawstring affair. Each bag held mask, snorkel, fins, booties, and a little bottle of anti-fog with no problems. They look great, hose clean easily, and will NEVER rust. I can imagine someone needing a bigger or heavier bag for a lot of gear, or for, say, really big scuba fins, but for our light / medium duty purposes, they were perfect, and a great deal at the price.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
4.0,Looks just like the picture. Very cute. A little on the small side
4.0,These earrings a very pretty and hang nicely on the ear. I would buy them again in different colors.
4.0,"I'm trying to make sure I write more amazon reviews because I find them so helpful.<br /><br />I know it's a black suit and I live in a place where it gets to be over 100 during the summer.  But I feel like this suit isn't as breathable as others.  However, it's super cute and we suffer for vanity, right?"
4.0,"Pretty good for price, wish it was a little longer!"
4.0,"Broke after 3 months. Can‚Äôt take the wind at all. So disappointed. Would love a refund or another product! EDITED: After writing this review, customer service was in touch right away for a refund of the product. For that, they‚Äôll have my business again! Thank you!!! A breath of fresh air!"
4.0,Thank you and they are Fun to wear but only thing is the fake color eyes has to much clear glue and it looks like it got all over the eyes but other then that CUTE!
4.0,"This looks good on me, can't wait to wear it."
4.0,They were darker than some others. I like tht
4.0,"Excellent fit, good looking, irons beautifully."
4.0,"I was hoping these would be more snug... kind of surprised, given everyone said they were a bit tight! I'm a 34 c-d and these are comfortable and fairly supportive, no nip-show-thru. But not snug at all. for reference, I'm 5'7&#34;, 150, normal/athletic."
4.0,"arrived promptly, great for the price  The fabric was a nicer quality than I expected."
4.0,Storing a couple of these in glove compartment for sudden showers.
4.0,He really likes it and it's something different
4.0,I like them super light and things then I thought but Def a good buy
4.0,so far so good. loving it
4.0,"Loved this tank, Great fit!"
4.0,My daughter likes to wear this and uses it when she's stressed or or thinking
4.0,"Soft and comfortable but the waist sits pretty low on the hips. Definitely order size up. In love with the color!<br />I wasn't sure about them based on the reviews, but I'm very happy I got them."
4.0,"They work perfectly for what I needed it for (dorm room-type living situation).  They're a little on the thin side, but thick enough I don't worry about wearing them into the bathroom - and they're great for use around my room."
4.0,The shark slippers are worn regularly by the teenager who requested them.<br /><br />This brand only fits okay on people who have narrow feet.<br /><br />I think they are most likely very uncomfortable for people with wide feet.
4.0,A little small but cute. Thin.
4.0,"The shoe for the most part fits good, it's ever so slightly bigger than how the size should feel, however I would be afraid to order half size smaller for fear of being too small, so nonetheless it's not a big difference and I can live with, everything else looks great!"
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äô‚Äô 115lbs I bought the medium but could have bought the small with it fitting fine. The medium fits good, I like the draw string so you can adjust the tightness. What I don‚Äôt much care about is how long the top ‚Äòflap‚Äô or ‚Äòruffle‚Äô is. It kind of makes me feel like Ariel wearing a sheet. It covers the draw string completely which covers the flattering details of the dress, again, making it look like a tiered sheet. Luckily I know my way around a sewing machine so I‚Äôll cut off the excess and hem it. Other than that, the fabric is lightweight, a cooling Summer type of fabric, and the color I got(the red floral) is beautiful."
4.0,"I like the necklace, so does my husband. I am extremely happy with the price. Does not look ""cheap"".  I was hoping that the pendant would be a bit smaller, but it is still nice.  I wore it yesterday and it was very comfortable. I was hoping that the chain would be nicer, but you can easily switch out the chain for another one."
4.0,"Bought these and are not soft, but not hard, fit well and comfortable, good price"
4.0,Somewhat Large but I like them big.
4.0,Great sandals. A little narrow but not uncomfortable. Great for use after the shower or bath and even the pool!
4.0,Comfortable watch band and fits small wrist.
4.0,"They're actually a bit large and difficult to get in. The pins also kind of fell out of the fox's heads super easily, and I had to bend one of the attachments for the body into place because it was hanging weirdly. The pins likely need to be just a hair longer - I had to really fit them tightly to my ears, which caused my ears some pain. I might just have to replace that portion myself later once I figure out how.<br /><br />That said, they're definitely adorable. Because they're hand-made, I can only honestly remove 1 star, because I personally couldn't do this myself! I'll likely buy a set of these for a friend and just replace the earring portion myself :)"
4.0,Grippy things on soles wear off quick but otherwise perfect. Stay put all day and really like the cotton bottoms
4.0,"Fits exactly as expected. I wish they had a little more flex. Other than that, they're great for EMS."
4.0,Fits great. I ordered the Large and I'm and a big girl with DD breasts. It has plenty of room. It is quite thin and you will need to wear a tank or camisole under it.
4.0,I love the figures
4.0,"Product as described and pictured. However, please note these are small. Barely fit my 4 and 5 year old who are very small for their age."
4.0,"Keeps good time and comfortable.  Has nice gold surrounding.  The only negative thing, it's very small and can be mistaken for only a woman's watch.  4 stars"
4.0,"Nice shorts - I like the feel, material, color and fit of them on me.  I ordered the large, and I'm 6 feet tall, 190 lbs.  These should be nice for the summer.  They washed well the first time, but time will tell how they hold up.  I'll update the review after a few more washings.<br /><br />The large fit me well - I'm not a big muscular guy, but have some tone to me.  I'm shedding my winter weight, and working back to 185.  At 185 they should fit great.  If you aren't on the leaner side of things, you might want to go up one size as they aren't loose through the hips - not tight, but not a loose fit.<br /><br />One thing I'd change is the white waist lace - make it either the same color as the shorts or a nice complementary color.  White is just so...plain.  It doesn't look bad, but another color would be better.<br /><br />Good shorts for hanging out and sleeping in."
4.0,I like the material and it's a comfortable fit needed a larger size to wear it like the picture
4.0,Shorts are exactly as pictured & I'm pleased I purchased them. The only thing is they do seem to run big so any future buyers keep that in mind.
4.0,"I like this halter top, but it's a bit snug in the tummy area. Other than that,  it is comfortable for working out or something casual."
4.0,"This bag reminded me when I was in high school. The design is simple and at the moment is my go to bag, it was zippers inside which I like and I could fix my iPad with out a problem in this bag"
4.0,"This dress is nicely made but it was very large for the size and looked like a moomoo on a larger framed girl. Maybe with a belt it might help but I haven't tried it yet. I was going to try to exchange it for a smaller size but didn't have the time with medical issues. Otherwise, it was delivered swiftly and the material is very durable. Lovely~!"
4.0,"Shirt goes hard, just small with not much stretch"
4.0,"good quality, not a lot of size options, the largest size doesn't leave enough to tuck in the leather strap"
4.0,"I ordered a black and a white. They are very, very comfortable. I was looking for a bra-ish that was easy on my shoulders. As a generously endowed person, bras can be so painful and really hard on the shoulders. These bras don't really provide support if you have large breasts, but they do contain them, so it's great for when I am at home, and it does stop the dreaded under boob sweat. The white one is a little larger than the black one."
4.0,"The hat was cute and more for style and share rather than the material I was expecting. I ended up returning it. There is nothing wrong with it, but I prefer sun hats that feel like they are a quick dry material for playing in water. This felt like a thick cotton and I was worried it would not dry quickly for water play or that it would be too hot.  Super cute looking, though!"
4.0,I order a blue and grey 2pack but got two blue.  I really wanted the grey more than the blue so that kinda ruined them.  But at least they fit great and the sizing is perfect.
4.0,"I was tempted to send it back for a refund, not because I didn't like it but was worried it wouldn't hold up to constent wear. Well I took a chance and glad I did! I've been wearing 24/7 without any issues at all!"
4.0,"Good for the price got them for my autistic son but they were to tight on his head, but after stretching them out a bit they are ok"
4.0,This was very cute and fit as expected. I will be saving and using for my second daughter on her first birthday.
4.0,I retuened this product. It was small for anyone. More for a child under 10 yrs old. I liked the hat..good hat for the price
4.0,UPDATE 3/28/22:  Decided to order a replacement. Return was free.  New item was perfect!<br /><br />Plus: Material is very soft and the perfect weight. Fits appropriately - I am usually a large and this fit great -except one arm.<br />Con: One bell sleeve is sewn Incorrectly making one sleeve smaller in diameter. Which didn‚Äôt fit.<br /><br />Unfortunately I will be returning.
4.0,These jeans are not low rise at all...At least on me they are not...I am 5&quot;4...130 lbs...and they sit high...my hips are 38 so i ordered a 9..i probably could have ordered a size down...They have a lot of stretch to them...They are very cute in person i just wish they sat lower on my hips:(
4.0,I love it. It's warm and stylish.
4.0,Creases easily
4.0,"Fits somewhat small, and I got a size bigger than suggested. Still cute though :)"
4.0,"Didn't like that was sent a wrong shirt. Was small checkered blue, white and light blue.<br />Although, liked it still. Lol fit good ."
4.0,Very good fits great!
4.0,Just as pictured and  came n time for Christmas even though I ordered it a bit late. I guess a bit smaller then I thought but still fits Nicely
4.0,"sturdy, good basic black sunglasses, i like the cat eye frame with the round lenses. but they're a little small so i wouldn't recommend if you have a larger head (mine is normal size maybe a little larger and they fit fine)"
4.0,"Beautiful ring, though the only drawback is that the metal is somewhat soft and the two ends can pull apart if snagged on something (like pulling your hand out of your pocket)."
4.0,We go this bag to use when we are hiking or walking with our dog. We need something to fit a couple bottles of water for us and our dog plus her portable water bowl. Or even when we go to the beach to carry our stuff. So far it has worked great. Not real heavy and stays on my husbands or my back.
4.0,Even prettier in person. And very roomy !
4.0,"I really like this top! Comfortable and great for summer. It is a printed top. I thought at first it might be embroidered, but it's still cute. Have gotten a few complaints on it when I recently wore it."
4.0,I am 5'3&#34; and 127 lbs. 34 C/D - ordered medium bc small tends to be too small at the top for me.  The bottom were fine bc of the high waist design and the front ruching is flattering especially since I have a slight mummy pooch still.  Top is a bit lighter than I expected but it is a nice peachy orange color (that was the only reason for the 1 less star rating).  Most importantly it is sturdy and functional 2 piece that I can confidently swim in without worrying about it coming off as I would with my other bikinis.  Looking forward to using it in Hawaii for spring break ;-D.
4.0,I ordered one for myself in 2017 and it has handles at the top and is a bit bigger than this one.  It also has a padded back this one did not.
4.0,Would buy again hand wash recommend
4.0,they do what they were designed to do.no issues i would recommend
4.0,"It looks very flattering. The shorts rode up a little for me, I may have bought the wrong size but the waistline was comfortable. Material seems sturdy and not see through. I‚Äôve only used it once so far"
4.0,"Very nice! I love this. The style is great, the material is good, it fit me well. It met my expectations and I am pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"I usually wear a large/extra large so I went with extra large. It is a little more snug than I had hoped. I haven‚Äôt washed it yet and I am a little nervous.<br />It does feel like one of those heavy cotton t-shirts, which wasn‚Äôt what I expected. But all in all, it‚Äôs a pretty good shirt"
4.0,too big but pretty
4.0,Everyone loves this shirt.
4.0,The dress is gorgeous but the3 navy stripes are a little snug around the waist. I love Miusol Dress I have about 6 of them they all fit perfect. I'm a short and a curvy but Miusol dress always fit just right.
4.0,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NIECE WHO IS OBSESSED WITH L.O.L
4.0,"Pretty shoes that were perfect for prom night. However, they are not very comfortable, as there is no cushioning inside the shoe. No show socks might help with some of the discomfort around the toes. I think I wore these for three or four hours before my feet were killing me. I ordered these in size 9 and they fit me perfectly, just as a 9 should."
4.0,So far so good!  Pretty eyeglass case!
4.0,Super cute little gifts for literally anyone‚Ä¶ Put a quality Chapstick in the keychain and use it as a gift topper on presents or add a little gift card and tape the keychain to the envelope. Everyone loves these
4.0,My niece loved the bracelet!!!
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet, packaging was a little lacking and one of the rings it clasps into snapped. However, the bracelet is still shiny and not fading despite constant wear."
4.0,"As I like Van Heusen products I jumped at the chance to review these cufflinks. While very simple I found them to be a good product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to use<br />look pretty good<br />solid build.<br />Come in awesome box<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some flecking of colors<br /><br />Just so you know:<br />I Received this product free in return for an honest review<br /><br />Is my review missing something?<br />I think that honest, well thought out reviews sometimes are forced to take the place of personal experience while online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from reviews and work hard to return the favor as best as I can. I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to address it."
4.0,"I expected it to be worse in quality? yeah the paint job isn't the greatest thing and it's not that comfortable to wear on the bridge of the nose but it doesn't feel fragile or anything, a little heavy but over all not unbearable"
4.0,"Slightly smaller than expected. Dyed dark brown for a costume and the threads didn't take the dye. Not complaining about that part, just noting in case someone planned to do the same."
4.0,Arrived on time and as listed. Txs :)
4.0,"nice and soft, keeps me warm and comfortable"
4.0,Bag feels like good quality.
4.0,The corset itself is beautiful and well made but It was too small. I plan to order a new one soon and gift this one to a friend slightly smaller than myself.
4.0,Busy a whole in the finger area
4.0,"I love this long vest so much.  It does run very small, so size up!  I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it.  It is unusual to see a long puffer vest."
4.0,Happy withe gloves. They are just right and help in my shop.
4.0,Smaller than I expected and the chain is very short. Best for a child.
4.0,"I'm petite and this is a little long on me. Makes me look a bit frumpy, but that may or may not be the fault of the sweater! The sweater is a very neutral neutral and a poor color choice for me, especially as I've been out of commission with illness for a month and am relatively pale.<br /><br /> Having share all that, I would recommend this for women with warmer, more vibrant coloring. The best feature of its design is the stripes in the sleeves. They're not obvious and they're three or four inches wide, darker and lighter. Wear any color sleeve under this sweater (excepting another light neutral) and it shows up on the sweater very attractively, in my opinion.<br /><br />The sweater is lightweight, but not loose fitting. It has an expensive look and feel."
4.0,really cute dress... I couldn't tell if I would love or hate this when I ordered it but once I tried it on I loved it. It's a little tight in the shoulders/arms otherwise size is pretty close. I typically wear a 14-16 and got the XXL. Fabric is a little thin and since it is sheer up top you cant really wear a slip but it wasn't an issue.
4.0,Couldve been a bit tighter to be a true bodycon but looks and feels great
4.0,Small but comfortable
4.0,"I ordered an XL and it did fit me but not the underwear or the bra part of the halter top. I have a larger breast than most and with the padding it did not fit so i just removed the padding and the top fitted me fine after that. It was very comfortable to sleep in. The material is very soft and looks so cute as a little sleep top. I was able to sleep throughout the night with the top and it didn't slip or anything. I couldn't wear the underwear that came with it because my butt wouldn't fit in it, but it was super cute and loved that it was the matching set. I recommend wearing this to spice up romantic time with your partner but what i also did was just wear a nude spaghetti strap underneath it and just wore as a shirt and no one said anything. Its been super hot here in California so just made into a tank top and it works as both a shirt and a nightgown. I would recommend looking at the sizes before ordering to make sure you get the right size and would recommend ordering one size up. I received this product at a discount price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,One size. if you're curvy wear as a shirt. Very comfortable. Can't beat the price tag. Doesn't look as cheap as it costs.
4.0,It dented on first use just putting it in car.
4.0,They run Somewhat Big I wear a 61/2 got a 7 just a little big. But the look great.. I think 6 would be to small.
4.0,"Goes down mid calf, have to hem it up because I was expecting it to hang right at my knees. Way longer than I expected."
4.0,Just a little to tight at the neck but I do love the fit
4.0,"These moccasins are made in China using a nice leather outer shell, and faux fur inside.  It has a thick sole so that wearing them outside keeps you above the dampness to keep your feet relatively dry.  I wear them at work, the grey color pair, as if they were shoes.  They are comfortable!  The other pair i keep at home.<br /><br />The two pair i bought aren't much to look at as far as moccasins goes, but someone with some craft skill could fix them up.  The sole may need regluing after awhile.  A little rubber cement should do the trick.  For now, they're fine.  Just keeping an eye on them.<br /><br />I believe that, for what i paid for these slippers, they are a very good deal."
4.0,"Ok so first off I found this case and went to colors I really wanted a gold thick case fortunately they had a gold one it looked pretty thick. I purchased it. It arrived they day it said it would come. So far so good. But then of course Murphy‚Äôs law. The gold was not as dark as it was in the picture which was really upsetting. The case was pretty thick but not as thick as it looked in the picture. But i still love the case. It says that Touch ID works too. And it does! If not, BETTER! it‚Äôs also water proof. Not a bit of the phone is exposed to air. The ringer button doesn‚Äôt work though. So I have to take the whole case off to change it. One of my favorite things is that it‚Äôs not plastic or rubber it‚Äôs a soft mat material. Overall it‚Äôs a pretty nice case!"
4.0,"Exactly as ordered. I'd say these are probably 18 gauge. A little longer than I wanted; they're as long as the one put in when I got my eyebrow pierced to allow for swelling. I may try to fix that by adding a bead on the barbell before I screw the cap bead back on. Colors are pretty. I only got one duplicate, but I think it will be fun to mix and match the cap beads. Fantastic for the price."
4.0,"So cute! Fits as expected, came quickly, such a good buy!"
4.0,"Runs small, and although my wife says I have a big head I really dont."
4.0,"Nice shirt, thick material. Runs slightly smaller than I expected, but shirt has some stretch to it so it all works out."
4.0,Love this dress. So pretty for the low price.
4.0,"This is a good buy, but it‚Äôs REALLY big and it‚Äôs complicated to put on your wrist.<br />I normally need help with it."
4.0,Great dress for the price! Maybe order a size smaller than you think tho
4.0,"This is a pretty funny product, it will give everyone at the party a good laugh but it's kinda expensive for what you get although i dont regret buying it.<br />Good snug fit and the stuff on the glove doesnt come off easily so thats a plus"
4.0,Everyone asked me where I got it from!  It was a bit tight but I was wearing it anyways. For the price I couldn't ask for much more.
4.0,"I bought this because I had bent the latch on my watch's original band and was not able to find a replacement for purchase on Amazon. It was comfortable but I did not like the way it looked if I wasn't wearing anything else mint in color. I was later able to find a replacement original band and went back to it. There was absolutely no problems with it, just personal preference."
4.0,"It is as expected. We just received it and assembled it quickly. We found 3 small holes in the fabric. That was disappointing. It looks like staple holes. I won‚Äôt bother returning, but I‚Äôm disappointed! See picture. Also the fabric is light.<br />Because of its width, it wobbles a little but we haven‚Äôt tested it during wind conditions.<br />All in all, it‚Äôs worth the money."
4.0,I use it at school for my kids who need to fidgit.
4.0,"Durable, comfortable, good looking watch band. My only problem is that it is very hard to install on watch. I broke nails doing it."
4.0,"My hustand and I use identical eyeglass cases which we received from our eye doctors. I received 3 (purple, orange, and black) of these from my husband as a gift so that I wouldn't mistake his glasses for mine. These cases are near perfect: well made and protective.  The only reason a took off one star is because the design on the outside is not my style; that said, they fulfill the intended purpose."
4.0,"Ordered two size up, just fit. Smooth and comfortable, nice shape."
4.0,Great shoe warmer.
4.0,Very cute but slightly snug around the ankles.
4.0,Runs smaller than I expected
4.0,"Great jacket. I was hoping the &#34;off white&#34; would be a little more off-white than the photo, but the photo is definitely true to the actual color... it's basically just a bright white. This is NOT a high quality jacket -  it is VERY thin and looks silly if you wear something with sleeves underneath it because you can see them straight through the jacket. I had read a lot of reviews before purchasing so I knew it would be. However, if you wear it with a sleeveless blouse or dress, it looks great. The price was on point and it is crazy comfortable - stretchy and not constricting like most blazers. The rouched sleeves are flattering as is the draping in the front. I have gotten a lot of compliments when I've worn this. I love how a simple blazer (and such an inexpensive one, at that) can change the look of a whole outfit - it definitely kicks it up a notch and makes everything look polished.<br /><br />Since the material is so thin, I bet a darker color would be great because you could wear it with more things - in fact, I'm planning to purchase a black one in the future. Bottom line: I would definitely recommend, but just know what you're purchasing. :)"
4.0,Nice shoes and very comfortable
4.0,"It's very pretty, it just didn't fit."
4.0,Really well mad belts my Daughter loves them....
4.0,This really dresses up a pair of jeans....great go to top
4.0,Jogging suit is a nice outfit but I had to buy a bigger size because the top run small brought size L
4.0,"We bought this shirt as a birthday gift -- it was a hit. The shirt has a nice fit, but it was a bit stiff when we received it so we gave it a cold water wash to soften it before we gifted it. It worked!"
4.0,"I really like this dress on the model, but the cuts on the slits are a little awkward. If you pose just right it looks just like the picture, but if you move around, the cuts are squared and a little odd. I will still wear it though, considering it's super comfortable!"
4.0,Tuve wue devolverlos. La talla corre grande. Una menos est√° bien.
4.0,"Keeps good time.  Wrist band is coming apart near the buckle, though."
4.0,Very cute shorts but definitely not high waisted
4.0,"Talk about false advertising!<br />The item is good. Sure . The fabric is decent . Keeps me warm and looks fine . But I thought this was an artificial  bangme man  . Maybe next time I should read the item description. I didn't even think of that when my search was for "" adult fetish toys "" and the picture was saying everything I thought I needed to know . But no . It's a top . Keeps my chest toasty but my bumm needs what the picture is advertising"
4.0,"Does run small, I got a medium, should have got a large, I usually wear a medium in shirts even though I am 5‚Äô4, 155, I did buy a yellow in large, but still too small. I wear a size 6-8 in pants."
4.0,Perfect bag used for bridesmaids gift. Bags are great size for overnight or carry on
4.0,One size fit ALL works..üëçüèº For üö¥
4.0,Very cute. I was afraid they would be flimsy but they‚Äôre pretty sturdy. I‚Äôll see how they hold up.
4.0,"Did not know what to expect. Amazing brightness in the day - actually better than daylight. Night driving is somewhat better tho' not as much as I would like.  It does cut the dazzle from the on coming headlights by a fraction, so in that it is good. I have used them twice at night so far and they are useful. The daylight tho' is much better and brighter. The downside is the frames are uncomfortable to wear. Too stiff and almost painful at times. Perhaps this will get better in time. However I am going to keep them and keep trying them at night as well as daylight. Not a bad product!"
4.0,Really love the bracelet. I wish it was sized a little differently. It feels kind of heavy but I do love the look of it
4.0,Dress is a bit long but fits well material is thick spandex
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments on the dress. It‚Äôs a bit thin, but not see through!"
4.0,"I bought these masks because I needed some without vents in them.  These masks are comfortable.  I like the material that the ear loops are made of and that the ear loops are adjustable.  I also like that I can insert an extra filter into the pocket  to increase the layers of protection.  I also like that they come in different patterns, though I'd enjoy seeing an autumn version, made with more classical patterns."
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute casual shirt but thinner material than I expected and no waistband at the bottom. Fits a little small I went a size up and fits perfectly.
4.0,I like its. its great for the era we are in
4.0,"I really enjoy this backpack! I used to have to walk several blocks to get where I needed to go, and I had this comfortable bag, that I could keep everything I needed in, and any books for reading or anything else. My 15"" laptop fits in it very easily and it fits a lot inside even with my laptop in it.<br /><br />Good value for the money, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for this style of bag."
4.0,"I LOVED this dress and was impressed with the quality for the price but unfortunately had to return it because it was too short. I'm 5'6"" and it barely covered my bum. I think this dress is best for 5'3"" or shorter, maybe 5'4"" if you have a smaller chest and therefore not as much of the length is consumed up top."
4.0,So far so good. I bought this for my son only one week ago and he seems happy with it.
4.0,Love the material and shine. Can‚Äôt wait wait for a night out
4.0,"I really liked the style, but the fit was much smaller than expected.  It did not cover well up top for me."
4.0,"It wears well, great spring or summer colors and light weight fabric. Fits me well and looks stylish with jeans or shorts!"
4.0,"order large,wit just right now,but worry about after I wash it.But very nice shirt."
4.0,"It is a very innovative product.  I like the case and the way the muffs flip to fit in the case.  I had trouble figuring out how to install the batteries, but once I figured it out, It was easy."
4.0,These shirts are so soft and comfortable! An amount was ordered for a coordinated party and they were amazing! The entire party still kept cool in the late August night air. Will order in many more colors!<br /><br />However. Shipping more than 2 at a time splits the order up and can not guarantee shipping/delivery on time. This order arrived in 4 shipments sent from all over and pushed the customization timeline very far behind.
4.0,Quality fabric cargo pants. Love them.
4.0,Great accessory to round out the Halloween costume.
4.0,"These look great, and are pretty well made. I would buy these again."
4.0,"Good stuff, only complaint is I received 1-6g and 3-4g. But I highly recommend the stainless steel."
4.0,"I love the color and style of the dress, however after one washing I noticed some thinning of the fabric and some snags."
4.0,"I wear these under my running shorts. Love the length, I'm tall (5' 9.5&#34;) and they go just above my knee, just where I like them. Since I'm a little curvy, the back comes down a little. But since I have shorts over them it's not a big deal."
4.0,"The quality of the fabric is exceptional. My husband loves how soft and comfortable it is. However, even for a tall person, the sleeves and pant legs are too long. It was a good fit elsewhere, but he had to fold them up."
4.0,"While I'm not a huge fan of the looks of these jeans, they do the job. They are rugged, and they fit well enough. They've been through the wringer a few times and seem to be holding up well. I'd say they were worth it."
4.0,"i like the look, they are really cute, but the fit is odd.  too tight in the waist and too big in the legs.. looked really boxy, cut for a mans body not a girls body"
4.0,"Sized a bit on the smaller side so order a size up...I think they are marked in asian sizes. They are made well, and wash up nicely. I ride 3-4x a month in theses shorts and they are pretty resilient in material compared to the big name brands."
4.0,"I sized up based on other reviews to a large - and that was a mistake. The arm holes flare out because they are too big. It does allow me to knot the shirt, which is cute, but I would recommend going true to size. The quality of the shirt seems good for the price, and overall I am satisfied."
4.0,"Not too much, with just enough &#34;pop&#34;. It compliments my dress."
4.0,"It's pretty, and I'm not sorry I got it, but the metal around all the stones are a bit rough"
4.0,"very lovely stones, but the clasp broke on the second wearing and it is hard to fine a place to repair it."
4.0,The cap itself is good and the ‚Äòspeakers‚Äô are adequate. Don‚Äôt expect theater-quality sound out of these but they do what is intended very well. Have yet to try it with the phone feature.
4.0,"Pros:<br />- dark, dark, dark<br />- cool vintage look<br /><br />Cons:<br />- removable side pieces a bit difficult to put back together (lens is not perfectly round, which I thought was kinda weird ?!), would advise against disassembling (I did so only to use as summer sunglasses without looking too much like a dork in the big city)... this is only a minor annoyance though<br />- case (branches don't fold that tightly so the case can't close completely / also the case feels very fragile, and while I haven't broken this one yet I totally had that exact same case (w/ another pair of julbo sunglasses) die on me after 2 weeks of moderate use)"
4.0,"Looks cute, but they do get hot! Your breathing goes down the front of your neck and gets trapped inside the fabric. My neck/chin end up quite sweaty."
4.0,This blouse is awesome. Fits a little tight in the breast arm area. But overall beautiful and comfortable. Cool fabric. Would buy more in different colors
4.0,Great moisture wicking properties.  Great Fit!  Nice cuff!  Great looks!  One downfall in my opinion is the price.  Pick em up on sale and enjoy!
4.0,"I really like it, fits well, material is nice. I'm using it for my vacation wardrobe"
4.0,luv them.
4.0,"fit, look good and do what they promise. Took a bit to put on, as they are tight, but than again, if they were not, one would loose the glasses. I wish they had more colour choices but certainly happy to give 4 stars plus. Ernie New Zealand"
4.0,Very nice just bigger then i thought
4.0,It's exactly what I expected- 12 pairs of lace trim for my boots. arrived sooner then expected. Wonderful color selection.
4.0,really fun and cool looking sunglasses
4.0,It fits great.  I paired it with leggings an high boots.  The material feel great.  It feels really comfortable.
4.0,Muy lindo gracias.
4.0,"This necklace is very cute, but really only suitable for children.  I would not wear it, but both of my children love it!"
4.0,"I want to like this shirt, but I am sure I put a size large in my cart, and when I ordered it somehow it was changed to a xxl. It is a comfortable fabric, but too big for me."
4.0,Great looking covers but need to be very careful during replacement as it easily break.
4.0,"A bit on the big size, good embroidery and well made."
4.0,Everything in the photo was given. The only problem was with the mask. One of the mask strips were barely hold on so i just ripped it off and sowed it back together. Other than that everything was fine.
4.0,Gf loved the necklace it but a big smile on her face
4.0,Very pretty. They look just like pictures. I wouldnt use these to gauge up with like I did. They are alittle rough on the newly stretched ear. I had to go buy glass ones but these still did there purpose
4.0,Good cloak to go with any kind of Halloween costume that uses them
4.0,"Love the look if it were true to size. I ordered by the chart and it is a little tight and they don't offer an XXL. Weight of fabric is good, color is true, design is nice, just runs a bit small."
4.0,A kind of large for my head
4.0,"I like this over blouse.  It's perfect for evenings that are too warm for a jacket, but I want something for the night air."
4.0,"This is not a bad product, not at all.<br /><br />My wife most assuredly does not have man-hands, but these gloves were a bit small.  Their stretchiness got them on just fine, and actually that tightness was a very nice fit for them.<br /><br />Possibly because they were stretched a tad beyond what was probably intended when these were designed, these gloves were move opaque than I had anticipated.  Once on, they are most definitely not pure white, but assume a tad of that taupe, that peachy-ness that comes through from the hue of the skin beneath.  (You can see a bit of this in the item's photograph.)  It's not really that big a deal for me, but if you're looking for truly white gloves, these probably won't do it.<br /><br />Shipping was quick, and the item was well packaged.<br /><br />Bottom line: nice little pair of dress-up gloves, at a good price."
4.0,Really nice they were internally threaded and really nice
4.0,"It's a very warm hat and the color is a lovely bright green. I have one problem with it though- it slowly works its way up my head. I don't think I have an egg-shaped head, but this hat acts as if I do. I just tug it down periodically because it's comfy and warm otherwise."
4.0,Would definitely order from you again.  This is a great product.
4.0,"Good quality, but not memory foam and fabric lining not removable"
4.0,"the torso is a bit tight but the sleeves are long.. However, the blouse is pretty cute."
4.0,I normally where a medium and I should have gotten this in a small.  The top of the tank is very loose on me.  Love they green.
4.0,Pants were huge but I was able to fold them over and they were better. Still like the outfit especially for the money  was perfect.
4.0,"Purchased for my mother in-law, decent quality for the price"
4.0,Cute. Decent quality for the price. We haven‚Äôt used them too much so I can‚Äôt comment on durability.
4.0,Not sure if I can say it runs big or small. What I can say is the bust area runs big. And I bought a small which should be btwn 32-34<br />.... I would say it's made for busty women with smaller hips.<br />I could have bought a medium for my 43 hips. But I would have alot of work to do for my 34 bust.<br /><br />But I love it.
4.0,"Everything is really cute. However, the shirt wasn't wide enough to fall off the shoulder. I had to makeshift it to have it come off the shoulder."
4.0,"I love these! They are soft, comfortable and look nice. The product seems like good quality and will last. It's a little warm during the summer months, but great during the cooler months! Delivery was fast."
4.0,Good product be nice to have directions included
4.0,"This top fits perfectly and is flattering as well. After returning four other tops that were not at all attractive, it was refreshing to see that this time I agreed with other reviewers. The bottom does curl slightly which is why I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars."
4.0,"I have heard great things about this brand and bought them to participate in obstacle course mud runs like Tough Mudder. Unfortunately, we entered into a pandemic so I have not been able to test these out. My last compressions socks came out ""browned"" with mud streaks even after a few washes so I'm hoping the darker colors will hide that even if it also comes out stained despite numerous washes. I can definitely feel the compression around my leg and look forward to testing these out in the future.<br /><br />I would say it fits true to size. I am between a small and medium and bought a medium. I will be returning for a small."
4.0,Very nicely made. Very pretty.
4.0,"Nice design but the elastic at the back gets worn out after a few wears. It was beautiful while it lated however. Also, the pasrt f the headband where the glitter is seems to be made from a parpery kind of material instead of fabric or plastic so that mad eit look a little cheap as well but the deisgn was beautiful and they were shipped quickly."
4.0,Great strap working well so far for my Vostok Amphibia Scuba Dude
4.0,"A little thin for my liking, but it will be great in the summer months."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, I am a size 18 and the largest size is a little tight across the chest."
4.0,This outfit is perfect for bday party and photoshoot. It‚Äôs fabulous and cute fits perfectly for her age!
4.0,"Real nice but very tiny, smaller than a pinky nail"
4.0,"They're OK. But check the size: I'm L and purchased 2L ... Will buy 3L next time (not for the waist but to get a little more length at the shoulder straps.<br /><br />The size/tightness of waist - thigh (plus leg length) are OK per size (2L in this case). The weak point is the shoulder straps stitching is sub-par as I busted parts on first wear. I have a sewing-kit to repair the shoulder - straps - stitching so not a big deal. The bottom of the legs have zippers ... That's a plus if you have big feet! The padding at the ""seat"" is the same as other brands: good."
4.0,"Very cute! Quick delivery! Only negative is that the shoe laces are elastic so my toddler pulls shoes off frequently because of that, but otherwise great!"
4.0,Purchased as a gift . . . it arrived as promised and looks to be exactly as advertised. The proof will be how the belt holds up with use.
4.0,"A little small for the sizing, but are pretty decent."
4.0,Absolutely loved this outfit it's so swanky and fit my daughter perfectly. She loved it. It lost a star cause it's quality was a little cheaply made so on first wash and wear we got a hole in the back from bad stitching but I fixed with some thread and a needle so it's fine now.
4.0,Nice pajamas but too small
4.0,These are comfy and the quality is what you‚Äôd expect for the price. I bought a second pair after receiving my first!
4.0,"I'm pretty impressed, I have to say.  I got them as an item to try, maybe they'd work well with some items I own, let's see how it goes.<br /><br />It did take a while to play with them and understand how they work.  They are not like a traditional bra where you are wearing Over the Shoulder Boulder Holders.  You don't pour your breast into these and strap it on.<br /><br />It's much more like putting a hand on either breast, and interlacing your fingers in the middle.  Then you don't have straps or bands going around, so you can feel your shirt.  But instead of hands, it feels like warm raw chicken breast.  It looks that way too.<br /><br />Once I figured out how to put them on I put them in my drawer thinking I'd find a purpose for them &#34;some time&#34;.  Well, then I remembered a dress I like that has super thin straps, maybe this bra would work.  Just for a few hours.<br /><br />It did take a while to get used to the feeling of warm chicken breasts holding my breasts, but then I did forget about them.  Or it.  I even put the bra through the ultimate test and I went clothes shopping.  On and off, on and off in the changing room.  The bra held on without an issue and looked super cute in all of my new clothes.  I'm a 34D/DD, it's awesome to NOT have straps on my back showing through my shirts.  Or to be able to manage an off the shoulder shirt.<br /><br />I liked this one so much that I've ordered another that's less chicken breast feeling.  I don't know if I'll like that one as much, but this one is awesome."
4.0,I was worried about quality based on other reviews and price but I wanted a large skeleton watch. I have had this about a week and I am very happy so far.  The watch looks great and runs well so far.  I feel the band looks a little cheap but not enough to change it. I would not hesitate at all to buy another one.
4.0,Love to wear it.
4.0,Fit perfectly. Nice matrrisl
4.0,"The color, fabric, and style are perfect but the arm holes on the XL 6shirt are huge. You have to wear a sport bra with the shirt."
4.0,"Nice warm socks, runs a little small"
4.0,"Super cute, light weight top.  Another product I purchased for my teen to use as a cover to her undergarments.  I believe it is not meant to be supportive but it is so adorable."
4.0,Very cute! Wouldve gave 5 stars but a little cheaper made then i thought when buying. Hope they last!
4.0,Love these. Fit perfect
4.0,"Pretty good quality. Looks great, just like the picture! I love it."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù with 34DD and 150lbs. I bought a size up and the shirt fits well, a little longer than expected. Soft material, not too thin, but will probably want to wear a cami underneath since it‚Äôs slightly see-through and reveals my belly flaws. True to color as shown."
4.0,"Nice, a little short for a dress and I'm 5'1&#34;. :)"
4.0,Gray one tore easily. But overall like them
4.0,"For the price and versatility it's great!<br />I bought this to keep in my bag (it can be folded) in case I bought extra stuff at the airport because the bag has the ability to be used with a carry on suit case<br />However, with the new airport regulations taking extra luggage may not be that easy<br />I went on vacation recently and I used it to carry a large rectangular game for my son<br />The bag does not have reinforcement so it is large and somewhat clumsy if the bag is not full but it has the added advantage of being able to be folded and pulled out when needed<br />If you travel a lot it is a good buy"
4.0,Super comfortable! I love the thick stretchy waistband!
4.0,"I was pleased with the black beaded rosaries which were selected for two high school graduates from our Catholic Church.  The rosary appears to be well constructed and I especially liked the black addition to the crucifix.  I ordered with little time to spare before they were to be presented, but the order was filled right away and the rosaries actually arrived a day earlier than anticipated."
4.0,"Highly recommend! Great dress and great price!! My daughter is a border line size 8... probably more like a size 9/10 but I ordered a size 8 based on the reviews saying that the dress runs big, so it is slightly larger than most size 8 dresses but not a huge difference in size. Great purchase!<br />***Update***One strap broke within one hour of received and wearing it; however, easy fix. Reduced one star but all in all still a good purchase."
4.0,Like this shirt. It‚Äôs cool comfortable also. The only downside is the length is very short.
4.0,"I really like these round circle glasses. I got the small pair so they were a good size for my face. I didn't give it five stars because they can be a bit funky when you wear them at night, I couldn't see very well with them on but it might have been me and the fact that I wear low prescription glasses. However, they were just what I expected and very comfortable."
4.0,"it runs small, but it is comfortable if you put your socks on"
4.0,"Looks great! The shading of the suit are somewhat off if you aren‚Äôt shaped exactly like the character. The suit does get slightly transparent when stretched tight so careful bending over. But it‚Äôs fits well, is comfortable and warm. It does look great."
4.0,"Fit well with Chucks as sometimes they skip, however, since they don't have the gel on the inside of the heel to hold them in place."
4.0,"Everything is perfect. Fits several cards. Good for my room key and Id,an debit card. Only downside is that my card on the clear plastic side doesn't work when I try to tap it on the security door of my building so I have to take my card out. But otherwise kepps everything together."
4.0,My pair a slightly irregular.  The toes don't match (angle-wise) and the eyes for the laces have different widths.  See photo for reference.
4.0,My son wanted these to go with an Anime costume.  They seem to fit him well and the quality seems good for the money.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because he just tried them on and hasn't worn them yet.  Only time will tell if they hold up or are comfortable.
4.0,"Please be aware that this dress has ZERO stretch. When it came to choosing a size, I went with the size chart provided in the photos and it ended up fitting exactly as it should. My measurements are 40-32 and I chose the XL. My only issue is that the arms are tight but not to the point where I feel miserable in the dress. I need to include that bit of information because while it doesn't bother me too much, I know that is a deal breaker for some! Other than that, the dress has good construction (cotton) and a great length."
4.0,I liked them the material could of been a tad better one of the eyeballs already fell off
4.0,Took both these charms off the chain it came with and made two 16 inch necklaces.  Cute charms!
4.0,"My grandson loved this hat! He loves everything fish, and this was really different."
4.0,Had to buy an ear cuff to help keep it  on my ear but other than that it is nice
4.0,"This Yoga Shirt with Bra is very cute but unfortunately runs a bit small. I thought my daughter would really like this for wearing to the gym but size wise, it didn't work out for her. She normally wears a large in shirts and I ordered the XL but it still is too snug on her. The bra part is what's more tight on her than the black tank top part.<br /><br />We both loved the style and design of this and how it's a racerback style back. You see the bra part and the coral color just really stood out under the arms and on the back. The bra part was snug around her and was digging in. She normally wears a size 38C Bra and the chest area fit and covered her but the around the back area was snug. The black tank over it actually fit her where she could have worn it. It was a little fitting to her but not to the point where it was too tight or uncomfortable. She just would have preferred that to also be a little bigger had the bra part fit her.<br /><br />The material of both are really nice and good quality. They have a nice thickness to them and there were no loose threads or seams. So overall, it's a really cute Yoga Tank but definitely you need to order up a size or two I would suggest.<br />I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
4.0,"These are a little big and hang down well below my knees. I end up needing to cinch really tight to hold them up, which takes away from what should be a comfortable biking short."
4.0,"Pretty color and easy to put on, great for summer"
4.0,Fits pretty good the the dress straps tie through a loop on the back of the dress and it is open on the sides the bow also is sent untied but the overall quality is good
4.0,"This skirt is absolutely adorable on my daughter.  It does run a little small and is slim fitting. The skirt is lined and has a zipper closure. I am going to purchase another one, as a gift for my niece. Much cuter in person."
4.0,"This dress is amazing! Super soft knit material, incredibly comfortable, and firm yet stretchy. I am giving the dress 4 stars though, because of the inconsistency in the pattern, which makes all the difference. If you take a look at the dress in the product descriptions, it's navy blue and green in the waist, which is the pattern I received. To me, this makes the dress. My waist looks tiny and my hips look full where the dark stripes run across my waist. If you look at customer photos however, you will see they received a dress where it's white around the waist and dark across the bust. The dress is still cute but doesn't visually contour your curves like it should. I guess I lucked out by receiving the pattern in the product description but I would have probably returned the dress if I had received the off pattern like some of the customer photos."
4.0,Big hit with 5 year old granddaughter.
4.0,I wish the quality of the fabric was a little better but overall I like it pretty good  it's stylish and the color is great
4.0,Nice ring but colors are a little deeper than in pictures if not in direct sunlight
4.0,"Wear it to work, fits perfect, quality holds up."
4.0,"Love the hard-to-find trombone print.  These were a gift for our daughter who plays trombone and she loves them.  Shipping took awhile, so I'm glad I ordered in plenty of time thanks to Amazon showing the estimated ship date.  When we initially opened the package they looked exactly like the picture but, once they're on the feet, the color and design fade a little because it is just printed on top of white fabric socks.  But, they are nice quality, thick fabric socks so all in all I would buy again."
4.0,This shirt is great but it looks nothing like the photo. It's extremely long on me and I'm 5'9&#34;! It's more like a dress but a little too short on the sides to be just a dress. It works for me but I don't see this look on everyone.
4.0,"I love absolutely everything about this. Great fit and looks amazing. The only thing I dislike was getting out of the dress. It fits so well it was hard to get back over my chest and shoulders. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not all due to the dress itself, but that‚Äôs all!"
4.0,These booties work great for my daughter who hates anything on her feet - she cannot get them off!  Fit is great and they wash up well also.
4.0,I bought it for my moms 40th birthday .. she loved it . The only think I didn‚Äôt like about was it not off the shoulder at all like the picture she wear Large sometimes XL ..  I got it 2x.
4.0,Love it and my son wears this to school. Comfortable and fits perfectly. He's 6. The ears are stretched out now but that comes with wearing it daily.
4.0,I wore these a lot during the holidays and loved them.  They fit nicely and were comfortable for long periods of time.  My only complaint is they don't wash well and come out pretty wrinkled and didn't hold it's shape.  I ironed them and shaped them a bit and they came back.
4.0,"These are the first &#34;No Show Socks&#34; that fits comfortable and stays on (for the most part). If I wear them all day, I may have to adjust them once but overall good fit...I will definitely order them again!"
4.0,Very comfy and nice cushion.
4.0,turns easily
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order a 10 which fit like my normal size 9.<br />I havent worn them out just yet, but they're super cute!"
4.0,This band is nice quality and easy to get on and off.  Only complaint is that I accidentally flung my watch off my wrist when playing catch because I didn't realize it would flex enough for the watch to come off my wrist.  Other than that it's definitely worth the money.
4.0,It was more of a gold color than yellow
4.0,"The tank top is very thin. I do like the color, and the fabric is light. However these run very small, so order at least one or even two sizes up. Comes in a pack of 3."
4.0,"I'm not really one for man jewelry other than nice watches, but I was in the mood for a bracelet and chose this one.  I was really impressed.  The tungsten is scratch proof and catches the light really well.  The ceramic is really dark and shiny.  It's a really sophisticated quality piece and I've had a lot of positive comments on it.<br /><br />The only criticism I could make is that the clasp perhaps could have been better.  But it does what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />For the price it is an excellent and interesting bracelet, and I would have no problem recommending it."
4.0,"Very cute, fit as expected, don't size up! I definitely could've gone down a size. Not sure why other reviewers are saying size up?  If you have larger hips and thighs, you may be disappointed with these pants. They are a very slim fit. The calf area is extra tight, but there is some stretch.  The fabric is thin and lightweight perfect for spring, fall, but I would say too thin for cold winter. Overall, they are exceptionally stylish, and I'd recommend them for that reason only. The quality of the material is low for the price. And the reason for 4 stars."
4.0,"Comfortable,light jacket. Nice for a woman. Very casual.  Looks just like the picture."
4.0,I like this but I ordered on in the past and it seems these are never made the same way.  The sleeves on this one are a little too tight.  On the previous one the neck is little larger and there was more ruching at the bottom but I still like them.
4.0,"Soft, cute and adjustable.  They are quite large. But would buy again."
4.0,"nice material, just runs pretty large. The length fits pretty well but around the mid section was very wide. Not the most flattering since it doesn't flow with your body but I'll still wear it because I like the lace detail and like I said the material feels nice. I'm 5'5, around 145 pounds, small busted, athletic, and ordered a medium."
4.0,"The gloves are what I wanted and expected.  Better then my last pair which cost more, Happy with them, Thanks Amazon."
4.0,I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and bought not realizing it was a baby hat. I thought it would fit a toddler. But it is really cute !
4.0,Leggins are fine...material was a bit thinner than I like.
4.0,The beige is a very pale pink!
4.0,"Nothing wrong with this watch, it‚Äôs just very small, no where in the item description does it tell the size. Overall though it‚Äôs a decent piece"
4.0,One had a hole in it. Otherwise great
4.0,I really like this necklace. Looks like the picture but hangs much longer. I can‚Äôt wear it with a v-neck shirt as shown. But it looks good hanging over a higher neck shirt or dress.
4.0,Just what we was looking for.
4.0,"It fits a little big, but it's a great suit!"
4.0,"A better place for the barcode sticker would have been INSIDE of the hat, NOT on the very top. Once I peeled it off, it left an adhesive mark.  I had to use masking tape to pull if off.  Got most of it off but it did leave a bit of a film. Otherwise, the hat it pretty cool. It's much bigger on your head (height wise) than you may think it would be based on the pic. Great quality for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the sticker issue."
4.0,very happy thanks
4.0,"This is a much loved giftMy friend loves it softness, light weight, but also keeps her warm and cute design."
4.0,"These glasses fold a bit differ than many of the other similar units. As apposed to the arms folding in and the glass folding out around the ear arms. These, the arms fold outside and against the glass. So far there have been no scratches so all is well, time will tell. As far as the color, great in different lighting and indoors where you have Florenent light and the traditional clear has a reflective glare, making their useage a pain....but not with these.  Also the ear arms have a  black round tip on the end so as not to hurt your ears when putting them on. On all of the other brands that I have tryed, they have all come off after just a couple of uses. These seem to stay on even with a lot of use.  The only things I wish they would add is that the holder have an attached loop for a carrbean or hook. Out side of that it has been a great unit. The glass is clear and the 1.5 power is just right."
4.0,Quilted arms don't like to be dried but have held up extremely well considering how much I have worn and washed it! I get compliments on it everywhere I go. It is snug but not too tight.
4.0,Fits my four year old well.
4.0,"Very nice, I've worn the same one for about a week straight and no issues with allergies or turning green, etc. The clickers work well for me, the screw on ones are so tiny but do-able (I had trouble with my longer nails). If you have trouble unclicking them, look up the 'septum pen trick' to remove. Very cute overall, I love them, worth it!"
4.0,Material is ok but feels a bit larger under the armpits. The draping is nice though.
4.0,I have chunky arms but tiny everything. This is a beautiful coat but order a size up or two. It won't hurt.
4.0,Support soft and well made.
4.0,I thought it came in packs of 2 so I ordered 2 and only received 2. my bad probably. I researched long for these specific internal threaded size for my nipple rings. they look like good quality but now I only have one nipple and it was too much $$ for me to order for the other side so I will probably look for others next time. but as replacement balls they are pretty and do the job
4.0,Kind of big but great material
4.0,Comfortable and light weight. Nice quality.
4.0,very cute and good value for the design<br /><br />size is a bit small. just get it for a gift or soemthing
4.0,"I washed them and dried them in the dryer on high in order to make them fit a bit better.  I felt a smaller size would be TOO small.  They fit pretty well now.  But If CompressionZ brand had a pair with a side pocket, I would order from them instead because the support is so much better."
4.0,Pants are very very comfortable love the fit love the feel wish they had more colors cuz I would buy all of them
4.0,"They cut down glare but dont improve vision. Not unexpected. Cant make light where it doesn't exist. Good quality, nicely packaged"
4.0,Love the dress! Many compliments. 4 stars bc it is difficult to iron. Needs steamer or place thin sheet (I used a worn pillow case) between iron and dress. I did use the steam function with my iron as well.
4.0,"My daughter loves the coat but the arms are a bit small and I have to alter it. She is a small girl but she has broad shoulders and muscular arms. So alterations have to be done. But - I must say, it is a well made coat and it looks beautiful. And the price was great!"
4.0,love these socks! they don't slide down your foot and they are super comfy!  I only didnt give firve stars because I find them a bit expensive for socks.
4.0,They fit a little bit tight but the overall quality is outstanding!
4.0,"I like the product but it broke after using it a week.  They said they would send me a new one, but it's been two weeks and I still don't have one."
4.0,Not particularly lightweight.
4.0,"I had this same brand before and it was a pebbled leather and much softer than this one.  The green is a beautiful color, but the leather is stiff and very hard to get the credit cards out."
4.0,Light weight and an eye appeal of simplicity.  My friends liked them and seemed happy - no feedback on how they held up so they seemed happy.
4.0,"Love this charm.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I ordered it in November and it took until mid-January to get and it was supposed to be a Christmas gift.  If you're not in a hurry to get it, its worth the wait."
4.0,for a child costume- worked well
4.0,"They are super duper cute!  My daughter wears 8.5-9 in toddlers and they are perfect!  If your daughter wears anything above a 9, you should get the next size up."
4.0,"Okay, I had been looking at so many watches that I forgot it didn‚Äôt come with memory card slot or music playability. My daughter loves it even without all those things. It does die daily so keep charging it every night."
4.0,Everything was great except they did not send the rings with the robes
4.0,"This bathing suit is so so so cute! The material thick in the front is layered to help hide any trouble areas on the tummy and you can adjust the top layer to be smooth as you want. It gives really good coverage in the back and cuts down deeper in the back to give a little bit of sex appeal. The bra portion was honestly too big for me but it wasn't very noticeable and laid against my chest to where you couldn' see that it was too big. The only problem I have is after one time wearing it, the wire band in the bra started poking out and cutting into my chest. You can slide the wire back in but it will eventually work it's way out. I would advise hand washing it to avoid this product but overall, really cute design!"
4.0,"Followed guidelines, dress was too tight for me.  Returned it. Had it fit, I would have loved it!"
4.0,Just a bit larger than I'd normally wear and could not tell this from the picture but they are so very nice
4.0,Looks pretty good for costume jewelry. Lots of sparkle. Perfect for the event I need to wear it for.
4.0,"I ordered the set of 18 as I wanted to have a handkerchief in each coat, jacket, and purse, plus a clean one ahead as I need it.  These are just the ticket.  Small enough to fit without creating a big knot and still large enough to blow my nose or wipe the sweat from my brow.  They are a light cotton which washes well and comes nice out of the wash.  Sometimes I iron mine for a little more smoothness, but it isn't really necessary.  The patterns are pretty and I can usually find one that goes fairly well with whatever I'm wearing that day."
4.0,"These PJ pants are beautiful dark teal and super comfortable to wear as lounge or sleepwear. The seams are finished with varying quality, and there is surprisingly little room in the leg and seat so moving around and doing yoga or other activities might feel hampered by the shape of the shorts. That said, the material is forgiving so you can push it anyway. Recommended with some reservations...also definitely recommend sizing up as the large fits like a medium."
4.0,They are baggy around the ankle so not as tight as it looks in the picture. Might have to take them in around that area.
4.0,Felt a bit wide . Probably should have sized down
4.0,"Arrived in good condition, new of course and fit well enough."
4.0,"Very lovely dress, but if you're busty not the dress for you. I ordered a large and it wasnt very flattering. ( I wear a 38ddd) I had to send it back"
4.0,"The shirt is nice, but be sure to order a size or two larger than your actual size."
4.0,I like it but it does get snagged in my hair a bit.
4.0,"Bought this last minute for a wedding and got tons of compliments! I got a size medium because I‚Äôd rather it be too big than too small but definitely could have gone with a small in the cleavage area, but nothing a few safety pins can‚Äôt do! Love how it comes with a tie to wrap around your waist!"
4.0,Llego en tiempo y justo lo que ofrecen.
4.0,"Pretty, but the stone part broke off after 6 months. I glued it back wih epoxy and it is fine."
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and typically a US size 6 (34B-27-38).  I ordered the multicolored printed jumper in the large.  It juuuuust fits, but not as flowy as it fits the model in the picture.  The crotch does not rise up in the front, but does around the booty a little bit since the cut is just flat on both sides.  It‚Äôs not so bad that I don‚Äôt wear it, but just a heads up for those considering buying.  While the elastic gives, the fabric doesn't.  I think a large is best for US size 4-6 or junior‚Äôs size 7ish, but smaller if you want it to look as flowy as it does on the model.  The fabric is pretty thin, but since I live in a warm climate, I don‚Äôt mind that.  It is not see-through.  Overall, it‚Äôs a cute, comfortable, casual jumper that I'm happy to have added to my closet."
4.0,"Recommend: yes, I plan to buy another soon!<br /><br />Looks: I love it and it doesn't look cheap, exactly like the picture.<br /><br />Shipping: takes forever!<br /><br />Wear: I wore it everyday for months until the gold started to come off about 6 months in. Then finally from wearing it so much the wristband came off.<br /><br />Battery: AWESOME"
4.0,Beautiful dress very classy
4.0,I purchased the large because it stated it ran small.  Large fits me great.  Nice product
4.0,"Took a while to arrive directly from China, but now I can fix all my watches for the cost of just one repair at a shop."
4.0,I like these and they're really cute! The only reason it's 4/5 stars is because I thought they would look &#34;pinker&#34; (I ordered gold and pink). I have a round face and these look great on me. They aren't the sturdiest glasses but then again they aren't glasses I would be wearing daily so they're fine.
4.0,fit was ok
4.0,Skirt was not as full as depicted in the picture. It doesn't look 50's because of this.
4.0,"Its acceptable quality for the price but much smaller than anticipated. If you are looking for a mini, then yes, get it."
4.0,Short on the waist area and made it look really juvenile.
4.0,Cute top for price. Fits loose
4.0,"My daughter loves these pj‚Äôs. She‚Äôs a big chipette fan. Fabric has quite a bit of spandex like material to it, it has a stretchy polyester feel to it vs a soft cotton material. Somewhat expensive for pj‚Äôs. However the chipmunks aren‚Äôt as popular these days. It would be hard to find elsewhere"
4.0,Nice dress. Very heavy!
4.0,"This actually fits my Note 8 IN A CASE!!! Based on previous reviews, I didnt think it would fit everything!!! Fits a stack of money, 7 cards short of the whole thing, and my phone...... now I just need a wrist strap or cross body strap and this would have been better."
4.0,"Very roomy and the quality is ok. Just some loose threads and some of the pockets were stuck together, however not for long. That is a bit understandable."
4.0,"Worked great for what I needed it for, It was a bit long, but after a quick wash it fit perfectly."
4.0,I liked it except for the left sleeve was so tight i had to cut it to get it off.
4.0,I'm 5'6&#34; and 120lbs and a small fits great. Gave 4out of 5 stars because the left sleeve seems to turn outwards which is a little annoying. Received the item sooner than quoted.
4.0,"I'm 5'10"", 160lbs, 38DDD and... Well, yea it shows the boobs. And it's pretty see through. But it's gonna be a beach dress so IDC, I won't be wearing it to the PTA. the length goes just to my knees. I could see a darker color being appropriate with dark under garments, and a cute cardigan."
4.0,Dress is nice for price.  The bow fell off during first time wearing it I can put it back.
4.0,"Purchased specifically for golfing. I wear a small typically a SMALL (5'9&#34; 160lbs fit build) and when buying Polo Shirts, they run the gamut of huge to comedically small. This shirt fit nicely for a golf shirt in the chest and waist (loose enough to golf in, but tight enough to not feel like a tent), but the sleeves are very long, falling just before the elbow. Maybe an inch less would be better. The material on the shirt is great, very breathable, and the red is true to the color in the photo."
4.0,Cute hat and good price
4.0,I used it as a necklace.
4.0,"The material is very comfortable and easy to wash. The snaps for nursing are easy to unsnap, but secure. Took a star off because the breast padding feels like a big bulky sponge and doesn't come close to staying in place. The sponge padding also bunches up every time you nurse. These tops are good to lounge around the house, but padding makes your breasts look large and out of place so I wouldn't wear in public (also have to constantly adjust them or they make your breasts look out of place). I ordered the large and it is a nice fit everywhere else."
4.0,"This dress fits OK.  I quite like it. The material is sturdy so the style is maintained.  Just one thing though... there is a satin-like inner lining at the top section if the dress that I had to put some effort into adjusting. But otherwise,  the dress is OK."
4.0,"I'm usually a 16/18. I ordered a 4XL, and while the body fits, I feel like this was made for someone shorter than me. I'm going to keep it, and adjust as needed. The color is pretty, and the cut is nice for someone who is curvy."
4.0,"Nice fabric, seems well made.  Machine washes and dries beautifully.  Just wish it was a little roomier."
4.0,"I purchased two pairs of these...one for my husband and one for my 16 year old son.  They look amazing on both of them.  They're a little flimsy, but I think they're well worth the price."
4.0,"I like the color, but not the interlock buckle."
4.0,The clear part gets super dirty fast and things will stick to it easily like dirt or dust. I still like it but it is not ‚Äúclear‚Äù anymore.
4.0,"workmanship a little shotty !  A piece of bodice was caught in seam that caused the top of the dress to pull down ,.  I was able to repair and kept the dress.  Very comfortable."
4.0,love this coat cannot wait till it's winter and I can wear it
4.0,"I Loved this dress!! It is a little long but was perfect for a simple Prom Dress. I am 5'3&#34; and 170 and ordered a size 16 and it looked great. It came right on time, and was the exact color that it says it was. The zipper was better than I thought it would be and, although it came a little wrinkled, it was fabulous. It fit as expected because of the reviews had told me to order a size larger than I usually am. I usually wear a size 14. I would recommend"
4.0,"Was a little hesitant on buying these  because there weren't any reviews on it. But, these are such a cute pair of sunglasses you could wear everyday and would go with any outfit. I got the ones with the green lens & the gold trimming (aren't available anymore). The only  reason why I gave it two stars  is because the quality feels a little cheap but it was made in China so what do you expect.  But besides that these are a great pair of sunglasses that I think are worth buying!"
4.0,"Really good looking belt although I bought too large a size. I thought that I would use it over a coat so I went up to the 2X, but it's too big even for that purpose."
4.0,"This dress is light and flowy. It's a true mini. It hit me around mid thigh. The fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. The skirt is lined for opacity. I found the fit to run small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The X-Large was a snug fit.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Daughter ls in love with this ring.  Very high quality and quite a bit more weight than expected from my prospective.
4.0,pretty on line but way too much in person.  runs a little small and short.
4.0,Like it. Not crazy about the material.
4.0,"Loved the colors but was expecting the blanket to be a bit thicker based on reviews.<br />However, I do use it regularly in meditation group classes with my students, so would still recommend as a nice item."
4.0,"I loved the look of this jacket and thought it was worth giving it a chance. I typically order my tops in an extra large because I like them loose and baggy. But I hate jackets with too long sleeves so after reviewing the size measurements, I ordered a large. The large fit well mostly. It was a tad tight across my chest and the sleeves were still too long.<br /><br />This jacket arrived vacuum packed and I washed and dried it normally. I had no issues with shrinkage. It did well in the wash. I like the fit and this is a great fall jacket. It‚Äôs not made for the winter, at least not Ohio winters so I‚Äôm not worried about buttoning it. It‚Äôs just as cute in person as the model picture.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a good length overall. So far it seems well made and is something I‚Äôm going to get a lot of use from!"
4.0,Super fast shipping - as described - VERY happy?
4.0,Tama√±o esperado color deseado
4.0,This was a gift for a co worker at our work Christmas party. She loved it.
4.0,"The large fits more like a medium, but had a nice feeling to it. Just wished I would have ordered a size bigger."
4.0,the skirt was a large and I ordered a medium but i fixed it with a corset
4.0,"Cheap, tacky, but it was for my 12 year old. She loved it."
4.0,True color / great price/ nice length [im 5'5&#34;] i had to have the elastic on shoulders  relaxed - it pinched a lil
4.0,I liked that they where just as shown however mine came with one horn little torn at band nothing a little hot glue didn‚Äôt fix went very well with my costume had weight to them and where comfortable to wear overall pleased with this purchase.
4.0,the print is fabulous and it was the perfect size. i just wish the back could be tied together slightly lower on the back. but it looks just like the photo and covers well in the front. it is a linen like fabric so it breathes well in the summer heat. i was very excited about this dress and will be looking at getting one of the other styles soon!
4.0,I like the color. They are somewhat classy. They run a bit small and  will take some time to fit right.
4.0,The most comfortable work boots. They are not the most durable but the comfort is unbeatable.
4.0,Very useful. Husband loves them. Wears them under shorts to the gym.
4.0,Exactly as it‚Äôs shown; but runs small in my opinion. I am 5‚Äô1 weigh 112 lbs and the small is tight especially in the chest area. Would have ordered a medium but no time to wait and exchange so just keeping the small.
4.0,"The hat is a little bigger than I thought but that just might be the style. Still, good quality hat, and it looks sharp!"
4.0,"My head is about 22 inches in circumference and this hat fits well. It's a light beige colour, and there's a bit of glitz to the material which gives it a sparkly shimmer.<br />The brim, at its widest is 3 inches, and at it's narrowest, 2 inches. While there's some form to the brim, it's not stiff and can be bent for storage/packing.<br />The hat is fully lined in a floral print, and the hat is well sewn with no loose threads whatsoever.<br />There's also a detachable strap with a strong toggle for adjustment. While the strap is handy, the detachable clips hook into my hair so I wish it wasn't detachable. The strap is also very fiddly to get on and off.<br />The hat also has a UPF 50 + factor which is great."
4.0,"these boots are amazing and so cute. they fit as expected (i ordered a size 9). they fit narrowly so if you have wide feet it will feel tight. i like how it‚Äôs not tight and it fits around my calves. i‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and it adds around 4in to my height but i love it. i haven‚Äôt walked in it yet but i presume just like any other boots, wear a gel insole and protect the back of your ankles."
4.0,"these are so cute, very much like the picture. I got the light brown ones with the brown button and brown stiching at the top.<br /> I love that they aren't full socks so my feet don't sweat but my boots look so great with these.<br /><br />The only reason I took down a star is because they are a bit heavier than i would have like.<br />however the bulk is kind of nice right now since its the dead of winter but i wish they were a little thinner so I could wear them in fall or spring. I just do not see that happening with how thick they are.<br /><br />they look great with any size boot too, I have ankle boots and knee high and it looks amazing with either.<br />its an amazing price too, if you go to any retail store these bootie toppers (my name fore them) are pushing the 15-20 dollar mark so for 6 bucks its a steal!<br /><br />they're also pretty strechy so you do not have to worry if you have larger calves like I do.<br />like I said they're thick so if you do not have a lot of wiggle room in your boots I do not think they would fit too well. luckily my boots are about an half an inch to an inch bigger so it fits snuggly.<br />all in all a great cute buy for way cheaper than you'd find in stores."
4.0,I was hoping for the dress to be at the knee but its above the knee. Other then that the dress fits perfect and good quality!
4.0,For a $10 purchase I'll keep it.  Fabric isn't anything special.  Fits small.  I got an extra large and I'm a size 10.
4.0,Great value for kids. Used for a classroom Halloween party in which they decorate their own bags.
4.0,"It bothers me because I like the jeans, I even tried to wear them around the house but they are way too small. I have had to return them."
4.0,"The fabric is thin and kind of shiny which was sort of odd to me, but otherwise it's a great dress. There are also a few pink stripes that I wasn't expecting but again they're not bad thing"
4.0,Wished they were in black.
4.0,I love these swim bottoms so much they're so cute and comfy! However I'm usually a S/M and a medium didn't fit had to re order a large and it fit perfectly. I'm 5'1 122 pounds and I have one of those deff works out but deff loves food type of figures
4.0,"The belt is really nice, I wish a larger size was available."
4.0,"The shirt is somewhat large, it‚Äôs inbetween a shirt and a dress. I love the buffalo plaid look and I could wear with leggings. Cheap material, but isn‚Äôt thin. The shirt hangs off the body and does not fit to my figure. Comfortable and worn with leggings, could wear with jeans."
4.0,I like the slim fit and cute style. Wish it was 100% cotton. It feels like a 100% polyester even though it claims some percentage of cotton
4.0,"UPDATE : the bottom hem curls up as I work out. Not the best to work out in, but still cute.<br /><br />‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî<br /><br />I LOVE these shorts! I‚Äôm 140lbs, 5‚Äô3‚Äù, hourglass figure, and I bought a Large."
4.0,"It is what it represents itself to be. Doesn't look like cheap plastic at all, looks just fine.  Definitely a unique look that is different than metal bands in its coloring.  VERY light.  Very easy to install.  It was a little tight on me - I don't have very large wrists, but they are a bit bigger than average. I had to go back and order an extra link (I think it came with 3 links) - very easy process to take a link out/put a link in, took me seconds.  Cost me an extra $6 for the links.  Not a big deal.<br /><br />I've been wearing it for a month now, no complaints."
4.0,Based on reviews I got an xl I‚Äôm a large/xl. Oh on body of sweater neck is tight to get on oversized I would have been better with a large. Length is great light<br />Weight<br />Sweater
4.0,Have no problem
4.0,"Nice shirt, quick delivery for surprise event."
4.0,Very elegant but quite long for petite
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; 130lbs (34-27-36) and I ordered the large which fits. I usually wear a small-medium so this swimsuit runs small. I like that the top is fully padded and not just tiny triangle pads.  However, I wish the top were a regular triangle top and not like a bra. It doesn't hold up my girls as well because of this."
4.0,Putting hats in is a little harder than expected you have to load from back. Good and sturdy
4.0,"The band was a bit smaller than I am used to, but it still fit on the outermost set of hooks. My SO approves. ;)"
4.0,Like this product. Fits well and has held up so far.
4.0,Another granddaughter present and she is also quite pleased.
4.0,"I went with my correct size per the chart. It felt like I had to pull too hard to get them to fit. Hopefully they will hold up. The socks are made of a thin material. These is little cushioning. I often ride long distances. I hope that these thin socks will prevent rubbing and blistering from my shoes. I never had this kind of a problem with other socks, but I have not used ones as thin as these. They are yellow so they should add to my visibility to others on the road.<br />As promised, they are marked L and R, so you have to pay attention! I will update this review as I pedal along."
4.0,Nice top. It's a little thin so I recommend a cami underneath but it's not see through. It doesn't gather around the midsection as I hoped but it's soft material and still looks nice.
4.0,The dress is a lovely color but was a bit close for my workplace which is conservative.  Next time I would order a size larger.
4.0,"I purchased these to help alleviate some of the eye strain with the increase of computer use since COVID.  They are rather large frames (but that is considered ""in style"" now).  They feel a bit bulky and you get a weird shift visually when you put them on, but I have chalked that up to the blue-light protection.  They are a bit bigger than what I would have purchased (but I have a smaller face), they seem a little heavy when you put them on, but I forget that I'm wearing them sometimes so they are not uncomfortable.  Only came with 1 glass cleaning cloth and 1 fabric sleeve- which for the price was not a deal breaker, but would've liked to have 1 cloth and sleeve for each of the 3 glasses that were included.  Overall quality is good for the price."
4.0,"Basic pouch.  A bit large if you only put your sunglasses in it and it is not lined.  Since it is not hard and not lined, I place my sunglasses in their case (a Ray-Ban hard case) and then I put the case into the pouch.  Then it is a nice fit.  Not tight, and not loose.  That solves my concern about protectiveness.  The extra effort to put sunglasses into a case first is negligible - you put your sunglasses away when it is not going to be worn for a stretch of time.<br /><br />This pouch attached to my molle bag quite easily.  But the pouch does not have a built in loop to tightly integrate the mounting strap with my bag, so it is not as tightly secured as my molle phone pouch."
4.0,"They were a little smaller than I expected, but that was on my part, not the seller's description. Very pretty."
4.0,"Overall, I like the jacket. However, while the medium fit perfectly, the arms were too tight, forcing me to a larger size. With the large size, the arms are too loose, but wearable. One issue that I have is that the breast pockets are quite small - too small for a wallet. The inside pockets are open to the front hand pockets, so unusable."
4.0,"Bracelet received was just as described.  The Baroque pearls are all one-of-a-kind and imperfections will be evident, but the resulting variance in shape, color, and iridescence every time they move is what makes these so beautiful.  They seem to change in front of your eyes.<br />4 stars only because the clasp is especially difficult for older eyes and/or arthritic fingers to use, even with help.<br />We are having the clasp replaced by a local jeweler at a very small cost, so all is good."
4.0,The fit great ! Length is perfect and so comfy! Nothing better then comfy pants with pockets ! They r real pockets and not tiny useless ones!
4.0,"I do like these sunglasses but they‚Äôre much larger in real life. The ad photos are a bit misleading, they show much smaller and thinner frame. Anyway these are still fashionable and I like them. Most importantly they look good on me üòú"
4.0,It lays perfectly so I think the material is fitting but it does not have a lot of give and the button was in the wrong place. When I put the dress on the button was on the shoulder not really pointed to the front. I didn't knock them more stars because it was still cute but be sure to iron it and know that it is not the best material.
4.0,"Didn't really know what size to order this dress, so I got an extra large. It fits just a tad bit loose, overall great. The material is a little see through, doesn't matter to me because I want it for the beach as a cover up, but just heads up for future buyers."
4.0,"If you want to match your daily outfit with accessory that compliments it. This classic color hoop have a great size and are lightweight. There a not gaudy, they are  simply perfect. Very happy with my purchase. :)"
4.0,Nice shirt cute
4.0,Wish it had more color to it but I love it
4.0,Pretty colors.....fit very well
4.0,I really like this shirt. It looks great but it fits way big. I'm usually a medium and it fit me like an XL or a big L so plan accordingly.
4.0,"It's well made but not very big. If it was a little larger, I would keep it. Definitely more of a handbag than a &#34;tote&#34;, which I consider to be something larger to carry more in. Thanks anyway!"
4.0,Didn't need the inserts but since the insert are  available then sure it keeps the item comfortable. As per the person who received it.
4.0,I love this medalion necklace. I have gotten compliments on it
4.0,"Wanted something simple to try out and these are soooo comfy and don‚Äôt hurt your wrists at all! A little hard to put on at first but we figured it out. Not the strongest tho, I feel like if I pulled really hard it might break but it was sturdy enough."
4.0,This is a nice basic oversized black cardigan. I dig the style and the cool chunky buttons. The fabric looks like it won't fade and I think it would hold up pretty well. I've tried on other chunky sweaters that leave me looking too frumpy but I feel like this one does not!  Super comfy and chill.
4.0,Got this for my 20 month old. It's super cute and we get lots of compliments. It will definitely fit her for a while. The scarf is a bit shorter than hoped but it works.
4.0,"As a Dr Who fan, I am in love with this piece--- however I may never wear it anywhere but to comi-con due to the size and weight.  This is a stunning attraction piece, not a little charm necklace."
4.0,This dress fits perfect it's just a little too long.
4.0,The bracelet Is very pretty.  I like it.<br />T.
4.0,"Good gloves, warm and pretty comfortable. They are a bit denser and more restricting to movement then other similar gloves I have had."
4.0,Soft and comfortable. Just a touch large. Hoping it will shrink a little in the dryer.
4.0,It‚Äôs not a real pearl but still a beautiful piece. I wear it a lot cause it goes with everything.
4.0,Exactly what l was looking for. Very sturdy. Well worth the price.
4.0,"They are 6mm but smaller than i had thought they would be.  I have a small wrist and they fit just right but I should have ordered the 8mm size, would have been happier with them.  The color and shine is exactly as pictured.  High polish and quality of gems."
4.0,"I really like these flip-up-and-down reading glasses that essentially turn a pair of regular glasses into bifocals for those of us who don't regularly need them. Now, I don't wear glasses at all unless I'm reading, and I only need them for that  purpose, meaning I have tons of spare reading glasses stashed all over the house. So these are not useful to me indoors...but they are perfect for clipping onto sunglasses when I'm driving or otherwise outdoors. This keeps me from having to reach into my pocket a lot or waiting until I can safely stop to glance at something on my car radio's small print, etc.<br /><br />My only concern about them to this point is their durability. The lenses initially strapped on to my sunglass very snugly, and flipping them up and down, they felt pretty tight. The concern is that they loosened up very quickly, and I now find myself hoping that they don't eventually become too loose to remain in the upright position without constant adjustment.<br /><br />Time will tell. Four stars for now."
4.0,It is soo warm.
4.0,"It's pretty, well made but fits smaller than the size it's supposed to be."
4.0,Love the case. It hold more games then my last case and love how there's grooves for the system to lay flat because of the joycon bumps on the back. Thoughtful design went into this case.<br /><br />My only gripe would be the smell of the material used on the inside smells a bit like someone had been smoking in the case. This however is just a minor gripe as over time the smell will wear down.
4.0,"I ordered a package of three silk blend sari skirts. Each skirt is two layers of fabric. I gave four stars because one of the layers on one of the skirts is not silk; instead, it is a rather stiff cotton or cotton blend, so it does not hang gently as the others do.  Otherwise, I really like the skirts a lot. I love the  two layers, and the way they wrap to one's own waist size. I also love the way they hang down rather than pouf out."
4.0,Color was a little different than what was shown on my phone- but not a big deal.<br />Sizes are as the information says. I am in between their sizes and should have ordered up.<br />Free returns though- much appreciated!<br />The style is simple and exactly what I am looking for- I‚Äôll definitely reorder the correct size.
4.0,Definitely works for me.
4.0,Love it & all its bling!!
4.0,"These are pretty good quality. Bought them for my friend's snake bites. Only sadness was they aren't mirror copies. I took jewelry pliers to them and switched the direction one of each pair spiraled, and now they are perfect."
4.0,"Fits a little bit too large in the waist but I am 5‚Äô7 135 lbs and I ordered a small if I ordered a size down it would have fit tighter but would possibly be too short, will keep and wear though!"
4.0,This has a very nice high polish and the size is perfect. I would give it five stars except the edges are a little rough. Since it has points it makes it a little sharp. Other than that I was pleased with the quality. I have gotten several compliments on it.
4.0,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about how these pants fit and look on. The material sits flat and resists wrinkles it‚Äôs comfortable enough to wear all day whether you are sitting, standing or walking around. All those good things said I was expecting the ‚Äúelastic waist‚Äù to have a bit more give. It is a CHALLENGE to get these pants over my bottom without ripping a stitch but once on they look and fit GREAT!<br />I bought the ankle length and am now looking at buying a full length pair.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù 190lbs and the large fits perfectly"
4.0,"Pretty good. Having two straps is a little fiddly. And they're a little stiffer than I'd like. But otherwise, decent fit."
4.0,"I personally like these masks, but recently some establishments will not allow entry with masks with vents.<br />The material is like a soft form, not cloth and they are easy to clean. The vents are in two pieces and may detach if you place the mask in the washer. Very easy to replace back onto the mask.<br />If where you reside allows this type of mask, then I would recommend it."
4.0,"Super cute shoes! The fabric isn't soft though, I would recommend wearing socks with them."
4.0,Very pretty and nicely packaged!
4.0,"I ordered these on a whim just to try them out. Very pleased - they look good, the color choices are great and the quality seems quite good. My only qualifier to this review is that they might be a little too stretchy for really holding in pants in place. If the stretch was just tad firmer, I would have done 5 stars instead of 4."
4.0,Love it but wish was smaller n warmer in hood area to cover ears
4.0,"Beautiful, fun, bright and well made. Perfect party hat for my great niece's 1st birthday."
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for a child who just started dance lessons and it looks adorable, and she loves wearing it."
4.0,"I wanted this to work so badly, but I'm thinking it's probably not meant for people with long torsos (or maybe it's the boobs that are causing the issue?). I love the skirt and the look of the whole dress when it's not on me, but on, I wish the skirt started 2 inches further down. The length of the dress overall ended up perfect which surprised me (I'm 5'11"").  I ordered an XL and typically wear a 16/18 bottom and XL top."
4.0,"I love these pants !! They are very soft and stretchy which is so important for me ! They feel so lightweight that it almost feels like I‚Äôm not even wearing anything which I love! The fabric is pretty thin so it gives a bit of camel toe, but nothing major. As far as the ‚Äúsweat stain resistant‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs completely false, but I did have sweat stains on my knees after my workout."
4.0,"Really neat, but are a bit small for what I thought they would be. It is smaller than actual dice, but it was an awesome gift and looks cool in a car."
4.0,"Dark Purple fits me nicely (5'2&#34; PXS), a tad long but that doesn't matter as I wear boots with these. Love the color.<br /><br />The brown ones, however, do not fit me. They are a tad loose for me around the ankles/calves. Returned the brown and kept the purple."
4.0,I absolutely loved these gauges. they were very pretty in my ear and i loved the design. but the holes in the sides of these gauges made my ear conform to them. which caused alot of discomfort. i wasn't thinking about that when i got these. but i would still wear them just not for a long period of time.
4.0,"works great fits perfectly, easy to put on..... hard to take off again....."
4.0,"Good, but the clips aren‚Äôt attached to the band so difficult to keep track of"
4.0,looks good. clean. many people have commented on this watch. great value for price. One of the pins gave me problems and fell out at whim but I swapped it out for another and haven't had issues. I've worn the watch many times and it is great still!
4.0,"It's not bad.  I was hoping it would be a bit roomier.  It's snug across my chest, but I am pretty top heavy (36H).  I was hoping it would be a bit longer, but overall it's a nice top."
4.0,"Gave it to my sister for mothers day, she liked it."
4.0,These are so feminine they look so cute on my fingers love them.
4.0,A fun item to wear
4.0,Loved these sandals!
4.0,"Got this for a company Christmas party in a few weeks.<br /><br />Pros: It does fit, it's comfortable, and the print I chose is adorable (I think so at least).<br /><br />Cons: I was not expecting such a deep v neck. When it's left to hang freely the v nearly drops below my breasts, which would be great if I didn't need a bra to hold them up & could find an invisible bra that will support my size.<br /><br />All in all I think this will be perfect with a little more coverage for me."
4.0,"Love this top, great for workouts since it's thin."
4.0,"I like the bracelet, however I feel that it was my error for ordering a bracelet with that many rows.  For me personally, I would prefer a less flashy bracelet, it is a little too much.  I wish I would have ordered only 2 rows, that would have been perfect.  The bracelet itself is very pretty and well made."
4.0,Bought as a cosplay outfit for Deanna Troi from Star Trek TNG - should do the job well!
4.0,I thought they would be alot bigger. Besides thats they are pretty the metal is more if a gray than silver.
4.0,"Very warm gloves, son likes them."
4.0,This dress is okay it looks cute with boots
4.0,Great quality. Material is heavier/thicker than a regular t-shirt so can be too warm to wear in hot summertime weather. Great for cooler fall weather plus very stylish. I got it in colors black and white and receive so many compliments when I wear with bralette.  Size up to get off the shoulder look.
4.0,"Great size and good material. The zippers seem like they may be a little cheap, but I only just got this. It is kind of a bummer there is no shoulder pad or top handle to quickly grab it and go, but otherwise I love this thing."
4.0,"Love this. Would give full stars if bag was offered in pastel colors for spring. Super roomy inside, soooo many pockets."
4.0,"I really loved the way it felt and looked! The only thing I didn't like was that white or black didn't come in my size (size small), and the red was very red, but still cute."
4.0,IT's very nice necklace. .. But it's a little bit small. If it's a gift for your daughter it's really good!
4.0,"The bracelet looks expensive and looks better than the picture.  I was very happy with the appearance.  I would have given it five stars but the bracelet does not stretch too much.  You must have a small wrist to wear it.  It is a little tight on my wrist but I will be able to wear it.<br /><br />Also, it takes a long time to receive in the mail unless you pay extra for expedited shipping.  I ordered the bracelet to wear to my daughter's wedding because it matched the row of rhinestones on my shoes but I did not receive it in time.  Unfortunately, I received the bracelet the following business day after the wedding.  At least I will have it to wear to other special occasions."
4.0,"Pretty nice sweater, for the price. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 170 pounds after just having a baby and bought this to wear with leggings. It‚Äôs super long (possibly a bit too long?) but may shrink. The collar doesn‚Äôt stand up like a typical funnel neck, it‚Äôs a little slouchier. And it‚Äôs a tiny bit see-through. Overall, I like this, just runs a little bit."
4.0,Work great but feel a bit overpriced
4.0,Not bad for the price but run very small.
4.0,Put them on my lady dogs colors
4.0,One can not beat such a price. Seems good so far.
4.0,Fit good after I washed and dried it. Can't tell it was a large. At first it looked huge fresh out of the package. A lot of pilling after the second wash
4.0,"I have a ridiculously large head (one-size-fits-MOST replaced ""fits all"" because of people like ME).  This said, the fit was snug, which I prefer because I just cannot stand the saggy-beanie look (for me - not judging).  A note for planning purposes, however, for my fellow Large-Skulls:  Be prepared to take it off occasionally, as the squeeze gets a bit uncomfortable after long periods.  Definitely GREAT for the cold, but if it's an ""all-day fashion look"" the normal-size heads out there will be better suites for that.  Still a GREAT beanie. Super warm, and good looking."
4.0,Fairly smooth transition between the different magnifications. The lense height is not 2.04 inches like the picture describes however. More like 1.3. That‚Äôs the only reason for four stars. I was expecting a little larger glasses.
4.0,"Love the slippers...have 3 other pair, but this pair was giant in size.  Kept them anyway because they are hard to find."
4.0,"I ordered these as part of my Halloween costume. They went perfectly with my outfit but were painfully small. My big toes ended up falling asleep from the pressure! Otherwise, adorable, great price and arrived quickly."
4.0,I decided to keep this however I was a little disappointed by the length of the shirt it has a drawstring pull at the bottom therefore it is meant to be worn more as like a cut off instead of a full sweatshirt style. I kept it because I really liked it and moving forward into winter it really won‚Äôt matter sorry. I plan on cutting the drawstring out of the shirt!
4.0,"love the earrings, just the right size.  gave 4 stars because they are a little difficult to close.  other than that they are pretty."
4.0,"I am a little mixed with regards to this dress.<br /><br />On the one hand, as others have pointed out, it is extremely well made.  The pink, which isn‚Äôt even a color I usually wear, is closer to pastel so is a bit softer in shade and more professional than a traditional pink.  The built in waist cinches well without being too tight and the material is comfortably stretchy.<br /><br />My only issue is that the skirt length just didn‚Äôt work for me.  I‚Äôm tallish - in heels, I can be 6‚Äù or more - and end of the skirt started out a bit too short (mid-thigh) and got shorter every time I moved my arms or walked for any period of time.  This happened even though the dress itself was a little big on me, so I think it‚Äôs an overall issue with the length from waist to knee.  I was constantly reaching to pull it back down and quickly decided it would not be something I could stand to wear for an entire day at work.<br /><br />Definitely do not recommend for taller ladies but appreciate the style and quality of this dress."
4.0,Super cute for the price. I was happy.
4.0,Easy to put on and adjust and easy to take off
4.0,These are some krazy kool sunglasses. But are poorly constructed. They break easily :-(
4.0,Received an item that I'm looking forward to wearing around campus - Alex
4.0,"I Loved the dress, however, the size I ordered ( Large, was small).  I had to return it.  Needed to go up XXL.  Plan on ordering the XXL, though.  Thanks."
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I was careful about the ordering the correct size for my son. They definitely were not as tight as he expected, so I'm sending them back and ordering a small.<br /><br />Just a note: he had surgery and needed a compression shirt, but like I  mentioned, it was not as tight as it should have been.<br />He did say there was a bit of compression but nothing great. Only 4 stars for this because of sizing."
4.0,Great Quality and i love mine.
4.0,"Super light and low profile glasses.  The color is a bit lighter than I had hoped, but overall pretty decent shades, particularly for the price.  Very comfortable and light on my face.  I ordered the 58mm and they're a little large, but not outlandish.  I'm an average adult female.  Product arrived on time and the seller has been attentive via email checking in to make sure I'm satisfied.  If you're looking for stylish, light weight, though not super durable, shades, these are definitely worth the price!"
4.0,"Too long,"
4.0,I love the compact storage space.  I am very pleased with the bag and hope it lasts a long time.
4.0,"These glasses work great. They're huge and make me like a bug, but I'll take it if it means some added depth perception and sharpness while I work at night."
4.0,"Beautiful, excellent workmanship, attention to detail, BUT much smaller than expected, and  for very fine hair! but, will cherish it anyway,wearing it only for special occasions."
4.0,"The only reason for four in stead of five stars is that these are not true no show socks. I would describe them as more of a footie sock. They do not show with sneakers (which is all I wanted), but with a pair of loafers or other similar shoe, the sock will show. Great socks though, that do not slip off your heal."
4.0,"I use this as back support during my workouts on an elliptical to ensure I don't hunch over, it's flexible and comfortable with good support overall. The elastic allows for adjusting comfort and fit, I would recommend this to anyone in need of back support without constricting the ability to bend and twist."
4.0,"Not the best quality tshirt, but the design is great!"
4.0,"For sizes 10-12, buy XXL.  Very nice dress."
4.0,"These are slightly bigger than expected, but still awesome. They are very warm and snuggly. My son loves them."
4.0,"The other strokan I bought fits way better. I am a 34d, very full in the cup department. I had a little overage in the top."
4.0,It's pretty and comfortable. Nice working cap but too big. A friend had to fix it and it still big. I can't use it.
4.0,It is really beautiful!
4.0,NICE AND GREAT WARM SOCK
4.0,"I love this shirt, except it snags really easily."
4.0,I like this dress it's a good quality it's flattering and I would purchase another one
4.0,"I like them, youcan comfortably down size."
4.0,Light-Cool fabric
4.0,"Kind of small on the side, just loosened the laces and they fit okay"
4.0,"I really loved this dress! It‚Äôs got plenty of room<br />But fits nicely over the chest. I‚Äôm a 38DDD and this had plenty of room for the girls! My only complaint is that I don‚Äôt like the little button area on the front, just the rest of the dress makes it well worth it. The chocolate color was really nice with the white and cream colors throughout."
4.0,easy to install  works well  like new
4.0,Love the quality and the design.
4.0,"The umbrella is really cute.  Great size for my 2.5 year old granddaughter. She loves Peppa, and was thrilled to receive this. Easy to put up and take down. The plastic is not very thick, so I hope it holds up. She had the chance to use it this week, and she was able to hold it herself and it did it's job and kept her nice and dry."
4.0,"This dress is perfect! I am 5'6 and I do not need to wear heels with it. The dress comes just above my ankles. I weigh 160 lbs and I usually wear between and medium and a large, and I am so glad I went with the medium. The Large would and been way too big. I would say to stick with your normal size, or even one size smaller if you want it to be tight fitting."

The weight is mostly in the face and is likely due to the amount of gears, accessories and circuitry that it has to make it run. It definitely has a lot of options and functions like a timer, alarm, and stopwatch modes. It comes fully equipped with a back light for visibility in the dark. There are two additional options that I can't figure out but I probably don't need them anyway. For the price you aren't going to get a better watch. The movement is made in Japan and the the glass is made in Germany. The glass appears to be pretty solid. The band has the pins set in securely and is made of silicone that is flexible yet fairly thick. To put the icing on the cake it's also water resistant and it comes with a 2 year warranty from amazon. I don't think it get's any better than that for a whopping three dollars and fifty cents. If you are looking to get a watch for your kids that works well but you wouldn't mind very much if the kids loose it or beat it up a bit this watch is a great option without having to spend much. Unfortunately it does not include a box but for this price that's not surprising.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. The fact that I received my item for free or at a discounted rate does not influence my opinion in any way, and my purpose for writing these reviews is to be objective in sharing the advantages and flaws of these products for fellow Amazon customers. I sincerely appreciate everyone who has taken the time to read my review."
4.0,Really cute and great coverage and padding
4.0,"I mean, they're flip-flops, and they look like the picture... I'll call it a win."
4.0,Beautiful stone!
4.0,"This is another holiday gift that I purchased for one of the family members. I will admit I tried it out and I think it is a great dress belt. By no means would I suggest this to be a tactical belt or used in any such fashion. It has a wonderful styling and is of a high quality leather. I also was impressed with the well crafted presentation box (makes it easy to wrap too). I was a bit shy to pull the trigger on this purchase but the reviews here sold me. Some are over the top but not far off the mark. So if you are stumped for a manly gift, this guy will work."
4.0,"These headbands work great, and look just like the photo, but they are super wide and thick at the nape of my neck where the fabric is all sewn together, and it makes my hair stick out funny if it's down. So I can really only wear these if my hair is up in a ponytail. But otherwise, I really like them - they are pretty and for the most part stay put."
4.0,This hat is even prettier than I expected. It‚Äôs pretty well made and is an excellent sun shade. It would be as appropriate at the beach as it is at church. It shades head and face without being cumbersome or in the way for driving.
4.0,"My daughter is a pink girl... I was concerned when I first saw the leotard because it is a peachier pink than it appears in the picture.  Luckily, it passed muster.  So if you're buying it to go with something, it would be worth keeping that in mind.  Otherwise, it's great... as I said with the black leotard, this is well made and launders well."
4.0,I like a how cute these shoes are but you'll need to order a size bigger. I e got small/normal ankles and there made tight around my ankles when zipped up
4.0,Would give these five stars if they had a larger waistline!
4.0,"It appears that each color of these pants have their own set of sizes, meaning, the 1x in black and pink fit but the 1x in grey and dark grey don‚Äôt fit."
4.0,"Kind of wish I got a size down, but it's still a great dress/tunic."
4.0,It was cute but a bit to big
4.0,"Thank You Very Much I just got my boots today July 25th when I got it in the mail than unwrap it , it was totally nice it looks just like the picture but the only problem is that the boots is not Black like how it shows on the computer is Brown but it doesn't matter is great. If you give them your right measurements they measure just right nothing else at all. I'll give it a 4 out of 5 , I would give it a 5 if the boots was Black just like Eren boots."
4.0,Huge hit with the kids.  Played all day.  I'm only giving it four stars because the cars are not as sturdy as I thought.  Won't hold up if you step on them.  Still they held up to a rambunctious 4 year old. I don't expect them to last the summer but I found myself playing with them when the tots were away.  I would buy this again.  I love the garage.  Kids loved the cement mixer truck.  Would make a nice birthday present.
4.0,"Nice pants, good value."
4.0,I wear a 9 9.5 I ordered a 9 the fitted cool walked around Vegas for a couple hours didn‚Äôt have any complaints the was comfy to me!
4.0,"I'm a 36DD (implants plus breast feeding). The bra fits pretty well, but tight. I guess you want it to fit pretty tight so you have more support. Overall, I'm happy with the bra. Better than most. It hits my shoulders too tight at a soft spot though, which sometimes gives me a little neck pain."
4.0,"This is a great little sling bag that's just big enough to fit essentials like sunglasses, a wallet, and keys. It's exactly what I was looking for to use during trips to theme parks or a day trip exploring a new city. It would even work well to hold a snack and water bottle (using the handy side bottle holder) during short hikes. I got the black day pack, which has a heathered look to it -- kind of like denim. I wasn't sure about when ordering but I really like it. It's more of a dark charcoal grey than true black. Definitely recommend this if, like me, you sometimes want to be free of a large purse or backpack during day trips, but still need something to hold a few essential items."
4.0,VERY pink! Not what I would call ballet pink so not ok for Recital but very soft and nice fine for class
4.0,"The tag looks nice, It not as shine as I thought it would be. and I think the chain is a little to long but overall I think its a good necklace"
4.0,"I loved the fabric and the print is  lovely, color  looks even better in actuality. I had to send it back because it is too small. Size large fits more like 8- 10 in women's sizes."
4.0,Love the fit! They are very comfortable and the material is soft and not thin. They are the perfect Capri length for my 5' 6&#34; frame.
4.0,"I have loved how well this necklace goes with a pair of similar looking earrings that my boyfriend got me, it is good quality though not for everyday wear. It was a little larger than I anticipated but looks amazing on the chain provided."
4.0,"Unfortunately, I wear a 9 1/2 shoe and these tended to want to come off. But because I love color I'm giving them 4 stars. My stepdaughter loves them. She wears a women's 7 1/2 and they're perfect on her."
4.0,love it except  for the clasp hard time  closing it
4.0,"Just as image depicted, though slightly big for a medium."
4.0,The delivery was pretty fast.  The unit was true to fit tried others but so far they all ran small .  Will purchase again to have a spare.
4.0,"The pads for the chest are too small to be of any use, but the shirt looks great otherwise"
4.0,the bra is very comfortable.  I would order them again.
4.0,They are very light weight boots and I love how they fit on my feet they are not tight at all
4.0,"My husband started my Chamilia Bead collection.  I was looking for a versatile necklace that would go with multiple necklines. This necklace can be adjusted for necklines as I need them to fit. The only drawback is the tail in back of neck, but I tuck that under my shirts. I have received many positive compliments from wearing my beads with this necklace. Yes, I would  recommend  this product."
4.0,Cotton is soft and good material. Nice shirt.
4.0,HAVE NOT WORN THEM YET. TIME NOT RIGHT AS I AM GOING TO WEAR THEM FOR GOLF.  THEY FIT  FINE.
4.0,"I like these -- they make a statement when you are going casual-dressy.  They are long, though, and require heels. I recommend wearing solid undergarments as they may be a little see-though.  The material does not wrinkle, though, so they are good for travel."
4.0,"I loved this dress but the arm holes are too small and I fear extremely uncomfortable.  I don't know where the dress was manufactured,  but in my opinion was not true to size.  It is so disheartening  to purchase a dress that makes you feel good and not be able to wear it.  I returned the dress for refund.<br />The return experience was fabulous!  You print the return slip, put it on the package and one inside, take it to drop-off location and you are credited when shipment is scanned.  WONDERFUL!<br />To the manufacturer: Women appreciate the feeling of looking pretty in their clothing and we look for functionality because we're busy.  If you're of larger stature, why would you not adjust pattern sizes accordingly.  I ordered an XL and could barely get my arms through the arm holes.  Just my thoughts."
4.0,Very nice! I'm only 5'2 so I will have to hem it. But it's very flattering to my figure.
4.0,"If you are a mature woman this dress might be a little bit too short in the front. I really like this dress. I am 64 and weigh 165 pounds. My legs  are not a focal feature, Ha! Therefore, I was looking for a dress that would give me a sense of formal but yet not. I was looking for a tea length,so I thought this would do the trick but the under fabric is shorter than the lace so I did not want my knees to show, actually would have liked it to go to the calf.  I had to send it back.<br /> But for people who have great legs this is a pretty awesome dress at a pretty awesome price."
4.0,nice feel but bigger than I thought it'd be
4.0,"It's a comfortable, versatile dress; overall I'm happy with it. There are a couple of small snags after only two wearings, so I'll need to be careful. Nonetheless, I've ordered a second one in a different color."
4.0,Good product and love the price.
4.0,"These sunglasses are nice.  While they are a lot larger than I was expecting them to be, I think they still look fine on me.  The colors & pattern do differ a bit from the ones pictured, but it is stated as such in the description.  Each pair is unique.  I also received these glasses much quicker than the estimated arrival date I had been given when I placed my order.  Overall, I'm very pleased."
4.0,The top of the dress is amazing the bottoms didn't really fit me and I'm not a fan of plumbers crack lol so I cut it and made it into a top and a skirt
4.0,Queda hermoso y es comodo
4.0,"Stones look really good, wish they had used a different material for the clasp though (stainless steel for example). Clasp started changing color after 1 week use..."
4.0,They ate fine.
4.0,"My one foot is 12"" long and the other is 12 1/4"" long.  Size 13 is just the right length.  But the opening at the top is uncomfortably tight.  The insole has a high arch which is a little rear of where I would prefer it.  The insole is hard.  The hard, high arch makes the shoe feel like it could use a higher heel."
4.0,I wear a size 9 women's shoe and these just fit perfect. I can't imagine men up to size 12 or 13 fitting into these as indicated by the sizing guide. Definitely a dress sock and not an athletic style crew sock. Worked great for my race though!
4.0,"Pendent: Great quality and hollow on one side for balance.<br />Necklace: Very cheap! Feels itchy, rough, and it has some sort of shiny coating of who knows what.<br />It came undone on my second donning. Personally, I had a feeling I needed to replace it right from the very beginning.<br />I'll simply find a string of better quality."
4.0,Adorable cut and colors are beautiful.  I wish it were longer.
4.0,"Very nice band, but not hot pink. It's more of a mauve or purple. Still nice, and very comfortable. Easier to take on and off than bands with a clasp, and doesn't get hooked on things."
4.0,"Very satisfied with these David Archy Underwear. This is a first for me having this particular brand, and I've been very pleasantly surprised so far. They fit and feel good, and seem to wash up good as well. These are the 'Trunk' version, but I will consider buying some other styles too!"
4.0,"The black shirt with girl & flowers is cute. Fit is nice, not too tight, and sized true. I'm a size small with broad shoulders. Fits nice, not tight, but not at all oversized. I wish it was an inch longer, but it does cover enough and reach my jeans fine. For the price I am happy, not sure if it will start to pill with washing, doubt longevity."
4.0,"Item as described, recommended purchase"
4.0,"I have not used these on the court yet but walking around the house, they are very comfortable. I also like the look of the shoe, and they seem light weight."
4.0,"Very tight fitting, hard to move in"
4.0,It‚Äôs a decent band for the price. But it would have been nice to know it‚Äôs the equivalent of a Small size Alpine Loop.
4.0,"Very nice and very neat. Its small so if you have large wrists, this is not for you. Cute for a teenage girl."
4.0,Nice ring for  the price. It's very solid arrived on time. Will see how it stand over time I know you get what you pay for
4.0,"Possibly a little see through.  Depends on how tight they are.  I'm 5'2&#34;, 130 lbs and ordered a small.  They aren't super tight but not loose either.  If i bend over really far you can see through them a little, if they were any tighter I think you could see through them more.  Not alot of compression so they are really comfortable.  Great pockets.  Nice wide Waist band, helps with the post c-section tummy.  Over all I like them and will keep them.  I'll just be mindful of what color underwear i'm wearing and remember not to bend over so much it stretches thin and wear a slightly longer shirt in the back."
4.0,Close fit
4.0,Read previous reviews so expected smaller fit and see through Good beach cover up
4.0,"Sexy and will definitely get you noticed. So if getting looks, stares and attention of all sorts from all kinds makes you uncomfortable. Maybe you should wear something more conservative. The logo on the pouch draws everyone's eyes front and center."
4.0,I like it and all it just doesnt fit together like its supposed too
4.0,I ordered a size up after reading the reviews and am happy I did so. The vest is adorable and exactly as depicted. The pockets have a stiff zipper so I do not like to use them. Otherwise its warm and cute.
4.0,"I love love the diamond one. That's the only one I have wore yet. But the durability and quality is great. I've been wearing it steady 2 weeks now, no issues. The other ones quality are the same just kind of cheapy looking. They're just fine for some bellybutton rings. Go ahead, buy yourself these bad boys. You'll be satisfied with them."
4.0,Nice product. Very well made. Use on a daily basis. Will purchase more.
4.0,"I love this dress and wear it often, mostly at home. It is really comfortable. I only took a star off because I received the blue polka dot and not the black... :)  I would order again."
4.0,This watch I ordered for my sister and she is wearing it.<br />It has slick design and comes with the nice packing and extra band as well.
4.0,"The material is thin, it fits true to size. I ordered a large, but need a smaller size."
4.0,I did measure my head before ordering however it‚Äôs pretty tight on my head. In all fairness it‚Äôs been a pain finding comfortable masks.
4.0,"I am normally a medium(34D/36C), I ordered a Large based on other reviewers, but I probably could have and should have gone XL. The elastic and shoulder straps are a little snug but overall I like the product. It's constructed nicely and looks cute."
4.0,Lightweight and unusual
4.0,"Run alittle small, quality okay but not the greatest, stitching came out on front pocket"
4.0,I bought this cover after I bought a Nook HD 7 in January. I was looking for a cheap alternative to the $30 or more covers I saw at Barnes & Noble and this fit the bill.  I have been using it for over a month and it does the job that I bought it for and it cost far less than the other cases I saw.
4.0,"Cute boots just didn‚Äôt zip up for me, I have a more muscular wide calf"
4.0,Nice quality. Well done.
4.0,I love the thickness of this sweater and how warm it is. This is perfect to wear with leggings to cover your backside and still look classy. I think the sleeves run bigger than the waist. If you want a snug fit order a size down or two
4.0,"These boots are extremely comfortable, I can walk the whole day. I wear them with slim pants and got many compliments from my co-workers. I took off 1 star because the zippers need some work. Something at the end of the zipper always touched the skin causing redness and scratch when walking with these boots. This also happened with my previous Cobb Hill Sabrina boots. You definitely need some band-aids or wearing higher socks, both are not desirable for me!"
4.0,"I love these bracelets  This one is smaller than the Serenity line,  but still so nice  The navy color is a little darker than I thought it would be... looks more black... but i still love it  and because there are so many other colors,  i may get more !"
4.0,I wear a 14 regularly (36DD bra size) and this dress fit just right. It is a little loose but is as I expected and wanted. I will need to wear a slip with it as the lining under the lace is see-through. The quality of the dress is as expected given the price...perhaps a little better than I anticipated.
4.0,"They will scratch eventually, but they only cost $10. You are getting what you pay for. Just don't expect them to last or be scratch proof"
4.0,"Solid, not flimsy.  Much prettier in person.  Love that the clasp is very secure.  Nice piece of jewelry.  My friend loved it"
4.0,colors not as bright as pictured look dingy but not too bad for the price
4.0,i love the print on the olive green. the fabric is wonderful. bought xlargeplus. too small for me in the hips. im a 2x
4.0,"First, the watchband is indeed calfskin leather, something I was worried about (thought it would be some pleather crap).<br /><br />The way that you change the day/date is a bit fidgety, but can easily be worked around, as shown in the instructions.<br /><br />The weekday name is bilingual, Spanish and English, which is cool.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give five stars was just the fidgetiness of the date changing, but again it's easy to work around.<br /><br />Another concern was that the strap would be too thin for a men's watch compared to the watchface. Turns out that the watch face is pretty big, actually. The strap/watch ratio is fine."
4.0,But an Adult can also use it :)
4.0,First of all it is a good looking watch that keeps time well. The metal is decent quality but the black is scratched between the links. The pins that hold the links together are rusty and flimsy.<br /><br />Pros: Stylish and good looking.<br />  Feels solid.<br />  Keeps time<br />Cons: Scratches easily.<br />  Pins are not solid.<br />  Scratched between links when it arrived.<br /><br />TLDR: It's worth the 15 dollars.
4.0,"These are functional, fit over my glasses well, keep sun out of my eyes and glare down. Style is lacking. For the price, I expected a little more on the fashion front.  ."
4.0,I love these sandals!  The kids sizes seem to run big and the adult sizes seem to run small.  Me and my daughter get compliments on these sandals all the time.  They are very stylish and comfortable!
4.0,Fits a little on the big size not worth the price
4.0,Saw an ad for this short claiming it's the most universally flattering shirt....eh.. I wouldn't say it's flattering but it's an interesting cut which is fun
4.0,Great watch so far. Little disappointed due to the fact the wood was more of a light brown than a red like in the sellers pics.
4.0,very soft and fits very well.
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and this is super cute. My only problem is my girls get in the way with any buttons and this was no different. Solution put on a tang too underneath and I‚Äôm good to go! I got so many compliments.
4.0,These fit great and as expected. My son loved them. Give them only 4 start because I felt like the toe did wear out quickly and he ended up with a hole in them even before summer was up.
4.0,"Bought for Cross pendants, for 2 Grandsons, overall they looked nice, but did seem to twist a bit."
4.0,Sizing was bigger than expected had to order a smaller size
4.0,Nice watch for the $$$ The only downfall is its a bit small.  If you have large wrists I'm not sure it will be comfortable.
4.0,"Very comfortable, not irritating on my skin. I have sensitive skin and sweat a lot at work. Breathable and comfortable. Very secure. Not the exact colors I wanted or expected, they‚Äôre not as bright as shown, but I‚Äôm still very pleased with them. Pretty good value for your money as a lot of watch bands I‚Äôve seen are rather expensive."
4.0,There good seems like they will last a long time
4.0,"Gift for my cousin and she loved it, I do wish the symbol wasn't faded. But overall it's cute. I won't buy another one, but it's cute."
4.0,Really cute but ran small.  My grandson tossed them aside.
4.0,came nicely  packed the card  needed some help most ink was missing  from the msg  other then that was great
4.0,Light weight and pretty. I only gave a 4 because they shipped the wrong ones.
4.0,Cute bathing suit. I ordered 2 sizes bigger as suggested but still ran a little on small side. A lot longer in the torso than I expected and I'm 5'7.
4.0,Wife says it's perfect size and has plenty of storage. She bought it for a trip overseas in April. She hasn't found anything negative about it so far.<br />Very pleased with product and service.
4.0,good it but little small
4.0,Fabric a little thin but I love this. Great length for wearing with leggings.
4.0,It isnt as long as shown in the pic but i loved it anyways
4.0,Really cute bohemian statement Earrings. Love the look. The reason I knocked off a star is because the post on the back of the earring is very flimsy and thin and already came bent. I wear costume statement earrings all the time and I‚Äôm concerned these won‚Äôt last very long because of that issue. Great look though!
4.0,A little small but a keeper
4.0,It keeps my bands so I don‚Äôt miss place them.
4.0,I liked the look and I saw others who bought it said to buy it one size up. I'm a large so I bought the XLarge and it fits great. Im also tall so it is a little short but still tucks in. Hope fully it will hold it's shape after washing it.
4.0,It runs tight and a little small  but I got compliments on it. You can't go wrong with it really. It is basic and gives you a good shape.
4.0,Great replacement for my Smart Wool socks.  Not as tall as regular crew socks.  I was looking for 3/4 quarter size socks so these were perfect
4.0,Expected the fern to be embroidered rether than a press-on.
4.0,"I wear these skirts every week. Great way to kick off a new wardrobe. I am short so the skirts do go below my knee, more than I like them to, but it is easy for me to fold over the waist a bit more to bring the hem up."
4.0,"The scarf is soft and fluffy. I will see how it will hold up. It is an oversized scarf,  but not a blanket scarf and is not square. Overall a nice item for the price, but I'm still in need of a blanket scarf."
4.0,"These aren't really sticky. I have worn them for maybe 2 hours and they were falling off at that point. Another waste of money!<br /><br />Update: I received a wonderful email for customer service, stating they were sorry I was unhappy. They offered to send me a full replacement product of another Fitglam strapless bra (same product) or to fully refund my cost of the product. I choose to take a replacement and give it another try. With such great customer service, this is a company that values it's customers."
4.0,under the arm too tight
4.0,Cool but box came bent and it was a gift!
4.0,Still love it though!
4.0,"Color was as pictured, Good quality material and zipper. The style just wasnt right for my body. I am 5'2, 124#, 32 B/C and got the xsmall. It fit well, just didn't like the style on me."
4.0,Really tiny but got the job done
4.0,Fit very good..
4.0,Very nice dress. A little longer than I thought it would be but overall it is a great dress.
4.0,"A beautiful set and a great box to hold the pins neatly in. My only disappointment is that their set up isn't very secure. When I opened the box the pins were all gathered to the left side of the box tangled together. It was delivered in a plastic, bubble wrap-style bag package rather than Amazon's cardboard box so perhaps the general jostle of shipping is what caused the pins to become upset from their foam frame that holds them in place. They seem to be okay, it's just a little frustrating.<br /><br />I do love that the box itself has a magnetic catch so I can open it and look at the pins without worrying that by doing so I'll accidentally damage them."
4.0,"This dress was better than I expected.  For the price, I wasn't expecting the quality that it has.  Highly recommend - i listened to other reviews and sized up - dress was a little big but fit the style of the dress."
4.0,The quality and cost of the dress is great.
4.0,"This is for my nephew and I haven,t seen it as yet"
4.0,"I do really like these leggings. They are more of a spandex material than cotton, which is great for staying dryer in the summer. I'm about 240lbs and 5'5&#34; size 18 typically. I bought a 4xl based on the size chart. These were a bit large in the waste, loose a bit in the legs and a few inches too long, BUT still wearable. A size down would likely have been a perfect fit. My only complaint is there are some marks on the pants, as if the printed pattern rubbed off or stamped the black areas while they were folded. However still cute and will definitely be wearing with some tunic dresses this summer."
4.0,Very nice but too small. It‚Äôs not stainless steel so I hope it does not tarnish and change color.
4.0,"No issues, fit fine"
4.0,"Wow! Fits perfectly, looks beautiful, and appears to be well made. The fit is so flattering, and I feel gorgeous in it. I will definitely be buying more dresses from Anni Coco. Well worth the money!"
4.0,"This has become my favourite watch, accurate and well made with a Swiss movement. The only criticism that I have is that the lume is very weak, and consequently one cannot see the time after sundown."
4.0,The pockets on the top of each glove is a plus. I have not used them yet but from what I see they are exactly as described.
4.0,These earrings are great quality but unfortunately too big for my ears :/
4.0,100% cotton shrinks
4.0,"I took a chance and ordered this despite only one review having been available at the time. Upon arrival I gave it a good look over. Stitching appears to be good and it is cute. It‚Äôs the material that seems to be less than ideal. I‚Äôm expecting it won‚Äôt do well if it‚Äôs packed to heavy but I‚Äôm going to try it for packing around a change of light clothing, extra sandals, sunglasses and wallet while on vacation. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll hold up well if I put a bottle of water or two in it, but I‚Äôm skeptical of that extra weight."
4.0,"Won't close and stay shut with a bunch of $ and credit cards inside! Great for grab and go ie. ID, and limited cc and $."
4.0,"Bought these for my mom because she‚Äôs a big SOA fan. They fit her well, but because she‚Äôs so short (under 5 feet) they‚Äôre a bit long on her. Other than that she really likes them and was especially excited about the pockets."
4.0,"I don't think what I got was worth $30. The quality of the products were not worth the price if I'm honest. Some parts I was very happily surprised with, others I was very disappointed. Some items have a higher quality compared to other aspects.<br /><br />However, I do still think it's all very cute. The socks and gloves are adorable, and the choker and ears are as well, and are actually pretty great quality.<br />The choker did snap off once but is a pretty easy fix. The gloves are also a little long, but still great. Had no complaints with the cat ear headband.<br /><br />However, I did have a lot of issues with the socks, which ironically were what I was most excited for and what I wanted the most. Firstly, the fabric is not really sock but more pantyhose, when you bend or stretch the knee it becomes see through. The tips of the socks are severely mis-shapen, and have weird square edges on the socks that are very unappealing. Lastly, the pawpads themselves are slightly uneven.<br /><br />However, it's all still very cute and adorable. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the gel paw grips at the top of the socks, which was a very cute but also useful touch! The socks don't fall at all.<br /><br />All in all a cute, but slightly disappointing product. I was heavily debating returning it, but instead I am going to cut off the square edges and sew the socks myself to adjust it to a normal sock. Something I definitely shouldn't have to do though. I hope this is helpful for anyone considering the buy."
4.0,"works great.  Just not a fan of the string attachment for the case, so I replaced it with some metal rings I had."
4.0,"Just a size to small but, beautiful"
4.0,worked as advertised.  very light and seems well made
4.0,The color was a bit off from the picture and the suit didn't fit.
4.0,my son wore it perfect!
4.0,"I have a wide foot and unless I'm playing on wet grass, I always prefer turf shoes. These are the best I've found.  Lightweight, comfy and accommodating to wide feet. I did change the laces because I just dont like the slippery weird kind that every soccer shoe seems to come with. Reasonable price for a quality shoe!"
4.0,Cute. No issues with the dress.
4.0,It's quite heavy on the neck...
4.0,"My daughter loves this mask, it keeps the water out and doesn't fog up constantly."
4.0,"These sleeves were made from a strong, very strectchy material. I have washed them three times now and they haven't unraveled on me. They cool at the slightest breeze and they protected my arms from being sunburnt (something I'm super prone to considering I'm a redhead), however I work outdoors and was using these to cover tattoos, and throughout the day I found that they rolled down. It may be because I'm a bigger person, so my arms are bigger than the typical size this is targeted for, but that was the only downside. So basically = big arms will roll down, but everything else about this product is great."
4.0,Great bracelets in bright colors. Perfect for goodie bags and grab bags. I use them in my classroom reward box
4.0,As I stated in another review...My grand daughters loved them so much I decided to purchase a pair for myself.
4.0,"It is a very pretty watch.  However, it says that the leather band is white.  It is off-white, cream white or even beige."
4.0,Well made. True to size. Perfect pocket placement.
4.0,Great for wearing under shorter dresses this summer. Only wish buying all black had been an option.
4.0,bought this for my granddaughter super cute!!!
4.0,"Nice strappy summer dress that can also serve as a slip.  I ordered a Large based on the size chart, should have ordered the Medium instead.  The dress is a a little big in the chest area (for reference, bust is 37, waist 31).  Nevertheless, I'm keeping it, The material is medium weight and not see through.  I ordered the orange color to use as a slip underneath a pleated orange and white silk maxi dress that has long slits on the sides.  This dress gave me coverage and it looked cute peeking out from under the side slits of the maxi dress.  Will use the dress on its own come summer time.  Only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the fit in the bust area."
4.0,Super cute shoes.  They are slightly wide on my feet but my feet tend to run just a tad narrow and they are not too wide I cannot wear them.  The toe rubs a tad but I'm hoping that will soften with a little time.
4.0,"I was expecting a chain that was thicker than this one, but since returning items usually isn't worth the hassle, I decided to give this item a chance... glad I did!  I wore it to a night on the town the same day I received it, and was surprised to receive three seperate compliments on it; my waitress, a bartender, and the attendant at the gas station all had pleasant things to say about my apperance, including this silver accessory.  Needless to say, this will be around my neck until time for a replacement - thanks Bling Jewelry for the fast delivery!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a nice wallet could‚Äôve been a tad shorter so bulk would‚Äôve been a little smaller as I carry my wallets in my front pocket. Other then that build quality was nice. I‚Äôm happy with the wallet
4.0,"He loved it, his wife hated it. I enjoyed the fight. Popcorn anyone??"
4.0,Material have a very unpleasant smell. Fits well to me when I'm medium/large in other mask size products.
4.0,"2nd set I've bought for my son's Apple Watch.  The weak point on these is the little part the end of the band slides thru. not sure what to call that.  The leather weathers down well,  the band looks good but it is cheaply made.  You get what you pay for I suppose."
4.0,"Oli love the fabric style, and convertibility.  I wish it was a little longer."
4.0,Lighter grey than expected but that's ok. Great fit - classy flop and can't beat a great wood wide brim. Would buy again!
4.0,"It turned out to be a little longer than planned. I'm 5'3&#34; with a shorter torso and it hit below my knees. I could have it altered but its cute how it is and super comfy. I got the black, and blue they are nice and flowy."
4.0,"True to size, easy to get on and off.  I do wish the rubber provided coverage of the toe area because they get scuffed up easily but what can you expect from a two-year-old?!  I like these shoes a lot - my son calls them the ""worm shoes""."
4.0,Definitely runs smaller then described.
4.0,"They came in a little bent that you can see if you turn it around, but it wasn't immensely bad. It's a decent purchase if you're in a con crunch and you don't have time to make your own."
4.0,"I am 5'4"" with size 34C and I bought a size S. It fit me just right, if you are size 35 I would suggest to go with size M. Material is really soft and comfortable to wear. For me the skirt comes just below the knee. It is nice to wear in both cool and hot weather as it worked for me under the sun and as well as in my office, which remains too cold. Material is a bit stretchable which is good and makes it a comfortable wear.  Some people may not like the pockets as they look a bit loose but it is a savior for putting stuff like phones and keys. All in all I liked and received Compliment for its color."
4.0,"Colors were vivid, very nicely made.<br />Very happy with purchase."
4.0,"I‚Äôll be personally using these for food delivery service. The over all build is not that perfect. The zipper feels cheap and flimsy and can be tricky to unzip with uneven sewing job. however, the added insulated base helps to distribute the weight making it more durable. The insulation is good and managed to keep food hot for quite some time."
4.0,A little larger than expected but looks very nice. Like the multifunction dial and band. Will wear with suits and formal atire.
4.0,"I love Lipault in the carry on size as I never check any baggage anymore. It's very light weight you do not need anyone to assist you with it ever. I always get a minimal of 7 days of travel outfits, 2 sets of PJs, 14 sets of undergarments and toiletries in this bag. I also place my laptop in it without issues.  This recent one when I compare it to my others is slightly smaller than the other versions I have."
4.0,"I bought 3 pair. I love the shorts, but the pocket zipper has failed on 2 out of 3."
4.0,Very inexpensive. Looks fine for the price.
4.0,Bought for lounge pants
4.0,Seems like a well made product that should last awhile.
4.0,"It's nice and fits just a tad small, it would be better if the neck was longer, just seems shorter than it should be."
4.0,"I knew at $3 that it wasn't gonna be exactly like the picture but from a short distance it looks cute.<br />Very glittery, and honestly looks like something I'd wear when I'm married. now kinda disappointed that I bought the perfect engagement ring when I'm 19 and very single. Told everyone that I'm marrying my self and adopting cats.<br /><br />One really bad con tho. It made the underside of my right hand ring finger grey. Only underneath it tho. Not on top."
4.0,Just did not fit my style
4.0,Great product. Does as advertised. Obviously don't follow the review of the guy who thought it was for protection from germs. Some people are just cry babies.<br /><br />Buying my 2nd one. Very comfortable.
4.0,Nice fit. Zipper is on left side and hard to close. Overall nice product
4.0,"I'm 5'3"" 115 lbs and have had two children, which i believe widened my hips permanently, and so the small was too small so returned and got the medium which i can actually get on, these leggings or hose whatever you want to call them will probably help with my varicose veins but they leave a serious muffintop at the point where the compression stops at the top of the thigh. I would like to find a brand that can graduate the compression in a way that avoids this muffintop at the point where the compression melds into the butt area-- making it all more seamless, as it won't work to try to wear these under any pants as there will be a visible bulge where the compression stops. Still looking for the perfect pair."
4.0,"Bought as a gift for a my aunt who was attending a costume dinner party. She loved it, fit perfectly and completed her flapper look. Would recommend."
4.0,Ordered 4 in youth got size 8 in men
4.0,I have a small head and these fit snug as they should. No one could see my face or eyes but I could still see out. I could breath well too. They are what you would expect.
4.0,"Got these for my adult nephew because he needed replacement band for his watch. These he said fit well and are very stylish, giving him options to rotate with his daily attire."
4.0,Very comfy and cute! First time buying this brand and love it...will purchase more from KUT
4.0,It‚Äôs long enough even I‚Äôm tall 5‚Äô10. The color is not as bright. Is more of a mint green but still nice.
4.0,"This headband has 2 silicone/rubber strips inside, one on each side of the seam which help hold the band firmly.  I am a small female and it does fit well and seems to hold its shape.  I haven't washed it yet, so hopefully it will retain this stretch. I like the width, it's about 2 1/4 inches, as some are much too wide for me.  I do wonder whether this would be comfortable on a large person.<br />The one issue I find for myself is that with glasses, it seems to apply a bit of pressure on them and tends to press them too tightly.  I think it will be ok if it's not worn for too long.  Without the glasses, it's pretty comfortable and nice looking."
4.0,"Adorable print but I had to return, did not fit my daughter... was too small"
4.0,"I love these dresses. I got three of the ones that have the ruffles. Very, very flattering and easy for summer wear. The only issue I had was that some of them were made kind of jenky so I had to do a few exchanges on each of them to get ones that didn't have holes, missing elastic or were cut too short. I hope they make more with different fabrics and pay more attention to detail bc dresses like these are perfect for the Florida climate. üòéüèùÔ∏è"
4.0,This is a great kit.  My husband really liked it but it's too large to carry in his workout bag to take to the gym.  We had to replace it with a smaller Dopp kit.
4.0,"Very cute, bought a size up, and its huge on my daughter. Looked like a night gown. Couldn't wear it this year, ill have to wait until next year. Id say buy true to size."
4.0,Great product but you really can‚Äôt even use them until you‚Äôre a size 4g the smallest. Doesn‚Äôt need to go so small.
4.0,"Nice material, has shoestring tie at waist will not stay tied,and no belt loops. Nice deep front pockets ankle elastic too tight for me, other than that pants are rugged and comfortable."
4.0,This is an inexpensive no frills sandal that is perfect for the gym.  I imagine you can also use it for a trip to the beach.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äù2 and 135 pounds and got a size Small, although the measurements I was in was more of a XS. The sleeves and armpit are a tight fit for my arm that are bigger but overall everything else is good. I would recommend sizing up. The fabric also does not give much. Vet cute dress though!"
4.0,I have wide feet and very high arches. The adjustable straps help with the width and the arch support is okay.
4.0,"I have other Shoeslocker shoes and they are usually very good.  But in this case, I should have read more carefully.  I got these for my granddaughter, but they are not for little girls.  They are very cute and fashionable with the double zippers.  However, they have a hidden very high and wobbly heel which makes them more suitable for young teens.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you!"
4.0,"Stylish but too boxy for my taste. Maybe on a taller, leaner body. It's good quality and very cute, trendy."
4.0,I for one love the show charmed it looks exactly like the picture but there‚Äôs too many charms on there . I do however love the picture of the power of four . Other than that I would highly recommend if someone is a fan of the show
4.0,They are extremely comfortable to walk around in. I got lots of compliments all day. They are not stretchy however. I like to sit with my legs in cross-cross position and these made it hard to do. Other than that they‚Äôre awesome
4.0,A bit too thin to be wearing out but excellent for sleeping in. Good product.
4.0,Great watch looks nice and works fine.
4.0,"Really cute, I have bigger arms though and it doesn't stretch on the arms but still looked cute"
4.0,"Love it , so comfortable"
4.0,This is a nice top!
4.0,Nice necklaces for boys
4.0,I bought this for my daughter's 6th birthday party. The dress did fit a little small on her and she is average size to small. It's great for a costume dress. The material is thin though
4.0,"The artwork on this shirt is fantastic, its not like normal screen printed stuff that just feels like a rubber sticker that will peel off, I think this thing will survive the wash no problem. The material is soft and feels great, however it doesn‚Äôt have any cotton lining inside so its not going to be the warmest hoodie, I would say better for fall than winter. I like to have some thinner hoodies though so no issues there as long as you know what you are getting. My only true gripe with this shirt is that the sizes run quite small. I ordered a 2xl and it fits more like a 1xl. The sleeves are long enough but the body is pretty thin and a tad short. As long as you order a size up you should be very happy with it."
4.0,"Lots of loose strings and oddly a few blue sequins, I still haven‚Äôt worn it out of the house yet. It‚Äôs very cute though and pretty comfortable, I only need to wear it for one long day so I‚Äôm sure it will be fine"
4.0,"This shirt is super cute. I wish the sleeves were a bit shorter but I just roll them up a couple times. The only downside to the shirt is the bottom does not have a sewn seam so it has started to roll up and I haven‚Äôt washed it yet so I‚Äôm hoping it doesn‚Äôt get worse after. It‚Äôs not a crop top which was hard to tell whether it was or not online, its just a shorter cut."
4.0,"It goes on easy and cleans well, but it dries to a dull finish. I used a clear paste polish afterward and brought the shine back. The boots look great."
4.0,This watch was purchased ofr an elderly family member with macular degeneration.  She finds it pretty clear to read with the clean sharp contrast of the watche's face and balck numbers.
4.0,"The product looks great and good quality, just fits too big, I ended up using them in a different pair of shoes that fit too big."
4.0,"Earrings are beautiful and worth the price on their own. If you get close to the pendant, the silver part is obviously fake, but the gem is beautiful. I wore it for New Years and I was quite happy with it."
4.0,"Am 5'4&#34;ft, 125 pounds , 34A bra size.....i ordered the small but its a little tight  ( am can get away with it ), but i can't gain any more pouds..ha<br />Anyways drees its beautiful and well made it looks like a spensive dress"
4.0,"This set has me on the fence. I like the color, the fit and the length of the skirt but what I don‚Äôt like is the material and the way the items look together for some reason, they are really cute separate.  The set runs true to size so get your normal size.<br /><br />Height: 5‚Äô1<br />Weight: 196-200<br />Waist: 38<br />Hips: 40<br />Bra size: XL (US) I only wear sports bras<br />Pants size: Xl (IS)<br />Shirt size: XL (US)"
4.0,"Good quality and very soft, however the sleeves are HUGE, the rest of the sweatshirt fits as expected."
4.0,"The case is hard, with a foam-ish cover, so it's actual fabric on the case. I don't want to put it in my purse because it might get stained by a pen or whatnot. I expected the music image to be printed on, so that was unfortunate. It really is cute, though."
4.0,"Wore this for a Christmas Happy hour, comfortable & cute !  I am 5‚Äô5  138 & ordered the small. It was a bit tight at the waist but seemed to loosen as I wore. Only five stars as the tulle is pulling away from the waist band in 1 spot."
4.0,It looks EXACTLY like the picture but I got one size too big. I got Medium and I'm 5'6 and weigh 140. It was a little bit big and it was my bad. IF YOU ARE UNDER 150 POUNDS AND ARE SMALLER THAN 5'7 GET A SMALL!
4.0,I wish the belt was just a little bit bigger but still in hella good condition ü§òüèº
4.0,Super cute and flattering except it is quite small. The shirt really looks nice and flatters your body. I didn't love the darker grey area at the bottom front but otherwise it was cute. Ended up it was too small for me though.
4.0,Looks really nice. Just hope it holds up. Seems kind of cheap
4.0,This is quite pretty and delicate. I like that it is adjustable in case I'm having a puffy day. It doesn't look cheap at all.
4.0,"The material is soft and nice. The construction is good, excellent stitching. The sleeves are longer than usual. The size was roomy, but the unusual thing is  the shorter front. It doesn‚Äôt seem short enough to be a ‚Äú crop top‚Äù, but hangs high.  This is illustrated on the product site also and it is not due to a large bust. If you are long waisted it might be a problem, if you are short waisted you might just  love it."
4.0,"Great shoes!!! So cute and I wore them all summer. Only problem is the ankle strap weakens over time and I twisted my ankle a few times. Nothing that ice and elevation can't fix. But, I hated taking time off from the gym."
4.0,The smaller rings fit great.  The regular sized rings are just a bit bigger than my fingers.  I have small fingers at a size 6 ( I think).  I do fear that if you wear them often they may start to discolor.  Make sure to not get them wet!
4.0,It looks so so so much better than the pucture.
4.0,I purposely bought it a size bigger than me (I wear a 2to 3x but bought a 4x)  to be safe and it is actually a little bit big length wise. The material is also thicker than I expected but not to heavy. I'm happy with the purchase and plan to get it in another color at some point.
4.0,Good quality fabric but it has a very shallow v neck not like n pic....it is a cotton jersey type fabric.  Also the sleeves have some kind of stitching done toward the bottom of the sleeves that is just weird...idk y it's there. Overall it's a cite shirt but I ordered a size up & it's DEF not long enough to wear alone...its cute with leggings
4.0,Runs a bit small but the quality of material is awesome
4.0,"Very cute cardigan. The material is thinner than expected. The color is slightly off, but I love the style of it."
4.0,They feel very comfortable
4.0,lightweight - will be great for summer wear!
4.0,"Absolutely love, Love, LOVE! Way better than the first mirrored pair with wood frames. Super sturdy and sharp looking, just needed a case to protect these awesome shades. Only reason for 4/5 stars."
4.0,"These are wonderful, thick tights that are a true ballet pink color. They are perfect for my 6-year-old's dance class. An average of $5/pair is a fair price, in my opinion, for these quality tights. So glad they come in a 3-pack"
4.0,"Love this belt!  Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it had an odd smell there for awhile (like turpentine or something!) but it seems to be better now.  Otherwise, gorgeous!!"
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture. Maybe a little more texture in a good way. Love it.
4.0,Well made but was too small for me
4.0,Good quality belt needs more holes but nice & dressy.
4.0,"Bought this top in black and dusty rose for kicking it around the house. The material is soft if a bit thin (but bra won‚Äôt show through). I ordered a medium, as I wear a size 8. Honestly-I probably could have gone with a small-but the top is comfortable and will work dressed up or down.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 165 for reference."
4.0,Beautiful color and love the tie it is just a tad sheer so I had to wear an undershirt for work.
4.0,"Came on time. Lightweighe sweater dress. Thin but not too thin. I'm 5'2"" bubble battle and 36B chest. About 145lbs. I ordered the small. It fits good. Not clingy, but not super baggy. I like mine a little loose. Downside attracts alot of lint, but nice otherwise."
4.0,"This dress fit okay. I felt a little like I could have tried a smaller size. The photos are of the 8. I'm a size 8 in e.g. CK or Vince Camuto, size M in Pattyboutik. It wasn't very flattering on me. It managed to hide my bust and not really look like I had a waist. Hips looked decent. I was worried the style was a little too vintage for it to have wide utility. The color was a saturated turquoise/aqua. (A little bluer than expected.) The fabric has a nice weight to it but is not lined. I could see my pantyline unless I was wearing hose."
4.0,These earrings are really cute but whatever the metal part that goes into your piercing is made of made my ears hurt. I cant wear them. I have sensitive ears.
4.0,Looked like the photo. I'd order again!
4.0,it looks more like the orange one than the caramel one. quite nice & pretty stretchy.
4.0,"Like these a lot, though they are slightly see through.  Need to wear nude colored underwear with these."
4.0,Bought this for my husband fits him great.
4.0,They were smaller then I thought they would be but look pretty cool. The only problems I had with them is the pointy end digging into my skin behind my ear and puss coming out my ear holes
4.0,Nice hoodie. Grandson loved it. Good fit.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:5ef47b7da1fdfcade1d247580769fa4]] It‚Äôs funny because I purchased the medium which runs super small but the size large is too big!! ( I own in other colors) I love this sweater though because it‚Äôs super comfy and fabulous to wear around the house!!
4.0,"I like this cute wallet. I thought my iphone 7 would fit in the zippered side, but it's a tight fit. Zippered side holds cash and coins, snap side has over 12 spots for cards. It's the only wallet I've used for several months now (as you can see, it's dirty) and it's holding up well. Good stitching. Wallet has a canvas-plastic feel to it. Main zipper has a beautiful leaf design which is nicely weighted.  My only complaint is the zipper for the coin pocket broke after only a couple of months, but it was repairable"
4.0,"They're extremely comfortable but I wish they were a little longer, like in the picture."
4.0,"Cute dress.  I bought it as a maternity dress.  It fit fine, but the material is a bit heavy.  Great color."
4.0,I loved the thickness S well as how soft it was. It was an overall baggy look for my petite frame.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but a bit bigger than expected"
4.0,"Very cute earrings!! Color is light green, not like in the picture, but still worth buying them. Nicely packed in a gift box (see pictures). Arrived sooner than expected."
4.0,"Super cute, just wish they had more colors and more supply of the good colors. I ordered yellow bc that was the only color left that would go with blue."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:d6dedbd6483517f34ca8c7a53a56e85a]] I love love love this Jumpsuit. Those who know me and know this is all he but the straps honey the straps. I got surprised for my birthday yesterday and boy boy boy as we pull up In front of the restaurant literally waiting for Valet. My both straps pop at the same time. Mind you I'm not a busty girl nor do I have broad shoulders. The lower tummy to fanny area was big so was the lower back but I was turning heads the whole evening. I will get again when they revamp the straps. 5'9 135lbs and got a size Small.
4.0,Comes too small and not really adjustable.
4.0,Very thin material but looks great on. The picture does not show the true awesome colors of the shirt. The blue and orange are much bolder. We went up a size and it fits perfect for my husband.
4.0,Fun but you have to be careful not to brake it.
4.0,"Looks great, but feels not very supportive at the bottom. However it doesn't leave my feet feeling sore or anything either. I use it pretty daily, I just don't think they will last for long though."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. The quality wasn't great. The lace on the top of the back ripped a little. My daughter still wore it and it looked great but it was a bit snug. my daughter usually wears a small in juniors but we could barely get the small zipped. Overall, I was happy with it and would buy it again."
4.0,It's a keychain. Hoorah!
4.0,"My mom loved it. Easy to put on, waterproof. Very inexpensive for daily wear."
4.0,"I would recommend sizing down for this particular line, not sure about the higher waisted tummy control ones or the other versions of leggings but these run just a touch big. The color is gorgeous though, almost an exact dupe for the much sought after dusty green color of the align II pant from Lululemon. Knocked off a star for them not being moisture wicking though, I got in the car the other day and was simply sort of hot on during my short 10 minute drive while my car cooled off, and when I got out of the car I had sweat lines int he folds where the legs meet the pelvis and on the tummy line, so I wouldnt even attempt to wear this particular color to the gym or at an outdoor event. But the color, length, and especially feel are amazing and it does still make me want to try other versions of the 90 degree leggings that are said to be more sweat proof."
4.0,Nice versatile dress.
4.0,"I loved this dress, the material, and overlay in the front area where you tie the belt. However the D-ring belt kept moving and was really hard to place. Likewise since there was no loop to connect the belt once you put it through the ring it just had to dangle. Which in my opinion was not aesthetically pleasing. I would however, recommend this dress for office wear with some heels. Size fit perfect though."
4.0,I can wear a 3X. 250. 6‚Äô2‚Äù.  The xxl fit perfectly.  Double seams.  We will see if the fabric retains its shape.  Not a silky shirt like most quick dry...this is built for everyday wear.  Would look perfect under a business jacket.  Shows no chest hairs when on.  Solid
4.0,"These are smaller than I would like, but they are pretty."
4.0,"Ordered this in the deep wine color, and it came much lighter than expected. The shade was still very pretty though, and I like it. If you're usually a 2X, this will still fit you but it will be quite tight, especially across the chest area and armpits. The stretch makes it wearable though, and the fit and flare cut is extremely flattering. I'm usually a size 18 in dresses, for reference. It fell maybe two inches below my ankles and I wore it with flat sandals without issues. I'm 5'4."
4.0,I like that the strength fits what was described but I am not sure that Blue light blocking glasses are for me. Many people talk about the benefits but I think they shade my view enough I might prefer plain readers over blu blockers. I will keep trying and see if it improves
4.0,"I love the look of this sweater, but the buttons do not stay buttoned. Very disappointed."
4.0,They're not quite as warm as I was hoping for and they're a tiny bit long in the finger (though I have really small hands) but overall they look really nice and are comfy. I wouldn't recommend for really cold weather though it is in the 30-40's where I live and while my hands are less cold they are still cold.
4.0,"But it did run a little big, especially around the middle."
4.0,"At first receipt of the package, I thought I made a mistake with this purchase, but I was wrong, the fit was great, and it was comfortable."
4.0,Granddaughter loved it. Wish had bought a size bigger cause she grew out of em month later
4.0,Cute but didn‚Äôt fit like the  blue dress I ordered. I have the blue one and I love it but the black was almost a little shorter then the blue one and a little tighter in the chest. Maybe size up but over all super cute and sheer
4.0,"Tight around shoulders/elbows, thin see through fabric"
4.0,"Purchased these as a last-second stand-in for a Captain Marvel outfit when I didn't have time to make a pair of gloves. Material is thin, and the gloves were more mid-forearm than elbow-length (I'm 5'10&#34; and have long arms). The gloves aren't absolutely spectacular, but they'll serve your costume needs."
4.0,"It is a very good product, it is a very helpful"
4.0,"Love them, very warm"
4.0,We gave these as a gift. They are beautiful earrings.  Only negative was the box that they were in was not one that the earrings fit well in.
4.0,"I thought I had purchased two black bracelets, but I actually purchased one black and one brown bracelet.  I was happy with my mistake!  Now I have two bracelets that I can wear with any outfit.  The clasps are magnetic and turn to fasten.  They are a breeze to put on by myself with one hand.  They are thin and simple making them perfect for stacking with other bracelets.  I love them and will purchase again.  I received this product for free or at a discount."
4.0,Nice shirt for the price. Same protection as the big names
4.0,I was looking for cotton socks with little or no elastic at top of sock.  There is a little more elastic than I wanted but these are of good quality.
4.0,These are more of a size for little kids. My 8 year old has to fully tug them over his head to get them on. He says their ok and hasn‚Äôt complained but I am going to get bigger ones for him. Should be good for smaller headed kids.
4.0,Excellent construction. Nice materials. The padding is superior. Air flow is great. There is an issue with the snaps popping open when sitting. I solved it by purchasing the Welsh heavy duty 2 inch wide y-suspenders available on Amazon and adding buttons to the inside of the waistband.
4.0,Like the color as well  as the fit.
4.0,"great scarf, thank you. light weight and will be perfect to wear in spring and early fall as I planned."
4.0,Great looking shoes and comfortable...
4.0,Works great and good price.
4.0,They are nice enough with plenty of pockets and fit well. I think though I prefer the shorts without the spandex inner lining.
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty, however I gave it 4 stars because in reality, you cannot tell that the ribbon is a ribbon by any means at all when the necklace is on. Sadly, no one would recognize that this is to represent Melanoma Cancer unless you tell them."
4.0,I bought this product to help me sweat and it did the job .
4.0,My husband commutes to work on his bike. He loves that he can stop to look at his phone if needed without changing glasses.
4.0,It was actually very beautiful n super sexy. However I am a curvy woman with a nice size butt so shorts where snug. Would definitely buy but up size.<br />I'm 5'2 145 lbd n I think it was a medium I ordered
4.0,"This SONJA BETRO top is just not cut right for me. The V-neck is too low and my lowest cut bra shows. The material is very thin and tends to pill. Somehow the shoulders are not cut right. They don't hang from my shoulders in an attractive way. Perhaps it's just my body configuration, but this is not an attractive top to me."
4.0,"I love the dress, but I wish it came in other sizes."
4.0,little tight in the arms but might just be the style
4.0,I love this bracelet and it was a bit costly for A bracelet. I recently just purchase this and as soon as I got it the ring that hold the pendant was loose but I didn‚Äôt think much of it and today I realiZe they the ŒëŒ¶ pendant was gone :( is there a way you guys can send me a new pendant or purchase just the pendant or send back the brazelet and get a new one? The bracelet is pointless without the ŒëŒ¶ pendant...
4.0,"This is a very nice watch. It's super smooth to setup and this particular one has Spanish and English dates, which is really cool."
4.0,"I like them and if you dont like the length you can roll them down and they look more fuzzy. Though not as warm as actual winter wool socks, my feet can still get cold in them. I wish there were more options for men with these kinds of socks."
4.0,"This band is one of the only bands I am finding that securely fits the gear. It snaps into place and won't come apart randomly. I will say that the color is a lighter blue than as pictured. And one end the the band is not flush with the face of the watch. Minor details that haven't made me appreciate it any less. I got it last weekend and have been submerging it in warm water every day and the pattern on the leather has not faded. I would keep it away from bleach. It seems like it might damage it. I do not know that for sure though, because I have not gotten any bleach on mine."
4.0,Shirt runs a little small and the material was not what I expected (kind of a slick material). My husband liked it so I kept it and it looks nice on.
4.0,They cover my ears and keep them warm. The material that s thin and soft. There are buttons for mask ear loops. The buttons are small but work ok.
4.0,I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased review.<br />The dress fits great! Its just not my style and I didn't like how it looked on me.
4.0,"I ordered large size for these black gloves.I am very impressed with the box they came in, nicely packed. The color is lustrous black and very elegant looking. The inside of the glove is the wool material which is very soft. I do feel its warm,but I can‚Äôt comment fully on that as the weather has started to get little warm here in Charlotte. So,may be next winter the warmth will be fully tested!! They work fine on the ipad, but when it came to texting,I had little trouble scrolling and pressing correct button on screen.The part that connects the index finger and thumb, which I pointed in the picture ,that area is little tight and stretches and gives  a little discomfort. But overall, I like it and would recommend to a friend!!<br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review; receiving this product at a discount in no way alters my opinions on this product, which I have tested to the best of my ability. The review above contains my genuine thoughts, opinions and concerns regarding this product.**"
4.0,Fit her a little big but she loves them. Hopefully she'll grow into them soon.... haven't washed them in the washer yet so I'm hoping they'll hold up since they have gotten quite dirty. But they are totally super cute as pictured and comfortable !
4.0,"Older feet, but these are the most successful slippers ever."
4.0,Like the shape and cut
4.0,"Close to perfect. Only problem is that the color runs not only during washing, but also leaves blue-ish color on your body."
4.0,These glasses have been great thus far. I like the lenses so far. The flexible yet responsive frames and  lenses have been tough. I would definitely purchase these again.
4.0,"First of all, this isn't a bad product. It's well made and put together, the fur is soft and the collar is cute.<br />Trouble is it didn't fit my buddy who I got it  for. I also tried it. No go. He wore cat ears all con. The only person in the house that could wear the tail and collar is 4'10"" and 125lbs.<br />So, not a bad purchase! But only fits the smaller range of sizes."
4.0,Not sawed right inside out not happy with it
4.0,Comfort and made well
4.0,"The metal is very nice quality and the ring is super cute. It's on the bigger side, but I tend to go for the bigger ones so that's fine for me. My only problem is that the jewel gets flipped around so you can't see the pink a lot. Other than that it's a really nice ring."
4.0,"good design, quality fabric"
4.0,"I've used these straps on a half-dozen flights so far. The straps are durable, they adjust easily to fit, and they make it much easier to spot my all-black luggage at the baggage claim carousel. My only complaint is that they seem to pick up scuff marks and rubbed-off color pretty easily."
4.0,"Fiance said the product for perfect, form fitting but not too tight. Fabric was very soft and comfy, and quality of the product was great. Unfortunately, she was looking for no seam in the front and a seam in the back (this has seam in feont and back), to fit her needs. Other than that personal preference, these are great yoga pants and we would definitely recommend these to friends and family."
4.0,"They are nice boots, except they are not very comfortable, they need a little cushion inside."
4.0,Color allows me to be seen in the almost dark in the summer.
4.0,No clasp as shown in photo. More like a shawl that just hangs. Clean white color and very soft. Great size
4.0,"I love having something that is unique.  I've been using this for almost two years and it's beginning to lose its form and stretch out, but I'm looking to purchase another in a different pattern."
4.0,the buttons are not sewed on that well. Be careful.
4.0,I like that it's mesh.  I get tired of wearing baseball caps; this is a nice substitute.
4.0,Tad to tiny for my tiny wrist but i loved it but returned
4.0,Cheap fabric but cute design. You get what you pay for
4.0,Very well-made comfortable material stockings were disappointing but overall well worth the money.
4.0,Love these leggings. They fit well.
4.0,These earrings are really pretty. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of compliments on them. Just wish they didn‚Äôt slide off center so easily. I have to adjust them often...but still love them
4.0,Looks great with high-waisted jeans if you're sensitive about showing your belly. Looks excellent with low-rise if you're showing off what you got. It's nice. Get your girl on!
4.0,I'll just have to wear this tank top with a black sports bra and jeans for an even more relaxed look.
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute. I did throw away the belt, it was orange I didn‚Äôt care for it, I had a cute brown belt that I wore and got lots of compliments. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 140lbs ordered M"
4.0,Exactly how it looks in the picture. Very cute.
4.0,Love everything about this robe other than the tie sash is NOT very long at all.  I prefer longer ones to tie properly.  But I do love the material and the feel of it for Spring and Summer.
4.0,Its a very good product for couples but putting the bracelet back together is a little  tricky to put it back on but its not bad
4.0,My daughter loves the nickles
4.0,Wish it didn't cost so much but it works make it easier to breath very adjustable
4.0,"Overall, this bike short is pretty comfortable, well pad, and using it on the bike works pretty good.  Basically, using it on the bike, it's a good fit.  The problem is, while I am outside, and while I get off the bike, it looks kinda funny with the padding, and it feels a little tighter then expected."
4.0,The shirt fit as expected and the material is very soft!  My only complaint was that I wore it the first time without washing it and the dye from the black sleeves turned my underarms dark.  But since washing it I've worn it again and have not had that problem.
4.0,"I got this through good ol' amazon for 85% off. For the price of a bunch of wilty flowers, I got her something a little different for Valentine's day. The pendant was pretty, and I like the little silver Angel (my wife has a thing for angels) and red jade? Hmm,, never heard of it. The chain was a bit too flimsy and small, but pretty as well. I bought a 16 inch silver, tiny rope, chain. We'll see how she likes it, then I'll update. Note* if you have all kinds of money, hundreds of extra dollars laying around to throw at Valentine's, this review will not mean the same to you as it does to us working class folks. Thx."
4.0,Absolutely a great buy. My friend wears his daily.  He has gotten plenty of complements. I will be purchasing again in another color.
4.0,This dress was beautiful!
4.0,"They are good joggers and fit perfectly on my petite girlfriend. She likes them, but the ""Mint green"" color is not the same as the picture shows."
4.0,"Very handy, but not all roller balls worked well."
4.0,"I ordered my usual size a Medium and it fit more snug than anticipated. For reference I wear a 6/8 in pants, 34B bra. The fit was was fine through the chest but more fitted through the hip area than I was looking for. I‚Äôll be keeping them just because finding workout tops while store are closed is a challenge."
4.0,"Good hat. Arsenal colors were spot on, not at all a cheap made hat. looks like official arsenal hat, and shipped really fast."
4.0,Other than scales going the wrong way they are good. Good for my costume but the OCD in my won't let me wear them all the time but my friend is enjoying them
4.0,So initially I was disappointed with this dress but turns out it was because it was backwards! Once I worked that out the dress was actually pretty awesome! I did have the pockets taken out of it at the local dry cleaner (not a fan of extra stuff on my hips) this needed up being my baby shower and maternity shoot dress üòä
4.0,Cute 100% polyester short kimono you can throw over a dress or bathing suit. It is one size fits all and it is cute and fun. This is a handwash item because it dries well and you don't have to worry about catching it on a zipper. I am not crazy about the colors so make sure you look close enough to see them.
4.0,My dad loves it while fishing and doing yardwork
4.0,"Very high cut in the hip area and not meant for the girlies with big lips, this thing will give you a wedgie in all the areas but it's very cute and I'll live with it"
4.0,"I love the color of these stones and have many things they go with, but the size of the stones could have been a little smaller making it look a little less gaudy.  I still enjoy wearing it and have gotten compliments."
4.0,"This suit is VERY sexy, I love the low back and plunging front.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is because the bottom is VERY skimpy.....pretty much turns into a thong when you walk.  Also, there are WAY too many strings.  I ended up removing the two on the sides that tie in bows and then ran the shoulder/ back straps through the loops."
4.0,Very cute. Thick material that would be great for a night out on a cool summer night. Giving it 4 stars because it is a little bulky in the armpit area. Sleeves are very wide. Not for office wear as I had intended.  Very deep neckline. Showed my bra. 40 x 35 x 46. Fit well in the waist. Can be worn off the shoulder if you don‚Äôt mind a little slouch.
4.0,"This is a really nice watchband with the added value of being double sided.  It is well made and I fell will last quite a while.  The only thing I don't like is that because it has a textured finish I find it abrasive on the inner surface, but for me this is a minor bother."
4.0,"From the wearer:  Cute shoe, but not comfortable for standing or walking for a full day.  If you want to make a fashion statement and don't plan on doing a lot of walking...spot on!"
4.0,First one I received was too tight I went one size up anfpd it fits perfect.
4.0,In photo it is bright  peridot grass green. In reality it is a drab olive.
4.0,Quality wasn't up to my expectations. Fits good (I'm an 8). I just expected more for $10 on a &#34;find&#34;. Love the graphic and haven't seen anything that comes close to this. I will definitely enjoy wearing it. The style and graphic give me a definite lift in spirit and motivation. I can dream of diving and vacation and being mysterious as I do my 3 mile am walk in 90 degrees with major humidity in the suburbs of Memphis TN
4.0,"Warn enough for what I need,little hard to get on."
4.0,"I am in a weird size where large is usually big and medium is small, however this mostly fit except for the butt. Its not bad enough so I can't wear the suit but since I'm still trying to lose weight I will buy the medium next time. I usually wear a large suit or size 10-12. This would be good for 12-14 size."
4.0,"I like these cycling gloves.  Very comfortable.  Would give 5 stars, but the website's sizing chart was impossible to decipher.  I ordered an XL that was too large.  Then had to order Large which fit better.  Arrived just in time for my event."
4.0,Do not order a size up.  It makes the sleeves too long.
4.0,"Love the buckle,but sometimes its hard to loosen & take off undo, you have to be sure to push in & pullup on latch."
4.0,Milacolato 6pcs titanium 16g endless hoops. These are great for the tragus and cuff ear piercing. I really like the endless hoop it is alot harder to yank these out accidentally when combing my hair. The hoops snap into each other so there is no little wire to string into a tube like the other kinds of hoops. The titanium is strong and did not cause any skin irritation or problems when inserted.  The diffrent sizes are great and the hoops are nice quality and seem durable. Great value pack of sizes.
4.0,I love the pair but they are too small so they lost one star
4.0,I like it. Only wore it once and got a lot of compliments. The circle looks like its changing color already. For the price I might buy it again just bc it looks nice and different.
4.0,I had to give this to my little cousin.  It looked like a childs xl jacket I will not be ordering from this company again
4.0,"These are very nice shoes.  They are well made and designed.  I like that you can just slip them on, I usually wear them around the house...sometimes outside if it's just in the grass and there's no mud.  These are really indoor shoes though.<br /><br />The quality is quite good, in all ways, from the soles to the liner to the top and sides.  They should be, considering the price.<br /><br />However, the fit seems off.  I ordered 10.5 wide...they seem more like 11 or maybe even 11.5.  They don't fit like other 10.5 wide shoes fit me.  I've worn Sketchers, New Balance, and Under Armor 10.5 wides, and these are the worst fit.  The fit is good, and adjustable, for width and thickness of my feet...they just seem like they are too long.<br /><br />They are also a bit difficult to adjust, but there is a technique that works.<br /><br />In lieu of laces, there are two velcro flaps at the side of the tongue.  You really have to get them tight enough, which means putting the shoe on, opening one side, tightening it but keeping the tongue pulled back and aligned correctly from front-to-back, then doing the same on the other side.  This gets them tight enough, and once properly adjusted, you can slip them on and off and they shouldn't feel like they want to fall off...except of course for the extra length of the shoe.<br /><br />They also have inserts that act as shims, in the case that your feet are not thick enough to allow you to tighten them down enough (I didn't need these).  BTW, those inserts don't fit my other 10.5 wide shoes, reinforcing my belief that these are at least half a size longer.<br /><br />I think you probably want to get these half a size smaller than you're used to...that should take care of the size issue.  I decided to keep them anyway, because even if they don't fit perfectly, they still manage to be comfortable, and I really didn't want to wait or go to the trouble of sending them back and getting another pair.<br /><br />The other question is whether or not they are worth the price.  I'm not really sure that I couldn't find something as or nearly as good, for less money, but they are very nice shoes.  If the price seems too steep for you, try something else.<br /><br />However, if you can afford it without sacrificing something else, I don't think you'll be disappointed (except maybe in the fit).  As I said, they are very nice shoes...but not life altering.  I might buy these again, when it's time to replace this pair...and I might not.  I'll shop for something cheaper, and if nothing catches my eye, I'll probably go ahead and order these again, a half size smaller...but maybe I'll buy something else instead.  Since I can't even decide for myself if they're worth the price, I certainly can't decide for anyone else.<br /><br />One final note: the lining is very warm.  I would even say it's a bit too warm.  If you want warm feet and you like really thick socks, you'll probably appreciate the lining...but if you find your feet getting too warm sometimes, you'll probably take them off from time-to-time just because you feel like they are too warm (that has been my experience).  I don't think the liner is a deal breaker either way; it's too warm for me, but only a little, and I really think some people will really like the thick, warm lining.  However, if it's very important to you that your feet can breath, these are probably not for you."
4.0,"This is a very cute jacket!  It's lightweight, perfect for fall.  I think it runs a little small.  I ordered one size larger after reading the reviews, and I'm glad I did. The larger size fits perfect."
4.0,It is definitely high waist and long a tall girls dream. My only con is the seem at the waist is thick and the elastic doesn‚Äôt line up so shows when on. If your a perfectionist like me you will find yourself fixing especially for IG pix
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 185lbs. I bought the wine red #3 in Large. Fits well. I have big boobs so the top part ends right under my boobs. And it‚Äôs to my ankles. Overall, I like it but since I‚Äôm pregnant I probably could‚Äôve gone with the xl since there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much room for my boobs to grow into. It‚Äôs very light- weight, (Almost see-through) which is fine for the summer.<br />Not the greatest quality but a pretty, thin, stretchy, summer dress to hang around in."
4.0,"It looked pretty good, a little thin.  You could see the shirt on underneath but was very comfy!"
4.0,"http://www.amazon.com/Top-Plaza-Fashion-Womens-Bracelet/dp/B015IUWLBM?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1<br />The watch is very stylish and contemporary.  I really like that it has a large face, and the colors are beautiful  I have received so many compliments while wearing it .  The bangle size is very generous, and it will fit up to a large size wrist.  It has been keeping perfect time and it was already set to my time when I  received it.  Thank you so much for the opportunity to review your product at a discounted price in exchange for my review.."
4.0,I bought these for my mom who doesn‚Äôt need a lot of arch support in her feet. These flip flops are good quality with not that pronounced arch support - which is what I was looking for. The look and aesthetics are modern and the flip flops are comfortable.
4.0,"This is a cute and casual long-sleeve dress, and I like that it has pockets. The dress looks nice, and is a good dress to wear casually, and I like its purple color. This is a nice dress that is soft and comfortable to wear, and looks nice. Overall this is a cute dress."
4.0,"Nice enough beanie for the money, this isnt a dollar store beanie, its a quality product. I would recommend it."
4.0,"Cute, very small. Didn't pay attention to the size. My 3 year old wears them because they are too small for me"
4.0,"Wallet has lasted a good long time for me. Only complaint is that the ID plastic broke out of the leather and I've had to tape it back in.<br /><br />Other than that, it's been a great wallet! Zippers all still work, and I can fit all I need into it easily without it being too big. Just sad about the plastic."
4.0,"Nicely packaged, very timely. My iPhone with a case fits in. Great for running light errands."
4.0,Very nice watch. Multi functional. Just received it today so I will update in a few weeks.
4.0,"I've gained weight, so I didn't know what size I should get. I chose Large which was perfect because it fit snugly and was a decent length. I felt very nice in it too which has been a struggle for me with some dresses. The one thing about the dress that surprised me was the fabric I wasn't expecting it to be stiff. But it couldn't lay like it does if it was any other fabric I believe. Thank you very much!"
4.0,"I got these for a fun party during the Christmas holiday.  The hats fit great, like the words (we fight for the Nice one...lol)  Hats are made well.  The necklace bulbs are fun and have a slide switch for solid, blinking and flickering.  Can also be used just for holiday decor.  Great buy and fun too!!!"
4.0,Good for short swims for working out. No saltwater yet.
4.0,"This is a fantastic looking product, but it is not so comfortable resting on my clavicle (collar-bone) as it could be if lighter weight. I think some greater degree of comfort could be obtained by adding a mechanism at the hinge to allow the wearer to adjust the angle of the hinge, so that in front, the head of the snake would be a bit farther from the tail. It seems for this wearer, that would be a more comfortable solution."
4.0,"bought these for my granddaughter to wear under dresses, or exercise shorts and they work perfectly.  She can wear them as exercise shorts around the house (but not right for school dress codes).  They fit her well."
4.0,Great jacket! I usually take extra large but after reading reviews I went one size down and it fits perfect.  Tested it out in the shower to see how well it old work and it performed like a champ!
4.0,"Very colorful.  I feel like a tropical fish when I wear them, which is great when the weather outside is frightful, their look makes me feel delightful."
4.0,Dress arrived early and fits great
4.0,"If you love bearpaw. These are perfect to add to  a winter wardrobe,and collection. Different,nice neutral color,and pink is perfect for all year,even summer..If you like shorts and boots. So soft too...one of my go too s."
4.0,Top is nice but I ordered large after reading the reviews. I am 5'2 and 113 lbs. Medium would have been much better.
4.0,"It's not a bad buy for the price, but it is a little cheap looking. Didn't expect anything different though."
4.0,"This dress was a hit. I'm 5'8 and 180lbs I brought a large. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the train of the dress was a different shade of black, but you can only tell if the lights are bright at the event. The material is thick you couldn't see all my lumps and bumps üòä that was a plus."
4.0,"This is a good quality product, no frays or hanging strings anywhere. I would not consider it a compression shirt, but it is form fitting and long enough to keep tucked it; coming down to mid buttocks."
4.0,"I bought two; one for my daughter and one for me. We are loving them!<br />Nice and flowing, light fabric, and POCKETS! What more could you ask?!"
4.0,"4 only because they're a bit heavy ,but really pretty!"
4.0,I like this dress however it isn‚Äôt designed to tie in the front as seen in the photos. You CAN tie it in the front but the side seams will shift out of place. Still very cute when tied in the back but I really wanted to tie in the front.
4.0,Love love love this bracelet. Get compliments on it every time i wear it. The only issue i have is its very big and i can tighten it but it loosens up throughout the day. But that‚Äôs not stopping me from wearing it!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,"These turned out to be cuter than I thought they were when I first received them. I expected them to be a bit bigger but I guess because I have a round face, they felt small. If I look over and down, there is no lens coverage because the cat eye is a bit small.. All in all though, I think they look adorable and I wear them often."
4.0,"Nice quality for the price,great coloring on the links"
4.0,The finger jewelry was broken upon arrival.
4.0,Beautiful beautiful dress has a tiny bit of stretch to it but runs a little small I love it I will suggest ordering a size up sadly I have to return but I‚Äôm going to try to order the next size up
4.0,"They appear to be well made, they are sized properly. I think I will like them. I will not use them until October when it cools down. I will rate them 5 stars if they are warm  and rain resistant."
4.0,I love them.  They are very cute. Only issue is if you doubt wear them like pictured they kind of look like mom jeans.  But if you are cute you can make them work!
4.0,"It's cute ,I like it a lot just wish it was a little more sturdy."
4.0,I bought a 2T for my 1 year old and it fits like an 18-24 month. Overall decent quality and adorable.
4.0,Great for the price. I had to remove a link. Looks good with my 2-tone watch
4.0,"Here is the deal, the china sizing sucks, they are small guys.. You have to size 2 times your American size and then the shirts will fit. I wear a large and ordered 2x extra and bingo they finally fit."
4.0,I love this simple and sturdy backpack. It is foldable and washable. I can keep it in my bigger backpack for day use or use as a shopping bag. The drawstrings are made of thick material. I am excited to use the backpack for every day use.
4.0,This sandal/flip-flop is more substantial than the pair I got from Target.  The straps don't collapse like cheap flip-flops so they do take up a little more space in your gym bag.  They are made from a more solid material that does not soak up water and I think they will last longer.  I've used them for a couple of weeks now -- so far so good.
4.0,"Very big with an open weave but a nice sweatshirt substitute as it‚Äôs a step up from that and with a turtleneck under it, it‚Äôs fairly warm. I shrank it on purpose so I didn‚Äôt have to send it back. No label so I have no idea which way is front or back but that doesn‚Äôt seem to matter."
4.0,I should of bought a size smaller due to I can already put it on the 3rd row of hooks and it's a little big where the straps are.
4.0,"This sports bra is adorable! But be sure to order 1-2 sizes larger than you normally would. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 140#, typically wear 38B or large size bras. I ordered an XL and it is definitely snug, but it works!"
4.0,"The quality isn't the greatest, the fabric is kind of thin, but the print quality is good."
4.0,Very nice . Wish I would gave ordered both colors.Runs small
4.0,"Super cute, not too heavy and they don't look cheap. One of my clasps did break off tho one one of the earrings but nothing a little dab of super glue couldn't fix real quick. All is well."
4.0,"Amazing belt for the price, definitely worth the purchase. Fit perfectly.<br /><br />It would be perfect if the belt was slightly wider though."
4.0,Great romper! Well made abs not see through. Very cute! Can dress up or wear casual. Great material too.
4.0,"Had to purchase a new watch as the strap was broken on my old.  In this pandemic I didn‚Äôt want to go down to Walmart and purchase strap.  For same money or even less, I was able to get a new watch."
4.0,"Very Cute, and the party that received them was very happy."
4.0,Very pleased with the rings
4.0,"I needed several inexpensive ties and these were great. You can tell they aren't high end ties, but they were nice."
4.0,Much thinner favric than expected
4.0,"This feels like a sturdy business card holder. I like that my magnetic name tag also sticks to it! I‚Äôm giving it four stars because I was expecting it to be more of an acrylic design but it‚Äôs some sort of vinyl.  The colors are not as vibrate as I would have liked, it actually kind of looks faded. With that being said, I‚Äôm still keeping this cutie!"
4.0,"Love this necklace. It's cheap material and broke pretty quickly, but considering the price, I'm happy with my purchase. Necklace finally fell apart completely today after about 5 months, so buying a new one to replace it. Worth it imo. :)"
4.0,"The colors are vibrant. The material is really nice and breathable,, very lightweight. Will help you stay cool on a hot day. But the size fits small. I would definitely order a size up"
4.0,The package was cute and it arrived early. It was longer and thinner than I expected but it works. I really like how it looks.
4.0,"Love the cut of the shirt. Love peplum tops. This one goes down to my hips, which is nice for wearing with leggings.<br />The material is like the athletic shirt material that is almost like leotard material for dance costumes. It has a sheen to it, but it also has a decent weight to it. In certain lighting, it will show every bit of texture beneath the shirt.<br />However, despite it not being the material type that I was hoping for, i still love the shirt.<br />I own a lot of peplum tops! I love their femininity .<br />I actually wear this shirt backwards. I have the v neck opening on the back. The reason for this is the way the choker portion of the shirt is cut, it presses directly against my throat. And while I love a good turtleneck shirt, I actually think this particular shirt is more comfortable and even more stylish backwards with the opening at the back. The silhouette of this shirt, is gorgeous. You can dress it up or way down- and keep your feminine style.<br />I'm typically a size Small or 4 Tall. I wear 32DD. I got this in Small (there is no X Small option) and it's slightly large. It skims my curves, but is not form fitted. I would love to get a different color in a smaller size (if they ever make one)  Where's the love of purple?  Please make a purple option in size XS and i'll buy again!"
4.0,A little snug but that's ok - motivates me to loose a little weight!
4.0,"Got it for my 6 yo, who has a small built and small face. This goggle is perfect does what its supposed to. Water doesnt enter inside the goggles because of the good suction. If your kids are fussy with suction over their eyes then they may not use it. It took lil time for my ever picky child."
4.0,"Love this purse! It is big but not too big, the burgundy color is beautiful and it doesn't look cheap. I received many compliments from my coworkers today."
4.0,"great ring. good price. very nicely inscribed. only issue is the edges are pretty sharp, they actually scrape your skin if you rub your hand the ring is on on it. my girlfriend kept complaining when i held her hand with that ring on because of that reason."
4.0,"i ordered half a size too big, but i didn't wanna go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a new size, so i just lace them up really tight and they still look beautiful :)"
4.0,"thick thick sweater, great for wintery cold days for my littles!  it fits true to size and the material is very soft and cozy, it also kept my little warm during cold days.  it's not itchy at all underneath and still soft under.  we had so many compliments when my little girl wore this.  i hope these guys make more sweaters for little ones."
4.0,"This jacket felt really good. Nice and light, but warm. Really long sleeves for us tall girls. I felt like I was in between sizes. Medium was just a little too tight across my shoulders but fit my body well. Large was good for a slightly loose fit but I was looking for trim fit to layer under a shell. I'd recommend it, and will think about getting a large in the future. 6' tall, 155 lbs,  usually a size 10."
4.0,Great compression stocking for all day use. Feet and legs feel great
4.0,It's a size smaller.
4.0,Wored as expected
4.0,"I love them, they are very comfortable, it keeps my feet nice and warm"
4.0,Fabric is very thin.  Showed too many imperfections.
4.0,I'm 5'8 and 250.  This doesn't hang long enough for me to cover myself appropriately to wear leggings.  Almost....but not quite.  Quality is great for price and size is true.
4.0,"I'm not a jewelry expert, but I got these rings because I wanted a cheap wedding band to wear in place of my good one. Something that wouldn't turn my finger colors, become discolored itself, or look cheap to the naked eye.<br /><br />While I found these rings to be slightly too big (and this could be due to me misjudging my size), I absolutely love them. They're simple and elegant, look more expensive than they are, and they're really fun to wear.<br /><br />These fit what I was looking for, and I'm really happy with them."
4.0,"I usually buy hanes boxers but they cancelled my last order for some reason and I decided to try rhese.  they are much softer fabric and feel better.  If they last, I'll order more of these."
4.0,perfect for my Elektra costume!
4.0,Nice quality but runs big.  Well made and nicely constructed - just a little too big.  Washes up well and needs little ironing.  I steamed out the wrinkles and it worked perfectly.
4.0,There nice fits well
4.0,"Qued√≥ de tama√±o perfecto, seg√∫n la informaci√≥n dada."
4.0,"Love! üòªDef had to make sure there were no nip slips. The color is everything. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù, 105 lbs, 32C."
4.0,"I like the different style this shirt has.  Having one shoulder exposed is something different in my wardrobe.<br />The material is nice and light.  Perfect for warm summer days or nights.<br />The shirt itself falls a little past my waist, which I like.<br />I did order a size larger than I usually do and I'm glad I did.  The larger size fit perfect.<br />The only thing is that because there are no tag markings on it, it's a little hard to tell which is the front or the back.<br />Only way I could tell is to hold it up and the front neckline hangs a little lower than the back.<br />Other than that, I really like this top.  Nice for just casual wear or you can dress it up a bit to wear out on the town."
4.0,"Very pretty, comfortable when wearing. Almost like I'm not wearing earrings. Not bad for the price. I would buy items from this company again."
4.0,Not the best material as it wrinkles easily but it fits well and it's a great style.
4.0,"It's Ok.  It's lighter weight, so I can wear it in the spring or summer. I use it to cover the spaghetti straps on a dress I wear to work."
4.0,The watch was purchased for my daughter.  She loved it but I just wish it could have been smaller. At least she can grow into it so I am happy.
4.0,The watchface is straight up glitter which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. It looked a touch more subtle online but the band looks and feels better than I excpected so we‚Äôll see how this goes! Came on time
4.0,Just a bit short for me but it fits just on the edge looks beautiful üòç
4.0,As described in terms of water resistance. Works great while golfing but I wish the description had mentioned no side pockets
4.0,"The Z-TON Men's Beach Casual Drawstring is perfect for non-competitive water sports. Featuring a highly functional design, quality materials and intense colors, everyone should  try on Z-TON Men‚Äôs Beach Casual Drawstring.<br /><br />The photos are intended to showcase what makes Z-TON Men's Beach Casual Drawstring unique. In the first photo, notice the bright sport-yellow/green drawstring with double-stitched waistband; and the mesh-lined pockets on both left and right. The second photo shows the backside where you can see the back pocket‚Äôs Velcro closure. The Z-TON Men's Beach Casual Drawstring is simply a practical, stylish and comfortable choice for a day at the beach, poolside, water park or backyard. I like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Z-TON Men's Beach Casual Drawstring to everyone."
4.0,"Fits a bit small. Considered others' recommendations and used the seller's sizing guide. I am usually between size 6 and 8 in bottoms, I went with the size 8 thinking worst case if it's much too big I can wash it and it shrinks a bit. I'd say it fits nicely as it came out of the package so I am going to wash it on cold cycle only to avoid any shrinkage. I don't know about the material, doesn't feel like 100% cotton/linen but it's def light weight.  Feels a bit stiff, hope that goes away with the first wash (if i remember, i'll update the review). Color is a nice light blue"
4.0,Quality you'd expect for price but honestly unless you inspect closely it looks lovely enough for my daughter to wear in our Ireland wedding.
4.0,I write this jacket as a replacement for one that is no longer made. I think it is well worth the purchase price. My only concern is that it doesn't have any inside pockets.
4.0,"These socks are pretty and comfortable. The grip on the bottom was a little slicker than I had expected, but overall they are solid and pretty comfortable after you get used to having the individual toes being surrounded by socks."
4.0,Love these! Comfortable. Luckily for me i read the reviews and saw from Tricia Smith review that it was a special seller that sells the real brand. It was in one of the reviews. And I bought from that seller and sure enough I got the real brand! Thank you Tricia. Here's what she said:<br /><br />New info:üìçI discovered that the seller changes as you click different sizes! The 2X are sold by Sonia & Co. and those are the true Yelete brand. The 3x are sold by CES3 and those are the cheep crappy knock off brand.
4.0,"Looks cute on, but fits a bit large and seems to be losing quality with every wash."
4.0,Belt is nice but too small.  The Medium belt was only 30 inches long not 31 like they said.  Either way it was too small.  I recommend you go one to two sizes up.
4.0,"I LOVE these pants; but they run a bit small. I wear a medium across most products, very few times do I need to go up a size; and these pants look like they have curvier models so I didnt even think.<br />I had to refund them and order a large.... it wouldnt make it up my thighs at all. I'm SUPER excited to get the large cuz girl they are cuuttteeeeee"
4.0,The bottoms run a little big but overall they are great and definitely not a suit you will see anyone else wearing.
4.0,"Cute, good fit, 2 xl true to size"
4.0,Its a gift and haven't given to person yet.
4.0,Very low cut and very heavy material for wearing in the summer.
4.0,"This dress is very beautiful and high quality but for me, it Came up short on the length. I am 5'8 and I was hoping that the dress would reach the floor. It came up short about 3 1/2 inches from the floor, in the front, showing off my big size 10 Feet. It was very Awkward to have my feet show cased up to my ankles at the bottom of the dress."
4.0,"No direction came with these gloves at all ‚Äì just the two gloves in a plastic bag.  That is totally weird.  Luckily, my mom has a pair of heated gloves and I sort of remember how hers worked ‚Äì so maybe it is pretty standard?  I dunno.  Anyway ‚Äì a long press of the button turns them on and then a short press cycles through each temperature setting.  Then a long press turns them off again.  Just remember ‚Äì each glove is independent ‚Äì so you have to press each button on each glove.  Also ‚Äì you have to take the battery pack out of the glove‚Äôs pouch and turn that on each time you use them.  Then you have to take the battery pack out of the pouch and turn them off after your use otherwise it will simply drain your batteries.<br /><br />First on you get a flashing red, press it and you get blue, press again and you get white, press again and you are back to red.  To me, the blue feels like the least heat setting, while the white feels the hottest to me.  Not sure, though as you would think the cycle pattern would match the heat increasing ‚Äì I dunno ‚Äì no instructions.<br /><br />The battery packs are easy enough to figure out and when you turn them ‚Äúon‚Äù the red light will come on ‚Äì and stay on until you turn the battery pack off.  So just turning the gloves on and off will not help your batteries ‚Äì you have to remove from the pouch before and after each and every use.  There are three AA batteries in each glove.  You do feel the weight ‚Äì is it terrible ‚Äì no.  But is it noticeable ‚Äì to me, yes ‚Äì especially if you turn your palms to the side.  My mom‚Äôs gloves are rechargeable ‚Äì no stand-alone batteries.  I guess the good thing about using AA‚Äôs is that you should always have some on hand to use quickly.  Also ‚Äì if needed while out and about in your gloves ‚Äì it is easy to go and buy some too.<br /><br />I could only try these on in my home as the temperature has been getting warmer these days ‚Äì here today it will be an unseasonably 70 degrees outside!  No need for gloves at all ‚Äì especially those that are heated.  Wish I had these a few weeks ago, though.  I guess I will not be able to truly test their effectiveness until it is once again cold out.  The backs of the hands and the backs of the fingers did get warm.  A lot of gloves the fingers do not heat at all ‚Äì so that was really nice.  I didn‚Äôt feel any heat in the palms or the underside of the fingers.  But the entre back of the hand/fingers may be all you need on a cold day.  I am truly looking forward to using them when they are truly needed. : )<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù button.  Thanks! : )"
4.0,Decent material but not much stretch. Kind of small for my neck.
4.0,"The hardest part to finding a good Venetian mask for a masquerade is, well, being a guy. Plenty of feather, bejeweled, sparkly pink masks out there. But something for a man? Not a lot. And the few things there are, are typically incredibly expensive. This is a great  affordable option if you need to go to a Masquerade and you're a guy (yes, they still happen, no, I'm not rich, yes, I'm being serious)."
4.0,Have 2 use 2 bra extensions to make it fit comfortably. And I got my normal 40d
4.0,"These are definitely not made of glass, but some sort of hard plastic. They do not have any bubbles or blurry effect when placed on the artwork, so I can still use them for my magnets. They are also very lightweight, and magnify the image beneath it, which is nice. They will look lovely when I'm finished with my project"
4.0,True to size for natural busty/ small frame women
4.0,To tight and small
4.0,Beautiful shine & makes a suit look even better!
4.0,"I bought these earrings for my 8 year old daughter who just recently got her ears pierced. We were advised by our piercer to stick with titanium earrings for awhile to avoid infection from mixed metals. She LOVED them! My only complaint is the backing is super tight and really hard to get off, but we just switched backs with a different pair of earrings we have and it was much easier. Super cute!"
4.0,The bottom band below the bra was too wide /loose. Color was nice though‚Äî a very pale soft lavender. The padding is perfect too!
4.0,Good socks. Cute too.
4.0,"I got the pocket organizer version, and I find it to be a very helpful organization tool. I can keep my day planner, a few pens and pencils, a small notebook and pad of sticky notes, phone charger, portable battery pack, mints, a flash drive, and several other bits and bobs in it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- The vertical organizer shape keeps things from dropping down to the bottom of a bag or backpack and keeps the space evenly spread.<br />- The zippered pockets are great for all sorts of small things like cords, mints, nail clippers, or anything else.<br />- Very easy to transfer many of your essentials from one bag to another quickly without any digging.<br />- Magnetic closure is secure but easy to access.<br />- Fits easily into smaller bags because of its compact size.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The zippered pockets are very flat against the bag, which can make it difficult to fit some things in them. The material has some stretch, which helps, but it's still a little annoying.<br />- Because of how flat it is, the larger main compartment doesn't fit things that have much depth, or are close to the size of the organizer itself. Larger tablets probably won't fit.<br />- I would like the pen slots to have some elastic or some other method of keeping them more secure.<br />- It is difficult to get things in and out of the pocket sized for business cards. It would help to just make the pocket a little shallower so that the card(s) stick out a little further and you can get a better grip.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with this product, and it seems sturdy enough that I will continue to use it for a long time to come. I hope that if they make a second generation that they make a few small adjustments to make it even better."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, but arrived tarnished and not acceptable to give as a gift looking like that.  I had to polish it :("
4.0,"I love the look and the fabric, but the fit is a bit weird, even if I wear them very low on my hips the pant legs are still above the ankle, wish they were a bit longer"
4.0,"Excellent material and good construction.  However, it is a bit large.  I wear a large, but this is still a bit loose on me."
4.0,Smaller than I had expected. A large is not really a large
4.0,"These glasses really do help with screen fatigue and with trying to wind down at night.<br /><br />They are also super cute, and the lenses are good quality. Recommend."
4.0,Really cute but just a little too blingy.
4.0,"Great sturdy shoes, although I am starting to rethink high tops with small children. It's a lot of loosening to do."
4.0,It‚Äôs cute and looks nice but it isn‚Äôt very warm.
4.0,"Fits well, however the fabric is sheer on the chest, I wanted to be able to wear these without a bra and I more than likely won‚Äôt be able to but they are cute nonetheless. I‚Äôm 5ft 1in, 128 lbs with 34DD chest. I couldn‚Äôt size up to a medium as it would have been too big around the lower portion of my abdomen."
4.0,Wish it had more Ohio state emblems on it but it seems to be functional for what I need it for.
4.0,Washed well. Fabric a little coarse but not overly rough. Don‚Äôt like the faux-wood buttons.  Will change them.
4.0,It's a very simple necklace. I could see this for a teenager
4.0,"I received this sports bag a couple of days ago and have time to try it out and review it. Its made of a very sturdy and heavy duty material. I would recommend this waterproof gym sack for the who do gym, have kids or general use. It fits perfect on your back and great quality of how its made. Don't think you have to many gym bags until you have tried this one!"
4.0,"Make sure you measure your face before buying because these are extremely wide. Other than that, great quality!"
4.0,"Just right, not a heavy thick fabric, just a lightweight jacket."
4.0,Like dress. Did not like the way it ties up so close to the neck.
4.0,"Would give 5, but the fit is tighter than my previous purchase, same size. Like the thickness and stretch/recovery of material, cannot beat the value."
4.0,"Item is good for the price and is large. Sadly, it is not as heavy duty as another brand I once owned. It would have been nice if the white part was stitched to the blue all around and was heavier."
4.0,yay! good hat
4.0,Necklace looks good now‚Ä¶ Just hope it doesn‚Äôt get funky looking after I‚Äôve had it for a while‚Ä¶
4.0,I usually buy 100% cotton Paul Frederick or Nordstrom's Dress shirts which cost a pretty penny. I needed a cheap off-white dress shirt for  an all &#34;white&#34; party and this one did the trick.
4.0,Quality wasn't too bad. Thought it would've been a bit thicker
4.0,"Real cute, fits well. I think they are squat proof i forgot to check because I never planned to wear them outside of the house. The ruching is really flattering on the butt."
4.0,"I absolutely adore this dress!!! I have the blue one which is such a cute color. The reason for only giving it 4 stars is because the second one I ordered was the purple one and I received the wine red one. But it's very comfy and flattering. I'm a bigger girl, and this dress covers my tummy issues while showing off my shape. Go down a size maybe. I'm usually a 3x but I ordered a 2x and it's perfect."
4.0,"The shaft part of the boots is crinckled. The shaft is medium width, so with my thin calves I tug in skinny, straight, bootcut jeans/trousers in. So for me it is wide, yes, and looks better with tugged in trousers than a skirt or whatever.<br /><br />The sizing is on the large side. I am between american 8-8.5 sizes and I ordered 39 (it says 8). Then I compared them with my other 8.5 boots and they are exactly the same length and a bit wider. So sizing down half a size could be a good tip.<br /><br />The best thing about them is their warmth. They are all fur lined and even warmer than my snow boots. If you are looking for super warm casual winter boots, these are for you."
4.0,"Runs a little small. Very light weight,  but nice sewing. Fabric soft and a bit stretchy.  Color is nice.  Not sure about the neckline. You can't fold it back cuz then the seems show,  so it just kind of bunches up behind your neck. Not enough to feel it or anything.  Had two descent sized pockets and my co workers gave me complements and said the elbow patches gave it a retro look. For reference, I'm 5'8&#34; tall and wear size 12 or 14 pants,  and large to xl top. I purchased the XL."
4.0,a little tight but feels great
4.0,So cute that me friend stole it before I even got to wear it yet! ü§£ü§£ü§£
4.0,"Love the material, but it does run a bit small.  I sized up one size and still feel like it should be looser."
4.0,Absolutely worth the purchase. They look great against white with matching shoes.
4.0,Very light fabric for
4.0,"Nice dress, but really wrinkle."
4.0,"I knew these ran a little small from other reviewers, so I purchased a size up and they fit great! I'm 5'11, so they are a little short if I wear them at my natural waist, but if I wear them a little lower they fit just fine.  They are a faded sweat pant type material, and make great low-key house pants."
4.0,"I ordered this a while back and received it earlier this week. It did take a while to get in not being eligible for prime. I was just a little concerned since I was pretty excited to get this one in. I am wishing now that the front view of the shirt had been shown as well, but I may have ordered it anyway. I am not quite sure how to review it. I ordered it a size larger than what I normally wear which is a good thing because it fits pretty spot on with the size that I did order. I do like the quality of the shirt and also the material, a very comfortable feel to it. The color is not quite as what is shown here, less of a deep color. My issue with it is I am not super crazy about the front of the shirt. It is hard to explain and could be just a personal taste kind of thing, but it has some pin tucking like gathering in the front and it just has a more...matronly feel to it. I do totally love the back of the shirt, to the point that I considered altering the front but I cannot quite figure out how making this a bit of a disappointment. Again, this is more of a personal taste deal and I would still say this is a nicely made shirt and great for casual wear. I did receive a discount for this shirt and chose to review since I depend highly on reviews myself."
4.0,"Is was a little tighter than I expected, but it did fit"
4.0,Very comfortable and relaxed.
4.0,"Arrived promptly. Looks nice. Cute accent. Don't last long, but, good for the price. Very different look! I got a lot of looks and a lot of compliments. I would purchase again."
4.0,"I bought this to take pictures of my newborn son. He was 7 lbs 6 oz at birth, and the hat was a little big on him, but it still fit well enough for it to look good and not fall off."
4.0,Same as above.  Help relieve foot pain.
4.0,"the only bad thing was that the label came on the outside of the pieces instead of inside. therefore, when cutting them, there was always a little white label that cannot be removed."
4.0,"These are very lightweight and made well.  They stretch yet go back to original shape.  I don't have to worry about them losing their elasticity.  The length is great and they are very versatile as far as wearing them on your head, face or around your neck.  I will say that they are very breathable but DEFININATELY NOT windproof as stated in the description thus only 4 stars not 5."
4.0,My wife loves it. One down fall is snow sticks to the outside when riding. Otherwise perfect.
4.0,"Pretty bummed I didn't get 1st, lost to some girl dressed as an elf, like okay. Also there's not off switch (that I have found) so whenever you move the sweatshirt it always lights up. Kind of annoying once the office xmas party has passed"
4.0,This charm is cute but I thought it would be bigger than it actually is. I‚Äôm keeping it anyway tho.
4.0,"Based on reviews, I bought this top in XL in the rose red color. I'm a 36J in US sizing (36GG UK). The XL fit great -- held me in place pretty well with minimal side boob, and was surprisingly supportive. It looked really cute! Thinking I'd finally found a cute top to go out in, I ordered the top in black in XL. It didn't even fit over my shoulders. I ordered it in an XXL -- still barely fits, SO MUCH side boob. So, it seems like sizing really varies depending on color. I'd recommend trying a couple sizes and returning whatever doesn't fit! Regardless the top is cute, definitely holds up, even machine washes totally fine."
4.0,Good quality and fabric. The trim was a little uncomfortable because it rubbed your arms. Other than that it was a decent work out shirt.
4.0,"Crisp, lovely print on soft, quality fabric but it runs roomy and would look better a size smaller."
4.0,"I wear ties occasionally for work when visiting clients, so I like to rotate out my ties every once in a while.  The quality isn't as nice as the $50 ones you'll find at a large department store - but then again, you're not paying that much for these either. They look just as nice as the more expensive ones - you can really only tell the quality when you put the tie on.  It's a lower quality silk.  Still worth buying - the purple tie is now one of my favorites."
4.0,"Okay, I got this for a cosplay of my DnD character. I love the outfit, but keep in mind, I'm part of the IBTC. I'm only a 34A, so I have little to nothing to show. But it does great! Comes down to a comfortable length. Coverage is a little funky for me (the left side shows a little more skin than the right) but that is because my chest is practically non-existent.<br /><br />If you are like me and have a smaller chest, it does work! It doesn't help give an illusion that I'm bigger than I am, and I'm going to have to invest in some sticky pads, but it's super cute and will work great for what I'm planning on!"
4.0,"The estimated arrival date for this hat was the 29th. Instead, I received it one day after I ordered it, gotta love that! This hat will be a gift for Christmas so I'm not actually sure about the fit. The only reason for the 4 stars is because the bear located on the back of the hat is not what is pictured. It is a much more detailed bear that is frontward facing. Slightly disappointed. :["
4.0,Product was exactly what I ordered
4.0,"I didn't really know what to expect for the size if it would be too small or too large in size. WELL, if you wear a size larger than an x-large get the next 2 sizes up. Otherwise, the material is nice I would wear a slip under it, a nice summer skirt."
4.0,"Good fit but a little tight around the ankles, probably after a few washings & wear they'll loosen up. Otherwise great socks; well made & comfortable."
4.0,They are socks. They are very tight around the top. Enough so that I have to take them off after about 6 hours.
4.0,"As i shared in my  earlier review of the white version of this bra, I really enjoy the solid construction and the flattering effect on your figure if you are full-busted.  I like the cup shape, mild push up, and insurance that 6 rows provides (when strapless).  I like the look with straps or without, though some might have a different POV for wide-band.  It is snug in band and the material is firm without the stretch you might see in a Victoria Secret Very Sexy bra for example.  As a result, you gain the side smoothing but over time that could make wearing it uncomfortable.  Like most decent strapless that have to hug your chest -- there is some band imprinting to your skin --which I see as normal for the breed.  Beyond 8-10 hours of wear, I feel the band pressure and tend to shed this delightfully sexy bra."
4.0,have to send them back
4.0,"This is a very nice cap, especially considering the price. I saw it retailing for much more elsewhere. It is stylish and well-constructed. I like the dark brown color, which you don't see often in this kind of cap. The XL fits my 7 5/8 head perfectly."
4.0,Nice little girl earrings
4.0,"My boyfriend loves the cufflinks and tie clip, but they look cheap to me. I was disappointed but he's thrilled, so I guess that's a plus lol"
4.0,"This is a very pretty necklace. I've received many compliments on it! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I cannot remove the pendant to put it on a different chain. The chain is adjustable, so that helps. If I could remove it, it wouldn't fit on another chain because the ring at the top of the pendant is quite small.  I really like it anyway!"
4.0,"The sweatshirt came just as expected.  Side panels for ""stretch"" and classic ""V"" at the neckline.  It looks great.  Just like ""original"" sweatshirts of yesteryear."
4.0,It is smaller than I initially thought.
4.0,"These shoes are not ‚Äústraight‚Äù.  I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a bad thing, or not.  One would think that it‚Äôs not necessarily a good thing though.  They curve slightly inward.  I‚Äôm going to attempt to post a picture.<br /><br />These are very lightweight.  I have the Anthracite (100)/Capri, which are very bright and colorful.  It‚Äôs cool how the shoestrings go through the straps on the sides.  There is some arch support.  There is not a lot of tread on the bottom, but kids don‚Äôt wear shoes that long either.  The soles are a little slick, but not too bad.  These shoes are Made in China."
4.0,Very good quality...shipping was quick.
4.0,They are very good product. Unfortunately i had to return them because they're too large for a toddler hi top converse shoe
4.0,Great fit... true to size
4.0,"Ordered a Small (I'm 5'2"" and 130 lbs). It's a great, flowy, light-weight dress with pockets! The length is perfect and falls just past my ankles. My only complaint is that it's a little loose."
4.0,"Look nice, but clatters quite loudly. Worth the price though."
4.0,"Wanted to buy it large so I could wear it over a heavy coat or sweater instead of a poncho. Only 4 stars, because Ive only worn it a couple of times. Seems to look good and even make a somewhat stylish lighr spring coat when it's not raining. Also, it packs up very small which is important to me."
4.0,The splits are high.
4.0,"Very soft, wrinkle-free fabric. Perfect to throw on anytime."
4.0,"I ordered a 3x and normally wear a l/xl. It fit slightly loose but otherwise perfect to be a work appropriate dress. I also wore black leggings underneath, and got many comments from people about it being cute!"
4.0,Fit good and great for my swim classes. Wish it has a little more support in the stomach area.
4.0,These are such a great alternative for my 5yr old daughter who does not have her ears pierced. The magnets are very strong and the earrings stay on pretty well for extended periods of time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the rhinestones tend to fall out easily.
4.0,"I'm a 34DD and didn't read the product review, clearly. I wouldn't recommend it for someone my size as it is a little tighter than average medium, it's more a junior fit, but it's not so tight that I can't wear it. In fact it still looks amazing and I love it.<br />I also didn't anticipate it to be a swimsuit top, because that's the material and the back hook, but you can divine that info by actually reading the description.<br /><br />Overall I was surprised, but it's well made and looks fantastic."
4.0,Ordered the small and it‚Äôs perfect! it‚Äôs lined inside which is great. perfect babydoll. didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars because it‚Äôs not black. it‚Äôs more of a charcoal color but still cute!
4.0,"I actually loved the dress, but the arms were too tight (i'm a 2x)  Otherwise it's a perfect loose fit. Sad I have to return it"
4.0,"Super cute necklace, I like that it‚Äôs mixed metals & a moonstone. I chose to wear a different chain... The one that it came with is thin & cheap looking (but for the price, why not). I do get many compliments every time I wear it."
4.0,"So far I am really liking this little blender! It is so easy to use and clean, takes up very little space on my countertop, and charging is simple. I use it mostly for blending protein shakes and smoothies and the only downside is it doesn't seem to do well blending frozen fruit or chopped dates. Maybe there is a certain way of doing it to ensure it blends well but I am not sure."
4.0,It's nice! But a little different that shown on the model
4.0,"The socks are a little big for my 11 month old but the band is tight enough that they won't fall off. They are not too thick so they're perfect for summer. They had a kind of chemically-smell when I took them out of the package but that should go away after the first wash (will update after).<br /><br />I was looking for a light-weight, non-skid sock that my son could wear during the summer on our hardwood floors and this product filled that need exactly. I was a little wary of ordering since all the 4 star reviews were sponsored but I am happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Thought it probably doesn't mean anything, there is awkward English on the packaging (see photo)."
4.0,"Requires batteries placed in a pack... that has a pouch in the middle to lower chest area. All wiring is covered by fabric. It's not super comfy because the front part/image that reacts to sound is Velcro on...but it's not that bad. It's too distracting to wear out in public or to school, in general....but entertaining still."
4.0,It somehow fits.
4.0,Love this. Fit nicely. Colors are better in person. The only thing I didn't like about it is that the material is more tshirt than sweater/cardigan.
4.0,"This watch is great for the price! it is exactly what I have been looking for, narrow band, silver metal, and short band with 2 bands to keep the dangly bit in place so there isn't much dangling over getting caught on things. I have a very tiny wrists so finding a good fitting watch is very tricky, and believe me I tried hard with price range as high as $150. The watch was ticking when it arrived so I am not sure how long it will last but I wear it for the look so that won't bother me. The band is good so far, been a few weeks and no wear and tear yet but I can see it won't last forever since any leather will take damage being worn at the same point for lengths of ti me, so I am doing my best to be gentle with it. But if it breaks, the price is worthy to just order a new one. Super satisfied!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted the black band and this one appears to be coming from China so it will take awhile. The brown one came from KS in the US so it got to me in 2 days. So caution if you want it asap that it will be a gamble of how long it might arrive."
4.0,I love my tshirt
4.0,My Bucky fanatic loves it. True to size.
4.0,Nice swimsuit. It fits me perfect except for my breast that were not really fitting but manageable
4.0,nice looking and work fine
4.0,"This product has a clear stamp on the ring, not on the pendant itself. It's a good size, not too small and not big and not too bling."
4.0,I got a large...usually I wear a small in pants. They are very cute knock offs but order much larger than you would normally wear!
4.0,Nice but had a real strong rubber smell.  Hope it goes away in time...
4.0,Just average but comfy.
4.0,The only complaint I have is the pockets aren't deep enough they keep wanting to turn inside out lol
4.0,"This is a nice cloak.  As others have said, the material could be a but nicer but overall I was very pleased.  I am a size 10 and the medium was perfect. I clipped up one side with a cardigan clip so more of my costume would show.  It was warm enough in the morning when it was 50-ish degrees but not heavy, so I was still comfortable when temps reached 70+ - so, perfect for a fall day at the ren faire.  I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,Love the look of the bracelet watch but the battery wore out after one time wearing it.  Can't beat the price.
4.0,great fit! button was broken when i got it. very disappointed as this was a part of my birthday outfit.
4.0,"Love the colors,so vibrant on the black"
4.0,Bought the light gray ones for teenager. He likes them. Good fit. Loose and lightweight enough for summer.
4.0,Warm and cute.
4.0,Love this dress.  It is perfect for work and going out for date night.  Fits well and is very comfortable.
4.0,Cute tunic...overall satisfied...a bit snug in bust.
4.0,Love these bras...please do not put in the washer the lace will br damaged..hand wash is better
4.0,"I'm 5' 6&quot;, between 120 and 130 pounds (fluctuation), and I ordered a Large and it fits pretty well. I found the skirt to be a bit short, but not so short that it looks bad. The material is thin and breathes well, it's very obviously a summer dress. It is lined part of the way down the skirt. The lining hits slightly higher than the middle of my thigh"
4.0,These bras are so comfortable.
4.0,"Cute & stretchy, just a little short for me. I'm 5'11&#34;"
4.0,"Love the shirt but not a fan of the dry fit, silky material. Much rather have had cotton."
4.0,"The skirt fits well. It's kind of thick, but I'm okay with that. the zipper can be a little difficult. I zip in front the turn it around while on my waist. I'll definitely be looking for more designs in the same skirt later on."
4.0,"Shipping was great, product arrived in less than 2 days. I own a tan pair 36x32 so, I ordered the same size in the camo...they Are tighter and I figured they were the same tapper but, they are not."
4.0,they are nice for young girls not crazy about the packaging if they are to be a gift
4.0,Very nice earrings. I would recommend theses to people who just want earring to wear while working or working out. Earrings you could lose and wouldn't cry over.
4.0,"This is a pair of good laces! I bought two different brands to replace my Thursday Captain lace (which was the older, flat version). This smoother and rounder pair of laces came loose more easily -- hence, I am forced to double-knot them -- compared to the second brand.<br /><br />The other pair (Benchmark brand) laces are thinner and waxy-er than this, and the 'wax' help to grip a single knot easily. The two brands have different looks and feels (Benchmark is thinner/waxy-er, and this Kevlar is rounder and smoother/not waxed). So depending on how you like your laces -- you can't go wrong with either one.<br /><br />Yes, they works great as replacement lace for the Thursday boots."
4.0,My 18 month old just started wearing size 6. These are a bit larger than that. Great quality.
4.0,"This bag is not as peach as it looks in the photo, which as it turns out, suits me just fine.  The color is a peachy-pink like a ballet pink, and almost looks like a nude color in certain light.  I used this last night when I was going to a bbq with the kids.  My phone, iPad, lipstick and sunglasses were in this bag in the larger canvas bag with the extra stuff I needed to tote along with the kids.  As others have noted it is unstructured and unlined, so I don't think I'll be using it as a purse on its own except in the most casual of occasions, but it is a nice way to keep my stuff organized inside a larger bag and is polished enough to pull out and carry alone if I need to."
4.0,This scarf is very cute & seems to made of good quality. It arrived on time and was packaged as expected. This scarf is perfect for accessorizing a cute fall outfit and/or football season. Even better for the Texas Longhorn fans ;) Some may see it as a downfall but I like the fact that there are no logos printed on the scarf. This makes it a lot more versatile and can wear it in different settings. I'm a nursing mom and I was able to even cover myself for privacy while feeding my daughter with this scarf. I'm very pleased with this scarf and it is the perfect accessory to my closet!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. The above is 100% my honest opinion. I hope I've helped!
4.0,Like this apron just one thing is wrong.  The strings to tie it in the back with seeing as though I‚Äôm on the fluffy side.  Love that it is water resistant. Hate washing dishes and you get the whole front of you all wet.  Definitely serves it purpose
4.0,"Fits well but you definitely have to choose one size up, normally wears medium bought large. Material feels ok but a little thin which is expected given the price point."
4.0,"A very handsome watch. A bit big for my18 cm wrist, but I'll still wear it very happily. Build quality and finish excellent for the price."
4.0,new mommie is a big panda fan and just loved the hat and scarf.
4.0,"The only thing that I dislike about these pants are that the belt loops came apart right when I was pulling them up but that is an easy fix. Other than that, I love these pants! They have 2 deep pockets and a regular pocket on the right side. Amazing for your phone or anything. üñ§"
4.0,Purchase three size small shirts for teen girls ranging in size from 0 to 3.  They all fit nicely and they are holding up nicely after three washes.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8b696b6e01950c39ab9191689a76185b]] These do run a size smaller, so had to exchange for a bigger size. Other than that, these were really cozy and kept my feet and ankles warm. Walking in then was really comfortable. I have wide feet, so it had ample space for my feet. I love the fur on the outside, it looks very wintery"
4.0,I LIKE THE COLOR ! THEY ARE LIKE A BASIC SUNGLASSES
4.0,"Love the colors and quality. Although, the adjustable band could be a bit longer. Otherwise, they're as expected."
4.0,"Delicate hearts - small but perfect.  I didn't like the chain so put them on a finer silver chain but have been wearing these since I got them.  For me (mom in my 40s), they're a great representation of my 3 sons... each different, but a complete set :)  If you're looking for either a small delicate necklace or a pretty necklace for someone younger, this is a good choice."
4.0,"i thought it was gonna be a jersey but it ended up being a shirt, i still love it though. it‚Äôs good quality and was worth my 25 dollars!"
4.0,"The mask is great, but you cannot use it while walking"
4.0,"nice quality, fits well.<br />Just be aware its quite lightweight material so better for summer than winter use"
4.0,"This is a fine enough purse / tote bag, but the product listing is kinda misleading describing it as a backpack or laptop packpack.<br /><br />There are no backpack straps, first of all. There are handles and a single strap (ala a purse or messenger bag). The bag is of decent size but would not do well holding most laptops ~ you could probably fit about half of it in and the other half would poke out the top. It'd be weird.<br /><br />The material is okay. It has the look and feel of a plastic tarp; maybe slightly less tarpy than a tarp, but still not a soft look/feel."
4.0,But so cute ! We keep it for later
4.0,"I am liking the feel of these nylons. They are durable. I work retail. We do a lot of lifting, ending, twisting. And I'm not having to have a new pair every day, which is great.  The feel is soft and siky. I don't have to add power or lotion first which is nice. Sometimes a static cling,but a spray of hair spray or a dryer sheet will help that. These are a very good quality. They sheer like nylons, not opaque.I received these nylons at a reuced price or free in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"Normally when I wear a mask while wearing glasses my glasses steam up. When I used the anti-spray on my glasses before going grocery shopping it was easy to use, it left no streaks, and I was able to do my shopping without my glasses fogging up. That was just what I was looking for. Thank you to the makers of Anti-Fog spray."
4.0,Looks good with baggy shirts/dresses. It's stretchy to fit on most body types.
4.0,This is so cute I was saving it for Easter and I got so many complements its costum jelwery but its so cute...
4.0,"A little rubbery, but it looks super cute. It's cheap construction but definitely waterproof and fashionable."
4.0,"A little see through when you bend over. Otherwise, great workout pants!"
4.0,Even more beautiful in person. Its not heavy. Came quick and neatly packaged.
4.0,This really should be larger to fit into an infinity scarf category but it should do the trick for travel
4.0,It looks good I hope it last my trip. then I will update it
4.0,"Beautiful dress, fit excellent length was great, still hit the floor with 3 inch heels (I'm  5'6).  Only problem was the lace snags everything.  My shoes had glitter stones and it kept snagging on my shoes."
4.0,Runs very small son wears xl had to order 6x to fit
4.0,"Great price and good quality. Bought for my 10 year old son and cut them down to size for him. Four stars because he only wore the first one about 4-6 times when the inside tag came off (the one used to tuck in the small end of the tie), so I'll have to fix that by hand before he wears it again."
4.0,I bought this and received it. It was too big but I love the design! I didn't expect it to fit from the beginning because I have tiny wrists. I ended up shortening it myself and its amazing! The 20mm fits with a galaxy active 2. The quality is what you would expect for an inexpensive watch band but I think it will hold up for quite a while. It's very comfortable and cute!
4.0,"I love these earrings and wear them all the time. They look much more expensive than they are. Compliments are almost a guarantee. I'm a little disappointed in the color - I bought them to match a rose gold watch band, and these are definitely more yellow than my band, so I'm still on the hunt for a good match. I'm keeping them though, as they pair well with everything else!"
4.0,"Much more effective if you put it on the inside of your wrist. App could be smoother, but overall pretty good put of the box so fat"
4.0,I got a lot of compliments on this shirt. The material doesn't breathe well but it's comfortable.
4.0,"I‚Äôve been buying Jolyn for a very long time and have enjoyed all of their swimsuits. The fabric of this one seems a little odd? It feels almost cheap, but I have heard that Jolyn has changed it to be made out of recyclable materials. So that may impact the fabrics texture. Also beware of the description saying they‚Äôre full coverage, I personally find them to be more cheekier than I expected (I did buy my correct size too). Overall I like these high waisted bottoms and are excited to wear them to the beach this summer!"
4.0,I like the silkiness of the scarf and bonnet however it tends to slide off throughout the night.
4.0,"Liked, retired for larger ring"
4.0,excellent but due to some reason i want to return back not due to quality
4.0,"And he loves it, which is the only important thing! It's a cute hat, it seems to be nicely made with good materials."
4.0,"Better than I expected, beautiful."
4.0,"I really like this swimsuit, however, like others have mentioned, it is short in the torso. I'm 5'8&#34; and it could use about 2 more inches in the torso length. However it's not so bad that I won't wear it!"
4.0,really beautiful and great price!!
4.0,a little too expensive for its qualty.
4.0,Its a beautiful necklace but sadly came with one of the jump rings broken. I am still giving it 4 starts because it is so cheap for the dazzling effect it gives. Obviously quality is not going to be amazing at this price point but I am still satisfied with how gorgeous it looked with my costume.
4.0,The bracelet needs to be bigger and the necklace needs to be a little longer
4.0,"I like my clothes a little big, I don't like tight shirts.  works great for me.!"
4.0,against Covid 19 .
4.0,"The light blue is definitely more of a mint color to me but it is incredibly soft. Hopefully they will hold up okay, happy so far."
4.0,"Got this for my 1 year old son, he is 28 inches long and it is pretty big on him. Needed it for part of a Halloween costume so it's not important that it fits perfect. Other than that it is very cute and will get the job done."
4.0,"The dress is very cute and my 8-year-old daughter loved how ‚Äútwirly‚Äù it is. Our one complaint is the sleeves - when buttoned, they were way too tight. The rest of the dress fit as expected."
4.0,The band itself is cute and seems durable.<br />My biggest issue however is that the watch clasps are too big. This was supposed to be for a 38/40mm watch but it clearly isn‚Äôt.
4.0,"This dress would have gotten a 5 star review except the first time I tried it on one of the little cuff buttons came off. It‚Äôs an easy fix so I‚Äôm not too worried, the dress is nice quality other than that. It‚Äôs the perfect length, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, I can still wear heels with it but it doesn‚Äôt drag. I normally wear a 14/16 in jeans and 1X in leggings or other pants and I ordered a 1X for this dress!"
4.0,"I liked this shirt a lot, the color was nice and its of good quality. Runs very small though. The sleeves are particularly tight. Order at least 1 size up."
4.0,VERY CUTE!
4.0,"These are really cute and seem to fit well. I bought the ivory which is a really nice antiqued look. I kept one star as the ruffles are not as full as pictured. Functionally, less full ruffles aren't a deal but aesthetically, it night be a deal for someone."
4.0,"Very nice looking watch. Very cheap, but it is still running months later unlike other watches that are this cheap.<br /><br />Two bad things:<br />The ticking is noticeable.<br />I needed to get it fitted.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great watch!"
4.0,It's cute but I have been unable to open up this bracelet since I bought it. Not sure what am doing wrong.<br />Someone please advise
4.0,Works pretty well! Used for my glasses with my mask while at work and has made a difference. I even used it on my ski goggles!
4.0,"extremely cute, but not for my body type."
4.0,"Nice item, but lether feels a little cheaper.."
4.0,"I received my suit today. I ordered the Aqua Green. The color is much nicer than the color in the picture (although that might be an issue with my computer).<br />I'm 5""2' and 160 pounds; I ordered a large. Unfortunately the pants were snug in the upper thighs I would really need an XL in these pants (the length was perfect though). The jacket and shirt fit perfectly.  Now I don't know what to do. If I return the suit and get the XL the top and jacket will be too big.<br />Hope this helps you."
4.0,"I wanted this watch because I have to have something that can take a bang or two because I'm hard on watches, so I don't wear them often except for special occasions. This watch seems very durable so far and look great on the wrist. setting all the functions using the buttons takes a little trial and error but overall, a sturdy functional watch."
4.0,"This is the second one I am getting. I like the design, the looks and the comfort for my daughter. It works for me."
4.0,The thick wool hat was a hit - the pull over neck thing was a flop.  I loved the ultra soft neck thing but for style and snug warmth it just doesn't beat the scarf.
4.0,Bottoms look like thong.  Top is gorgeous!!!!!!!!
4.0,Beautiful charm. Love it! But the chain broke pretty easily.
4.0,Extremely  cute
4.0,"Cute skirt, the fit was as expected.  I ordered the white which is a little off white.  It is also see thru so you will need slip of some sort.  That is the reason for 4 stars. However, I liked the style and fit enough to order an additional skirt in a different color.  I would recommend, just know that about the white skirt."
4.0,This dress is smaller than the size you order so if you want XL as an example order XXL. Very cutr dress.
4.0,"The fabric is stiffer than expected. Absolutely no stretch and is not very soft. Still, I love the design!"
4.0,"It's a nice necklace. I would have given it 5 stars, but it's a tad on the thin side.  Any thinner, and I'd have returned it."
4.0,Good fit for me. If you like your sweaters loose go up a  size.
4.0,Fits as expected and very comfortable however it is not quite the colour appearing in the picture.  It is definitely more of a teal blue
4.0,Pjs were exactly as advertised. Fit true to size. Nice Wurlitzer material.
4.0,"Well made, and comfortable"
4.0,"The dress (almost) looks as pictured...I love it overall! The only down side is the slit is much higher than I anticipated, just like some reviews stated. I def have to be careful if it's too windy or the way I walk but it definitely won't stop me from wearing it! I am normally a Large and it seems like the dress is very flowy, so I ordered a Medium and I think I could've gotten away with a small."
4.0,Inexpensive mouse ears solution.
4.0,"Just as photos show. Tights are very nicely made, color is great and fits very well. Only complaint is they're very thick and feel a little warm while wearing. Good for warmth or working out inside, but wouldn't recommend for outside exercise."
4.0,Good quality. They fit as expected.
4.0,These were very cute in-person. They are very flattering to your shape and comfortable. Can dress up or down.
4.0,"This eyeball ring is the coolest ring ever. It's so unique; I've never seen anything like it. I'm going to wear it a lot around Halloween time.<br /><br />It's made of durable stainless steel and its pretty heavy. I love the teeth. The eyeball looks very realistic, but mine was a little off-centered. I wish that these came in smaller sizes, but otherwise I love it.<br /><br />I received a discount during a promotional period in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Overall, pretty happy with this item. The top silver and the chakras are a little off center but at this price..."
4.0,"Great design, quality stitching.  Two main points you should know:<br />1) The fabric is stretchy, but quite thin.  Therefore, these will be perfect for warm weather exercise (not too hot).  The fabric is too thin to create any significant ""compression"".  The fabric is not thick enough to squeeze as much as the more expensive ""compression shorts"".  However, the shorts are tight enough to ""keep your junk in the glove-box"", in my opinion.<br />2) Be careful about the size.  They seem about 1 size smaller than typical American sizes.  In my case, I am 6' and 175 lbs.  I have a 33 inch waist.  I ordered the LARGE size, and they are quite snug.  I wouldn't want them any smaller."
4.0,Nice compression socks for a good price.
4.0,"The stitching is off,. When I got it, the stitching had a couple of loops and now have been pulled by pups. Fix the stitching and this is PERFECTüòç"
4.0,I had and wear the watch less than thirty days<br /><br />Too soon to tell and give  a proper
4.0,Very cute and unique. The arrow came off but I was able to easily reattach it.
4.0,"I purchased this bag (elsewhere).  It to has a *huge* capacity for its size- much more than any other carry-on of this size that I have seen.  My last trip, I easily packed 2 pairs of pants, 6 or 7 tops, 2 cardigan sweaters, 2 pashminas, 1 skirt, underwear, 2 pairs of shoes, a bathing suit and a coverup, toiletries, 1 hair dryer, 1 curling iron, and 1 other large hair appliance.  It zipped easily, and I could have put in more.  Even with all of this in it, the bag was still light and convenient to lift, and a dream to maneuver.  And on top of all that, it's cute, too!  My last long trip was 3.5 weeks and I took a different, larger bag that I needed to check.  After shlepping that bag around for 3.5 weeks, worrying about how to store it and how to carry it on public transportation, I vowed that in future I'd travel *only* with a carry-on, no matter the length of the trip.  This is it.  (My reasoning is that as long as you've got enough for 1 week, you can always do laundry.)  My only complaint is that the deep pocket on the back is basically useless.  Instead, I wish that Lipault would add a shallow pocket for a boarding pass, and an elasticized pocket on the side for a water bottle.  Then it would be perfect.  In the meantime, this is still the best carryon I've found."
4.0,It's not the best material but that was expected. It was very cute.
4.0,"as described, nice appearance"
4.0,Husband loves them they fit great
4.0,The gloves were the perfect size for my 10yr old.  The go half way up to the elbow and have some stretch.  They are well made.
4.0,I wear a medium but this would have been better in a large.  It is very pretty and I am planning on wearing it as a beach cover up so I am keeping it.
4.0,"Very easy to open, locks in solid. Best buy for your money."
4.0,"Absolutely loved these earrings! I expected them to be smaller, but they look great and the quality is very good as well!"
4.0,Great bday gift for a friend but like alot of other reviews the ears are floppy which is to be expected
4.0,"Super cute boots, and very affordable. Got them for my halloween costume."
4.0,"This dress fit true to size and is very flattering. It‚Äôs also quite comfortable. The only reason I took away a star is that it‚Äôs much brighter than pictured and described. It is called wine red but is actually a bright red color. Still pretty, just not what I was hoping for."
4.0,"Great fit, not too thick/thin - great value for the price"
4.0,My bra size 36DD. XL too big.
4.0,not bad for a price
4.0,Una correa sencilla pero muy bonita
4.0,These are so cute!! But dont let thst fool u they gave me blisters on my heels from the zipper. Yes the zipper is on the heel and is not concealed frim THE SKIN!! But with all that said the next time i wore them i sprayed liquid bandaid on my heels and had no isues! Tbe wedge is easy to walk on and the shoes are super sexy!
4.0,A very impressive piece!<br />Lovely
4.0,"I like this skirt! Nice quality, the colors are a little duller than they appear but I like it because it is thick enough to wear in Fall/Early Winter. It fits true to size.  I love the front pockets!"
4.0,"runs full size but is a bit too long, warm for chilly mornings"
4.0,"but we also have another child that can wear it next year, quality is nice, have always preferred Danskin wear."
4.0,"I brought these to replace the watch band tail cover for a smart watch I have (Fossil Q). It originally came with a leather loop but working out in it destroyed it. I like these as a replacement a lot, the only drawback I have is the side width. I would have really enjoyed these a little narrower."
4.0,"Great for Bob's shoes, but sometimes I feel like they are tight and will eventually make my toes hurt."
4.0,Dress is adorable but runs extremely small.  I recommend you order 1 dress size larger than what you normally wear
4.0,This is a cute necklace and I can't wait to give it to my granddaughter.
4.0,I use them and they do the job.
4.0,"Love this dress. Fits as expected. Material is good, no complaints."
4.0,"Having just had achilles tendon surgery I was looking for a comfortable slipper that didn't feel like it was ""flat"" when I wore it. The memory foam in these is very nice and gives you a cushioned feeling.<br /><br />My only problem with these slippers is about 1 1/2 months after buying them, the plastic sole on one of them split open right across the side.  So now all the inner parts are falling out of one of my slippers.<br /><br />I am going to try another pair of these because I found them the most comfortable of all the slippers I've tried, and hope that my experience with the cracking plastic sole was only an isolated problem."
4.0,Very pretty. Good for the price. Lovely color
4.0,Cute and well worth the price
4.0,"This top is a must have staple in your wardrobe. It‚Äôs super cute, very comfortable, goes with anything and hangs long enough to wear with leggings. It‚Äôs a flowy top which hides all the problem areas just perfectly. Super affordable and you definitely should add this basic top to your closet."
4.0,"Bought for my daughter for working out. She likes them, and she said they are fairly well made and should last her a long time."
4.0,"This beanie is exactly as pictured, I just didn‚Äôt expect it to be as large as it is. To be fair it is shown as a slouchy fit so I shouldn‚Äôt judge too hard. The stitching on the little patch and embroidery are great, no fraying and the material itself is pretty soft and cozy."
4.0,this is nice small bag and got at a good price. i thought that would be bigger so my gosh. i really like it.
4.0,These are great glasses as cheaters.  I have them them in all the rooms of my home.  I will reorder this item again.
4.0,"It is a little too big for man, nice for my wife, good construction and material"
4.0,These boots are beautiful but they were very narrow and small around the leg.
4.0,Fix right spott o
4.0,"I was looking for something a little fancier that I could wear for a night out on the town and this dress has all the glitz and glam I desired.<br /><br />The sequins on this dress are GORGEOUS. The photos really don't do it justice. It is so shiny! Of course with any sequined dress, it can be a bit scratchy, but that just comes with the territory and takes a bit of getting used to.<br /><br />I would say that it seemed to run slightly smaller than I expected, and the material does not have much stretch to it so be sure to order a size up if you want to be sure to have a good fit. I liked that it was well made, I looked over the dress and all the stitching is nice and tight and none of the sequins fell off when I wore it.<br /><br />I got a lot of compliments when I wore this out, it's definitely a show stopper. I paired it with some black pumps and wore it to the casino with some friends and it was the perfect choice for me. I received one to review and am very happy with it. I do wish the fabric either had a bit more stretch to it or ran more true to size, but other than that it's a great dress!"
4.0,I will order more for the summer.
4.0,"I think this is a beautiful dress. I loved the color, the fit and the fabric is a nice quality but I just didn‚Äôt feel it was flattering on me. The flutter sleeves made me look wide in the shoulders and the neckline was higher than expected."
4.0,Very comfortable and a nice color
4.0,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for his birthday which was in late September and he loved it, but now we are halfway through October and the writing along the outside has completely worn out. He works indoors at a computer all day so I'm not really sure why it wore out so quickly. Either way though he still loves it and the rest of watch is great quality."
4.0,Was able to use on certain diameter  heel and able to walk in grass awesome product
4.0,"Lovely skirt! Runs about one to one and a half sizes too small, so be sure to order up. I am 5'9,  around 155lbs., and usually wear a medium or large (depending on the item etc.) and needed an X-Large. The skirt is definetely long enough and comes just over my knees. The bright blue print with the birds is beautiful. It is well made and the material is not cheap looking at all. The waist band is elastic and stretches in the back. The waist comes up high and was just tight enough but if I gained 2 lbs. or more I would not be able to wear it, so larger waisted sisters out there may have a hard time. Nothing a good waist cincher couldn't fix. ; )<br />Kind of makes your waist look small and your hips big. Nice vintage looking skirt.<br />I would recomend this item."
4.0,"I wear a 10.5. GL with that, right?  I need rounded toe box...but my heel slips, and partly from the shallowness of the sneaker, and partly my narrow heel. The lining is thin. I guess I expected better for the price. Size up."
4.0,All of them are in different sizes and it‚Äôs cotton and made in China üá®üá≥
4.0,It is very soft and beautiful. However you need to choose a size two times larger than you normally wear otherwise you'll feel like you're trying to get into a sausage casing
4.0,"This dress was really pretty and comfortable, and fit as expected."
4.0,It is sturdy vibrant and looks good in person
4.0,Beautiful but small size. Buy size larger. Very beautiful skirt.
4.0,"Slightly smaller than expected, but it will work. Have not had a chance to wear it yet; just try it on."
4.0,"My son wanted to have someone engrave a watch like the one in the show, but I found this instead. He's not using it as an everyday watch, so that's not a factor. I admit the sound isn't so good, but just from the joy it gave my son, this was a great purchase."
4.0,Can one ever have too many black leggings? These fit as expected and have a mid/high rise waist fit. I like the slight detail at the bottom and the waist stays put unless I get into some vigorous activity (rare!). haha. I have these in my regular rotation.
4.0,"To start off, in comparison at the price range these things are an awesome pair of pants. My one con with them, they tend to be tight and bunch up in the crouch area. But am I glad I had them, 250 miles into a 600 mile ride I T boned a truck breaking my ankle knee cap and compound break to the femur... these pants held up insanely, the only tear anywhere on them is were my femur ripped through. I had absolutely no debris in my wound and that's why these are getting a good rating. Nobody wants to get scrubbed! Highly recomend."
4.0,I purchased this for a work Christmas event. I wanted to add a little Christmas spirit but didn‚Äôt want to wear some big ass red ball or something crazier on me. It does the job.
4.0,This shirt fits well and is very comfortable.
4.0,I have no chest. I'm literally flat as a board but my chest is busting out of this.
4.0,This dress is BEAUTIFUL!  Quality was great but it was too tight. I purchased the size recommended but sadly had to return it and they did not have the size I needed to reorder.
4.0,"I got these for my wife, who loves dangly earrings. I figured here, now you have a TON of options! Like other reviewers said, there were SO many, that she might keep a few to give as gifts. And still have a lot left over. The listing says 3 pairs, but we got all of them. So many that the little box was literally bursting with them!<br />The quality is all great, and they seem durable. At least as durable as this type of jewelry gets anyway.<br />Our baby is interested and tries to grab them. So, baby-approved too!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />Some of these have a horseshoe shape ear piece (shaped liked the omega Œ© symbol) which my wife says it a pain in the butt to get on her hear, and then re-connect to the earring. So -1 star for this since a majority are shaped like that."
4.0,"Nice plaid...could be a little larger, but nice..."
4.0,"I really like the glasses.  I used to fly a F-14 Tomcat in the Navy.  I was in the middle of a long cruise in the Indian Ocean when my lead pilot and I had a close call with some Russian MIGs.  I pulled off some fancy moves and got the upper hand but my lead pilot did not and got shook up.  He barely landed on the aircraft carrier and summarily turned in his wings.  It was sad because he was scheduled to go to the TOP GUN course, his spot became mine.  My commanding officer wanted me to fly rubber dog poo out of Hong Kong but sent me to the school, he had a deep love for me, the kind that only sweaty men stuck on a ship could have.<br /><br />I went to the school, a little too cocky.  The other pilots did not like me until we went and played volleyball with our shirts off except for my backseater.  At the time I used some lesser brand eyeware and it led me to go into a flat spin where I had to eject.  My back seater hit the canopy when he ejected and was gone forever!<br /><br />Heartbroken, I waffled on staying in school.  But, with the love of my instructor, a mannish woman, I took time to reflect on all that I had while listening to &#34;Dock of the Bay&#34; over and over again and got back in the fight.<br /><br />I went back overseas, faced the Russians, and won with the help of my entire TOP GUN class.  It was pretty remarkable.  I became an instructor, married my mannish woman who turned out later to be a lesbian, and I went into Scientology.  If I would have had these glasses, I would have not gone into a flat spin, its that simple.  Toodles!"
4.0,Cute but extremely wide with oversized head and leg openings for a newborn
4.0,Only one of the masks had an adjustable ear strap.  Comfortable
4.0,I am 5'9&#34; and the sleeves are short. it is very comfy otherwise and very elegant.
4.0,Worn all day during wedding and reception.  Comfortable.
4.0,"Fits my pair of Crosshair's, for the most part. A little long as some users report but I didn't see the need to trim them down. They do slide around a little but I think an adhesive should help keep them in place. It's a shame that you can't get replacements from Oakley. I would give 5 stars but let's be honest, it's price gouging for what you're getting."
4.0,Good but don‚Äôt match
4.0,Update: Contacted the seller and they were very accommodating by refunding my purchase and allowing me to repurchase. I will update this review if the new product has the same issue as the first.<br /><br />The one side doesnt click into place on the watch causing it to be able to be pulled off.
4.0,"Nice durable, and detailed. On complaint is that it is a little bulky. May not be the best for everyday use unless you don't mind having a slightly heavy keychain."
4.0,Shrunk in laundry. Alas.
4.0,"These sunglasses are a nice intersection between quality and price. The case and pouch seem to be very durable and good quality. The sunglasses themselves seem to be flimsy and made of plastic. However, I do not think one expects a $100 frame at this price point. I tried to test out the polarization, it seemed to work fine (but I tried on a cloudy day, which may not have been the best test date). I will carry these glasses with me when I am driving and when I go to the beach.<br /><br />I received a discount code in purchasing these sunglasses and did not pay full price. However, my review is my opinion and an honest assessment of the product."
4.0,Very nice got lots of compliments
4.0,"Read reviews and ordered a 3x instead of my 2X size. Fits well. A lot of my weight is in front so I'm glad I heeded their advice. The dress is made of a thick fabric which is great for winter in the Midwest. The bodice and sleeves are made with a nice lace. My arms are typical of an older woman being a bit saggy. The sleeves are comfortable. Will wear it to a wedding . An update might follow. By the way, for some reason it had a strong scent of cologne. A return? Please keep that in mind when trying on clothes."
4.0,sl smaller than expected for an extra large
4.0,They‚Äôre OK. Takes some practice to get my kid‚Äôs hand in properly. They seem warm and fairly water resistant. Wish there was a zipper that widens the opening.
4.0,"The set is nice, it is medium size beads. I liked it. The price is good for what i got, and the necklace has some weight to it, liked the color."
4.0,"Not as well finished as the product used in the representation, something I am correcting with a little wet or dry sandpaper.  It works as advertised holding one or perhaps 20 folded over bills. A little more time spent on finishing would have earned another star."
4.0,It was a gift and the person I gave it to loved it.
4.0,"Love the print and they are comfortable but they fit big. The measurements in the description are not what the masks measure, the masks are larger than the measurements."
4.0,lovely product
4.0,This watch has its unique color combination and my husband loves it. Is just that i did not expect it to be so big and quite heavy compare to his tag heur.
4.0,"The only problem is trying to remove it, but is really nice!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:546a93fed10363309aeb84448723a314]] These earrings are really look elegant and cute.Perfect for daily wear.
4.0,This dress is nice as it is adjustable for tightness. It's also modest and hits below my knees. One con: the material almost has a purple tone so when I try to wear it with white leggings it looks funny.
4.0,Nice warm winter coat.
4.0,they were bigger than I expected.
4.0,daughter liked very much
4.0,"Super cute, brightly colored, great fit and super comfy. Only complaint, material is thin. Great for swimsuit cover or lazy lounge wear."
4.0,"very comfortable, easy to wear, nice red."
4.0,"I like it my only problem is the chain and the ring don't seem to hold it in place.  There is a stop of the chain to keep it from riding up around your neck, but it rides down to the pendant.  I wear it everyday and it counts my steps when holding a cart with the wrist holders don't do."
4.0,"These are bold, not the nicest quality earrings I have but certainly makes a statement"
4.0,Looks good but definitely not high quality. Will work for a costume.
4.0,Its great for the price. I ordered my normal size and it fits well.
4.0,Nice but very see-through thin.  Roomy as expected.
4.0,"The earrings are just a picture on a 1/8"" thick piece of plastic.  They don't look 3-dimensional in real life.  Still cute, though.  I like them."
4.0,It's a cool outfit.
4.0,It fits well & looks really cute. It is lower cut than expected but it doesn't bother me that much. I'm not sure that I would buy again but I'm going to continue wearing it.
4.0,Nice sweater.  Fits VERY close.  I have many Pattyboutik tops and this one is smaller than most.
4.0,"I've had it for about a month now.  No chipping or change in color.  Looks very nice, especially for the price."
4.0,"Just what i was looking for. I was looking to change up my tan lines, lol."
4.0,They reduce the clarity of my vision. The fit was perfect for a mid size head. They work great for my wife so they get used every day.<br />  The service was prompt and they came in a protective soft bag. They do take the night glare down which is a great help. Great price for a good product.
4.0,I like the jacket but a little snug in the chest area.<br />Won‚Äôt be able to wear a sweater or thick shirt<br />Otherwise it‚Äôs a nice jacket. Haven‚Äôt worn it yet<br />But it feels warm enough on chilly days or nights.<br />Don‚Äôt think it will hold up in the rain.
4.0,Didn't let water in or fog up. Suction is very tight and causes red lines on the face around eyes.
4.0,Bought it for a gift.
4.0,"Does not look quite like the photo shown, fits awkward around arms"
4.0,"I get what other reviewers have said about these being very tight and difficult to get on; they do take some patience and work. Honestly, they remind me of Thrombo-Embolic Deterrent Hose (TEDs), which are often medically prescribed and used for fluid retention (people who get edema, or leg swelling due to vascular issues) and preventing deep vein thrombosis (blood clot). TEDs are very thick (like these socks are) and notorious for being difficult to put on. I haven't personally worn TED hose, but, as a nurse, I have placed them on many patients. Putting them on are like putting these compression stocking on--laborious. It takes some time. BUT, once on, my legs feel really good. I can feel the strength of the compression. So, they are inconvenient because of how much harder they are to put on than any other pair of compression stockings I've worn (and I've worn a lot over the years as a nurse for varicose vein prevention). They are a heavier material than most brands out there. The heavier material makes me think that they will last a long time, but only time will tell.<br /><br />Fit:  the foot fit is strange. I am a woman's 8. Per the Go2 size chart, I am a medium, so I purchased a medium. I would have preferred to go with a small because a 7.5 isn't that far from an 8, and the medium goes up to a size 12.5 shoe size--that's a huge range. In the pictures, I tried to show how much toe room I have. These socks are way too big in the foot, but tight in the leg (albeit tight in a providing-good-compression way). Because of the weird foot fit and time it takes to put these on, I'm rating this product 4 stars. I'm not going lower because I think they feel great. My legs feel like they're getting really good compression in these.<br /><br />If you're deterred by the fit, I'll tell you that my favorite compression stockings are made by Buttons and Pleats--they feel the best out of any brand I've worn, and they fit all heights really well. The few extra bucks are worth it for the quality you'll get.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest product review. I hope you find it helpful."
4.0,They are cute and for the price....you can't beat it
4.0,comfy and casual!
4.0,"Love the material and all the colors. Only thing for me is that I wish they had a short version because they are a little long, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4."
4.0,"Cute, my cousin loves it"
4.0,These boots are so cute! I love the color and the size. I usually have a problem finding boots tall enough and these sit just below my knee. The only thing I would like even more would be a looser calf and a bit more comfort for walking/standing.
4.0,"Looked cute but skirt was to big, had to be taken up"
4.0,"Very good fit, comfy, true to size, but the drawstring is ridiculously short.  It went into the waistband as soon as I went to put the shorts on.  I just took it out.  But other than that, great!"
4.0,They're comfortable. They protect your forearms from cuts and scratches. A good product if this is what you're looking for
4.0,"This fits just as I wanted.  It's not super tight and has a little room to breathe.  I'm 5'4, 113lbs and ordered small.  The zipper seems to get stuck on one spot, but I actually can slip the dress on without un-zipping.  The dress is otherwise pretty well made and designed.  Just a tad bit too long, but with the wedges I'm wearing, I think it will be fine.  The black lace is a lot and if you have black hair already, it might be nice to find an accessory or two with color.  I feel a bit gothy, Stevie Nicks ish in it ;&#62; which isn't totally the look I'm going for~ but still dig it quite a bit.  Wearing for an opera or two and just felt it was time for a new dress in the winter.  Other than the zipper hang-up, it is definitely made and designed well for this price."
4.0,We love the masks. On my husband though the ear loops start to hurt after long use which is probably normal for anyone. On me the mask is a little big. Overall though these are a win for protection from unwanted particles and comfort. Doesn‚Äôt irritate skin.
4.0,I used this for the first time today while working. Had clear vision while wearing over my eyeglasses. Overall very pleased with the product.
4.0,Plucking facial hair
4.0,"Sterling silver and pearl, my two favorites in one. Really liked the keychain. It‚Äôs small but detailed."
4.0,Very pretty . Gave it to a friend as a gift. She loved it.  Gold finish is very done.  It would be fit anybody:  woman and teen. The heart in the middle makes it very special.
4.0,"Great belt, construction appears better than the ‚ÄúMission Belt‚Äù (same style), however, it is a bit wide for most belt loops, making it more difficult to put on. Also, the buckle is constructed well, but also thicker than the other brand. This causes me to loose my belt on a long drive, or it ‚Äúcuts into you‚Äù. Overall, I like it better so far, than other ratchet belts, and if it was slighty less thick, I would have probably given it a five. Wear and tear. I yet to know the answer to that."
4.0,Very thick and lined with satin. Worked well for my twenties party. Has hook but too high and I didn't have time to move it.
4.0,"These are better than the ones with out a seam in the middle, but I wish they stood out a little<br />More from my mouth. But I really like the bendable nose pierce already sewn in. Glasses don‚Äôt fog up."
4.0,"I got this shirt in purple and I absolutely love it.  It's light weight, but not thin.  It's t-shirt weight and the chiffon is just enough without being overused.  It fits long enough and honestly there's not a thing I dislike about it.  I'm going to order a couple more colors!  :)  Incidentally, the color shown on my monitor and on my phone are very close to the genuine color of the shirt in person."
4.0,"I wish there was a way to send measurements to the team that made this, it is a little small for me and squishes the nose a bit, but after a little effort on my part it fits perfectly.  Great visibility, breathes wonderfully too.  The only thing I long for is a visor so I don't need to use a twisty straw to drink gin and tonics."
4.0,"T-shirt material is luxuriously soft for this Columbia Lions shirt (I have another for a different university that is more standard), and fit is true to size, but I am still a little hesitant to make proclamations about its sturdiness as I already needed to replace once because neckline was torn after a single wash."
4.0,I absolutely Love this pullover! Whatever a little cheaply made but so what warm like a blanket.  It‚Äôs short on the arms though. Fyi.
4.0,"This sandals are very pretty and very good quality, however they are not for me I have wide feet and this are narrow. I will recommend to size up."
4.0,for dance class..good
4.0,These work really well! I only see light by the nose -- everywhere else is completely covered.
4.0,"Product looks as described.  Very nice color and trim details.  Toe of she is very hard, however and will require significant &quot;breaking in&quot;.  Expect some sore toes until then."
4.0,"It‚Äôs beautiful, the only downside is that it‚Äôs just a little short!"
4.0,It‚Äôs gorgeous!
4.0,"I love the dress.  I usually wear a medium. I am 5'8&#34;, 125lbs, 36C.  I bought a medium and had to return it.  I liked the dress so decided to try a small.  Fits great below the chest but as a 36C, I'm surprised that the chest area of dress is still a little big. A padded bra might correct the issue but I don't really want my top to look larger.  I will be able to make it work but please keep bra size in mind.  Smaller than 36C, this might not be the dress for you even in size small.  Dress is not the highest quality but fine for price. Very comfy."
4.0,too small each time I purchased it. even in larger sizes
4.0,Smaller In Size
4.0,The size is perfect for everyday and I love the color especially for the holidays.
4.0,"The material is substantial and it gives, so the fit is very comfortable. The colors (I bought two: blue and green) are beautifully bright. I received many compliments on the fit and colors of the dresses. The first one I bought was XL and it fits well, but I felt I could wear a L because of the spandex and I was right, a perfect fit for my 38D, size 14 frame. I liked the length, just past the knee. I was disappointed that the sash was closed with elastic, so it pulled to expose a gap between the two ends, both on the XL and L dress. I opted to wear it without."
4.0,Charms seem a little cheaply made but we are Star Wars fans so it didn‚Äôt really matter.  My husband loves it.
4.0,This purse is as expected...it has sturdy construction...I have no complaints
4.0,Very pretty.  Smaller than expected.
4.0,"Love the necklace, but can only give a 4 star because I did not received it in a wooden box as discribed. Just in a jewelry pouch."
4.0,Love these. After having many different more expensive ones when I was in the military these have done the job just fine. I have even on accident dropped in the river of the boat with the wife expensive camera. She was not pleased but it floated and no leaks and everything was protected.
4.0,You can style them ways i sleep with them on my head at bedtime and stay on my head
4.0,Fits perfect and is very compfy
4.0,"Fits well. Pretty material, good for the summer months. doesn't wrinkle easily."
4.0,I like it but can't wear it because it's way too small.
4.0,They are cheap sandals but work
4.0,"Well ... I'll be honest, I would prefer I looked like the product photos but sadly, not a model. Its a cute shirt, I love the button details, they are the best part.  It's a great casual look, but just unfortunately not the most flattering on me.  It really doesn't do a ton for the broad shouldered girl... bat wings never do.  Its not a huge batwing, thankfully but it's not a slim cut sleeve either.  I like the neckline a lot and I love the color.  It'll be a great fall shirt with skinny jeans and boots but do wish it was just a little more flattering, probably something I should work on :)"
4.0,Seems to hold everything I need.  It's a little bulky when fully loaded but still closes.  Color is great and frabic seems of a good quality.  I think this will allow me to keep very organized when traveling making things easy to access and find.  The small removable pouch sits a little wonky in the bag when snapped in and has to manipulated slightly to get the thing to fold up properly.  All I n all a good buy.
4.0,"The fit of the leotards was sorta off, causing them to dip very low in the front. Good quality though, I just wish they came up higher at the chest."
4.0,These are for the truly bigheaded.  I have never had a cap that I didn't want at least an extra half inch at least around but this cap is crazy.  It will fit with inches to spare.  It is also for the tall-headed.  This cap comes almost halfway down my ears.  The duckbill is a bit over the top also being about a third again in length compared to a normal cap. Got a really massive head?  Get this.  I wish there was just an xl size for me and another triple x large for the most massive headed people.  Label reads XL-3XL.
4.0,Would be great for someone else. Too much cleavage enhancement for this buyer but nice color and fit otherwise.
4.0,I love it. It is as advertized. The colour is as advertized. I would buy it again. Kinna want a black now.
4.0,I like how the top comes up more than other suits and hides what should not be seen. Top was way too small. Bottoms fit fine. Usually it‚Äôs the other way around as I am not big busted.
4.0,"Super cute, I ordered this for my best friend as a birthday gift and I can‚Äôt wait to give it to her."
4.0,Love the fit..pants were a lil big but still look nice. Oder a size down.
4.0,lovely.  A little heavy considering compact size.
4.0,Both items were exactly as advertised and just what I wanted.
4.0,I love this dress. I have worn it out from wearing it so much. There is a slight manufacturing defect but the dress is dark so you cant tell.
4.0,The work out set is very cute. The material is thick and good quality. It has the scrunched detailing which does enhance your behind which I like. I choose the khaki color which in person doesn't look as flattering on my particular skin tone but it's still a nice set. I would purchase more but in a different color.
4.0,"Wish it was a little more durable, but still great hat.  Love the worn-look."
4.0,"Great for the price, the fabric is very soft, and even the fabric is thin saves the heat so you are not cold."
4.0,"Cute concept, just fits small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and it‚Äôs short in the torso."
4.0,"Comfortable Fit. Bifocal a tad higher than I would like but work very well. The clear glass part could be a little darker, but overall, these do the job I intended and look good on."
4.0,Wasn't very comfy
4.0,Good and less expensive alternative to the 511 tactical pants
4.0,cute bracelets!
4.0,"LOVE IT. I'm short. Barely five ft, but that's to be expected since I'm still on middle school. The size adjustment thing on the bag is awesome. I think it'll work even if ur below or above my height. I like the size but from person to person opinions on that vary. The only complaint is the material. That's to be expected though because its lower in price than others. Overall, it's not perfect, but it's good enuff"
4.0,"When they arrived I didn't know it was these because they look nothing like what's advertised. They're significantly more transparent and the colors are very faint. That being said, they still turned out to be my favorite pair and they are very beautiful, just be prepared to get something much less dramatic in color."
4.0,They're comfortable but was hoping for a little more padding in the feet bottoms.
4.0,I really liked the pattern on these bands. It is comfortable to wear and it doesn‚Äôt make my wrist sweaty like other bands
4.0,very cute suit. Wish I would have gotten a size smaller. It is made very well. It is an adorable suit. I received this product at a discount for my review.
4.0,"It's a square sheer fabric sewn down the sides, with a neck hole. I'm not usually a fan of this shape/cut because of how much excess fabric hangs off under your arms, but I like how this one looks. It still has too much excess sleeve for my liking but ah well. I ordered the pink/colorful stripes. The tassels aren't too big to bother me. Fabric is light, sheer, bright colorful - good for the beach. The top is long enough to keep everything covered."
4.0,Good deal. Great price
4.0,Fits well and comfortable. Great gift for little girls who love spiderman
4.0,I was just looking for something to wear everyday and this was just what I needed I love it !!!
4.0,Ok for small ears. I thought they were going to be bigger but even tho they were not I still loved them. And wear them in my 3rd holes up. Or they would be perfect for a child's ears.
4.0,"These look high end, like fine jewelry, but are a nice costume style. I don't like the huggie hoops. They are harder to open and close and get in your ear correctly. The stones are gorgeous though. Bright sparkly and full of life."
4.0,"I love this sweater, I really do its very warm and comfortable. however that being said there is one small problem, the neck is very tight, so tight in fact that it chokes me. and it is not elastic so there is no stretch in it at all. that is the only problem with this sweater."
4.0,Nice and large.  Very dark.  So good I gave my first pair to a friend and bought them again.  Would only be better if they came with a case.
4.0,Nice jacket but there are no closures on the front. We returned the item.
4.0,"I wanted to love this dress :( The neckline was slightly uneven, and didn't lay quite right. And the eye was missing from the hook and eye closure on the back. But it fit perfectly otherwise, and the fabric was a good weight. Side note, the care instructions were inconsistent."
4.0,"only worn it couple times like it so far,was everything I expected"
4.0,"pretty good, kinda big"
4.0,"These sneakers have done the job. Held up for the basket ball season.My son is glad they are a tad big,as he is growing so fast!  My only complaint -they are way too expensive!!!!"
4.0,"It's a very nice case, high quality, but very slippery. I've thrown my phone 3-4 times pulling it out my pocket. Had to stop using it because I kept dropping it."
4.0,"true to size, good design. FIL loves HD everything and he loved this shirt"
4.0,Seems good quality. My only issue is that's it's really snug. Makes it hard for my child to put their scriptures back.
4.0,my husband likes the Velcro watch bands and a thin watch.  this filled both of his requirements.
4.0,"I really like this band! The only issue I had with it is the color. The picture shows a nude-ish color, but in person it is a deep brown."
4.0,Very nice fit but I was sent the wrong color. I ordered God and got black with gold glitter. I kept it because it is cute but couldn't wear for my birthday like I wanted. Also very nice quality.
4.0,Great little purse/clutch. I'll get a lot of use out if it on nights out.
4.0,The clasp didn't work right so I had to fix it.
4.0,sotf and comfortable
4.0,"This is a great hat. Since it's winter here in the Midwest, I'll not be wearing this until Spring. However, have 3 friends that wore this same hat during last summer's heat and swear by its cooling function. My only issue was that my hat was shipped in an undersized box, and, the rim of the hat is misshapened. I hope that will correct itself after use."
4.0,Love them - but the back is a little low. When I bend down I have to pull them up.
4.0,"Very cute world necklace, I love it. A bit small, but still pretty. I got the black necklace and it's very pretty!!!!"
4.0,Good...but it has a weird strong smell.
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and had to cut a lot off of the bottom, but overall it looks how it does in the picture and worked wonderfully for my wedding shower."
4.0,Soft and comfy. Cute designs. My 4 year old son loves them.
4.0,"I really like the shoulder pads, but they are too long. I had to shorten them by cutting them and finishing off where I cut them. I like how they look under my clothes. They do slip sometimes and they show on the outside. Sometimes the neck of a dress, etc., has a large neck so that is the main reason I had to cut them off."
4.0,"Nice unique looking ring.  I orginally bought this for my trip to Mexico as a &#34;wedding ring&#34;.  I thought I'd get better service and less hassles.  Well, this was not the case..haha!  Either way, it didn't tarnish and is fun to look at.  I got a few compliments.  I would purchase it again."
4.0,"I like the shirt, but should have ordered one size up. I thought xlarge would fit me. it normally does, but not this time. I now have a collection of shirts I've ordered from Amazon that I gift or just give to other people when they're too small for me."
4.0,Runs a bit small but not uncomfortably so as it's stretchy. Really like the B/W camo print.
4.0,"As expected from the photo, this top is a bit roomy being an XS. With that said, it is a cute top with the bow attached. I like the ruffle detailing and it's not overly done. It does need a little ironing but what Allegra K product doesn't. Great when paired and tucked in with just about anything. When purchasing, keep in mind it does run large so its expected to be a little roomy which only adds comfort but doesn't compromise on style."
4.0,Pretty cool so far. Decent quality. Lenses may be a little darker than most. Quite reflective - a bit ostentatious for anything other than the beach.
4.0,"Love this necklace! Gave as a gift, and it is lovely quality.  She also loved it"
4.0,A bit snug at the top and quite loose at the wrist but works very very well
4.0,I like the way the mask fits over the chin so not much air can get it.
4.0,"Love these socks.  Nice fit, soft, good grip on the bottoms and super cute"
4.0,"I received this product heavily discounted. The description is a little off on these, there is no silver tone at all it is all gold in color. I have added a picture so that you can see how they look out of the packaging. They came in a very velvet carrying case, which is nice to have for trips to the pool, beach or boat. It's going to be the summer of golden things, I think. Gold or metallic tattoos are en vogue this year too. What a very fun and cute accessory for a summery and beachy look!"
4.0,just like other reviews...cute.  I really don't understand asian sizes.  I ordered according to their suggestions (dimensions) and it was way too large. Luckily I am a skilled seamstress and can make this work by changing a few things.  I am (US size) a 10-12 with long torso.  According to the size chart I should have bought a XXXL! I sent for that and when I discovered how huge it was I measured the suit and the measurements were way bigger than the chart said they would be. Like I said I can make it work and it is cute so am keeping it.  Just keep in mind.
4.0,Good for the beach and other uses where they will get wet.
4.0,"The picture doesn't show the embroidery detail on the stripes, but it was a pleasant surprise for me."
4.0,"Incredibly cute, real leather!!!  Only gave it 4stars because it will not fit an iPhone 6plus."
4.0,My wife was was kinda disappointed though because  she thought the lighting was glitter! But other than that she loves it!!!
4.0,"The bag worked really well for travelling in the plane, big enough but not too big for the airline. My only negative is the outside pockets aren't big enough for cell phine, keys, ect. Need to be wider and deeper."
4.0,I was pleased with my set of earrings.  I received them on the date they said I would get them. I will be using them for the Holidays.
4.0,Very nice shirts.  I will be ordering a couple more.  I wish the sleeves were a little shorter but otherwise they are great.
4.0,My friend loved it! Don't know how it fit but looked like good quality and reasonable price
4.0,"The graphics are well done and the details are perfect. The only thing that could be better is the shirt weight, the material is thinner than I expected."
4.0,"Very chic and easy to wear. I like the red undertones. Protects the eyes nicely. Comes with a protective case. It's big, round and very sturdy. The quality is good too."
4.0,"Really nice. A good length. Not a super soft t-shirt, but thick and nice quality."
4.0,I love this skirt very flattering.
4.0,"An issue with some of the different types of underwear that I've found is that briefs tend to hug your package a bit too tightly to your body, boxers tend to give you too much freedom of movement and boxer-briefs have a tendency to ride up. These are actually a really nice combination of all of those. The 'pocket' allows everything to be positioned as it would normally without being hugged to you or being too free, and the shorter leggings don't provide enough material to ride up and become bunched in your pant leg. The material is also very comfortable.<br /><br />My one base concern is how long they might last before becoming stretched so that the part around the thighs become loose. That tends to happen with most underwear that makes contact there but time will tell.<br /><br />And I know this will sound silly coming from a guy but they seem to be considered a male version of ""sexy underwear""(first time I've ever been complimented on my choice of undergarment!)<br /><br />I'll likely be buying another package after wearing these some more."
4.0,Easy to wash. Easy to wash out stains. Don't shrink after drying. Good quality. I love the cute little designs. Can't beat the price. Reasonable and affordable.
4.0,"This is a really nice bag. It's made with super thick vinyl like material. it has lots of extra pockets, sturdy construction, top handle for easy carrying, strong resilient fabric and zippers along with the superior, compact design make this the only traveling case for your personal essentials that you will ever need!<br />My only gripe is that it is much smaller than what I anticipated.<br /><br />I received this at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,Love these mugs! Unfortunately one of the mugs were broken when they arrived.
4.0,This item is comfortable.
4.0,This set is super cute. But not true to size. Ordered a M but really was more like a xs/s. Wanted to keep it but Had to return it.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Fabric is a little heavy and the dress is really long but I like it
4.0,"Bought this as a play costume for my daughter for a middle school production of James and the giant peach. She wears a women's small, but based on reviews I went up a size and got a medium. It was not tight, but not too big (which was exactly what I wanted) and did not look at all sexy on her, so definitely true to size. If I wore it it would look totally different since I wear a medium. She got tons of compliments. The webbed arms are cool and it held up through weeks of daily wear for rehearsals and 3 actual performances so it is good quality. All around a good purchase."
4.0,"Love the color and fit. Will show all the sweat of you're doing anything heated or intense. That limits what I can wear them to; but, other than that, I love them."
4.0,"Like the design and material, but fit was tight around foot and length was no there."
4.0,"Bought 3 pairs in different colors for my sisters. They loved them all. They do not necessarily have top quality polarization but for this price, they are pretty good. They wont last you lifetime but good summer glasses."
4.0,"the photo indicates a pair of free earrings, none were included in the shirt purchase that I received but the shirt is really what I wanted and i get several compliments on it every time its worn. I'm a little busty and ordering a size bigger worked perfectly."
4.0,Fit on the tighter side.
4.0,"I wasn't clear on the actual size, but got this one anyway. I'm had an  8"" wrist for many years.  But this would not fit a wrist larger than 7"", even with the stong magnetic clasp.<br /><br />It's still a cool bracelet though"
4.0,"To be fair, I am not sure whether these were made inside out, or whether the other pack I got of ""Trunks"" from them were....Either way there is a difference in the seams and fly configuration (looks like these are inside out compared to my old ones when the waistband is oriented so that it reads correctly), but that doesn't change the comfort and breathability. Took one star off for the inconsistency and the added couple seconds that bathroom operations take with the ""inside out"" fly configuration."
4.0,"looks kinda cheap, but I don't care!  I wear it with my jeans when I go shopping a walmart"
4.0,"This is a cute dress and in terms of the length - it is as shown.  I am 5-5 and it is short, but that is why I purchased it.  I am 40DD, 200lbs and normally wear size 16 in dresses, l/XL in tops or these types of dresses.  XL was the largest size, and it fit - but a bit snug over the bust.  However, I think that was less because of the size rather the material is not as soft or stretchy.  It was more like a cotton feel.  It's wearable, but I wish it was slightly softer in feel and less fitted over my bust area."
4.0,It was nice soft flowing material. I liked that it covered my hips. Nice style.
4.0,"A little see through, but fits and looks great. Good whisking material"
4.0,"I used this for a Dreadpirate Roberts costume from &#34;Princess Bride&#34; and it worked perfectly. It's definitely fragile, so dropping this would pretty much mean the end of it, but it fits well to the face and is easy to secure with the ribbon. I'm very pleased with the purchase. If you need something that goes up over your eyebrows and into the forehead, this is a large enough mask to do it."
4.0,"I like it, New attractive piece of jewelry which I can now add to my wardrobe. It's lightweight and an attractive piece which I can wear both for casual and formal use."
4.0,"Great material and look exactly as shown and described. Great value for the price! I carry only 3 credit cards, 1 ID, a transit card, office batch and a few Bill's. I hate to carry a bulky wallet and nowadays many things are stored on the phone anyway. If the width can be narrower, so the overall dimension can even be slimmer would be excellent!"
4.0,This belt fits and works well. My only complaint is that I thought this design had a full chrome type finish. I didn't realize from the picture and the non-specific description that it was a multi-color finish.
4.0,"Chain, neck cord is way too short."
4.0,purchased and loved the material and fit. Use size chart with description!  You will love!
4.0,I love this watch.  awesome.<br />Just need the band to be a lil more sturdy.
4.0,"These are nice. I like the look and the fit is pretty good. I normally wear 8.5 and ordered the 9, but they seem a bit short. Lots of blisters on my heel after the first wear, none on the second wear, so hopefully they're breaking in. The leather is soft, so I expect them to get more comfortable with time."
4.0,SansoiSan Cute Animal Printed Baby Boys Girls Jumpsuit Unisex Toddler is breathable but warm material. comfy texture. cute design. Fits  large but he really isn't into this size yet. Washed and dried nicely and the price is very reasonable. Blue & orange trim and spans-cut combo
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:14a513e52034e32651ed85046cd7e275]] I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs decent for the price (I got the color on sale.) I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 118lbs and usually wear a size 26 in jeans or a size 4. I got the skirt in a small and it fits well and goes to my ankles. I like the under mini skirt so you‚Äôre not exposed when the wind blows. Isn‚Äôt see through at all, but the material is a little cheap looking. It‚Äôs somewhat shiny and looks like it‚Äôs made out of the same swim material that my kids rashguard swim tops are made out of. Because of that i wouldn‚Äôt dress it up, but seems good as beach wear, a swim coverup or as a casual summer outfit."
4.0,"Seems like a good product, I've had them about one month and they are holding up fine.  I wear a size 12 shoe and they are a little bit too snug.  This is the life of a size 12 shoe wearer, socks are always a bit on the small side as they are typically &#34;fits sizes 6-12.&#34;"
4.0,I loved it! But the cups were made for a c cup at the most! Works for b cup great.  Great lift
4.0,"The hood is attached in an odd way, but seems like it will be very durable. Maybe not the warmest, but a keeper for sure."
4.0,"Good thick and strong quality, but my kid won't wear. He finds it scratchy and too tight, I guess he doesn't have the sensory needs I thought he might have. But the shirt was of good quality and I was able to return without any issues."
4.0,It was quite the delight. The sweatshirt was comfortable and was perfect to get me sweating. Wasn't too warm and looks amazing. 6/9 ducks would recommend. Was bit too large
4.0,"Love these!! Just was them first, have a bit of a chemical smell"
4.0,Nice well made watch.  Love the look and style. Very durable. Only a 4 star because hands do not light up as well as expected to read hands at night. Needs to be a bit brighter.
4.0,I loved this dress. The only issue i had was the top buttons and since im busty the black piece of fabric that was in the top. Other then that i love this dress. Lots of vreat compliments on this piece
4.0,It was easy to wear but some information has come out that they are not safe
4.0,Very pretty but a little big on me. 5'7 115lb
4.0,Yup your bra is showing if you wear one also color is more tan than pink
4.0,I like the pants except for the bottom legs they are tight on my legs had to stretch them out. They are soft
4.0,"Still testing as just got it,"
4.0,They are too many for a good price.
4.0,Very nice t-shirt but a little bit small
4.0,true to size and is cute
4.0,"I mean I wouldn't say they're perfect, but my girlfriend says she liked them. She at first thought they were pineapples though."
4.0,they fit a little tight thats why its getting 4 stars
4.0,Works great on jewelry. Love it
4.0,"I bought this mask for work, and it fits well. I bought the ""large"" and it barely fits my medium face, my coworkers who have large faces don't fit in it.<br /><br />It still fits me after washing it so the fabric keeps its shape in a medium hot wash and delicate low heat dry.<br /><br />The main problem is I do a lot of physical activity during my job and after about 30 to 45 minutes of use the fabric gets moisture saturated to the point that wearing it is like getting waterboarded. Absolutely stifling to breathe. It takes forever to dry off too.<br /><br />It has a Filter Pocket. I cannot see wearing this mask with a filter due to it being so thick and hard to breathe in WITHOUT a filter.<br /><br />I have to wear 100% natural fiber masks due to fiber sensitivity and this mask works extremely well for light duty wear and even when saturated doesn't cause skin irritation.  Just don't get it if you need one for wearing during a physical labor job or need to wear it for an hour or more at a time.<br /><br />Update, I bought some filters for this mask and they change everything. They keep the mask off your face and make it much more breathable, it no longer feels like waterboarding and while damp and uncomfortable after an hour it is still somewhat wearable.<br /><br />It still should not be worn for more than an hour at a time if you have facial hair as it gets your face soggy, but by swapping out the mask for a dry one every hour you can use it for some degree of physical activity. And if you are clean shaven it might last you all day... But only with a filter in the pocket.<br /><br />Getting the filter takes this mask from kinda tortuous for long wear to decently wearable.<br /><br />This mask is good for small to medium faces only."
4.0,The earrings look great. They are a bit small for normal ears!! Would work better on a child. Not an adult.
4.0,Cute.  Case can fit in pocket for easy travel.
4.0,"Cute set. The only downside was that the pendant on the necklace had broken off. It was still usable, though."
4.0,The pockets  are great but material way too thin. Disappointed that the pattern was not on the back of the dress. I will keep and try to embellish it myself.
4.0,"The strap itself seems durable, but I don't think it gives enough support for the camera. I think maybe the plastic piece that slides into the camera needs to be a little longer."
4.0,"The pants fit great and we‚Äôre very comfortable the top was a little tight when zipped,it worked out because I was able to leave it open but you definitely were a little snug when it was zipped up. But I don‚Äôt think you would want to go as a full size up because of the pants being the size they were. The quality was very good though and I was happy with how it looked. Definitely way higher quality than a cheap Halloween costume!"
4.0,"I loved it, nice color & size.  The only criticism is it could stood up to wear better. It was the only purse I took on vacation & at the end of 2 weeks I had to get out the Gorilla Glue to reattached  some of the hardware."
4.0,Lo acabo de recibir y est√° muy arrugado y el precio que trae es diferente a lo que me costo yo pague $29.99 y el precio que tiene es $24.99 . Pero me gusto la calidad de la tela
4.0,So far so good (hasn't turned my skin green).. although I do have to say it's a lot smaller than I expected but still cute though.
4.0,"I try it in a polarized tester and it is original, and it has 100% UV protection.<br /><br />For this price, its ver very good,i recomend it."
4.0,Just really didn't look good with my outfit so it's never been worn.
4.0,"I ordered an XS, it was slightly big, but either way I can wear it as if it fits that way and it works. The material is not soft and cotton, it‚Äôs polyester, which I overlooked. However, I like it anyway, and love the colors. And pockets!"
4.0,"Had for a few days.  Very good quality and unlike a lot of shoe trees, way more wood than metal. The double rod/double spring structure makes them very stable. And the screw adjustment for width makes them easy to adjust for wider shoes, which i have.  Not sure they would work for EEE‚Äôs, but for my wider D‚Äôs and E‚Äôs work very well.  Unlike a lot of other reviewer‚Äôs experience, they are true to size, it just takes a bit of getting used to putting them in the shoes.<br /><br />I only wish the width adjustability went a bit further back in the shoes, but it‚Äôs a minor point."
4.0,"A little too big, I had to make 3 extra holes because my wifes wrist is a little too small."
4.0,Wash before use! The dye transferred to the sheets!
4.0,"I am happy to say,in regards to receiving this item.Satisfied with prompt delivery.The price was very affordable.I will inquire for future interest,.Sincerely"
4.0,Works great and it comes with a case which is nice that I could use in my other glasses.
4.0,"SOMEWHAT LARGE, BUT IT IS BETTER THAN SOMEWHAT SMALL, MY KID IS GROWING FAST."
4.0,"I liked them a lot for my kiddo. He is not too fond of shoes so the fact that he is not trying that hard to take them off tells me that they are comfy. They run big; I was worried that I ordered them borderline and might not fit, they fit with room to spare‚Ä¶<br />If my review helped you in any way, let me know by clicking the helpful button below. Any questions, feel free to ask..."
4.0,Nice anklet for working out in.
4.0,"these bands has lasted me a while they are easy to clean, and fashionable. really easy to you and they hold up. Also 3 bands for that cheep is not bad. I say get these"
4.0,"Since I have been able to examine this product, I figured I get to doing a review for seller. Although I dnt give any 5 star reviews except in extreme situations..<br />  Although I dnt give any 5 star reviews, However, all said ..,  I must say:: PRODUCT WAS AS DESRIBED, DID ARRIVE ON TIME.. -AND-...MOST IMPORTANTLY...I AM HAPPY WITH IT!!!<br />I would buy from Or Recommend this Product/Seller to another.!!!"
4.0,"Loved the look and quality of the band.  My skin cannot take the texture of this band.  I had it on for a few minutes and took it off.  My skin was imprinted with texture of band and itchy.  I had to keep it on at that tightness to keep it from shifting around my wrist. It is very easy to tighten and loosen with one hand.  Def a great buy for those without my issues.  I have many metal allergies and even my hair gives me contact dermatitis.  The original apple  silcone band with the buckle is the only one that has worked for me, so far."
4.0,Great fot. But cheaply made and straps were both coming off because the thread was unraveling. Wanted to send back to exchange but didn‚Äôt want to wait for the new one so decided to just keep it and resew the straps. Hoping it holds up. Will prob hand wash it.
4.0,like these but the armpits hang low.
4.0,I got these for my 5 year old who loves dinosaurs. The designs are cute and the underwear is well-made but these do run large. I would say they would be better for a 6 or even 7 year old. (My son is a normal sized 5 year old.) Go at least a size down.
4.0,"This wallet is everything you want it to be. It is quality made and as nice as it looks in the pictures. We are very satisfied with this wallet, my husband loves it."
4.0,Love the print and the cut. Great sundress for the price.
4.0,The legs were wider than the picture shows but I do like the pants.
4.0,Not bad only thing it should come with some cover
4.0,"Very nice, comfortable, ended up buying 3 more pair, they are just a little bigger in size but are great"
4.0,love the shoe however its too big will have to go down atleast two sizes n order again another pair but they are great shoes from what i have seen so far
4.0,"Lightweight, true to size and color BUT it's  see through."
4.0,"Living in Florida I love clothes with sun protection.  These shirts are comfortable, not hot and beautiful colors.  My only objection is that the crew neck stretches a little when washed.  I think for the price that should not happen. But I do love them. I own three colors and plan to buy more."
4.0,A little more flashy then I was expecting;but very pretty! They were a little too long for my feet; but I was able to cut and reassemble chain no problem
4.0,"The bottom of the shirt is smaller than the top if the shirt, not a shirt for women with hips."
4.0,"Works perfectly, but the plastic screw is a bit weak."
4.0,He loved the pajamas for Christmas!
4.0,Thought it would be a little smaller but I still love it!
4.0,will have to let you know how they stand the test of time
4.0,They are small charms just as pictured.
4.0,Quick shipping. Great packaging. Quality product and true to description. Only complaint I have is that it runs small and will have to exchange for a bigger size.
4.0,"Keep 4 year old warm with helmet, but he sometimes complains about having around...says can't breath but its not tight, just he doesn't like jackets zipped up or anything around neck.  Work though."
4.0,A beautiful addition to a charm bracelet.
4.0,"Super cute, should have went a half size smaller."
4.0,These are great Replacement lenses for Oakley Rpms. Much cheaper than buying Oakley replacements but more than 2x more expensive than other companies on Amazon like Walleva which didn't seem to carry this model.
4.0,Bought this for my granddaughter. Apparently a hit.
4.0,"I'm 5'11"".....it is long enough for me."
4.0,"This was a birthday gift for my mom and she really likes it!  She does spoil our dogs!  Or should I say, she accommodates them very well!"
4.0,"8 hook key cases are a bit hard to find any more.  This one is made of very nice soft leather and has small pockets under each flap, but with a large wad of keys, the pockets are not very useful.  The case comes with a ring at the bottom of the hook area, and when a single key is placed on the ring, there is little room if the upper hooks are all used.  The other problem with the ring is that it stops the key from turning, thus compelling that the whole case be turned to turn the key.  I finally abandoned using the bottom ring.  The hooks are very well designed and allow easy mounting of even the biggest of keys.  All have good quality swivels and allow easy use and management of the keys.  All in all a very nice case except the lack of utility of the bottom ring."
4.0,"I was looking for something cute and functional for the gym, and this was a great top. I ordered size 4 (FYI I'm 5'6, 120 pounds, 32b chest) and this fit perfectly. I find that I probably could've sized up one size for a more comfortable fit, but this holds me in well. It's flattering on your back muscles too."
4.0,"This suit runs a little smaller than I thought it would, but other than that, I love it.  I just had my third baby and gained more weight than I wanted to, so I've become very self conscious about my thighs especially, and the bottoms to these fit great and make me feel good about them.  The top is just a little tighter than I thought it would be, but I'm still able to wear it so it's not a huge deal."
4.0,"Color and texture match expectations. Length wise, it appears to be more of a crop top sweater, which I didn't really expect from the picture. On a deeper look at all the pictures now that its arrived, I can see where the sides are slit higher, showing midriff. Nothing wrong with the sweater at all in this case then - just be warned it's going to expose your belly :)"
4.0,"-Fit is good, but I'm thinking if you are between sizes to size down<br /><br />-The material is medium weight which is nice but I wish it was softer<br /><br />-The ruffles on the shoulders are a nice touch but I am still trying to decide if it adds or takes away from the sweater<br /><br />-I ordered the white and it appears more of a cream color in person<br /><br />-I washed it and put it thru the dryer and it came out nicely"
4.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; 138 lbs and ordered a medium, it fit perfectly. I  wore it to a small wedding ceremony and got a lot of compliments on the dress. Will wear it again."
4.0,They worked well on the ride this morning.
4.0,quick service but too big!  https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/?_encoding=UTF8&asins=B06XDPRRM4#
4.0,I bought this item for my 14 year old daughter who is small and the other dresses we looked at were very child like and immature. It fit her perfectly
4.0,I had to alter it a bit cause the tie kept coming loose once I put any tools in it. But since now it has a parachute buckle it's way more convenient. I wear it everyday on the jobsite.
4.0,It was worth the money. All the Fortnite players recognized the mask and rest of costume. Definitely a bargain.. saved a ton of money instead of spending 80 bucks in spirit of Halloween.
4.0,Little thin
4.0,"It was real nice and my sister loved it, the only thing not too cool is the material. Besides it, everything is nice."
4.0,This dress is light weight true to size. However 3 inches to long for 5‚Äô3‚Äù. Very pretty
4.0,For my mother. She loves them.
4.0,I really wish the sleeves would‚Äôve been more snug but overall the top is so pretty and feminine. I love the ribbed detail. It makes it more casual.
4.0,They were for my Grandson and he likes them.
4.0,"I bought it for my daughter to wear during P.E. class.  She said that she likes it, and likes that the shoe is lightweight."
4.0,Very attractive shoes.  The heel was a bit odd and I didn't find them stable enough for me.  But I'm giving to my granddaughter and I'll bet she will enjoy them.
4.0,"Nice, big and well made.  Not really Navy more inbetween navy and royal."
4.0,The torso fit fine (I have bought size 12 in more expensive suits) and found the leg openings were much wider in this suit. I really like this suit and bought the blue one in an 8-10 and it fits great. I may still buy an 8-10 in this suit because for the price it is worth it.
4.0,‚Ä¶ sized small.
4.0,Great shoes! Comfortable and sporty. I love them! Well worth the money.
4.0,"Pants it's too big, bit jacket it's ok"
4.0,I ordered this item to wear to a funeral. It was a quick buy and when I received the item I was impressed how it fit. I wore it with a black sweater and boots and it looked great! I may even wear it  out to dinner with my significant other. Extremely happy with this product.
4.0,nice necklaces.
4.0,Shirt could have ran a bit longer LIKE normal tshirts!
4.0,The earrings arrived on time and are cute. They compliment a necklace and bracelet I had already owned. They appear to be well made; I have worn them one time so far and they were fine. I would recommend them.
4.0,Sizes are accurate. My daughter loved it! I do wish it came in different colors but this is ok. My only complaint is the logo at the bottom. It takes away from the visual appeal. Is not showing signs of fading or shrinking after multiple washes.
4.0,"The material is a thick with a silky feel to it. The dress has a deep plunge, too revealing for me and easily shifted."
4.0,More like ankle socks for my size 12 mens feet
4.0,"I like these belts, I don't have to look for the next hole."
4.0,perfect for the warm weather
4.0,The suit was really cute just didn't like my body in it.
4.0,I bought this brush to clean my Grandfather's Stetson that we just found in storage!!! It worked very well!!!
4.0,Very good quality and fit. They are somewhat hard to get on and off because my daughters feet sweat in them. But otherwise very cute and affordable!
4.0,"Love the design of these goggles, and the blue/purple color of the lenses are just as bright as the photos. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 bc I haven‚Äôt worn them skiing yet, and Im not sure of the anti-fog capabilities.  Great product for the price!"
4.0,"There weren't many reviews for these pajama pants when I ordered them so I felt like it was a bit of a risk, but I'm glad I got them.  They are the only ones of this style and material I could find that have POCKETS.  (Why don't clothing makers understand women want pockets too??) These pants are very, very comfortable.  After multiple washes they look as good as new.  The only thing I don't like, and the reason for subtracting a star, is that the nice, wide elastic at the waist folds over inside the channel and it is a pain to try to get it straightened out.  If it weren't for that, I'd order multiple more pairs of these pajama pants.  That said, the pros well outweigh the cons."
4.0,"I just tried on this dress and love it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 140 lbs and the medium fit perfectly. For the length, it hits mid-way between my knees and ankles. I bought it to wear for work, so this is perfect and can be worn for work, casual or event. The reason I give it a 4 is because the bottom half of the material is thin and can sometimes have static. However, for the price, I think it‚Äôs a bargain."
4.0,"These are great BUT getting the sizing right is a bit challenging. If anything size up! 6mm is very small. My advice is for your second hole or nose I‚Äôd say go with 7 or 8mm. I now have a lovely collection, lol."
4.0,"I have ordered from Red Taro before and been so happy with both the product and service that I have highly recommended you to friends. But not this time. What you call ""red"". It is NOT!!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Fabric is thick enough to hide undergarment seams. The shoulder area is poorly designed- the arm bands provide no support, leaving the dress possibly falling. The straps can be moved up to the shoulder, which leaves a bit of puffing. The dress accommodated my bust and hid a tummy. Overall, have gotten some fancy gala wears out of it!"
4.0,Fits fine and you can read the print. I wore it with my 50 t-shirt. Everyone thought I made the mask to match my shirt. lol
4.0,"Overall I am happy with this purchase! I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 155 lbs and ordered the medium in Khaki. It fits well - loose and slouchy without being frumpy or drowning in it. It is lightweight and great for spring, but i wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be the best quality material. It is comfortable but is not a soft or cozy fabric. It also has more of a gold/mustard tint to it than the color that‚Äôs shown in the images. I just received it in the mail yesterday and am hoping it holds up over time! Even though I think it‚Äôs overpriced for the quality, I‚Äôm glad I bought it."
4.0,"This is a very pretty top.  I'm always trying to cover up my weight with a loose top but the XL in this was really big and XL is typically what I wear on top.  I'm a 40C bra with a short, thick waist.  I could easily have sized down to a large and  even then it probably would have been too flowing at the waistline.  The neckline isn't cut  too low but I would  have chosen to wear a cami underneath.  This is almost like a short swing-dress.  Very nice material and and not see-thru at all, it was just too much fabric around my tummy which didn't hide my imperfections, it made me look bigger.  Even  though I returned this, I'm giving it 4 stars because I think many ladies out there would love this top but perhaps go a size down."
4.0,"This is a lovely top; the fabric is very soft and comfortable, the color is a lovely greenish-blue. You could wear it with a pair of shorts or capris and make it casual, or a pair of nice jeans and dress it up. In the cooler months, you could put it under a jacket and continue to wear it. I took one star off for sizing, which doesn't seem to be correct.<br />I'd originally debated between a large and extra large.  I'm 5'5&#34; bust is 41&#34; (36DD), 33&#34; natural waist, and 41&#34; hips, firmly into their extra large territory which is 40-42 inch bust. I ordered the XL since that's what the sizing guide said and it was WAY too big. The arm holes gapped making my bra obvious at times (in the pictures, I don't have my bra pulled back like I would with this type of top) and it was visibly too large to wear.<br />I hope to get the smaller size and will update the review."
4.0,"The fit was not true to size and was tight, but still looked pretty good."
4.0,"My daughter has a few different colors, she loves them. They are very cute."
4.0,"This is soft and loose enough to wear with leggings. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it, is that it‚Äôs hard to tell the front from the back. I‚Äôve put it on backwards more than once, only to realize it immediately as it looks funny. A faux tag or something would be helpful."
4.0,I really like this skirt.  Many complements.  Just a bit too large.  I should have sized down.
4.0,"Love this dress for the price. It was beautiful for my small wedding. The bottom slip could have been longer though. It makes the part of the dress below the knee lighter than the rest.Overall, the quality is great and I would buy again."
4.0,"Nice material.  I like the fit, true to size."
4.0,"I should‚Äôve known better & sized up. M fits like a Xs/S. Zero-stretch waistband & VERY short. Other than that, it‚Äôs nice quality, doesn‚Äôt feel cheap."
4.0,Happy with the purchase item is as expected
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my mother. I thought it a little small, but she liked its size and definitely liked the decorative owl artwork. My only complaints are that no instructions came with it and that it came in a plastic pouch, no box. Keeps good time, so far."
4.0,I love it but it is a bit too small so i gave it to my 18 year daughter. I took the advice of one of the reviews which said it is true to size but i should have taken extra large. It is more less for teenagers.
4.0,"This is lovely, fits nicely and I get a ton of compliments. One star removed because it is super sweet through....<br />I had to wear a skin colored tank underneath it to even be able to wear it out."
4.0,It wasn't  big enough. Lucky I had a machinist fix it. We had gotten the biggest size available.
4.0,"As a new pacemaker patient, I wanted something to let people know my issue in an emergency. These bracelets aren't the prettiest, but they are the most useful that I saw. They can be seen easily and they are okay for washing hands, unlike the prettier ones you can buy. I gave it four stars instead of five because one of the bracelets is gray on gray (no colored letters to make it stand out and easy to read). I would order them again, though, but this gray one is worthless compared to the others in the pack. A different one would make this a 5/5 rating."
4.0,"Very Nice Item. Attractive Looking!! I gave four stars for now. Will be back after I see how durable, wear and tear it is and if this is good I will gladly give Five Stars. Seller was very prompt with delivery and description. Couldn't be happier. I would recommend to others and also buy again!!"
4.0,"Fits as expected, washes well, looks precious paired with the purple cape and super hero mask my daughter wore to her 100th day of school... She was so proud of her little outfit. Would recommend!"
4.0,I really like them. Just wish they were the same color one is a white and the  other  is a pink stone.
4.0,Cute and sexy. Soft.
4.0,The pockets are placed in an odd spot. I didn‚Äôt like the fabric. It felt heavy and not soft. The style was just ok and I feel like I could have gone a size up. Not my favorite dress.
4.0,"bought for a wedding but they are a lot smaller than I thought; however, wore them several times already!"
4.0,Just a luttle small and he is already small so I can't imagine someone who is not am a but good material
4.0,This is well made just very stiff. I am hoping it will losen up with use. But it is made well.
4.0,"As I read in the comments, I ordered a size larger than I normally wear. I wish I would have ordered 2. It is extremely light weight and cool. It‚Äôs great for working in the yard. I don‚Äôt work out in the gym but would say to order 2 sizes larger if you like the looser fit."
4.0,"Ordered a small and they fit great, nice and snug like I like them.  Except my daughter said ‚ÄúMom don‚Äôt wear those outside the house, you can see right through them!‚Äù  Don‚Äôt wear white underwear with black shorts ü§£"
4.0,"These mirrored sunglasses are cute and comfortable, but after wearing them fairly consistently for about a month, the mirrored surfaces are developing some deterioration spots. I also find that the mirrored surface makes them more difficult to see through than regular sunglasses, so I would not recommend them for driving or other activities where good visibility is crucial."
4.0,"They fit a little big for the described size, they are comfortable and have great style."
4.0,"Loved this outfit but even the smallest size is large on me im 5'4 ,105 lbs it swallows me"
4.0,"I am 5ft, 110 pounds, 32A bra.  Just a tad big up top, but doesn't show my bra or anything.  Length just barely grazes the ground."
4.0,"The description of these sunglasses say they can be worn by either men or women, but the sizing is more suited to women. They will fit well and look good on a variety of face/head sizes and shapes with a comfortable fit. I appreciated the added feature of them being polarized since most of the sunglasses I already own don‚Äôt have this feature. There is noticeably less glare when I wear the sunglasses. They also come in a basic but protective case."
4.0,"Came with a tiny hole in the seam where the pocket is sewn in, but the jacket is still wearable."
4.0,Cute and good quality but for very skinny feet. They were very tight on my son in the middle. Laces aren‚Äôt long enough to loosen to normal and still tie it.
4.0,"I liked that they fit, it was hard getting them on at first!"
4.0,The cross is beautiful but I didn't read enough to know it does not include a chain. The picture shows it with a chain. I had ordered several for gifts and had to run out and find chains that would fit through the opening and that was not easy.
4.0,"Small tear I had to sew, a side from that issue love it."
4.0,"Ok. The important size for the style to consider is the bust. I'm a 34DD and 5' and a 1/2"" tall. Straps are adjustable. Yay.<br />After adjustment, It comes to about 2"" above my knee and is sheer. After washing, the lace on this nightie is very soft and so comfy.<br />I'm a seamstress so inspite of the fact that this was TOO big - i took it in about 2.5inches from the back and brought the cleavage up about 1.25inches. It now somewhat supports a 34DD (39"") bust- being more fitted at the top. I'm back to buy another but going a size down - if its still too big, i'll take it in again and then go down another size. Until i have all the colors in this i like and they fit...- it's THAT cute on. But regardless of the size i will bring it up an inch or so in the front of the bodice for a little more support for the girls.<br />Vendor - will you PLEASE change your size chart to reflect the actual measurements this garment will fit?<br />Then we all won't have to do so many returns and we'll all be happy. Not everyone is a seamstress. It would be so refreshing.  I used to be in sales, but even a 12 year old (who wouldn't be buying this garment) would be able to look at the issue of vendor size charts and discern the vendor is costing himself $$$ by all the returns.  Having said that - if you like this style - buy it with confidence but go down a size at least. I'll update my review after i receive the next one. FYI - i love reviews that include measurements - given that people come in all shapes and sizes, it's so helpful. Hope this is informative enough that it's helpful to someone else."
4.0,"These head coverings are cute, stretchy, and comfy on my bald head. Only thing is they are super thin so it can get cold in the winter and I wear other coverings that look the exact same but a different material to keep my noggin warm. But I woke recommend these, they are fun to wear if you have cancer üëçüèº"
4.0,I love the way it looks. It isn‚Äôt irritating at all. Only downside is the color starts to come off after the first use due to moisture from your nose.
4.0,"I love maxi dresses, and this dress was a great dress and Amazing price. It‚Äôs just very long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù2 though, so I always have this problem."
4.0,These looked nice from Star Eyewear and were of good quality but did not fit my skull as expected. They are good for larger skulls.
4.0,Allergy saver! Actually purchased these to help keep the pollen out of my son‚Äôs eyes. He has severe seasonal allergies and these have been very helpful. The only reason I did not give them a five star rating is because these will fog up from time to time.
4.0,Got this for my great nieces and they loved them. Two issues though...the handle of the want is hollow therefore easy to bend. The other is the ribbon on the hem come loose very easily and had to be sewn back on. Otherwise they are really cute.
4.0,Very nice. The chain is cheap but the pendants are good. Once you change the chain it will be perfect. Got it for a friend as a gift. Will be looking at others
4.0,"This is a cute keyring with an encouraging message. The printing is nice, and the metal is finished with smooth edges. The split ring will hold several rings. It comes in a small box, which makes it easy to wrap. At $19.99, it is overpriced, though."
4.0,Cute for summer.
4.0,Great so far. Looks great in the garden. I give it four stars.  There's no more weed to pull up.
4.0,"I'm 5""5 and expected it cover my knees fully in all positions, but it was a bit shorter on then I wanted on the sides. It went above my knee on the side of my leg. Over all it has a nice materiel and stays soft even after washing. I definitely recommend."
4.0,"I wear 36 inch waist pants. I ordered the Large, and they fit great over my regular shorts. They seem well made and the price is good. Just what I needed for summer showers on the course.<br /><br />I have no idea why there is no sizing info listed. That is really annoying, as I had to guess which size to order. I would estimate the Large shorts fit approximately a 33 to a 37 inch pants waist wearer, over your other shorts. 38 and up probably need to look at the XL."
4.0,"Fits me very well! I'm 5'6 160 lbs and I ordered a large. Fits perfect. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's see through. I'm going to have to wear black tights under it so my underwear won't show. But, otherwise, I love it! It's even cuter than the picture! I'm wearing it to my Rehersal dinner for my wedding"
4.0,"Would have given 5 stars but it bunches a little at the armpit, still really nice!"
4.0,For some reason I thought I would get two pairs of socks with this order but after reading the description better I understand that it is ONE pair of socks that don't match. I have no clue why my son wanted a pair of mismatch socks but whatever. He really likes them. He is almost 12 years old and they are a little big on him but they go up to the bottom of his knee like he likes. You get one yellow sock with blue M and one blue sock with yellow M on it. They are thin and I wouldn't expect them to last for much longer than a year on a kid who wears them for basketball but in the end he really likes them.
4.0,It helps keep your mask tight on your face.
4.0,"I ordered the daisy color which looked cream online but when I received it it was more of a really light pink so I returned it BUT the quality of it was so surprising! Properly structured and well made, if the color was accurate I definitely would've kept it."
4.0,I had purchased a &#34;gem sonic&#34; jewelry cleaner that did not do nearly as well as this product. A few of my badly tarnished pieces did not clean up that well due to the fact that they are detailed with lots of grooves and it is impossible to get the cloth down into tiny grooves and crevices in really detailed tiny jewelry.
4.0,"had some before and could not find in store.  but guess what after ordering found some. they are great for around the house, not to tight or hot, just comfy."
4.0,"Love these! Only missed one overall star because I like my earrings to be super secure because I rarely take them off! These are super cute, great size and quality for price!"
4.0,nice. Enjoying them. Getting lots of compliments.
4.0,"My teen grandkid likes these a lot. She worn them often this summer. They fit well according to size ordered AND they cover her. They are a bit flouncy and if she doesn‚Äôt take notice, they could be seen up- just as a skirt. However, being aware keeps them from being problematic and it‚Äôs only while sitting down or lifting her leg very high etc.<br /><br />The material is a bit thin, but not see thru. I just wish it were a bit more thick and durable. I wouldn‚Äôt trust these shorts while wearing a pad etc they‚Äôd show the ‚Äúbulge‚Äù if the pad was big enough to create one, material is so thin it provides zero protection and they are so flouncy that seeing one‚Äôs panties could occur. So these wouldn‚Äôt be a favorite for a girl who has just started and isn‚Äôt comfortable with adjusting her clothing yet. (I went thru issues with this the summer b4 last. My grandkid would not of worn these shorts last year bc of the aforementioned. This year, she‚Äôs much more confident and uses tampons and those period panties. Yeah, TMI but it‚Äôs life. Get over it. I shared bc for those of you who can handle life, you understand the zillion reasons kids have to not wear the items you buy even if the like the articles of clothing. So, my share is for those who want to save themselves this hassle IF their kids are in this very awkward stage of leaving girl and being woman.<br /><br />The design is very cute. Especially, if you grew up in the 80‚Äôs. These will have a bit of a flash back feeling. The print and cut as well.<br /><br />Over all these are 4 stars bc of the material being a bit thinner than I‚Äôd hoped for and the shorts need to be cut a bit differently or be a tad longer to get that 5th star. I would still recommend this purchase to anyone who likes the print and style. The one lost star isn‚Äôt a deal breaker. Especially not for the price. These are super affordable and bc of their comfort level can easily bc night shorts and slept in for years after these go out of style. These are one of those articles of clothing that you‚Äôll get every penny of your money out of in use.<br /><br />Hope my honesty helps a few of the younger women out there to select a larger size (to make these a little longer and flouncier) or to select a different pair, while helping others feel confident in knowing these shorts will be enjoyable!<br /><br />Have a great summer!"
4.0,"The ninja suit worked perfectly! It didn‚Äôt come with any accessories but had the sash, mask, and outfit. Comfortable and thin material, stretched to make any part fit well. Would recommend but don‚Äôt think You are getting a full high quality ninja outfit. Was perfect for an inexpensive Halloween costume or playing ninjas with your kid!"
4.0,"This necklace is so fly! Its big just like in the picture around the models neck, and yes its plastic but I don't care because its just so darn pretty! The color is right own as depicted in the picture. The ONLY reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I haven't worn it yet and I don't know what its wear n' tear quality is as of yet, so when I start to wear it regularly; I'll update and state any color changes, broken pieces..etc. But other than that the necklace is a beauty and I recommend it to anyone who loves extravagant bold jewelry with a unique twist :)"
4.0,"The color is more purple when you actually get it, but other than that, I really like the quality of the wristband. So far, it has been used heavily and it does not have suffered much damage."
4.0,"I ordered this hat because I wanted to wear it to Alien:Covenant. I'm a huge fan of the franchise so I'm very happy with how the hat fit on me! I expected this hat to be TOO large on me, to the point that it is just going to be loose on my head. Although it doesn't fit as well as I want it to, the hat is a decent size that I can comfortably wear it.<br />The lettering is clear and people recognized it :)"
4.0,Not exactly what I wanted.  Not enough purple
4.0,"Starting to show some signs of wear, i.e., some stitching coming unraveled in the first couple of months."
4.0,Kept head warm and dry during steady rain for an hour in 35 degree temps. Works for me at NYC job.
4.0,I don't remember if this came in different sizes but this one is definitely too big for my head it would fit a guy great but for girls will need a smaller size. I usually wear a size 8 in hat so I ordered the large thinking it would be just right but I'm wrong. I love this style the fabric is nice and light and it is warm I did wear it outside on a 30 degree day so it does work just make sure you get the size for your head or even order one size down!
4.0,"Not as happy with the button on the side of the buckle, sometimes difficult to work."
4.0,It's good. A little tight but that's what's to be expected. Overall fits great
4.0,Pretty cool to change out the bands depending on what I'm wearing to work that day.  Makes it seem like I have a new watch. Even my daughter thought I bought a new watch.
4.0,Super cute...kind of tight on my 4 year old's head. Everyone stops and comments on how adorable it is where ever it is worn!
4.0,Nice shirt. I would suggest buying a size up. I have a small chest and I ordered a medium and the shirt fits snug.
4.0,"Beautiful piece, but very thin & lightweight. It turns easily and makes the loop it hangs from kink up."
4.0,"I'm not sure I would do anything active in these; but, they are perfect for sleeping in and fit as I expected. I love that the straps are adjustable!"
4.0,bought for my son so he can practice in something other than his hard cleats.  much more comfortable to practice in for a longer period of time on hardpacked ground than the cleats
4.0,"Great prop for Call of Cthulhu RPG, horror movie, or to ward off evil spirits from teenagers. The chain is a little fragile so if this is to protect you from the Old Ones, I‚Äôd suggest trading it out for a leather thong or a sturdier chain."
4.0,Cute top that I like to wear to work or out when I want to look cute but casual!
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; and 132lbs. The large fit perfect. It's super cute. The nice thing about the material is it shouldn't shrink. The downside is that it does have a sheen to it, which I think cheapens the look somewhat, but overall, worthy of the price."
4.0,The top is so cute! My new favorite.  The bottoms however are not...but that might be just because I'm not a huge fan of solid white. Purchased different bottoms.
4.0,"The slacks are good looking and seem to be well made; a big plus is that they have belt loops. I have the same problem with them that I have with virtually every pair of slacks and jeans that I own: too small in the hips, too big in the waist. I'm not disappointed, and I'm also not surprised. Once hemmed, they will be fine for work when worn with a belt."
4.0,"Finally had a chance to use this after it rained in my area and here are my thoughts.<br /><br />The jacket itself is great in a basic sense, after sitting in down pouring weather. It does the job well enough, your face will still get pretty wet despite the hood having an elongated cover to protect your face, this is only an issue for people with glasses as it is much more of a mist that would be hitting you rather than actual raindrops.<br /><br />The front pockets do exist but I would not put anything that you want to stay dry as the design allows water to get inside, after standing outside for a bit I went inside to check the pockets and sure enough they were pretty moist on the inside.<br /><br />If you have lived on a college campus then you would know these can be pretty commonplace for people who ride mopeds/scooters. This allows a moped rider to stay relatively dry along with their backpack/pockets. I can confidently say that this does the job. I rode around a few minute in the rain in my Suzuki FA50 with a small bag and full pockets and while the lower portion of my shorts were somewhat soaked, my pockets, shirt, and my bag were dry.<br /><br />Overall, pretty good basic rain coat that I would recommend. Please ensure that you check with sizing chart prior to ordering."
4.0,"I wanted a mid level Swiss watch and so I got one of these. I've been buying watches 40 years of all kinds. This was just another addition to the collection. It's a neat watch with some neat features. However at 53 years old I can't see the tiny items on the face of this watch even with my readers on. But so what. The way my life is the day and date and even the time have no relevance. At any rate I do like the watch. It comes with a stylus to adjust the day and time etc. it's a neat item that is included with the better Swiss watches that have chrono features. Most of the better Swiss have it. It's a neat addition. There are little buttons around the case of the watch so you can use the stylus to make the changes you need. Kinda fun. I changed the band the first day I had it because I don't like deployment buckles, which is what is included here. It's a good watch for the price. I did not buy it from Amazon, I bought it for less somewhere else. Anything Swiss is better than non Swiss. This is not the highest level that Maurice lacroix makes, but it ain't bad. They makes watches for 6k if that's what you want.  I can recommend  this watch. My next watch will cost more."
4.0,"These glasses are more round, even though they don't appear to be. They's also too small for my face, but I bought them for a friend so I hope they fit hers!! I love the colors and style of them, though."
4.0,"Great size, color, safety features and color changing feature. The only reason for the 4 stars is that I haven't been able to try it out yet, it is a Christmas gift!"
4.0,"Nice, fuzzy, warm. Not a winter pattern which is nice to see. Fits as expected but also has a little room to stretch."
4.0,"The dress is well made and the fabric and design is spot on with the photo. It's a thin velvet which makes it more breathable.. BUT, the sizing is wrong if you have any sort of bust. Pulling it over my chest was like trying to pull off a wet sports bra.. and pulling it up over my hind end was just as comical. Once it was on though it looked great... but... yet again.. the seam under the bust was killing me with no give. Have to return it sadly and won't have time to order a new one for my event.<br />Would still recommend... but lawdy, size up."
4.0,Perfect swimsuit!
4.0,"The design was beautiful, the material was soft and comfortable, but it was way too small. I‚Äôm curvy, I buy a size larger in tops to fit my DDD bust (16-18). Despite that, this did not fit around my torso comfortably. Return was easy, of course, with Amazon. I would have repurchased (2 sizes bigger) if it would‚Äôve been here on time for my vacation, though honestly with how small the XL fit I worry even the 3x would‚Äôve been too tight with only an extra 5‚Äù."
4.0,Not 5 stars because I think this should have a magnet instead of a pin.  Other than that great quality!
4.0,Great product! Protects the whole screen no lines and and very clear. One issue I have with the screen is there is an air pocket that won't go away causing you to have to push a little harder at that location but otherwise the screen is great
4.0,Perfect for dressing up and adding a little sparkle to your outfit.  They do fit a little tight.
4.0,Tight from the arms
4.0,"Much larger than I expected, but that was my fault for not looking at the measurements."
4.0,"I usually wear a size large but sized up from other peoples comments... XL was still too short in length (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù). They let me order an XXL in its place and it fits better! Top is a little baggy, but it‚Äôs super comfy!"
4.0,Had a little trouble keeping them on when I went up stairs but got use to them.  Cute and warm. Price was good.
4.0,I love this dress and the way it fits. It was just a little lower cut than I expected and I had to fasten it to my bra so you couldn't see it
4.0,Pretty comfy but the color bleed on to the white. I ordered my normal size a small and it fit just fine. If you want some room in the waist I would size up.
4.0,My daughter like this product
4.0,"It's much thinner then expected. I'm a little disappointed. I love the larace tunics, I have several of them. I wear a 3x and have a large chest, I don't like how it fits, when I tighten it, it fits like a maternity dress. The top part needs to be 5llonger, to compensate for larger chested women. But it's soft, comfy, and has pockets, so I'll keep it."
4.0,My daughter is 2yrs ans weighs 26pounds.
4.0,"Great value.  My daughter wore this to her birthday party and loved it!!  The quality of the material is just ok, but I would expect that for the price."
4.0,This is a sturdy bag that should last many yrs. However it's not 5 stars due to awkward design. The top flap uses too much material ... making storage space smaller. There are two zippered compartments plus unzippered pencil pocket inside main compartment. Minus 1 for shoulder strap which is too flimsy to support a bag of this size. Best thing ... this doesnt smell toxic like many Chinese-made products so you dont have to worry about health risks. Received free sample in exchange for honest review
4.0,Too cute.  The perfect size.
4.0,"Very nice shirt, I am on the shorter side, so it fits me more like a tunic, but still satisfied, it is stretchy for those with larger arms."
4.0,I know its plated but was hoping it would last longer than a week of constant wear before it wore off on the inside. For the price though I really can't complain.
4.0,"I love the dress, but I am normally a 6-8 depending on cut and style, I had to send back the medium and get a large.<br />I am 37, 25 37"
4.0,The lute works very well as a representative pin for the real instrument. You can tell it is a lute and not a guitar.
4.0,"I mean, it‚Äôs mostly fine. Well made, fur is soft, it fit. But it‚Äôs not exactly what I expected. Only one of the hanging paws actually had the paw pads, and the zipper on the arm doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. But, for a $20 hood I‚Äôm totally okay with that."
4.0,They were all smashed and could not get them to suction to the face....leaked terrible.....grandkids were really disappointed with them
4.0,"Great shirt for the price. Arms were much too small for me, however. I am 5'7&#34; 140 lbs, I ordered a medium. I do have long limbs, but this shirt just simply did not fit the length of my arms (which is not typical for medium sizes), fit great everywhere else."
4.0,The material seems kind of weak? Almost see through thin. But the thinness is great for this summer weather.<br />It feels like it could rip very easily.
4.0,bought these as a party novelty item and the kids loved them.
4.0,"Leather craft, a beefy ring of good quality"
4.0,for the price is ok
4.0,"My son is really happy with this headband. It was pricey for what it is, however the price likely doubled when they added the Golden State Warriors logo to it.  It is durable and well made.  The headband is large enough to fit most heads."
4.0,So comfy and soft!
4.0,"Super soft, stretchy and stylish, but they run small and don't fit me. They do make your butt look good though :)"
4.0,Looks nice for the price... The smaller piece sticks out from your ear if you don't have it just right
4.0,For Peggy carter cosplay
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; and often the bane of my existence is finding clothing long enough to be comfortable. This dress fits the bill AND it's comfortable AND it's adorable. The only issue I call attention to is the fabric in the skirt and how it flows on ladies with larger hips and a butt. The fabric is very structured and the model in the picture appears to be holding it down to give a slimmer appearance. It definitely flares out to create a full skirt. Most of the time it looks really cute, sometimes it makes me look heavier than I am. I'll definitely keep it an probably do some alterations to help keep the skirt in its place. In my opinion, this dress is worth giving a chance!"
4.0,"Good, but color is slightly different than in picture. Good, cheap sunglasses."
4.0,Very comfortable but thin material .
4.0,"I love Birki's!  Unfortunately, this Barbados style did not work well for me.  I'm used to the Arizona style with a much more flexible sole, and this particular style was too stiff for me.  The arch support was also not as comfortable as my Birki Arizona's.  Unfortunately, I had to send this pair of Barbados shoes back to the seller.  But they handled the return wonderfully, so I highly recommend the seller."
4.0,"I bought it as a present for a young lady, I think is a nice necklace."
4.0,Love it.  Can‚Äôt wear a bra with it because my boobs are big and it is pretty tight but still looks good!
4.0,Ordered navy and burgandy and black. Got royal blue and red. Still very happy! 20 weeks pregnant hoping the fit and flare works till 40 üòÇ Then plan to rock them post partum! They are so light and sleek. Very stylish and forgiving with leggings and a decorative scarf. They cover crotch and butt areas nicely.
4.0,I‚Äôm taller so this wasn‚Äôt long enough for me but the quality and material was nice
4.0,"These were larger than I thought they would be but since the waist is stretchy, I can still wear them.  The material is soft and the color is true to what is displayed.  However, I'm 5'6"" tall and I have to him them at least 2-3 inches."
4.0,keeps you snug..
4.0,I bought two of these shirts and they are a little tight around the arms and the shirt isn‚Äôt as soft. I bought similar shirts from the Nike outlet and they are softer and fit better. My biceps are a little larger but the medium in the other Nike shirt felt fine. So this one is better for narrower arms.
4.0,Very nice BUT it took a very long time to get  it. Way too long!
4.0,Fits perfect<br />The sleeves are too short tho....  But than again im 5'11&#34;
4.0,Quality construction and large enough to fit my glasses and the clip on in one case.
4.0,Had to get a slightly bigger size than what I expected but that‚Äôs also because we wanted the oversized hoody look. The material is ok. The picture is beautiful and stands out
4.0,"A little pricey, but good quality."
4.0,It's very pretty and looks even better in person. Great price
4.0,"Good quality and sizing. Delivered quickly, and good customer service. My daughter gets tons of compliments. Not very warm though."
4.0,Light and comfey! I like everything I get from Herou
4.0,Took forever to get. But super cute
4.0,"They don't really glow in the dark for long.  Lasted a day or two then, didn't hold it's glow.  However, they are quite stout for a shoelace."
4.0,Very pretty. Very shiny hardware. Expensive looking. Well made. I bought at Macy's on sale for $87 then I saw it on Amazon through Zappos for $58 so I ran back to Macy's as fast as I can. I would never spend $145 on a key chain/fob but $58 was reasonable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it really looks nothing like the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. But I still love it.
4.0,"This was ordered as a gag gift for my best friend who has a very irreverent sense of humor.  When she opened it she loved the dainty design and cross like feature, but it took a minute for her to look a bit closer and see what the writing was.  Once she realized what it said she howled with laughter, and it is now one of her favorite pieces of jewelry.  This was a huge success."
4.0,"Quite comfortable on wrist , stylish too"
4.0,I bought this dress so I can breastfeed and wear a dress at the same time. ordered large and it fits me perfectly. hides the mommy tummy very well and I can easily breastfeed my son.
4.0,They're nice and thin and I've put them in the washing machine and dryer a few times without any problems. They were a little tight when I first got them and I wear a size 10 1/2.
4.0,Cute dress... As far as the pale yellow color it is a little see through as others stated but I put a tank under it. I felt like the sizing chart and what they put in the description for sizing was conflicting so I went with what was recommended by others as to purchase the size that your child wears now and it fit perfect. My daughter wears a size 12 and I bought the extra large.
4.0,"It runs a little big but I‚Äôm sure that washing will address that issue, however if you‚Äôre short (like I am) you‚Äôll either have to hem it or tie a knot on the side so you don‚Äôt kill yourself by tripping on the end of your skirt"
4.0,"Got this for a comicon cosplay, but after reading the reviews I realized I needed to get a lot bigger size- and I'm glad I did, I'm 5' 10"" and I wanted to be about floor length. I got a 4XL and it barely brushes the floor. But the fabric is good, and it's good quality in general. The sizes just run way small."
4.0,"It's seems that most people who purchase this have small heads, as do I.  The reason for buying is so we can have a normal pony tail or bun.  If we wear a regular hat, the pony tail sits way to low.  I've noticed that regular hats for other women who have normal head size fit well enough to have a normal pony tail or bun that's high enough to not sit on your neck.  Since my head is too small for a regular hat, I wanted something like this product.  It works alright.  But it's too large and there are gaping holes at the top between my head and the hat and at the back.  Thankfully this can be adjusted to fit at the back like a normal hat, but it still sits low on my ears or has a space between the hat and my head at the top."
4.0,Love it.....its a little too long but that can be adjusted.
4.0,"Looks good on, not very heavy but nice for the price"
4.0,"First of all who really cares about TRex arms intellectual property, if you get a great deal. My Buddy had the TRex version and it's okay but not better than the Petac! So who in their right mind wants to pay $100 more for virtually the same product?..Not this guy ü§£üëà!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the general design of the straps. They are a bit difficult to get on..no biggy. So overall, stop the whining girls, and buy this<br />good productü§£üëç"
4.0,"I am 5'9"" 185lbs 36/38B I have this in the XL and it fits me like the advertisement photos.  I don't usually prefer shirts that snug but this one is very comfortable.  Enough give in the material for my arms/shoulders to move without pulling the material or making me feel like I can't move my arms at all.  The material is a bit thin but it is comfortably non-itchy and not super heavy.  I really like this as a night shirt aka PJ top."
4.0,Its a nice dress but runs little off measurements. Overall It a great purchase
4.0,This is a nice hat but too tight on the head. I opened the rear seem and added elastic to give comfort to the fit.
4.0,But big but great otherwise
4.0,One of the largest bags came with only one zipper instead of two?
4.0,Nice and heavy metal....
4.0,"I'm a juniors small and it fits great. I bought the pink which is a silky material, sorta see through, and def s small in size. It is flowy at the hips and high-low in cut. It's cute but I'd rather have a shirt that isn't see-through."
4.0,"Adorable little earrings, exactly as I hoped they would be. Only issue I had was that I had to replace the backs they were delivered with. They were way too small, I had to use a towel and a good deal of force to remove them before I cleaned them. Overall really happy though!"
4.0,"This outfit is adorable but runs small. I am 5'7 170lbs and typically fit a 14 but the large is def more of a 12. I've been losing weight so I'll hold onto it but there isn't as much stretch as I thought there would be and don't want to mess up the zipper squeezing in, lol<br />But the fabric is good and the fit is super cute!"
4.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend and I to use on a cruise excursion where we were required to wear helmets.  I'm not an avid biker, and so I'm not sure how they would hold up for long-term wear or use.  But for the price...we didn't get lice!"
4.0,"The sizes on Amazon make the size seem a bit off, you should definitely check out the actual Capezio webite to get the sizes & measure your dancer. Capezio leotards run on the smaller size so purchase accordingly. My daughter is 7.5 and wears a small in tops and a 7 in bottoms, she is pretty tall and thin. We purchased a L in this because she outgrew the size under it already."
4.0,I like my new bracelet charm.
4.0,"Very cute, but the bow on the headband broke apart within the first day or two of wearing it (only worn maybe a couple hours). I managed to sew it back together, but would be nice to not break out my sewing kit for a brand new product... Gloves and hat are thick which is nice if you live in colder climates"
4.0,i returned these since they were extremely large for a 1x.  Nice weight of material..and reordered a large.... stand by for next review
4.0,"It worked well for carrying my passport and cards, but the pen holder made it a bit hard to close. I wish that it had a wrist strap to make it easier to carry with me. Overall, it was a good wallet for the money, and if the company comes out with a wristlet, I would purchase one!"
4.0,"These are cute yet smaller than pictured, which isnt a huge deterrent but I may have kept looking for something larger, if I knew this info."
4.0,I found the shorts are too small I am returning and purchasing a size up.  They are so cute<br />The unfortunate part is I have to pay for the return even though it said free returns when it was purchased
4.0,"Car, Mail box and Entrance Keys"
4.0,The material is very soft and comfortable. The cut is kind of like scrubs.
4.0,This seems to be a great hat so far.  Large enough for my 11 year old and the perfect answer for keeping her waist-length hair away from her face while playing outside.
4.0,fits well but I am still on the quest for a wireless bra that not only lifts (this one does) but also separates which this one does not
4.0,"I love this bonnet. I only thing I don‚Äôt like is that it doesn‚Äôt have a drawstring so you can‚Äôt really tighten it, but it‚Äôs still good."
4.0,Quality could be better but it does the job.
4.0,"These are beautiful cuff links. I can't deny that. I also love the fact that these are matte black in finish instead of silver/chrome. However, they are way over priced. They do come in a nifty box, though."
4.0,It's so cute. Will this fit an iPhone 6??
4.0,"Got it as a first Father's Day gift. The only issue I had was the shirt material, for the onesie, it was t-shirt material and it was hard to get it over my baby's head. Otherwise the onesie still fit (bought newborn). Large shirt fit well as a large but I'm afraid it may shrink in the wash."
4.0,Very nice design. Bought as Christmas present. Needed something that ran without a battery. Recipient likes it very much.
4.0,"This was beautiful! I bought it as a Christmas gift for my aunt, and she loved it. It came in nice packaging and had instructions for use."
4.0,"I have bought yaluxe wallets before and have always been happy with the quality. Now after buying this handbag, I'm also super happy! The bag comes with two straps that you can snap on and off to make it either a shoulder or cross body bag. For each strap, you can adjust the length because there are multiple snaps. I love this feature because I go back and forth between shoulder and cross body and I didn't want the crossbody to be too long on me. The side pockets are convenient, but small. I can fit my cell phone in a side pocket, but nothing else will fit and the top of my phone sticks out (see pic). I put my keys in the other side pocket. Although there are two separate zippered sections, the wall between these sections is thin. The bag does not hold it's shape.....it's slouchy unless you have it full. I like this style though. You can fit tons of stuff in this bag.....even with all my items in it, I still have plenty of space. I have 2 young kiddos so I like knowing I can fit random kids stuff (e.g., water bottles, wipees, etc) in there if needed.<br />I included pics in different lighting to give a better sense of the brown color.<br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does come with a strong stench as other customers have mentioned. So, I aired it out for 2 days and tucked scented dryer sheets in the pockets while it was airing out. That did the trick.<br /><br />**Update- after several weeks of using this bag, the snaps on the crossbody broke on one side so I could no longer use it as a cross body........ Very disappointing!"
4.0,I was told by someone who has the album that you get both the CD AND a DVD. I looked where the DVD was supposed to be and it was missing from the album. Also the actual CD case was worn and the CD was dusty and kinda scratched. So kinda pissed I spent forty bucks on a rip-off.
4.0,"This dress is so cute and quite scandalous, but in a good way. Only wish it was a tiny bit longer, was constantly having to pull it down but other wise I loved it."
4.0,I like the color and print
4.0,"One of the straps broke the second time I put it on which was a bummer, but i was able to hand sew it back and fix it. I'll probably also preemptively secure the little jewel on the top between the cups as its sewn on pretty loosely and I'm afraid it'll fall off.  Other than that I love this suit! It's super cute and looks great!! I ordered the medium (i'm usually an extra small in US sizing. I'm 5'1 and 100lbs ) and it fit well!"
4.0,"Great dress! If my stomach was smaller, it wild fit even better. I purchased a medium and probably should have bought a large. It fit the purchase for communion Sunday. Love the length"
4.0,My grandson has been taking karate lessons and I know he will love the headband.  Nicely made for the price.
4.0,I wasn't thrilled about the material but it fits perfectly
4.0,It was pretty small. More for like a charm bracelet
4.0,The neck is kind of weird.
4.0,Super adorable.  She wore this on her birthday and again for her birthday party.  Then the iron on number 1 started coming off.  It's probably at least partially because it's on a leotard type stretchy material.
4.0,"Super cute, but a bit small even though I followed the size guide. Feathers fell off immediately, and the material feels a bit scratchy, but super cute."
4.0,"That heart hurt like a b**** to put in my daith. The moon is cute and simple to put in. The only complaint I have is the clips on the circular ones are difficult to open, let alone find once in your ear."
4.0,Great shirt!!!!! Will is a little hazy but can still read it!!!!üòÅüòÄ
4.0,"I chose the white hat with black tie.  It looks lovely in person, and I like to wear it whenever I am out in the sun.  I even wear it when I'm wading in the pool, watching over my kids play.  It provides nice shade and protects my face from further sun damage."
4.0,"I was pleasently surprised that these turned out to be not only cute, but high quality as well.  My four year old loves them.  I would order up as the backs are a bit snug.  But I like how he can get them on by himself.  My only issue is that the bottoms are so cushioned that his foot bed sort of shifts over to the side.  So his foot bed isn't directly over the slipper bottom if that makes sense.  But ended up being a great Christmas gift for him at a good price."
4.0,"Great bag! Perfect travel or diaper bag, however zipper broke on the first day I used it. I would have given 5 stars otherwise."
4.0,Great for your shirts! Keeps me looking sharp in my uniform!
4.0,Nice material. Fit well. Did shrink jus a little when washed.
4.0,Beautiful piece however a couple of rhinestones and one of the links fell off during shipping but nothing that can't easily be fixed.  I still love it!
4.0,I ordered 2 pair black/blue My son feel right in love with the sneakers as soon as i open the box..The colors are very bright they're great at night ..but lights can also be seen in the day light..
4.0,"Quit buying nike, this one is cheaper and softer!"
4.0,"I wear it every day and it's been a year or so since I got it. I have to wear it a certain way so the metal doesn't rub against my wrist bone. Also, if I clean it with hot water, the black coating comes off in a powder. I wouldn't buy it again because of how difficult and messy it is to clean, but I continue to wear it because it's the best band I have at the moment."
4.0,"This was a really nice skirt, loved the soft material.  It is very breathable for the hot summers!  I did think it was on the smallish side for an XL, but it is stretchy so you don't really notice it too much.  The length was perfect, right to my ankles (I'm 5'6&#34; ). Communication from the seller was really fast when I had a questions.  I did receive a small discount on this skirt for my honest opinion."
4.0,"I was satisfied with these sunglasses. They truly are polarized as the description notes. They are pretty comfortable and not overly large as some Wayfarer-type glasses can be. They definitely have a light/cheap feel to them, but that's not too surprising given the price. They are certainly nice than super-cheap or freebie glasses, so I would recommend as an extra pair to keep in the car."
4.0,"I don't really look at myself as plus size, but that's the hosiery size I am. This product fits as I expected it would, which is right at my knee. I got these for a costume, but they're knit just like socks and will help keep my legs warm in the winter - so much better quality of a product than the striped stockings you'd find at a halloween store."
4.0,Great quality and the color was just as pictured. I took away one star because they run big and look baggier than any other leggings we have in the same size.
4.0,Fit great and feel wonderful although the fabric is a little lighter than I thought it would be...overall comfy !!
4.0,"The finishing of the watch seems nice, and the choice of movement means it should be nice and reliable for years. Overall it feels a little lighter than I would have liked, but isn't light enough to feel very cheap. The bracelet rattles a little, and was a pain to size since the links were trying to bend where they connect. It ultimately broke the pin of the included sizing tool and I had to use a nicer one I have.<br /><br />Additionally, the bracelet is pretty long. I removed all the links and it just fits my wrist, about 7.5-7.75"". But once it's fitted, it feels nice on the wrist and feels secure."
4.0,Love this watch. I have small wrists and it stays on perfectly. The numbers are big so you won't have a problem telling time.
4.0,"I ordered these to replace some old sweatbands I needed to dispose of.  I sweat so much when I work out that sweatbands are pretty much a necessity.  These are a little thinner than I'd like but they do absorb a good amount of sweat.  Also, they can withstand a good washing in my washing machine.<br /><br />For the price, they're completely worth it.  However, they're no replacement for name brand sweat bands (Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, etc.)"
4.0,"Vey lightweight and comfortable.  Not extremely supportive, so i wouldnt wear it on a day when I would be pretty active. But great for a relaxing day by the pool or beach."
4.0,"These are very thin, you can see through them but they are the right length for what my son wanted."
4.0,it took some time to adjust to the rubber-band who keep your feet in place - its getting better!
4.0,"The quality is ok, they look a bit more plastic cheap in real life. Beware that the glasses are really huge!"
4.0,Thinner than I expected so I have to double as a mask.  Slide right off my head when I try to wear as a headband.  But beautiful colors and very soft
4.0,Awesome hat! My son loves Sriracha sauce and wears this hat often.
4.0,While looking for a replacement shoulder strap pad I bought a couple of different models. The bulky feel of the raised cushions and the tendency for the pad to roll on the strap caused me to select another vendor. Don't get me wrong as I do have plans for this pad as it will go on my garment bag to replace the original which feels like hard plastic digging in to my shoulder.
4.0,The straps were a little right and uncomfortable for my 5 year old. Otherwise it was a nice looking product.
4.0,Gorgeous blouse and I love the color but it does fit smaller than expected. I am normally a large and I order a xxxl and it was just a titch to tight on the bottom portion for my liking. But I do like it so I ordered the next size up.
4.0,Kinda cheap looking and really big but overall good for the price.
4.0,I really like this dress. It is perfect for work and can be dressed up or down.
4.0,"I use this bag for my laptop and work folders. It's a great color, and has the perfect amount of distressing.  I like the closure, although it's a little irritating when I'm trying to keep it fastened."
4.0,"Love TSwift, and all the songs these necklaces represent, so was interested in how this necklace would look. $16.99 is inexpensive so I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, so the gift box was a really nice surprise. It comes in a bag‚Ä¶ in a box‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not sure why. But it‚Äôs definitely gift-worthy.<br />The gold is almost garish- it‚Äôs soooo yellow and bright - but for a big concert night (any age) or a pre-teen Swiftie, this is a fun and beautiful way to celebrate!"
4.0,I I like that it was lightweight. It was used to lounge around the house .
4.0,"Awesome glove. The liners weren't the best quality, but the the glove itself it a nice--warm, stylish, and true to size (make sure to measure your hand). The glove isn't waterproof and the liners were faulty, thus the four starts. A little pricey, but not too bad for the money."
4.0,Nice fibrant colors.. lots of compliments... Only complaint is thick enough to wear without slip however tends to be a little warm therefore sticks to legs
4.0,I am a size 10 - 12 and I ordered a size large. It fits fine. Not to tight and smooths out my tummy roll in my tight fitting dresses. Will be great for dressing up.
4.0,I have no complaints on this pair of base layer  nicely priced accurate description and fast shipping
4.0,Good fit and good price
4.0,"Pros: good looking<br />Cons: no Pagani box, came in a cheap<br />box"
4.0,"After a month the the vest seems very well made and I am happy with the product and that's saying a lot, my only gripe is the zipper is on the wrong but if you can  get past that , it seems to be well worth the price."
4.0,"Good quality for the money.  Sets up nicely, and looks well made."
4.0,I like the way the metal looks.
4.0,This shirt is excellent and fits well.  he accessories are great.  The only negative is that there are only four studs supplied when it should be five.  The set is well worth the price and I would recommend it.
4.0,"Updated review<br />Liked the quality of the watch and fast delivery.<br />After receiving the watch, I tried to paired with the IPhone, but I couldn't.  I wrote to the seller, TWICE, in a period of 7 days, asking for help, but got no word from them.  I found the answer I needed,  from tutorials in the Internet.<br />I expect from a business, at least someone, (doesn't have to be an expert), that can take a few minutes and answer the messages, doubts or questions.<br />Very good watch, but the seller, not so good.  After the sale, doesn't worried for the client.<br />That was MY EXPERIENCE.  BEWARE!!!"
4.0,"Love these, they are pretty true to size, the only thing I didn't care for is after a few weeks the cheap insole inside moved, but that can easily be replaced."
4.0,Great product feel and fit are excellent!  Only complaint I have is that the stitching at the y came undone on one of mine so it rides back and forth.
4.0,"I would say they fit &#34;ok&#34;. I think they are a bit too wide for me a regular 9 women, I would have like a more snug fit. Otherwise Very ccomfortable anti-fatigue very cushiony."
4.0,"Super great. For a week. Then the metal clip at the end fell off. Sent an email to the company, but never heard back. UPDATE: lacezz contacted me and offered to refund the product AND send a free replacement.  Fingers crossed these last longer than the first pair"
4.0,Because i bought a size bigger thinking would be tight but no I will be buying my Medium in other colors as this dress is so comfortable and stretchy. Really glad I got it.
4.0,Inrealky love the time piece! Just shipping took long time!
4.0,Order 1/2 size up.
4.0,Fits well and the hubby loves it.
4.0,"Pros: Dress seems well sewn.  Nice subtle shimmer to the fabric to make it stand out.  Color is accurate to picture (we got the green).  Straps were adjustable.  Fit true to size, some give to the fabric if you are unsure.<br /><br />Cons: Dress was very sheer.  You could hold it up and see through both layers.  She wore spanx and a tube top underneath."
4.0,"They are very pretty. The backing doesn't seem to grip as tight as they should, but otherwise great purchase for the money."
4.0,"The only thing is I will tack the bow down, other than that the skirt is nice."
4.0,runs a little tight
4.0,Got this for my wife on xmas.  She says it is comfortable and loves the lights.  I had to return the first one.  The battery would not charge.  Second one is working.  The lights are pretty cool looking.  The button on the battery pack switches the animation of the lights.  The battery pack is pretty small and fits in a pocket on the inner side of the beanie.
4.0,"Pretty and straight forward. The flower slightly rubs the wrist making it a little uncomfortable,  however, it is nice and seems to be pretty durable.<br /><br />As it has started to break in,  it has become more comfortable."
4.0,"I Like the purse but the zipper is  hard to work with. If you open the zipper all the way, it's hard to get it back on the zipper track to close the purse."
4.0,"Since it came rom China I knew to order a bigger size but the person I ordered it for is VERY petite, & I ordered her a 2XL"
4.0,"Soo cute and good quality<br />But its runs small , which is good for me"
4.0,"The shirt is a decent shirt. A little on the thin side, and easily wrinkles, but not a deal breaker. I haven't put it in the dryer, as it looks like it would shrink horribly. Overall, I would purchase this shirt again."
4.0,Cute dress and made well.
4.0,Love the material! Just Wish it was a little longer! I'm 5'8 D chest and got the XL and it's like 2 inches to short!
4.0,I like the way it's made the picture well and I disliked house then it was thank you
4.0,"I am tall, but they get the job done AKA look nice."
4.0,"Nice belt, love it"
4.0,"Comfortable and warm. They run a little large on me.  I almost always get large women's gloves but these are sort of loose.  They are so comfy, I don't care, and figure that for really, really cold days there's room for a liner too."
4.0,"Nice quality sports bras, supportive but not too tight, fit true to size and shipping was very fast. Only thing I don‚Äôt care for are the pad inserts that are removable, I just took them out rather than trying to get them positioned correctly every time I wear a sports bra."
4.0,"Seems like good quality. They are a bit too big for my 9 month old, and he has a large head. I thought they would adjust down more. They do the job though."
4.0,"I love the flattering fit, and that it came just as pictured.  I appreciated that it was folded inside out to protect the lace.  This dress is actually the second one (I returned the first one because it was too small).  The back dips down to the bra strap, and is not pictured (wasn't when I ordered).  So excited to go to the O.U.R. gala in this gown!  Thank you!"
4.0,"cheep, could of been biger"
4.0,Knock off of the expensive Porsche glasses it works well very pretty but very bridle and fragile you need to take care of it i can‚Äôt just throw it in my purse and it came with no glasses case!
4.0,Great quality and fit. A place for everything.
4.0,"So far. I have only had it a few days. The purchase and shipping was just as promised. I made the choice to pay the high price for the replacement band[which *does* have a resin-type buckle, which is like the original, which I think will help it last longer than the metal buckle that had been a repair] because this is the best watch in the world, so far.  Read all the reviews of this watch- we are for real."
4.0,"I like wearing visors when I hike/walk, and with the heat in So. Cal. I get a little sweaty. I wanted a visor to help keep moisture out of my face, and these do that. The only thing I'm not thrilled with, they are a little flimsy. I try to shape them like my ball caps, but they don't stay in shape. But not bad overall."
4.0,I use it as a face covering and I get a ton of compliments. Happy with my purchase.
4.0,We were Konan and pain for Halloween and it worked great for our cosplay!
4.0,They are on time and packaged well. They are just as shown in the photos. The size is correct. My girls LOVE them. Could recommend to others.
4.0,"These shirts fit as expected in the torso area, but they are short in the arms. I also didn't feel much of a compression per se, but I still like the shirts to work out in. I ordered size small."
4.0,Order a med for daughter who is a size small. Perfect fit and comfortable.
4.0,"My daughter is an anima fan.  She watched this series and has been begging me to watch it.<br /><br />As an avid cyclist, I'm not much into sitting around and watching cartoons.  But the motivate my daughter to ride more we bought matching jersey's for a organized ride.<br /><br />The jersey is pretty cool.  It definitely runs small.  In American jerseys, I always wear a medium.  This jersey I bought the XL based on user comments.  This was a very wise move.  The XL fits good.  I'd like it a little tighter, but I simply worried a large would be like shrink wrapping myself.<br /><br />The material and worksmanship seem ok. Only a couple rides will tell.<br /><br />I fairly certain, the jersey will pique peopes curiosity.  Someday I hope to GE able to enjoy the series and tell the story to onlookers, much like my daughter dos for me."
4.0,"Great fun styles, and once you get them on very comfortable and supportive."
4.0,These were the first masks I purchased. The run a little small and worked bestbon my middle schooler.<br />I like the insert which you need to use because although the valve makes it easier to breathe it can also admit virus.<br />I would not buy a mask with a valve. When I visited the clinic they made me piece paper mask over thus mask
4.0,Very comfortable to lay around in.
4.0,Part of a costume but my daughter still wears it.
4.0,"Left this necklace in my pocket on laundry day, and it wound up in the washing machine. The medallion itself was fine, but the connector the string threads through broke off. I filed down the jagged piece still attached, and now I have a spooky octopus coin/charm.<br /><br />P.S. Everyone who see you wearing this will say ""Hail Hydra,"" regardless of why you actually bought it."
4.0,I cut the backing strap to make it less bulky. I'll have to wait and see how well it weathers.
4.0,"Even though I recieved this product for free, this is my honest opinion and experience with this product.<br /><br />Lovely boxers that are pretty comfortable and have that classic band around the hips. These feel just like Calvin Kleins, so if you want the cheaper option I recommend these.<br /><br />Ran into only one problem with this product. The thighs are really tight on both me and my friend. Not too uncomfortable but noticable. So possibly size up."
4.0,Well made product good compartments . Use it to carry my personal stuff.
4.0,This top runs a little tight. I ordered an extra large because I normally wear a size 12. This is a tighter fitting top - it's not a t-shirt.<br />I will live with the tighter fit as I am a cat lover and like the shirt
4.0,"These pants fit as expected.  They are light-weight, but not see through.  They are soft.  These are a very good buy for the price!"
4.0,This fits and looks exactly like the photo. It will not wrinkle and wrap shirts/dresses are great for travel. The colors are vibrant. The only negative is the fabric is a little too polyester-feeling. It's warm so not a NY summer choice.  But I suppose that's what you give up to have no wrinkles. It looks great on.
4.0,"Understated fashion of a slim tie, look great with my Hermes and Burberry skinny ties, plus the fact this company it GREAT to work  with, I loved the simple clean look, it's that detail that makes it work, and you must have sterling silver, I would not have less"
4.0,These Glasses Are So Beautifully Made && Delivery Was Pretty Fast To Me I Would Recommend These If You Want A Nerdy Look.
4.0,Love these belts ... have several
4.0,"It's very similar to what I thought it would be.  I wish it was 100% cotton, cooler, and thinner."
4.0,Very pretty and fits neat.
4.0,Arrived quickly and in good shape. It fits securely on the head and is very cute! Looking forward to wearing it on my next beach trip.
4.0,"Very much what I expected but was rather large for my head and kept falling off. Would recommend adding some sort of strap. All in all, would recommend as basic costume purchase."
4.0,"Very nice purse. I love all the pockets,  it holds a lot and is very cute. Does not look cheap. My only complaint is that the shoulder strap is cracking along the edges and I've only had it a month."
4.0,"So I bought this for my friends bridal shower... and it this weekend. The object of the gift is to buy something you would wear yourself and she would have to guess who bought... based on personalities, well I would wear this item however I didn‚Äôt know that the black and white sleeper had bats and spiders as design... I thought it was moons and stars... ugh who wants to go to bed on their honeymoon with something that has bags and spiders as a design .smh I hope that she likes it. Over all the material is good it has some stretch to it and it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap... and it‚Äôs still a nice fit I would still wear..."
4.0,Well I bought this shirt for my husband. It popped up under a men's shirt search so I assumed it was a men's shirt. This is NOT an adult shirt. Thankfully we have children who can grow into it. The shirt is seemingly good quality. 4 stars because of the unclear labeling for youth vs adult size.
4.0,"I love this. Bottoms are beautiful and accentuate curves (36-30-42). Im a DDD in cup size and the XL was a joke no support, boobs falling out from the bottom, but from the reviews I was expecting that.."
4.0,"Beautiful design!  Bought for as a bridesmaid dress, this will be perfect for a one or two event dress.  If you look at the reverse of the dress you can see it is not the greatest quality, but it wears wonderfully.  I'm 5'4&#34; and the dress is a bit too long even in my 2&#34; heels.  The zipper is cheaper, but I have had no issues if you zip slow and steady.  Great buy.  Highly recommend if you need an inexpensive formal."
4.0,"If I have one complaint, it's that this wallet is too thin! Sometimes I need to be careful taking other stuff out of my pocket; it can drag the wallet along. I've almost lost the wallet this way."
4.0,"I bought this waist trainer for my postpartum belly that I have and I'm loving it, its helping me loose the weight faster. it's so comfortable and breathable with this stretchy material I can wear it all day long, the only reason I'm not giving a 5 star it's because one of the steal bones poped out already and I've only had it for about 2 weeks now. Other than that I'm glad it wasn't pricy at all. Also I weight 200 pounds and got the 2xl and it just fit a little tight but after having it on for a few minutes I can't really feel it, it doesn't bother me at all"
4.0,"I bought this for my 92 year old blind mama who I wheel around in a &#34;transport chair.&#34; I just wanted for her to have a &#34;wrap&#34; to put around her shoulders because it is such a hassle to get a coat on and off. She isn't sitting on this and she LOVES the pockets to put her ever-present tissue in! The embellishment on the pockets makes it look nicer -- fleece is not really a high class fabric but it is warm. The double layer with the top part folded back adds warmth. It doesn't really lay down but that's to be expected because it is a flat piece of material without any seams or darts to give it any shape. I guess that is why I gave it 4 stars, and the fleece material. It's not a fine garment but it does just fine. And the price was very reasonable."
4.0,"Love the amount of pockets and space this small bag has. Side pockets are a bit snug but can accommodate tub lipsticks and misc. small accessories. Inside has plenty of space for phone, cards, etc. but is tight when closed. I had to take my phone case off (galaxy s4) for it to fit comfortably. Side pockets won't fit large phones, fits my s4 perfectly. Great for date nights, weddings, or when you don't need to carry much."
4.0,"Cute, my toddler grand daughter LOVES them!! I would give 5 stars, but the straps and Velcro are not as comfortable looking as I would like-the strap sort of sits up above her foot. She doesn‚Äôt seem to mind & walks and runs in them (as much as you can call 18 month toddling ‚Äúrunning‚Äù). Every now and then her toes slip out of the shoe too. Therefore a 4 star rating"
4.0,product is good only somewhat short.
4.0,"This item is great quality and is a very nice cut. I ordered a Medium and was surprised at how large it still fell. I am just getting back into Medium sized clothing and was skeptical about ordering a Medium. However, please order down a size. The bodice is huge around - I think I could have easily gotten away with a Small"
4.0,Fit and look great but hurt your feet after about an hour walking in them.
4.0,Just as described.  Perfect!
4.0,Arrived on time; nice quality. Looks more expensive than it was.
4.0,"Very cute and I have enjoyed wearing it several times.  The arm holes are a little big, but otherwise great design and style."
4.0,works just as described
4.0,"I thought it would be a little looser, but it's still really cute!"
4.0,"Get what you pay for, one strap on one broke the same day. Other than that they work fine"
4.0,The item looks killer. Unfortunately the shape of the hat itself makes it look hideous when worn. But it looks so sexy on my shelf.
4.0,Nice comfy top for summer. Different than most &#34;cold shoulder&#34; tops.
4.0,"For the price it‚Äôs ok. Very light, durable plastic. Finishing seems not high quality so back strap started to come apart pretty quickly."
4.0,It‚Äôs very soft and feels like it would be comfy. Very cute..
4.0,"I really like this hat! It‚Äôs really cute and I would say it would fit most people like it looks in the photo, a little loose. I have a bigger head and finding hats that fit me is difficult but this did!"
4.0,"its VERY pretty. My 3 month old ripped the bow off with in 5 minutes and its itchy. So, I suggest you put the dress on right before pictures or whatever activity you bought the dress for.  Maybe wear panty hose under it."
4.0,Ordered for my son.  He's happy with it.
4.0,"Soft and good quality yarn, but a bit small for a man‚Äôs head, the moustache part goes into the mouth"
4.0,Comfortable and easy to wear and adjust. Comes with 2 filters which is a great plus. Nice design gave it a 4 because it doesn't really glow.
4.0,"I like the design on this  shoes,,,  looks elegant but,,,  is just too sad,,,, that  my Son  feet  was so big,,,, he just wear it one time, so if you plan to order  this, shoes  make sure that you get a big  size, because the 12 months Old  size is so  little,,,, I hope this review can help you,"
4.0,Material a little thin but I expected that. I wear this over jeans or leggings to help cover lymphedema in my legs.
4.0,"color was very much red, not the burgandy/maroon color pictured.. fits good though, like that it is long and the sleeves are long"
4.0,"One of the gloves came with a seam ripped but I'm pretty good at sewing so it wasn't a huge deal. However, for someone who cannot sew, this would have been a real problem because the ripped seam was definitely noticeable and not at all little."
4.0,"I was in a pinch and needed a strapless bra for an outfit, and it‚Äôs a little odd, but get the job done and is relatively comfortable. It‚Äôs just a smidgen too small but it‚Äôs workable."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d8c6156fcbd001b834b3729ba3544070]] Update:<br />Do not wash this tail with detergent! There is a washing label on the tail, but it's in Korean so I couldn't read it. There are washing symbols but I can never remember what those mean. I should have looked it up but I have 3 kids and was just rushing. I assumed that since its swimsuit material I could wash it--it turned black! And is now sticking together.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo to show you.<br /><br />I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 4 since the washing instructions were not clear and since its not washable.<br /><br />Original review:<br /> My 3 year old LOVES this! I ordered two--one for her and one for her to share with her friends at the pool. She put it on the moment I took it out of the bag and hasn't taken it off since. She even slept in it! She's spent 24 hours talking about what mermaids do...&#34;Mermaids eat dinner with napkins in their laps. Mermaids fall asleep with their heads on pillows.&#34; It's really cute.<br /><br />The bra has stayed on for the most part. She did wake up crying for us in the middle of the night because one of the straps came off and she needed it back on. So cute.<br /><br />As for the size, it's a little bigger than I was expecting. She can grow into it, which I love.<br /><br />It's pretty long, so she steps on it. But it's also loose enough so she can pull it up when walking up stairs or running.<br /><br />When I ordered it, I wasn't sure if it was closed at the bottom or open. It's open, so her feet can poke out while she walks. I also think that's safer for swimming.<br /><br />The bow on the underwear part is not sewn in place, so the bow can be pulled out. I took some photos so you can get a better idea of what I mean.<br /><br />The stitching is nice and I expect this outfit to be fairly durable as a costume/pool play.<br /><br />The washing instructions are all in Chinese or another language, so I have no idea how to care for it. That worries me because I don't want to ruin it in the laundry!<br /><br />All in all, my daughter is so happy with this outfit, so I love it."
4.0,"Thanks! wore it today, easy to put on..."
4.0,"A very nice dress, good quality but I usually wear a xl and I got the 2x because of my chest and it still was too small and not off the shoulder."
4.0,Sizes are very small go up 2 sizes for comfortable fit . Wasn‚Äôt crazy about the thickness of rubber over lay (3/8‚Äù) really only need 3/16 max ‚Ä¶
4.0,"I think these would be perfect for church maybe because I sized up. I got a large in these but normally wear a small/medium and size 5, I'm 5'6 135lbs and there's plenty of room and tied the strap pretty tight."
4.0,helps alot worth it
4.0,"Very cool product. I wish it would've stated in description that there are two sets in each purchase. I bought two thinking it's only one set. Otherwise, very nicely made. Can't wait to use"
4.0,I love dolphins and these are super cute. However after putting them in they quickly seemed to fade from being so shiny and now they look more yellow than silver and I‚Äôve only wore them once.
4.0,As Good as expected...
4.0,"This is a very light knit. It feels like a long sleeve tshirt. I have thin cotton turtlenecks that are heavier. There is wool in the blend so I'm sure it will be slightly warmer than a cotton poly tee, but I was searching for a &#34;ski sweater&#34; and it really will require 2 layers under it along with at least a wind rain barrier on top for mild weather ( high 40s ) on PA slopes.<br /><br />It's very cute and the colors look accurate to the look on screen.<br />I ordered an xl incase it was snug but it's generously cut so go with the size most closely matching your measurements. I easily have room for double base layers since this is bigish. I do love the retro look and colorful print, but I won't be ordering another. For my climate wool or fleece sweaters over base layers and under insulated gortex parkas are the only way to endure a full day in the snow and wind.<br /><br />This is appropriate for lodge lounging, ski pubs, and other winter socializing where it's not as important to be super warm, but super cute is a bonus. Infact, it's perfect for when you don't want that heavy confining feeling of thick bulky underlayers."
4.0,I like the size of the bows. They're not too big and gauty. Look good on my 1yr old
4.0,"It works, but still takes a few tries."
4.0,"I purchased this for my 2 year old daughter, who weighs 33 lbs. the puddle jumper has helped build her confidence in the water, she went from being terrified to exploring around without my help. The only drawback I can see is the sizing, 30-50 lbs is a large range, it was a little loose on her arms and she was able to pull them out on her own, which is very scary but thankfully she only did this during tantrums when leaving the pool/beach; also the decoration on the front is kind of poor quality, after only 1 week of use it started wear off. Over all I highly recommend the puddle jumper, just be sure to get the appropriate sizing."
4.0,"Really cute dress, but not so flattering if you have a larger middle area."
4.0,Large fit perfect for me
4.0,"Great product for a neat, low price."
4.0,"The pattern was pretty and the top itself was comfortable, but it was too loose. Not the top itself, but the outer layer. It was practically hanging off. I was expecting a pretty layered effect, but the sheer outer layer was far too loose. Your mileage may vary but this top was not for me."
4.0,"I bought these to wear mountain biking to protect my eyes from low hanging branches and kicked up debris from anyone riding in front of me. I immediately changed the lenses over to the amber to better illuminate the forest and trail, lens change was kind of a pain but easy to do once figured out. The lens case included is actually really nice quality and looks sturdy. My helmet is slightly low hanging in the ear region and makes wearing the glasses a little uncomfortable due to their rounded stems instead of flat. Takes a little to get the helmet situated over top of them. One thing that I dislike about them is the lens just goes to the bottom of your eye socket which for me I'd prefer a little bit lower as anything coming from an angle underneath would have direct contact with you eye. Overall nice glasses."
4.0,It is a nice tie.  The shade what brighter than expected.
4.0,Fine fr the beach
4.0,I wanted the bottle for another purpose. It works well for what I use it for but if you want to use it as a necklace you will need some glue. The part that wrapped around the bottle falls off.
4.0,"Well made, good length, nice material, just a little tight in the chest."
4.0,Bought this for vacation ..I loved it ..it was so comfortable
4.0,"Is it just me or have these things gotten cheaper since they first came out? Anyway, it still does it's job nicely, and is the only way I would wear my hair in a bun. Unfortunately, my hair has finally reached a length where it is impractical to try to use this thing myself; I  can only have someone else put it on for me. My hair reaches my pelvis."
4.0,I bought these for my wedding shoes so that the heel doesn't stick into the grass while I walk down the aisle in my garden wedding. My heels are only about 1.5 inches long but they are square and I have to really work to get them on. It wouldn't work for all heels and is probably meant best for stilettos. Once I had them on though I went walking in the grass and it worked great. I will say though that they are noticeable. I'm not worried about it since I'm wearing a floor length gown but I saw a girl downtown with them and a short dress and they just look kind of weird. They do protect your shoes though so that's the trade off I guess.
4.0,"I'm always on the lookout for a decent pair of inexpensive glasses - and these are good enough I went back for a 2nd (wanted a &#34;backup&#34; pair in another car).  The lenses aren't particularly dark, but they do the job just fine.  Frames *feel* a little delicate, but I've not had any trouble with any kind of excessive bending or breaking.  The supplied case & microfiber is a nice bonus."
4.0,Nice set. All the pieces are pretty. Thanks.
4.0,"The colors on the jacket are bright and vivid love that! Size wise runs smaller, I wish I would have gotten the next size up, fits but is snug I even made sure I measured before ordering."
4.0,Color is different than picture
4.0,The v-neck.opening is smaller/higher than pictured.
4.0,Cute dress the material  has a little bit of a pajama feel to it but I really liked it.  The ruffle is a little bit heavy on top but you can see that in the picture. The Empire race fits as  expected and isn't real clingy
4.0,"I ordered a large to give myself some room. It's a little larger than I expected but I like the loose fit. The length is good too with a nice low heel. The colors are pretty vibrant too, so don't order if you don't want to stand out from the crowd. Came extremely fast which is always nice."
4.0,"Beautiful belt, soft leather, perfect fit"
4.0,"These Ear cuffs are nice looking and are fairly easy to wear.  I bought other ear cuffs, and these are one of the better ones."
4.0,has a strong smell of fabric. just covers the belly button. returning. didnt like how it feels and fits on my body.
4.0,Its a very nice suit.  The color is vivid and accurate in the posting.  The price is awesome for the quality.  I ended up returning the suite simply because the back was so open and wasn't flattering to my body.  But a quality suit all around.
4.0,"Purchased these for my grandsons (10 & 11), and the lights were a good pick.<br />The boys loved them and found all kinds of creative applications.<br />Also, now when they fight in the dark, they can see each others fists coming. :-)<br /><br />As mentioned by other reviewers, not 10 packs of four lights, 40 loose lights in a plastic bag - Four colors, 10 lights each color.<br />The lights are very bright, warn the kids to avoid staring into the light.<br />The lights seem to last a pretty long time, have had them around 6 weeks and the boys have played with them 3 or 4 times with no burnouts.<br />Five of the 40 lights were DOA, a 12.5% failure rate resulting in a cost of .19/light vs .17/light - Not a big deal.<br />The boys loved them and still love them - that's what counts.<br /><br />When the light count gets down to 10, I'm going to replenish."
4.0,I‚Äôve two 3-packs of these. They‚Äôre great for the price. Good material and comfortable. I didn‚Äôt give it five stars because 4/6 hoodies fit well but for some reason 2/6 are tighter than the others. Sizing isn‚Äôt consistent.
4.0,The rings themselves seem real but idk of the silver interlocked rings are
4.0,does hold 2 suits just fine.
4.0,"This shirt fits great. It is very comfortable and does not pinch in any way. The shirt is long enough that is does not rise up on me. The V neck is not too low that it shows anything that it should not. The printing on the shirt is solid, no holes in the ink. I did wash and dry this shirt before I wore it. I measured it before I washed and dried it and it really did not shrink much at all. I hate having sleeves that are tight on my arms, this shirt is not at all. I am very pleased with this shirt and can recommend it.  I will update my review should anything change.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product  at a discount for an honest a unbiased review. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine. I take writing reviews seriously. I turn to reviews when making a decision on whether I want to purchase the product or not. I hope my review will help you in your decision on whether to purchase this product or not and if you have any questions please feel ask and I will answer them to the best of my ability"
4.0,More yellow than green in color. Nice suit. Fit a little loose.
4.0,I Love this dress! So pretty. Fits well. I'm  5'4 1/2 145lbs. I would've liked it to be sold in an X-small but it's not but still not bad. Kinda baggy but looks good. Thin material but not cheaply looking.
4.0,"I love these boots because they are very different!!  I just think that the heel could be a little thicker.  Nevertheless, they are really nice boots!"
4.0,"Got size 2-3 for my 2.5 year old daughter. She is rather slender, yet the sleeves seem to be too tight. Didn't have this issue with other Carter's gowns, so this must be just poor design."
4.0,I like the color coz it sets my watch apart from all the hundreds of watches I see everyday. I‚Äôm an in between size so I got a large then just adjusted it myself and it fits well.
4.0,I ordered in the color champagne or light gold and it is very very see through. Sadly for what I wanted it for but I think it‚Äôs great for a rave or risqu√© clubbing look and everyone looks awesome fro. Other reviews just be mindful that this color is see through as hell
4.0,Love them. Sadly my cousin thinks they are his now.
4.0,"I really love this skirt and you can't beat the price! I found it to be a little big on the waist. I am 5'3'' and 110-115llbs, so possibly size down? I am not sure if that would be best for everyone, but I think an extra small might fit better. Either way, pretty cute and inexpensive purchase!"
4.0,This set is a very complete assortment of pad for shoes. I like that the full length pads have an arch support. These have helped save several pairs of shoes from going to the trash because I can now wear them comfortably.
4.0,"I use the watch faces to create beautiful watches.  The batteries do not last very long.  It is difficult to take the watch backs off and replace the battery.  I have the &#34;tool&#34; to make it easier, but still, very difficult to replace batteries."
4.0,"I thought it was a bit smaller than it looked in the picture. It's very pretty and looks like really good quality. I didn't really like the color of the garnet. It looks orange. Maybe garnets have different color variations but I thought they were red to dark red. I will be looking into this to make sure it is a garnet, other than that it's overall look is very pretty. I bought it for my daughters 20th birthday. I think she'll love it!"
4.0,"It snags pretty easily. It wasn't itchy for me, but that's because I was wearing a cape over, so my arms were not directly touching the top. It was not as long as I would have hoped, but it still looked nice regardless. For me the v was a tad too deep and I had to fix my top to prevent my bra from showing."
4.0,"I got 2 shirts, a medium and a 2x. I should have gotten a 3x. The shirts are short and form fitting. My niece will now have both of them now."
4.0,"The good: Stealth styling, smaller than most G-Shocks, nice night light. The bad: low contrast hands and display can be difficult to read, non-solar, analog time setting, stiff band.<br />If you like the stealth styling, but want higher contrast hands, solar recharging, and atomic time, there is also the AWGM100B-1ACR at a slightly higher price. You can pair either of these with JaysandKays strap adapters, which will allow better fit for slimmer wrists."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f8fbf312d5bc35e56652bfac30c370f]] I like this set, it‚Äôs unusual and i like everything that‚Äôs different. This is definitely different. I can‚Äôt blame the seller for my wired shape, its just the way it is for me , the bottom is very loose on me , wearable , yet only at home. But I already wore the top with jeans and black leggings and it looks cool .<br />The top is made out of such a nice and soft fabric, easy to take care of and super long lasting ..<br />If I had a waist I would wear this with a thick belt ‚Ä¶ I have a lot of ideas to try this out with ..<br />Can only recommend!"
4.0,They are not Keens but they feel pretty good on my feet.  True to size and no rubbing on my skin as they are made not to rub.  They are not expensive but do serve the purpose.  Don‚Äôt know how long they will last.  Im wearing right out of the box‚Ä¶. and no problems.  I would recommend these sandals.
4.0,"The small hoops are a perfect size and fit snuggly without squeezing the earlobe.  The stainless steel is great since I cannot tolerate nickel that is contained in some silver jewelry.  The bar is somewhat difficult to insert in the hole, but once done, stays securely placed."
4.0,"I got this in navy, and really like it. The material itself is almost like felt, but I wasn't expecting to be blown away at the price I paid. Regardless, it's definitely flattering and is decently warm. As the other reviewers have mentioned, I would definitely get the size you normally get. The body part is a bit bigger than I was expecting and the arms tight, so if you have thinner arms, you may even want to size down."
4.0,My boyfriend brought me a small and it fits perfectly.I am 5'3 and 112 pounds
4.0,"I love the vibrant orange and the simple design of the shirt.  It doesn't move around a lot so that it ends up choking you after a while which is a bonus. The shirt fit as expected and seems to be pretty accurate and true to size. The length is nice, not too short or two long.  There isn't much stretch to the shirt however.  The first time I put it on, I had to stretch the neck out just a bit to get my head through.  Other than that I love it."
4.0,"The necklace is quite pretty, and seems well made. HOWEVER, it is about 58&#34; long and there is no catch, so it's impossible to wear it as triple strand, unless you have an abnormally tiny head!  It's a long single or a double, not a triple."
4.0,"Very nice overall and exactly described. Maybe it's just my fingers, but the stars were a challenge to grip."
4.0,Great dress. Great quality. Fit as expected
4.0,Great shirt. Received lots of compliments but shrunk the first time I washed it length wise.
4.0,"Beautiful,  but springs are tight and pinch my ears."
4.0,"4 starts because it was smaller than what I expected. Yes, I didn‚Äôt read the bio, but still. Seemed bigger in the pic. But other than that, good length and well painted!!!"
4.0,Soft and has some stretch to it. Its a very good buy
4.0,"Product arrived with no issues, the bracelet is pretty."
4.0,"Better than expected!  They are comfortable, vision is clear, and glare is greatly reduced, which is really important to an accountant who spends all day looking at the monitor..."
4.0,"I love the style of these pants but what I am not pleased with is the crotch seems to be a bit low and they are a bit too short for me. I don't know if I ordered wrong so that could be on me. Also, my calves are large for someone my size so in that area they are too tight for my liking. Not uncomfortably tight, I just don't like to feel my pants around my lower leg if that makes sense. For someone who does not have long legs and large calves, I think they would really like them. The material is nice and they are comfortable."
4.0,Zipper was a little cheap. I hope it holds up in the wash. Otherwise I really like it
4.0,Great buy!  Nice fabric and fit
4.0,"Just fooling with a mask on the pic, but it can make a good steam punk outfit addition. The only downside - it's too hot and almost impossible to breath through."
4.0,I ordered a 4x thinking I wanted to big and it was huge. Short arms and torso. Would buy again just in the right size.
4.0,"Love it.  Flowy and loose fit but perfect on my chest (which is on the bigger size;) Have it in 2  colors and they are same size but seem to fit a bit differently,  but not a big deal."
4.0,This is very cute and has washed well.  The sleeves around my wrists are quite loose but I typically bunch the sleeves up so this is not an issue.  The neck was larger than I had imagined from images and ended up have to adjust my bra to have it not show.
4.0,Fine quality all silk ties.
4.0,"First of all, I received this item at a discount price in exchange for providing an honest review.<br /><br />In regards to the color and design of the suit, it is exactly as it appears in the photograph.  The colors and the design are exactly as I thought they would be based on the picture.  The colors are bright and vibrant.  The fit is very small.  I ordered up to a size large and probably could have gone up another size or two.  The bra cups are tiny!  I do not have large breasts by any means (I am a small C) but was pouring out of them.  It is definitely designed for a very slim figure with small breasts.  I really do like the design of the suit with the lace up back and skirted bottom, but I think it is probably more suitable for a teenager or very petite adult.  The material appears to be of decent quality and it appears to be well made.  I would definitely recommend ordering up a few sizes, keeping in mind that you can always tighten it to fit a bit better with the laces if need be."
4.0,"This is a great robe for a bride-to-be to wear on the wedding day. Higher quality than what I was expecting, however it is a little smaller. I would size up if you want to be more comfortable with a looser robe."
4.0,It did the job. My watch cosc certified went from 2 min /day to 2 sec / day.
4.0,"This sandal does fit my sole better than most but still lacks softness.  The bottom of my feet get very sore by the end of the day as happens with any sandal I've purchased.  It's a very nice sandal, I just wanted to wear all day without having tired feet. My problem, not the footwear."
4.0,I love this dress it‚Äôs just a little too small.
4.0,I got this for my daughter who is a lifeguard for a quick little towel/jacket for after work. It's definitely cheaper than a speedo jacket lol however the material is thinner than expected as it's advertised as thick. Other than that it's great.
4.0,After resizing the pins keep coming out of there socket but the watch is beautiful.  That is why I have not returned it. I just push the pins back in. If you don't like that kind of trouble it is something you should consider.  Its worth the trouble to me.
4.0,Definitely love these. I wish the shorts were just a bit shorter so I could wear it with a dress..
4.0,The fit is very flattering but I noticed it's a little tighter than expected. The fabric is amazing and the length is just right. I liked it very much!
4.0,Great quality. They smell pretty bad though. I‚Äôm hoping the smell will fade because I won‚Äôt wear them if it doesn‚Äôt.
4.0,"I put these on my 9 year olds shoes and he likes them.  He hates tying his shoes and I got tired of buying new laces all the time.  I wish there were a few more smaller sized pieces, but they still work on his size 3 shoe."
4.0,"This is cute, works great with dresses. It was shorter than I expected. More of a crop fit."
4.0,Fits well pockets accommodate the the necessary gear. The only thing missing is an inside pocket.
4.0,"Super cute dress!<br />Unfortunately it arrived with a tear in the stitching - so I had to return. Otherwise seemed of decent quality, perfect fit, very cute and flattering."
4.0,"Good tank, it is kinda low cut and stretches as you workout. The medium fits, but my sports bra shows all around the top, as I am a DD"
4.0,Returned. Arm length is too short. Doesn‚Äôt serve the purpose.
4.0,If they were just 1/4 inch (6mm) longer would be great
4.0,Tunnels were slightly  bigger then the tapers; managed to slide them in after a warm shower.
4.0,"The jeggings fit my really well except that they are too long for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3. I do like how they feel and look, though, so  I‚Äôll wear them around the house."
4.0,Great lightweight linen blazer. Purchased it in black. I gave it four stars! It's a functional lightweight linen blazer...much like a coverup. My girlfriend loves the blazer and often wears it ...especially if the AC is too high in a theater or restaurant.
4.0,"Very cute, but runs small across the chest. If you want a loose fit I'd order at least one size up. Returning this product was easy."
4.0,"This makes my 4th Nine West Handbag, Double Vision Satchel.  I have never purchased the same handbag style...in four different colors.  This is a ""first"" for me.  I like the division of space for my items...and, even though it is a bigger bag, it is not heavy to carry.  My one complaint is the zippers are not the best...meaning, they are crooked and looked cheap.  But, the delivery of my bag came fast....which also pleased me very much."
4.0,"I am 235 lb, 5'2&#34;. I usually wear a XXl in women's or size 20 in pants. I ordered an Xl in these as I wanted them to be shirt as I am short and I know they will stretch and come up a little-so I don't have to get them altered. The were the right length in doing this, not too tight, but I did order white-so you could kinda see through them being white thin stretchable fabric and all. I like the fit so much that I just wear a long plaid shirt with them."
4.0,"Pretty and flattering this dress feastures a fit and flare style. the polyester fabric hs a touch of spandex and is fairly thin. It is comfrortable on but due to both the close fit of the top and the relative lightness of the fabric it most definitely requires Spanx or other bodywear or a light slip. The color is a pretty corl that is ivid without looking cheap or guady. It washes like a charm. Polyester is not my first choice but this dress is impeccably crafted, and ttractive. Well done."
4.0,I bought this for my cousin in Jamaica she had a special event and she wanted to buy  A bra like this if she really love it
4.0,Looks ok but not great quality
4.0,"I ordered a size up just to make sure that it would fit (wore for a wedding).  Dress fit well on top (I'm a 38D) and was large on the bottom, hanging past my knees.  Since this was an outside wedding and I was one of two people performing the ceremony, I felt that the fit was appropriate, but could have gone true to size and ordered a XL instead."
4.0,"Pretty color and soft material... I forget China sizes are NOT like US. This dress fits me like a shirt, barely covers my bum, but. Lesson learned."
4.0,"Works as a cute coverup for the beach/pool, and fits well. I'm overall pleased with it. My only complaint is that it does snag easily, causing the weaving to stretch out wherever it happens. I already have a few stray loops stretched out of place after just a few wears."
4.0,this is quite good.
4.0,"Wide through waist, hip and thigh."
4.0,They are great earrings! The only thing is that the backs fit very loosely. I had to change them out to ensure the didn't come off.
4.0,It  looks better than I thought it would and was reasonably priced.
4.0,I love this swim suit and it's super cute however the top area fits small a 10-12 does not fit a c cup very well. Although cute suit overall.
4.0,"I was really looking forward to getting these earrings and was not disappointed when they arrived. They are just beautiful! They are very shiny and the stones are very clear and bright. (I hate when cubic zirconias look dull) These earring are comfortable to wear. I thought they might be a bit heavy, but was surprised to find that they are not heavy at all. The chain is just the right length that they hang at about chin length. The back is a bit light for these earrings. I think a longer solid piece at the back would be better....it would keep them from slipping forward like they tend to do. I'll probably put a pair of those clear rubber backs that slide up the chain on them to keep them from sliding. Otherwise they're just perfect.<br /><br />The earrings came in a little velvet storage pouch. I did not do a silver test, but I believe these to be sterling silver as they have not discolored or irritated my skin. These earrings are beautiful and I would recommend them.<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discount on this item in exchange for an honest review. Opinions, experiences and photos are all mine."
4.0,it will work and i'm glade i read the reviews i order and xxl and i wear size 12. so its snug but will work for halloween.
4.0,Nice sporty shoes but it‚Äôs a bit narrow in the front so I don‚Äôt recommend if you have wide feet! My daughter complains about her pinky hurting!
4.0,"First off this dress is great! Fits just as I was hoping. Ordered an XL I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù about 177lb, I have two kids and the body type that shows it..... I saw the reviews that is fits like a glove and I wanted mine a hint loose to help blend in my stomach and it is. I tried it on without my waist trainer and it was loose.<br />The style of the dress will enhance the hourglass figure if you are looking for that.<br />Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because there are stains on the bottom of this dress! Ugh. I hate when I get a returned item without prior warning. I wanted to wear the dress tomorrow for a celebration dinner, I think I need to find a new one. :( bummer because its cute and sexy."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:362752d43cca777a114b3be915d3e516]] This has two of my favorite things! Amethyst and Buddha!<br /><br />I love gemstone jewelry as much as I love Buddha. Now I have a piece of each to carry with me everywhere.<br /><br />The amethyst beads are nicely polished and of amazing quality. The Buddha head is silver tone and I'm not sure yet if it will tarnish. As of yet it has not.<br /><br />Threads were larger than expected but gorgeous nonetheless.<br /><br />My only complaint is the fact this bracelet is made of a rubber band type material üòï  Meaning it will break easily. I am going to replace mine with corsage to extend the life.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount. My reviews are based on personal use quality and performance and are never manipulated or altered in any way.
4.0,"A LITTLE HEAVY, BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED.  VEY PRETTY"
4.0,"It fits perfect! Is very elegant and chick, looks expensive, take one star bcs I need to buy shorts to use under bcs is a lil clear, but other than that is a five stars product"
4.0,the needle part bends I had a hard time getting it through my hat It looks good.
4.0,"I was so bummed when I got this (would be) super cute necklace, some of the lettering wasn't ""filled in"" if that makes sense, I'm not super confident my picture shows what I'm trying to show lol but its a cell phone pic..  anyway, I put in a request for a refund and they were SUPER FAST at fixing the issue, which is why I'm giving 4 stars! Customer service was great!"
4.0,"I do like this outfit and it served its purpose for the weekend.<br /><br />The skirt is really short, I had to wear shorts underneath and the arm bands were tight.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt know if I would wear it again but all in all, it is cute. I don‚Äôt think ordering a larger size would‚Äôve made a difference. For reference, I ordered a M & I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 36/29/41."
4.0,Pants are a different fit but worked great for the halloween costume
4.0,"It's a great dress! Very light, but material is slightly sheer, and I usually wear s tank top under. Pockets are great!"
4.0,"These turned out to be super cute.  I tried the style with no zipper, just pull on and an elastic ankle. They look great, sleek and narrowing.  Note: if you have thicker ankles, it will be difficult to get these on and they may dig in to your leg.  The opening is fairly narrow, though it does stretch.  They don‚Äôt have much support, are fairly hard bottomed and no arch support, but for the price, totally worth it!"
4.0,I use these for little girls softball team. They work great
4.0,Cute dress! It was kinda big so I shrunk it as much as I could. Still looks cute with a scarf and boots
4.0,Bow was way too big for a baby's head.
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 127 lbs 36C and ordered the small. The shirt fits as expected and it‚Äôs really soft. The only downfalls are the shirt is really thin and it‚Äôs sort of a box shape. That being said I do like the shirt and think it‚Äôs worth the price.
4.0,"This skirt is lightweight and comfortable. It is 100% cotton, which I always look for for in summer wear."
4.0,This skirt is super cute but a bit longer than I expected.  Quality is as expected for the price.
4.0,"Thick material, great look. Too big and stretches out of shape."
4.0,Order a xlg n it feels great comtable a litt loose
4.0,The charm is adorable and looks exactly like its picture.  Looks great in the charm holder.  Well worth the money.
4.0,I like the pattern and the design and colors.  I had hoped it would be a bit heavier for fall weather.  It is more like a summer scarf.
4.0,Hard to find item .... found!<br />Thanks!
4.0,"really cute boot, and comfortable. sexy slouchy look. I have large calves and these fit nicely! I would recommend these"
4.0,My 4-yr-old loves these.
4.0,"Our son is very picky with socks. They have to be &#34;No Show&#34;, but then he complains about them creeping down into his sneakers and shoes.  When I saw these, I wondered if the positive reviews were true. Well, believe me they are. He loves the colors, he loves how well they are made,  and he loves that they don't creep down.  The only problem is that we only received 4 pair in the package - not five."
4.0,"The band fit my Casio MDV106, but it required curved bars (only straight bars included). I took it to jewelry shop and they fitted the band to the watch for half the price of the band. The jeweler complimented the weight and feel of this one compared to the ones sold in the store. I am satisfied with the band despite the minor setback witht the band."
4.0,For a replica ring this was had good craftsmanship. I collect NHL championship rings and this one passed my quality test.
4.0,Good looking and accurate watch. I would prefer that the chronograph continues to run longer than one hour.
4.0,"Very cute! I usually wear a size 8/Medium & ordered my regular size.  The dress fits but is very snug in the chest area.  If you have a larger chest , maybe size up."
4.0,Great slippers warm but your feet don‚Äôt sweat
4.0,"I,wish the shirt came down longer like it does in the pic. The back is longer but front isn't long enough to cover the goods. I still love it, it has a flare style to it. I ordered my true size which is an xl, and it fits me very well.. 38d and 165-170 pounds for a reference"
4.0,Very nice took them on vacation to Mexico.  Can be dressed up or down
4.0,I bought this for my husband for Halloween. He was dressed as the beast from beauty and the beast.  I always go up a size when it comes to buying for my husband. This fit him well but it was snug in the arms and it made my husband feel uncomfortable  some but he still wore it and loved it.
4.0,"pretty dress, does run a bit large."
4.0,"Harley looks great, the image is fine. My only issue is with the size. I wear XXL and have no problems with almost anything else in that size. This is one of those times where it feels a bit small."
4.0,Very nice. It is as advertise perfect size for a man.
4.0,"Very fun, looks great.  Does not look cheap."
4.0,"This dress is super cute. Well made and has nice stitching. There is no inner lining. The fit is perfect. I'm 5'6 120lbs slender build with a small bust. I purchased a medium which fit perfect. The only reason for the four stars is the length. it hits well above the knees. When my hands are at my sides it hits at my fingertips. Too short for me being in my mid thirties with two small kiddos. If the dress was knee length I would be keeping. the color is exactly like the picture. I have to return only because of the length. This came well packaged and shipped fast. the returns are super simple. thank for the wonderful customer service. I was fortunate enough to receive this a slight discount in exchange for my true, fair, and honest opinion."
4.0,I like quality
4.0,"cute & great price. My only complaint is on the gold earrings, the edge is not painted."
4.0,I like NOT dealing with a strapless bra or with wearing a bra only due to thin material so far adhesive has held well. Seems to kind of a ridge on the bottom when your top clings to much. But all is good so far. For the price I'm not looking for them to last a real long term but will have to see.
4.0,Good value and just like photos
4.0,"Her favorite color is yellow, so these are the closest I could get.  She is thrilled."
4.0,"These pants are cute and fit true to size. My only qualm is with the fabric. The image is printed on and faded ever so slightly after the first cold water wash. (I hang them to dry), so I'm wondering what they'll look like after a few washings. Also, a white t-shirt looks great with them, but it was harder to match the fuchsia color. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, but wish for old fashioned fabrics with the colors woven in, not printed on the material. As snug yoga pants, they work great for a yoga session, but I don't wear them all day as they don't seem as breathable as cotton."
4.0,"Very beautiful, though clam area comes off easily."
4.0,"I received nine pairs of stainless steel earrings. I attached a pic of my favorite ones - they're the most minimalistic of the lot, showing very little stainless steel. Some have a gold backing, some silver, and some all black. The latter will take some getting used to, but I'll wear them in the winter. They look a little glass-like. These are earrings you can wear daily. Only thing is - they're hard to take off!"
4.0,"Not the shirt that is pictured but it's cute. Runs small so order up 1-2 sizes. It's a v neck capped sleeve, medium weight. Great price!"
4.0,Beautiful dress but definitely runs way small so small that I can‚Äôt even wear it. I normally wear a medium and that‚Äôs what I ordered. Too bad because it‚Äôs nice and modest and the material is nice and light but not see through.
4.0,I like this hat a lot. The color is great and it is very soft. I wish it was a bit bigger to have more of the slouchy look but that won't stop me from wearing it. I bought this hat in bright pink and baby blue. Both colors are better than I expected!
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 150lbs.  Size 6 and a 34DD.  I bought a small and, apart from the waist being way too high, it fit fine everywhere else.  The material was of high quality, had a nice stretch to it, and was not see through (I bought the wine color) but the waist is almost laughable. If you have anything other than a short torso, this probably will not work for you. Because the waist was so high, the booty part was also too high, giving it a weird shape.  The woman in the modeled picture must be about 5‚Äô2‚Äù and a size 2 for the waist to be right.  If you‚Äôre short, this dress will probably be your favorite thing to wear as the material was super flattering and comfortable otherwise!"
4.0,Okay but sometimes don‚Äôt maintain hold on eyeglass stem
4.0,This was a gift. The recipient liked it and used it for which it was intended.
4.0,Could have used a few more CC slots.
4.0,"These shorts dry really fast,"
4.0,Bracelet broke an hour after wearing. Cute.
4.0,Very cute!  Not too big right size for 10 y/0
4.0,"36DDD, the material was a little short but that was probably due to my bust size pulling the material. Very cute, little tight on the upper abdominal area (clung to my fluff a bit) but not enough to make me feel uncomfortable. Cute, flow-y and modest"
4.0,"I bought this in the hopes of wearing for my students on the last day before Christmas break.  It was absolutely adorable upon taking it out of the package. Unfortunately,even though it was an XL (depending on the maker,I run between XL/2 XL it didn't fit me....I don't want to return it though,as I may have another use for it"
4.0,Fit ok for larger than normal sizing
4.0,"Love the hidden pocket, real comfy and fits well!"
4.0,Lots of pockets to put things in.. I do love this purse.. so glad I bought it..
4.0,"This skirt is beautiful, however the length is not what is pictured. It is a normal floor length."
4.0,Fell in love with them!!  BEAUTIFUL!!!‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
4.0,Great for parties but doesn‚Äôt work for suspenders if you‚Äôre under 6‚Äô
4.0,"The material is as listed but the image on the listing looks more soft and plush the hoodie itself feels very thin. the fit is tighter than I wanted I ordered a larger size for a  loose fit and its snug. the colors are very vibrant, it is a pull over not a zip and the pockets are very shallow."
4.0,So this was a great value bought together with the wand and the dress. She (4) has trouble putting it in alone.
4.0,"This four pack of travel drawstring show bags is perfect for packing, not just for shoes either! My husband and I like to travel and so we will travel with everything from casual sneakers to sexy black heals. Shoes fit wonderfully within drawstring bag.  My shoes (women's size 8/8.5) fit with room to spare.  My husbands shoes (mens size 11.5) fit, but only barely.  They fit in length but get a bit tight when it comes to bag width for running shoes that are on the bulky side.  I am thinking of ordering another set for miscellaneous travel items such as my blow dryer, flat iron, and even for my socks/underwear within my suitcase.  So many possibilities, so few bag.  Clear view window at the toes of the bag makes it easy for you to find the right pair of shoes without searching through a dozes little black bags.  Great feature. Surprisingly sturdy fabric, easy drawstring and washable! Good product overall.  Sample product discounted for review purposes."
4.0,This jacket is not a mens. It's more of a unisex .not totally a woman's cut but slim and the zipper is on the woman's side.I got this as a gift for my skinny cousin. And he liked it
4.0,I wore it many times each time it would separate the strings and the fabric would grow fuzzy I can't explain it but where are more my necklaces and under my arms got fuzzy fabric areas so we don't wear the dress anymore
4.0,Great buy! These boots are awesome! Once you get them past the knees it gets a little snug for me but overall I would make this purchase again.
4.0,"At my size, I feel very self-conscious and when I put on this bathing suit top I felt more confident. I'm 5'6"", 145-150#, 8/10, and got a Large. It is comfortable and stylish. Shows off a moderate amount of cleavage, but very comfortable to wear all day with the kids or friends.  Soft cups and surprising supportive one strap.  I got the green, and the color is WONDERFUL!<br /><br />The bottoms are teeny tiny, IMO.  There is no way I would wear them out anywhere.  I ended up having a ton of bottoms that matched this top, so it still worked.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!"
4.0,"I'm 5,2 about 140pounds. Got smaller size. It is very tight it will show every lump and bump lol. Extra tight in the arms."
4.0,These were good for the price.  I bought them for a kid's spa party.  They must be washed in cold water and after the first wash I did have some strings hanging off of two of the six robes that I bought.  They are more for dress up then regular use.
4.0,Ordered this by height for my almost 10 year old. It is too long and also way too big fit wise for her too. She‚Äôs skinny and the size 10 looks like it is more for like a 12-13 year old weight wise. The quality is great though and the colors/pattern were spot on to the picture. Wish I could get a replacement in time for our event in two days.
4.0,"Love bright colors, cute dress..Love pockets,  nice fit.  A little snug in chest ...waiting on response of exchanging for large. Prefer looser fit."
4.0,"The shoes are adorable, but even if you measure your child's foot according to the size chart, still go up a size. These suckers are tight, especially if you're dealing with a chubby foot like most toddlers have. Other than that, they are well made and easy to slip on."
4.0,"I am trying to stretch them, a little snug. But I love the design & cushiong."
4.0,"I found this coat to be very cute and stylish. I know it is supposed to be a short coat but unfortunately it was too short for me. I am 5'6, 115 Ibs and typically wear a size small, which is what I ordered. I think the problem is that I have a pretty long torso so this was basically like a belly shirt type jacket on me. I will say that it appears to be fairly warm and of high-quality."
4.0,Nice top. But you need to go down one size. I got Small size but it‚Äôs still too big for me.
4.0,"These can be dressed up, or dressed down. They're comfortable! I had to exchange a small, for a medium. So, they're a little smaller than average. It was well worth the effort!"
4.0,Beautiful Dress. Stylish comfortable
4.0,"Pretty, but too large."
4.0,not bad but very thin
4.0,Bracelet is beautiful but is a bit small.
4.0,"boot warm an dry, what was wanted."
4.0,"Ill start with I got these gloves for free in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They will not fit a big man, I am an average woman and they fit me almost perfect. They look weird, like old socks dipped in rubber. They even leave cotton on your skin if your hand sweats in them. They did keep my hands dry and clean while gardening."
4.0,I like how small it is...the red leather is nice but the places for cards are a bit snug.
4.0,Thought the chain was gold .. bigger than I thought
4.0,They can pinch the neck if not placed properly. These give a good extra half size to a shirt.
4.0,"I love these kind of bags, with multiple zipper pockets on the outside. This bag is great if you want to run around with minimal weight. It's held up pretty well too, given how &#34;flimsy&#34; the material feels. I have a more expensive, tougher, sturdier version of this bag and it's strap has ripped off a couple of times. If you don't stuff too much that's heavy in this bag, it's the perfect bag for travel or just running around with errands, etc. I tend to travel light and only have key, wallet and a few other things - if you tend to shlep a lot of stuff, this wouldn't be for you."
4.0,"The hoodie is nice, kind of thin but think enough to keep you warm on a cool day, not a really cold day. The picture quality is good but I don‚Äôt think it will last for a long time, it‚Äôs seems like it may peel off. But only time will tell! Over all my daughter loves it!"
4.0,Did not like the color brown it was. Overall satisfied
4.0,"i love the vivid colors and its strongly made but i wish they had made the neck opening/length a bit longer ... when putting it around my neck if i try to lift the phone to my eye level, im finding it a bit short, wishing there was more length to it ... if not for that, i would give it 5 stars"
4.0,I like the hat. Not thrilled with the front seem but better keep it as I need it now. Replacing it could take too long.<br />Like the long flap and wide brim.
4.0,Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the bad smell when you first get it
4.0,"The earrings are pretty ,various sizes which I like. not to heavy<br />Nice sheen .but part of one of the earrings was broken that's<br />The reason why I gave this review 4 star's instead of 5 star's"
4.0,"The dress fit perfect! Great material, fit perfect‚Ä¶the mask though‚Ä¶it‚Äôs terrifying. This went from being so cute, to something that will haunt you. My daughter loves it though. Little does she know she looks like she belongs in The Silence Of The Lambs. I recommend, but be prepared to laugh, cry & tremble at the same time."
4.0,Love my new purse!!
4.0,This dress is very comfortable and the material is soft.  It's a little too short so I wear leggings with it.
4.0,A little  to thin..that means it tear  easily but it's  ok for high 70's degree  weather.
4.0,Very comfortable but shear. The pad can be seen thru the fabric. I took the pads out of the pockets and placed them inside the bra.
4.0,"Very cute and retro!<br /><br />However, my dog sat on them (big boy, Australian Shepherd) and they broke immediately."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but the crystals are cheap. The fabric seems nice and sturdy.. overall happy with my purchase."
4.0,These were very cute but they kept rolling down my leg at the top. Other than that they were a pretty solid pair of socks for the price. Will consider buying other colors.
4.0,"Great concept, wish we had them years ago!  Our son loves his shoes, and can operate unassisted.<br />The biggest drawback we have is that be our son has to wear special braces inside his shoes it started excessive wearing within a few days.<br />For as much as these shoes cost we hoped they would hold up better for children with special needs.<br />Love the fit and function but if they don‚Äôt last long then we may not buy again. Time will tell."
4.0,"Right size and warmth, haven‚Äôt tried the touch screen yet"
4.0,Very pretty but too small and difficult to put anything in the outside zipper pocket.
4.0,"Just received this limited edition Seiko Samurai this week and I'm really attracted to the blue dial.  The color of blue is very different from my Seiko Blue Monster dial.  The Samurai dial appears darker in certain lighting but has almost a teal colored blue showing up in parts of the sunburst pattern in bright outdoor lighting.  Really love the sharp angles on the casing and the bracelet really matches this watch.  I was thinking of swapping out the bracelet for a strapcode bracelet but I think I'm going to keep it as is for now.  The bracelet has solid end links and the links are held together by the pin and collar system, which can be a pain but after sizing lots of watches, this is no longer a problem for me.  Practice makes perfect.  They list the casing as 43.5 mm but too me, it's more like a 44 mm without the crown.  I have a 6.75 inch wrist size and it wears great.  I have a black / glint and a blue Turtle.  Both Turtles are the new releases from last year.  The Samurai is slightly smaller than the Turtle but is by no means a puny watch.  For me, it's a watch that gives off a big wrist presence but wears small because of the case design.  I feel the new released Turtles are more comfortable to wear but the Samurai is by no means an uncomfortable watch to wear.  My only gripe is what the other reviewer mentions, the notorious Seiko chapter ring misalignment.  For my watch, there is a very slight misalignment at the 12:00 o'clock position.  It does not bother me because while wearing it on my wrist, I can't really see it.  Also, at certain lighting and angles, I don't see it.  Oh, it's there if you really look good, but not enough to bother me and return the watch.  The other notorious problem of the Seiko bezel misalignment is not a problem on my watch.  The bezel is smooth and lines up perfectly.  I'm really glad about this because a slight chapter ring misalignment does not bother me but a misaligned bezel really irks the heck out of me.  So far, the accuracy of this watch is running about -3 or +2 seconds after a 24 hour period.  All in all, I think it's a good watch to add to my Seiko collection."
4.0,"The design is very nice.  They're comfortable and they keep your feet warm.  As for the orthopedic part, they're built with a lot of tough-cushion in the heel.  They're pretty rugged too, so they should last quite a while.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I would like if they had more arch support.  (Maybe they have different inserts on their website).  They're a little expensive for slippers, but knowing that,  I take care of them pretty good.  (I've had several slippers & sneakers ruined by my dogs over the years. So i take care of these.)  It's a very good product and I do recommend them.  Worth the price."
4.0,Can't say anything bad only worn a dozen times
4.0,It‚Äôs made small. Purchased a 2x so it would fit big. Returning for larger size
4.0,Loved it except there was a bit running with color
4.0,"It was a little wide in the hips for me but not by much. (I got a small, I'm 5'4&#34; and 115 lbs). The quality isn't the best I've ever seen but seams look pretty good and it's as pictured."
4.0,"I like the material, but it does run small, the bust is tight for this size, and the sleeves are very tight, but do love the dress in general..."
4.0,"Cool product, very good quality socks!"
4.0,"This is a great watch. The little red dial is the second hand. It is a large watch with hefty weight. The watch-band is junk though, you will need to change it. It's a nice $50 watch with a ¬¢.8 band."
4.0,"this is so cute, comfy but this is the kind of fabric that looks old after a few washings, definitely wash this with a soft fabric detergent with the dress turned inside out, and do not put in dryer. the pattern of the fabric is cute and flattering to a fluffy figure. I ordered up 2 sizes and it fit."
4.0,Love this dress - a little long but cute still!!!
4.0,"Bought the smallest size for my kids, but it was too big and fits me instead!<br />Overall very nice mask and quality."
4.0,It is good product for the price
4.0,"Great shorts, very comfortable, and a. Ether looking material than your typical (and other mech-eng) shorts. However, I tried wearing them to a spin class, and they have no stretch at all. I think it may be an issue squatting as well."
4.0,Nice t-shirt.  Looks and fits as expected.  Would recommend this seller.
4.0,true to size very comfy
4.0,Its a  nice dress
4.0,"Earrings were very pretty,good value,very thick and stuck on good!!"
4.0,"Love the bands, some times loosens and has to be readjusted"
4.0,"I bought this shirt in a 2T for my son's second birthday party! The print is great, the shirt is great material, but the neck hole is SO SMALL. I had to force it over my 2 year old's head, which is a normal size for his age lmao. I recommend sizing up but overall a great buy for Taco TwosdayüåÆ"
4.0,Going by the reviews I got a very large size and it was STILL too short.  I am hoping I get it returned with the correct size (and hopefully a decent length)
4.0,"Pros: Good quality tights with pretty designs. Same colors as shown on screen.<br />Cons: Too large to be labeled as 0-6 months. Fits 5 to 6 months medium sized baby. This is my opinion: These tights don't need anti-slip feature for this size, because (generally) babies this age don't walk. The anti-slip pattern may not look pretty."
4.0,"I originally wrote a review and only gave these leggings two stars because these came in and the fabric felt very itchy, but after I washed them, they were much more comfortable and I LOVE THE POCKETS. The great thing, these leggings stay in place, so definitely SQUAT friendly. These RUN SMALL. I am a SMALL - MEDIUM but these mediums were TIGHT. I honestly would have been more comfortable in a LARGE. I'm 5'0 and 130lbs with a 28&#34; waist so yeah, these run pretty SMALL. But like I said, my first review was too critical. The fabric grew on me."
4.0,"Awesome dress though does fit funny in the arm holes, a bit of a sewing mishap I fixed myself."
4.0,This dress fits me good. I am 5‚Äô6 170 lbs. I ordered a large.. more of my weight is in my legs and butt so I have more of a curvy body so I thought this dress would help show off  my curves. I love the tie belt. The color is not a wine red. It is more of a bright red but still cute. The top fold over part isn‚Äôt as slouchy or loose as the picture. The dress is a good length and came to my knee. Over all this dress will look perfect for a night out and look very classy!
4.0,"Like the fabric, style, color and design.  Feels good against skin."
4.0,Love this dress that I bought 2 in different colors and may pick out a couole more. Flowy and the colors are lovely.
4.0,Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She was pleased.  The belt holder at the back is placed too high compared to the side holders so is unusable but not that noticeable.  I purchased a larger size than she usually wears because of the  reviews I read and glad I did as it does run small.
4.0,It fits good & looks good on me.
4.0,"I am very happy that this beautiful blouse fits me. I am a size 12 American. The chiffon ruffle is beautiful. The sleeves are a little short, as I am 5'8""inches. The fabric is different and synthetic. It works beautifully for my Christmas caroling costume as I have a cape to camouflage the fabric"
4.0,So cute but tight.
4.0,"It does everything it‚Äôs supposed to, but it doesn‚Äôt really feel as nice as I expected it to be.<br />It‚Äôs easier add keys compared to a traditional key ring, but I still find it to be a bit of a hassle. It‚Äôs probably a little less sturdy as well, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be an issue except in extreme cases.<br />While typical key rings are smooth and round, this metal has a texture to it and the square edges feel very unique. It‚Äôs also a lot thinner than I expected.<br />Honestly, it‚Äôs a great product for the price, and it‚Äôll work perfectly fine for me, but I think it just felt very different than what I was expecting, which led to some disappointment"
4.0,I recd the pendant<br />thank you
4.0,"Super cute outfit for Halloween, but arrived too late for sufficient use."
4.0,Honestly I would size down for true true compression. Otherwise great product
4.0,We decided to return the purse.
4.0,The prints weren't exactly as pictured and I ordered my normal size and thought it was very maternity esque on me so I ended up returning. I'd recommend sizing down and pairing with a belt.
4.0,"This tee is super soft and fits true to size.  The one negative is that the design is a pressed on decal and not silk screen so after a few washes I‚Äôm sure it will start cracking and peeling. For that I took off a star. After one wash, it‚Äôs still fine and tee did not shrink."
4.0,The only thing I didnt like is how thin it is. Other than that it does the job.
4.0,"I'm 5'9 amd a size 18. Based in the sizing description and the comments, I ordered the XL. WAAAAY to small. Other than that..the fabric and look are great! Returning and ordering the correct size."
4.0,"Fits great. I'm 5'10"", 160lbs, bcup, and it hangs nicely. Not too clingy, hides the post baby pooch.  Weird polyester fabric, but not unpleasant. Very pretty print in person."
4.0,"It's a belt dude, fits well, sturdy, soft leather, stock buckle looked good,(replaced with personal buckle) not much else to say"
4.0,Super cute! The hoops are a little bigger than I thought but still cute!
4.0,Very pretty. Fit as expected.
4.0,"I had a hard time finding cargo shorts that were a little longer inseam. These are great looking, but a little snug. I'm usually a size 8; these are a 10, and just fit. Otherwise, they're well made, nice looking and hold their shape."
4.0,Got it for a friend for her birthday. She loves it and has had people ask her where she got it. Downside is that it attracts a lot of static.
4.0,"It's a nice shirt with soft fabric. The tank top was a little loose for my liking, and the overshirt was a perfect fit. My only dislike is that they're connected so i cant wear a smaller tank top underneath. If i were to get a size smaller, i think the overshirt would be too small. Still cute though, and i would order again!"
4.0,I bought this gift for my 5 year old grand daughter who turned 6 in June. Everything fit...but not the shoes...they were too small. We gave the shoes to my 4 year old grand daughter who wears a size 11 shoe in little girls.
4.0,Seriously the cutest unicorn birthday outfit! True to size and good quality.
4.0,"Lense is a little darker than what I wanted, but very good."
4.0,I like them but they are smaller than 2mm and almost pink.
4.0,"I love these oversized corduroy pant..The only problem the ones I ordered look like they are pink and grey but are not,they are yellow ochre and grey..I still kept them cause I like that combo too.."
4.0,I felt so bad for my husband who felt like he had to get up every morning and put his watch on with his robe. Now this winder does all the work. It is dependable and practical--- what can I say other than it really works with his Rolex!!
4.0,Nice but my Oakley Juliet‚Äôs are too heavy for them to support and they sink
4.0,It‚Äôs very light weighted and very nice finishing too.
4.0,"The bow was nice but it is smaller than I expected. It shows a picture of an adult male wearing it but it is a little smaller than I wanted for my 8 year old son. The quality is nice, so I will still be using it."
4.0,"I had two concerns on ordering these based on other reviews: the smell and their elasticity.<br /><br />It might be the colored headbands from cosmos that have the smell, but there's no exceptional odor from the whites.<br /><br />I've used the same headband a few times now, and haven't noticed the elastic wearing out. You might be disappointed if you'd hoped to cut off the circulation to your scalp with one of these, but I can't complain.<br /><br />They absorb sweat, rinse, and dry without issue."
4.0,"this is so cute, I go it to go with my browns and other colors, I am a silver girl But this is so cute."
4.0,I love the way this dress fit on me. It's safe and very pretty.  Was not wrinkled much when I toke it  out of the bag. I thought it came with a  belt.  I did not receive a belt with this dress.  I received many compliments on this outfit.
4.0,"Very cute, soft, and comfortable. Thick enough that you can't see a bra through it. Has good stretch, and doesn't cling to me. Def recommend."
4.0,"These look great and stayed on the entire game without an issue. The reason I am giving them a 4 star rating is because when trying to remove the plastic from the front to apply the tat, some of the tat stuck to the plastic ruining 2 of them."
4.0,It looked great but wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable. Was a little stiff.
4.0,The fit was snug around the arms and chest. Thin material and a bit itchy. Other than that it‚Äôs fine.
4.0,The material wasnt what I thought but it was comfortable and fit good on me.
4.0,They add a nice touch of flare and I love them
4.0,"Nice for the price. The ring is size adjustable. The metal detail is good. So is the polish/sheen. The eyes of the owl look like resin, not glass. Who knows how long they'll last."
4.0,"Chain is a nice weight not too heavy, good clasp. Not a wear everyday piece- too big for me personally, but it's nice. Dulled quickly, however. Need a stainless cleaner."
4.0,The only problem i had was that the peircing were to short for my monroe peircing; however the fit well in my nose peircing. Love the diamond ones.
4.0,"The arctic blue sunglasses are great, they fit well, are light wt, good for fishing. For the price I would recommend."
4.0,"I choose this rating because though I liked the ring itself, it did not come with a box like it said it would in the description. It comes in a padded envelope with the ring inside a small, clear, zip lock bag. I also think the size runs a little smaller because I am having to return the ring and purchase a larger size. Other than that, the ring is what I expected it to be."
4.0,Fits exactly as expected. Very flattering cut. Nice soft material and adequate lining. I would‚Äôve liked the lining to cover the entire bodice but it‚Äôs still a very nice dress for summer.
4.0,"Great water wallet. Godo configuration.  But its a little crinkly.  Makes a little noise, but not too much.  And the corners are sharp to where they poke my butt and legs when I have it in my pocket.  I took a knife and rounded the corners, and that solved the problem.  But I shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />This is my second one.  Lost my first one at a waterpark in the Bahamas.  Anyone seen it? :)"
4.0,"I now have three different styles of these jog suits. As a hard working single mom I need something to throw on after work that's cute and comfortable. The blue denim jog suit is my favorite, as it hugs my backside and lifts it up a little. Great fit! Very pleased with this company and the true to size fit. I ordered three size mediums. The blue denim is a stretchier snug fitting fabric than my other two and fits perfect. I probably could have bought size small in the other two jog suits. The fabric isn't as clingy but they still fit well and look great!"
4.0,"Material is good and price, but very small,  my suggestion is to order one size bigger or two."
4.0,I like this comfy to wear over suit
4.0,"I bought these to wear in the hospital for nursing school, so my stretched lobes wouldn't be as noticeable. I wear 2g. They fit well, and they do a moderately good job of disguising my stretched lobes. Of course the color isn't perfect, but I think that's to be expected. The edges could have been rounded out a bit. They definitely seem like they were just popped out of a mold and sold without any smoothing/shaping. Overall, they fit, they're affordable, and they get the job done."
4.0,the leather is stiff so you have to break them in.  they rubbed blisters on top of my foot until the leather softened up.  Loved them once that happened
4.0,great bangles.
4.0,"Beautiful colors that don't run. Fit is a bit tight for my bust, a bit loose in the waist, really loose in the hip and thigh. But the fabric isn't too thin; it covers well. Length is to the middle of my foot, which is long for some people but I love it."
4.0,"Very attractive, casual shoe. Color as pictured."
4.0,Works well. Always wear long socks or leggings with boots to avoid chaffing.
4.0,good quality but larger than I expected
4.0,"I ordered an XL, I usually wear a L but I like my winter shirts baggy. I love the fit, style and colors. My only complaint is that it is thinner than I had expected. But, all in all it is a nice shirt. I ordered 3 colors and love them all."
4.0,"Love the color and the fit.  Texture a little rougher than I expected, but overall, I'm very happy with it."
4.0,Quality was good but it was to small.
4.0,"This product fits and feels very nicely and I'm crazy about it!  But it was just too, too, long!  So I  had to cut it.  But it's great for all day lounging, if you please.  :) ‚ô•"
4.0,I had to alter the waistline so it fit. When it wasn‚Äôt it looked so loose and I had to wrap something around my waist to make it look right.
4.0,"This top is roomy, soft and comfortable.  The sleeve are nonbinding and short enough to feel feminine.  I like that they don't come all the way down to the elbow.  The top is long enough to cover my bum.  The color is bright and has held up to washings."
4.0,THE MATERIAL IS SOFT. EXACTLY WHAT IS PICTURED
4.0,"The fit of this shirt is pleasantly roomy, without being baggy.  The sleeves are a tad too long though (I'm exactly average height,) which is mildly annoying.  I'm actually planning on hemming the sleeves into a three-quarter length once the weather gets warmer anyway, since the floral pattern is a little busy for a long sleeve.  But overall this is a very good shirt.  It's also great for traveling, as it's versatile and doesn't wrinkle easily."
4.0,"Pretty solid belt, especially for the price. I like that bigger sizes are available. The only issue I have is that due to the belt being reversible, the buckle area is very bulky. If you can put up with that, this belt is amazing."
4.0,I love the belt!  it lies flat as advertised; adjustable too.  I have a bit of trouble unhooking it but then I am not the most co-ordinated.  I would recommend it though
4.0,After 5 field trips in 2 years the lens popped out... For its price I feel it's definitely a must get item for every geologist!
4.0,Not as bright as I would like it to be. Quality is ok .
4.0,"Very quick delivery, nice watch for my grandson.  I'm sure he'll like it."
4.0,Very pretty - the chain is lovely and it's just the right size.
4.0,Not bad. But it's not as shiny as in the picture. Don't like the Polish. Keeps time as long as I wind atleast 3 times a day. I feel like I am the watch for this watch.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute and as described. The horn is stuffed and made of fabric so mine came bent. So it‚Äôs not really a unicorn straight horn it‚Äôs a sad looking horn.
4.0,"As far as scarfs go, and I don't wear many scarfs this sucker will surely keep you warm. I knew immediately this thing was going to be a diamond in the rough when I opened the exquisite box it a came in. Go right out and get yourself one of these."
4.0,"Good product, i bought these for basketball just to get my shooting rythm in order. Kinda cheap but does what i need it for."
4.0,"very cute & the colors were vibrant! a tad shorter than expected, but fits well. wore it on a puerto rican beach vacation, loved it so much i wore it multiple days!"
4.0,"Hubby calls this a coach proud style, which he does not like. Front panel larger, higher and more stuff than a traditional ball cap. Design and embroidery is as pictured."
4.0,"small, but very pretty"
4.0,Product arrived quickly and as described.  I'm excited to gift these to my Dad and his Twin brother next month for their 70th Birthday!
4.0,This top has great quality for a white top and not see thru at all. Based on reviews I thought it would be long enough for my long torso and 5‚Äô7‚Äù height. Unfortunately it was too short.  I bought a grey one also and that material was thinner and even shorter. If longer I would have loved the white.  The grey was too thin of a material
4.0,"Well constructed shirt and very cute for little boys. However, it does say ‚ÄòAHOY!‚Äô instead of Roar for the dinosaurs. To be fair, that‚Äôs also what it shows on the product photos, but it just doesn‚Äôt make sense. If you can get past that though, it‚Äôs a cute and durable shirt that fits true to size."
4.0,"It's pretty but, wasn't what we were looking for."
4.0,"These planters are really cute, but two of them arrived broken. Keep in mind that they are very small."
4.0,"The material isn‚Äôt great, can‚Äôt wear after a few wash. Can tell it‚Äôs cheap"
4.0,"While cute, the hat seems bigger (extra material). But I do know it will keep my 10 year old daughter warm"
4.0,This hat/gloves is so cute and warm! There is even a zip pocket on the right inside! Love it!
4.0,I love the pockets and the size is perfect. My only complaint is the strap is always sliding and does not stay adjusted to the length I want.
4.0,"I like these items,  they look good ."
4.0,Good but bigger than expected.
4.0,Favorite skirt
4.0,"Snug fit, but may be may not work with poor circulation."
4.0,"Honestly I had the best bridesmaid dress and so many people complemented me on it, but, my dress loop broke before the day was out so I couldn‚Äôt keep the back laced and in front of a crowd of 400 people. This is why bride should‚Äôve had an emergency sewing kit.. anyways don‚Äôt use the back as a corset/keep it loose enough or keep some thread around and you‚Äôll be set. I loved the custom measurements on the gown and how it flowed when I moved."
4.0,Super cute but a lil small. Had to add a longer chain.
4.0,"Beautiful scarf with lots of vibrant colors, extremely soft and long enough to be tied in multiple ways. I normally don‚Äôt pay this much for an accessory but this is beautiful!"
4.0,"Beautiful, good quality! I really like the lining."
4.0,I'm very happy with it. It's a beautiful color and fits everything I need!
4.0,"This dress is o.k.  It's a little snugger than I expected but shows my waist which I like because after losing a lot of weight I finally have an hourglass shape to show.  I purposely pull the dress up a little around the middle to create a ruching effect which makes the dress look better and makes me feel like it's not quite so snug.The design is attractive though not the best quality, but good enough for a cheap summer dress and the fabric is stretchy but also very sturdy and does not accentuate in imperfections instead it kind of smoothes imperfections.  This is not a dress I would wear to work or out to eat.  I would wear it for a night out at the beach though.  All in all a fairly good deal."
4.0,Love this color on me!  Fits perfect. I have a larger bust and sometimes these shirts are too tight. Great price as well.
4.0,The mask w/filter is comfortable and adjust easyly for a secure fit. Love the different colors I can match up with what I'm wearing. Great gift idea.
4.0,The back pockets are not as flat as I would like .
4.0,The toe strap is somewhat irritating on one foot. Hope it softens up because I really like the sandals
4.0,"Purchased this during a long hospital stay; the sleeves are short enough to allow for taking BP while on.  It was a little uncomfortable sleeping in, but otherwise worth the money"
4.0,Really cute! Was nervous about t being too long but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù 129lbs and got a small and fits perfectly!
4.0,It does say thermal. I don't know how I missed that. Your only wearing these when it's cold outside. Don't even try in the summer!
4.0,"I purchased these to handle a set of negatives that I was digitally scanning at home.  These gloves are perfect.  They are made of a durable woven cotton mix that is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  The only downside I found was that your hands seem to dry out from the material after long use, but these gloves are worth the money.  This package is a set of 5 that was more than enough for days of negative scanning.  Keeps the fingerprints off the negatives and they don't feel like they will disintegrate after an hour."
4.0,I like it fine especially for the price
4.0,Love the color but it was a least 3 sizes too small
4.0,The rose gold does not match the rose gold of watch face.
4.0,Nice sandals. Good for a few hours
4.0,I really loved the fabric and idea of the style of this dress but for my body type (I have a square body type) it just didn‚Äôt work. I think if you are curvy with a distinct waist area this dress would look great on you.
4.0,First off... it's HUGE.  Secondly it is made in Japan - guess they named it Heiden so you would think it is made in Germany? Third - it definitely looks cheap. I will say it is very quiet...will be interested in seeing how long it lasts.  I will update as I just received the winder and these are my first impressions.<br />0405 2018 UPDATE - still working and still quiet. It is pretty cheap looking but big test will be how long it lasts for the $$ paid - which by watch widing standards is pretty inexpensive. Upped rating to 4 stars.
4.0,Nice and cute.The only thing I wish it could be a bit bigger
4.0,"What I love about this glider is that it is great quality. . . glides smoothly, locks when you don't want it to glide, relaxes you with comfy cushions (like the arm cushions since I breastfeed -cushions kind of ""squeak"" though when you sit on them), arm rests are at a good height for me, the color fits into our nursery scheme, and it has a matching ottoman that you can purchase to go along with it.<br /><br />What bothers me about this ottoman is that it's not really very wide in the seat!  Sounds crazy, I know.  I'm not a large person, but I'm also not petite.  (I'm 5 foot 9 inches tall, weighing 140 pounds.)  Now that my baby is 7 months old, it seems like it's getting very tight for nursing him while sitting in this glider.  Not to mention, my derriere just seems to fit pretty snugly in the seat. . .<br /><br />Seems that there is another glider out there that would be the perfect, comfortable width.  But you'd probably have to pay more.  This glider is worth the money despite the width!<br /><br />*note:  I wrote the original review for this in 2003.  Now it's August 2005, and we're still enjoying this glider EVERYDAY with my two/almost three year old at storytime!  Worth the money!"
4.0,"Nice top, runs a size big.  My daughter is 5'5 and 112 pounds so I ordered a size small but it was big in the arm holes and too long.  Also fabric is solid blue, not heather blue as shown."
4.0,Light and looks like a normal dress
4.0,"I really like the Vockets camisoles bc the side pockets are easily accessible and they are deep enough. My phone fits in both pockets and the shoulder straps are wide enough to cover my bra straps. Not that it matters bc I wear a shirt over the camisole. That makes the phone at my side even less noticeable, but easy to retrieve. I like the fit, which is snug so the phone stays sedure."
4.0,"Love pearls, but thought the stems should have been a little longer."
4.0,Beautiful and soft on the inside! Can't wait to give it away as a gift. Only thing I didn't like was that it came with shoulder straps yet no loops to hook them on to. Guess you can put them where the handles are attached?
4.0,Love the designs but it was too small for adult ears. Fit perfect on my 12 yr old daughter
4.0,I like the backs of these earrings.  They screw on and stay on. They are a simple look and I wear them all the time.  The backs are also rounded and it makes wearing while side sleeping comfortable
4.0,"The dress fit well, material is a bit see through. will need to wear with a slip."
4.0,"I never really order clothes online, but I‚Äôm really glad! It was a little wrinkley but it fits well and isn‚Äôt too short or too long :) wearing it after my wedding"
4.0,The sandal itself fit well both in length and width. The straps were too long and I needed to add an extra hole for the buckle.<br />Not everybody who has a longer shoe length has a wide width.
4.0,"It's nicely made and the pockets are wonderful.  However, it is SUPER long!!  With it's thickness, difficult to wrap twice around the neck.<br />I bought it for someone in a nursing home, hoping that she could wear it when in a wheelchair or sitting up in bed, and keep things in the pockets<br />but it is way too long for that."
4.0,This dress fits just right and flatters my figure. Every time I wear it I get compliments.
4.0,"For the price, I didn't expect super high quality. Although this is not really high end, it's a great value for the money. The skirt is just long enough to add some modesty for parts I'm not eager to flaunt, yet the suit doesn't scream &#34;granny&#34;, it's quite flattering. There's a bit of &#34;crinkle&#34; in the mid-section to camouflage less attractive &#34;bumps&#34;, and the bust is deep enough to show some sexy &#34;bumps&#34;."
4.0,"Doesn't seem too sturdy, probably because the straps are thin, but that seems necessary for the style. They are very cute and they haven't broken yet. For the price, I might buy a 2nd pair just in case."
4.0,Looks bigger than it actually is.  Seems well made.
4.0,I really like this shirt. Fits great.
4.0,"fits my wife great, it is heavy material though, so maybe use as a fall or winter dress, overall pleased"
4.0,A little more sheer than I thought.
4.0,"I read that I should order a size bigger than usual. That isn‚Äôt right, you should order your normal size. They are fantastic if you order the correct size. They don‚Äôt feel very cottony and are more stretchy but I love the pockets and they are very comfy!"
4.0,"These units are exactly the way I like them.  Heavyweight cotton poly blend.  No zippers, no flair, no nonsense.<br />I would have given this fat bastard a 5 star rating, but the neck is slightly constrictive."
4.0,"Quality is good, but overpriced too much."
4.0,"Actually these fit good. I had a bit of a pocket above my butt area because I have a small waste, but otherwise. I love them."
4.0,"These are very pretty. They look very nie. They look better than a lot of the plain types that you see. You did have to put eveyrthing together, and that did take a little while. So you have to plan for that and it can be a little frustrating.  But once you have them done, they worked well and were easy to use. They weren't a bad deal for how nice they looked. Overall, as long as you are okay spending a few mintues on them, they are very nice."
4.0,Cute. Quality- ok. Nothing special
4.0,"These were absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately they were bigger than I expected. When I saw that it was a quarter of an inch, I imagined that being smaller. It was my mistake but unfortunately they're too big for me and hang off the edge of my ear when I wore them. I gave them to my mother instead and she fell in love with them and gets lots of complements!"
4.0,Muy buena calidad y grosor de la tela
4.0,I ended up keeping the dress because the price was right.  I am 5'10&#34; and the dress is shorter than I would like but I decided not to worry too much about that since it was only $15.  But I do think this dress would be better on a person not quite as tall as I am.
4.0,This is a very pretty glass case.  It is a hard shell and will protect your glasses.  I couldn't give it a 5 star because my women's sunglasses would not fit in the case.  I decided to keep it and use it for my regular glasses.
4.0,"Loved this dress, wore to my rehearsal dinner and was told I look like a princess. Quality is great and it‚Äôs super cute! Only reason I rated 4 stars is because the bottom comes pretty wrinkled and is hard to steam."
4.0,This is a nice dress however it would be better if made of a soft cotton material and not the spandex. It is not forgiving and shows everything. It is also too long. I have to wear it bunched up at my hips to walk in it. It is a nice dress just needs to be made out of a softer material with some give.
4.0,fit daughter as expected
4.0,"These pants are so flattering! I'm 5'2"" and 115-120 lbs, so they were a big long and a bit loose. Had to roll a couple times at ankle to make them look length appropriate. I will keep them, as the baggier style is still attractive, but I do wish they had a smaller size available."
4.0,"Look awesome, feel awesome, but after about 6 weeks they start to fade."
4.0,The fit iz perfect ...
4.0,"It runs small fir its size but it‚Äôs a soft, nice shirt"
4.0,"very cute watch band looks durable, but the base color is not a green which I was hoping for xmas.  Its more of a teal blue color, not very xmas-y."
4.0,"The quality of the ring is very good, especially for the money.  My only complaint is that it‚Äôs  much larger and heavier than I expected.  I have fairly large hands and as you can see in the picture it looks like I‚Äôm a kid wearing his dads ring.  It really makes it uncomfortable to wear, and it slides on my finger easily due to the weight.<br /><br />With that said, if you really want all of your fantasy football friends to notice the ring across the room, this will work well for that."
4.0,"The watch band looks excellent when new. However, after some time wearing it the paint did wear off a little."
4.0,Hermoso buena calidad
4.0,Elegant. Low price. Suit for business use.
4.0,"I am 5'1, 140 lbs. I normally wear a Medium but I ordered an XL because most of the reviews said this was small. It fits pretty nice except the length is a bit long. I usually have this problem though considering I am quite short.<br /><br />Other than the length, the matetial is quite nice & matches the picture.<br /><br />I did struggle with the zipper for about 5 minutes but after that it zips no problem."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, it was a little long for the thickness of it but still a great accessory."
4.0,was exactly what I was looking for
4.0,Love them except for the fact that my 5 year old broke the strap within a couple days.  We've had the glasses since November now and he loves wearing them.  Wish the straps weren't so expensive but we found a better alternative for that.
4.0,"Nice style, a little big around the waist, I moved the buttons and changed different type, now the coat fits just right and looks good too."
4.0,Item is just as pictures and its super cute.
4.0,Haven‚Äôt pinned them on anything but seem to be pretty cute. Bigger than I thought.
4.0,Color was not as bright as photo but belly button ring fit well and does not cause any discomfort.
4.0,"I've only purchased/worn one other adhesive bra prior to this one. I purchased the other one at Target and unfortunately couldn't find it anymore in the store. I came across this one online which had pretty good reviews and was about $8 cheaper. The bra was very easy to apply and also easy to adjust as needed. I was able to wear a semi fitted dress without any outlines showing and I liked the fact that the cup is ""rounder"" so it doesn't make it look like you have a ""pointy"" chest. The bra held up for the most part throughout the night. My only complaint is that the outer edges would come off my skin once in awhile and i would have to apply pressure to adhere it back on. It's possible that I could have applied the bra either too far apart or too close....I'll have to adjust it the next time I wear it and update my review/rating accordingly."
4.0,"Nice ear warmers. Good price. Durable. Actually color is black. I like the packaging it all came in the pouch pictures is to store the warmers when not in use. I would probably use them in the washer too. My only issue is they don't have the same bend as my last pair. The medium size was bigger so that may be a factor a well. Overall, good purchase"
4.0,good price for 10 watches
4.0,Warm and good for winter but somewhat stiff and also will take up a lot of room in shoes that fit the child well- need to wear with a half size up boot
4.0,"The material is not breathable, no room for stretch. If you prefer comfort order a size up. But overall makes a cute top."
4.0,"Love these, very comfy. They get a tiny bit sheer around the knees when I sit but otherwise no problems there. They are nice and form fitting which is what I am looking for in a legging I have bought some leggings before that sag down in the crotch or don't fit snugly throughout the leg these are nice and elastic and they are tight all the way down."
4.0,They look great yet are very snug. Meaning I might have to oil my hands up just to get them in all the way. But they look cool.
4.0,GREAT FOR DRIVING
4.0,These earrings are super cute! They are a little bigger then I expected so I was worried that they would be too heavy but they are actually very lightweight! The metal is a little rough and scratchy but they are still very pretty!
4.0,A little shorter than expected but still very cute in person!
4.0,Perfect beach or lake bag
4.0,Good to wear everyday. Simple and gorgeous! Well made and not heavy.
4.0,Great piece. Order up a size though - runs small.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:f43ab3f3cbceaa728abde99367356e78]] The ZANZEA Women's One Off Shoulder Striped Irregular Maxi Dress is a very comfortable dress. I love the loose fit of this dress that is lightweight yet still thick enough to wear outside of the house. I purchased this as an around the house dress to lounge in however I can wear this out. By simply adding a pair of leggings and a camisole I am ready to hangout completely comfortable. What‚Äôs even more awesome is that I can wear this as a beach coverup also with a floppy hat. Now I purchased this two sizes too big and I should have only purchased it one size up. Overall I am very pleased.<br />This product was received at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased review
4.0,"My daughter is a new rider and we‚Äôve ordered several pants from a few places. She likes these but the Kerritt‚Äôs feel better on, look better and appear to have a longer life most likely. These were shorter than I hoped in length."
4.0,Super cute but I ordered a medium and it was to big. Sending it back for a small. If it helps someone Iam 5'3 and 123 pounds.
4.0,"Well made, supportive shoes."
4.0,"Good waist trainer/shaper combo. The straps do dig in a bit on my shoulders, but I can remove them and wear it strapless and it stays in one place all day."
4.0,"Great, thanks!!!"
4.0,They fit great my only real complaint is that I don‚Äôt really have much of a butt to keep them up without the string.
4.0,"Very cute, fits to size, and comfortable. No listing of what its made out of though, so im not sure how to iron it."
4.0,They work well but you must be careful putting them on to not rip it
4.0,"Would normally order small, but I listened to size chart and ordered medium. Fits good. 4 stars because it‚Äôs suppppperrrr thin. No warmth here"
4.0,"I love the look of it, I adjusted to the additional weight it carried, but after a few days it turned my skin green."
4.0,Very nice set of glasses. All accesories came as shown in pictures. Also received ahead of time.
4.0,"They have changed the fabric from what it used to be, so am not as happy with it."
4.0,Nice watch looks just like picture
4.0,I do like this watch the face is large enough for a quick glance to see the time<br />i hoped it would be a little weightier but LOVE it & everyone who sees it comments on it
4.0,"I wear these under my work polo shirts. They are snug, but comfy. Adds a little warmth and covers all my tattoos. If you don't like a tight fit, order a size up."
4.0,A little hard to get on as they fit so snug. The feel great once on!
4.0,"Could of done without a face on the back side, but who knows, it may come in handy later."
4.0,"The paint and molding were both very good quality. I think the product should be about $2 cheaper, but it is a nice keychain."
4.0,Was very nice got for my granddaughter
4.0,"Comfortable, but disappointed I couldn‚Äôt use for sports since there is no way cup pocket."
4.0,"I wanted a step counter along with an analog face.  This has it, and I can connect it to my phone so that I can customize timers for workouts.  It would be great if the app connected to other apps to track fitness so I didn't have to manually do it.  And I am still trying to figure out how best to make the timers.  I guess I could read the instructions, but who has time for that?"
4.0,I like this a lot but i hate the high/low hem line.
4.0,The quality is very nice - material soft and cuddly.  They do run a bit large.
4.0,cute shoe
4.0,They are really good cheep chains. They are not real metal but they are still good quality if you were looking for some cute accessories for cheep. The main problem was the false advertising in the heart belt because it‚Äôs a clip on chain like the rest.
4.0,Glad I bought this top as it was easy to get on/off post-surgery.  Good quality and fit as expected.  Washes well too.  I think it's overpriced at nearly $50 at my time of purchase.
4.0,They was a gift.
4.0,Super cute but if your looking to cover your long hair its not for you.
4.0,I got a medium fits nice I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 191 haven‚Äôt worn yet will in January.
4.0,"I thought it would be a lot easier to get the keys on it, but not really."
4.0,"I ordered the women‚Äôs size 7 and they are too big.  Part of the problem is the part that goes across the foot ‚Äì it is too loose, so my food slides forward.  That puts the ball of my foot right on top of the ridge that should be in the gap between the foot and the toes.  Therefore, the slide is not comfortable to wear for long periods.  If they fit they would be comfortable.  They have some nice features ‚Äì a raised part for the heel of the foot, the previously mentioned ridge that should function as a toe grip.  Now that rain has started falling in California, it is convenient to keep them by the door so I can change out of wet shoes.  The quality is excellent and the price is what I might expect."
4.0,"Since the straps broke within a few hours, the company refunded my money right away. I was pleased with this and will purchase from them again."
4.0,"I wanted a top suited to warm, early fall weather in autumn hues. This works. I sized up one size and I am glad I did. The arms are a bit long but a size smaller would have been snug in the bust. I ordered an XL. I usually wear a large or a 14. I am a 36D, 5'6"" and 165lbs. if that helps determine sizing.<br />Although this is styled like a sweatshirt, the fabric is lighter more like french terry."
4.0,They look great but the cheap plastic cracked just wearing them around.  Still usable but not going to last very long.
4.0,Fit nicely but I was a little disappointed that the dress had more blue than in the picture
4.0,I was very surprised at how thick the pendant on this necklace is.  It almost looks like you are wearing an electronic device. I doubt that I will wear this because the thickness completely changed the appeal. It actually looks kind of odd.  There is also no way to shorten the necklace.
4.0,The chain isn‚Äôt as long as pictured so be sure to read the description. I love the necklace though.
4.0,Super cute and can literally go with any outfit!
4.0,i needed completely sealed eye area and these fit that need. the plastic is a bit harder than expected but tolerable. I have a more comfortable completely sealed  goggles that i prefer but needed a back up since my fav is sold out. The goggles will have to go over most n95 masks in order to see without distortion in the lower portion. if you don't mind moving your head down to view there is no issue.  In order to fix this issue i have to place the goggles over the top portion of the mask but hey will fog  if the mask has any gap. if you are lucky enough to find an anti  product that actually works... great otherwise.. maybe it will not fog if you wear a lesser protection type mask ..THESE ARE NOT ANTI FOG GOGGLES
4.0,"Cute and fits well, but the one we received had cap sleeves, not sleeveless as pictures and listed. We kept it because my daughter needed it for her first class."
4.0,wish it fit gave it to a friend
4.0,"I love my bag!  I take it to the gym with me almost every day.  Its sturdy, eco-friendly and there is plenty of room for my things.<br /><br />It's nice to know that I purchased a product that I use regularly and helped children at the same time."
4.0,Cute scarf for summer and fall only because its on the thin side.
4.0,My only recommendation is they could be a little larger.
4.0,"This has all the compartments and card slots that I could want. I'm not too fond of the different patterns on the flap and the rest of the bag, but it's a very functional purse."
4.0,I really like this top as it fits well and the color is great.  The material is little heavier than I like but it‚Äôs a keeper
4.0,"I LOVE the style of this suit. However, I normally wear either a size small or medium (depending on the brand/cut). I ordered a medium in this and could barely get it on. I can't imagine possibly pulling it back on if I'd already gotten wet and then needed to slip it off to use the restroom. I would HAVE to have a large for it to fit comfortably. As others have stated, it is large in the chest area as well. I'd for sure have to alter the cup area if I exchanged for a large.<br />Hate to return this because it is AMAZING in style. But the fit just isn't quite right."
4.0,At first sight my daughter loved these after 1 week the eye balls fell off and the backs broke
4.0,"The product looks nothing like the picture, it is latex or rubber. Works ok as a mask but smells odd. It is better used as a prop and looks really good as one."
4.0,they were too big and size S was out of stock :-(
4.0,Web belt is thin and flimsy.  Buckle very nice.
4.0,"Those sandals are simply beautiful and I get many compliments wearing them. The first pair that came needed to be returned because the straps were too big and it made sandal feel loose on my foot, also little detail on the front strap had a tiny shiny stone missing. I ordered another pair and they fit me perfectly and look great. I love them and and can't wait to put them on again next time I go out.<br />As I am updating this review a little, I want to mention I still love the sandals, I get many compliments on them the only bad is those little shiny details on the straps fall off :( for that reason I made my review 4 and not 5 stars."
4.0,it is made nice but it is a little to small for my wrist.
4.0,"Was skeptical but very very nice. Yes like others say its a little tight to put 15 Credit  Cards etc, but 5 will do just fine. And it does strecha little."
4.0,Bought this item for my wife and it fits well and is of great quality
4.0,"Fit great and received lots of compliments. It‚Äôs great quality, my only complaint is there is was a small run in the material when I received it."
4.0,"True to size, good material."
4.0,"I really like the fit, except for the arms, they were like and inch or two too long."
4.0,"These earrings are for the woman that is simple, a plane Jane, or even a little girl. They are very tiny. Cute for if you have a second or 3rd hole in your ear. But I like a little more &#34;umph&#34; so they are a tad too small.  BUT DARLING"
4.0,Girlfriend loved it! Warm and comfy she said.
4.0,"I loved the way it came out but i wasn't aware of the tag being so thick and heavy. I expected a much thinner tag like the regular type of dog tags, but overall i liked it."
4.0,"The material feels great! I had to take it to a seamstress to give me a better quality zipper bcuz it wouldn't zip up then after i forced it ro go up thwn it wouldn't go down. Overall, I love this skirt & I can't wait to wear this out & about!"
4.0,"I really like these, but one pair arrived with a hole in them, so I can't give five stars."
4.0,They fit great but it's because I read the reviews on ordering up because they run small -- have never ordered a size xxl in anything -- have a 9.5 - 10 size foot so shouldn't need an XXL but in these slippers that's what I needed to fit my foot
4.0,these will work well for a child but a little short for an adult
4.0,"Very pretty, though the ribbon is stiff and not the best of quality. The belt is beautiful though. Because it was so long, I just doubled it and it worked fine. It helped to dress up my outfit!"
4.0,"The color is gorgeous (red violet with sparkle). Immediately unpacking it the material is very thin. You can see right through it just picking it up. I was planning to return but after trying it on, I can‚Äôt wait to wear it! It fits so damn well. I wish I had a swimsuit just like it. I will definitely wear some pasties on my nipples. Super flattering fit. I am 5‚Äô and curvy and the medium fit perfectly."
4.0,I ordered a S it was big. Sadly they don‚Äôt have in XS. Good quality tho!
4.0,Very nice for the price it's perfect.
4.0,I've only worn a couple of these but they're very comfortable& stay in place. They're pretty too!
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute but after two times wearing it, it got a hole in it. Customer service was great and did send a replacement."
4.0,A bit too heavy for travel.
4.0,"A decent product, but they are sized too small. If you're an average American, buy a size or even two sizes larger than normal."
4.0,"So I just did my first batch on clothing ordering online.  This shirt was one of the 10 shirts I ordered all at once. (yes I went for it ha) I am not a real review writer but since I pretty much bought everything I bought based on reviews and pictures of all you lovely people I feel like I should return the favor so bare with me...<br /><br />This shirt is great! I am 5'9 235lbs and it can be hard to find clothing that fits long when it is supposed to be long. I ordered true to size at a XL and it wasn't as lose as I would have liked. I kind of knew it might not be when I didn't order it big. I am one that likes a little closer fit MOST of the time so I'm good with how it fits but if you want baggy order up. The shirt feels like a typical t-shirt and the little bands around the arms are like sticky tape. I think if I would have gotten the shirt bigger that might have bothered me (cause it may have stuck together) but since it is tight on me it pulls to where it needs to be. That being said the bands have a strange smell, that is why I rated it 4  and not 5 stars. I washed it and hung to dry there was no shrinkage and the smell went down. I think with a couple washes it will be gone. *It was NOT as bad as some people made it seem** I have big and long arms and you can see from the photo that the arms are a little tight but still fit good. If you went a little bigger fit ordering a size up would be a good idea.. The arms were definitely long enough which makes me happy<br /><br />I run a infant daycare so all my clothing has to be comfortable and movable and this shirt fits the bill. I love that no part of the shirt rides up anywhere it's not supposed to."
4.0,Needs elastic in the waistband.  Ran on the big side.  My boy is a small 9yo and the 8 was falling down.  I thought I kept the 7 and it fit but didn‚Äôt realize and didn‚Äôt have time to slter. See arms and legs.
4.0,Purchased as gift- good color and size
4.0,The seller was upfront about shipping questions. The wife liked the earrings and that's what mattered. The size was just right for her. The posts are rather thin and a bit shorter than usual but they are 14K. The main gem is an extremely light colored green and shows up better on blue or green clothing. The black diamond is a nice off-set to the piece. Overall very satisfied with it and the price was great.
4.0,Soft and fluffy. It has a nice thick lining inside and stands up well in the wash. Short in the arm length and a little short on me at 5'11.
4.0,"Very nice necklace, dainty chain and not much detail on the elephant. Overall, pleased with this purchase"
4.0,This is a great newsboy cap that's constructed well and is a good value at under $15. Dress up or dress down with it and easy to care for.
4.0,"Great fit and look, I'd order more of these. HOWEVER, I ordered the &#34;red wine and khaki&#34; pairs. The red is similar to the online photo and met my expectations. The &#34;khaki&#34; is definitely not similar to the online photo and did not meet my expectations - the color of the product I received is most definitely brown. So I was a little bummed about that."
4.0,"I wanted a tennis style bracelet that I could wear on a daily basis - delicate enough to be pretty but sturdy enough to be durable, and I found it in this bracelet.  I am petite and the 6 1/2 &#34; length is very good for me.  I did have to tighten the safety catches but that was easy."
4.0,I bought this my three year old niece to carry her glasses. She really likes the exterior design and the color perfectly matches her glasses. Great find.
4.0,They are thicker than the title &#34;ultra Thin&#34; implied
4.0,The wrap around the waist is baggy and takes away from the design. The material is also see through. Otherwise it would have been a very nice dress.
4.0,These stay on great. One pair got a hole first wear otherwise would have given 5 stars
4.0,Great for the beach. A little long though (I'm 5&#34;3)
4.0,"This item is very cute and is good quality!  It is shorter than I thought it would be, it does not go to my waist as expected."
4.0,Dopeüëçüëçüëç
4.0,Beautiful skirt. Easily snags.
4.0,I like the material and the length but it definitely runs small. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large because I am pregnant. It fits just like the medium should...
4.0,"I like this dress it looks just like the picture and to be honest when i took it out the bag i was thinking who is going to be wearing this certainly not me and what i meant b that was how small it looked. I put it on hesitantly and voila it fit. looks nice on me I just need to loose some of my belly feels comfortable though not to tight I would recommend this dress.  I think I read that if it's no pictures the review is fake, this isn't fake I don't look good in pics but i am going to an event in a few weeks if I can get a pic of the dress while I'm wearing it I will post.<br /><br />I had to request a return because upon further inspection of the dress it shows where the sewing isn't quite right, and would most likely not last past 1 wear.  I was offered a $6 refund and took it, it's better than nothing, I could have gotten a full refund if I was willing to pay to send it back which would have most likely cost what I paid for the dress.  I still like it but would probably not purchase another one."
4.0,"This is a smooth, low-profile watch band. The 3 stars instead of 4 is because the band is still a little too big. The Velcro patch location makes it difficult to try and get the band wrapped small enough.  If you have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sized wrist, this would be a good option to switch band  colors and not pay the Apple band price.<br /><br />Shipping is was very quick."
4.0,"These are overall nice for lounging, and I'd feel fine going out in these as well. However if you just want comfort and staying at home, the zippers detract from that as they are scratchy. Going out they are useful to make sure you don't lose something. So decide if functionality outweighs comfort for you. I'm keeping the one I got, but looking for another for just indoors. Reasonably cool and lightweight wear, but not the coolest material if that's highest on your list. Soft yes."
4.0,This pack is a great value. They are stretchy- more like a underwear material than cotton... so idk about that. But they fit adults too. A bit loose on my 6 year old who they were intended for.  But will work so we can have a clean mask each day for school.
4.0,"To me, they were snuggling. Sorry. Loved the material, love the brand but they were just snug could of gone with a size up. Don't won't skin tight Grey shorts."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù, 150lbs, bought medium based off measurements.<br />It‚Äôs not form fitting as I had thought it would be(the waist string doesn‚Äôt tighter the outer layer), and it‚Äôs a bit longer than I anticipated. It‚Äôs a bit tight at the shoulders, but feels a bit baggy everywhere else. However, the outer material is nice and pretty thick, and the fuzzy interior is very soft and warm. Plus being able to take fur off is a huge bonus."
4.0,I love the shape and color. They are a bit on the flimsy side
4.0,Family loved the key chain in memory of a family member
4.0,"This was a gift, my thank you note referred to the &#34;amazing shirt&#34;."
4.0,"The only downside is that Mickey's head flops around some and gets in the way, but my son loves them anyways!"
4.0,Fits in pocket easily and holds all my cards and they stay
4.0,"Its good for what I paid for, almost 11 bucks and it looks good all around :3. The only things i find wrong with it are size which I had read was unexpected anyway so I wasn't too unprepared,as well as the engraving on the inside. It's more pushed out than in which is the opposite of the anime but hey, it's all fine and dandy in the end.<br /><br />Now upon acquiring the watch you will probably have it set to the wrong time, it's easy to fix but it took me few minutes to figure out how to do it. On the button you push to open it there is a little twisting thing that looks like a King's crown, just pull that up and you can set the time, push down when set. Simple yet I'm sure I'm not the first to stumble on that."
4.0,Gos material
4.0,"fitted perfectly and very pretty on‚Ä¶at 50 I felt pretty special when I overheard a couple of young ladies (20‚Äôs) saying how nice it was‚Ä¶  looked exactly like the photo‚Ä¶one down side, the collar is a type of cardboard and I expect it to only last 3-4 washes before I have to swap it out for something a little more suitable.. for the price tho was great."
4.0,These are perfect for hiding my gauges at work. I am a high ranking professional and these make it look like I have regular earrings in. Definitely hope to find more like them in different styles.
4.0,Nothing fancy here. Nice and comfortable for every day wear. A little large but figured they would shrink in the dryer.
4.0,"This is great, looks adorable, and fits well on my bracelet."
4.0,"This is a very pretty cover up, the color is beautiful and the material feels light as air and soft. I was happy to see this was plenty large to cover up with, I  wear between and Large and XL in tops and dresses and this easily fit around my hips and bust with room to spare.  It comes with a tie so that you can tighten it to the size you want.  In the short time that I have had this I have found a few different ways to wear this not only as a sarong, but also a vest and scarf.  I am very happy with this product! I was provided this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest feedback. All of my reviews are my own unbiased, honest opinions.  I do not receive monetary compensation for my feedback and I am not required to leave positive reviews."
4.0,Fits kids skates with a little extra room.  Would be nice if it were a tiny bit bigger.  I had bought another type of bag that had extra pockets etc and do not like it as it is enormous... almost like carrying around a backpack.  This skate bag is much more reasonable.
4.0,"it runs quite small but otherwise good product, good for sport"
4.0,Bought for a friends son and he has worn it every day since I gave it to him
4.0,"It's really cute and the stitching is good, but the photos are innacurate because it doesn't fit as big and long as the photos show. I'm 5'2 and it almost covers my butt and it barely reaches my wrists. I'm still happy with my purchase but if you're taller than me I dont think you'll be happy with its length."
4.0,Super comfortable lounge outfit. It does run a bit big so I would definitely size down if you don't want it too baggy but it is comfortable and fits in your regular size.  The fabric is not too thick like sweats. It just a nice average size thickness. It winches at the waist as well.
4.0,"I like the jacket although it runs a bit small. I have broad shoulders and long arms plus a set of DDs and jackets are never large enough. So I ordered the XXL anticipating a roomy fit.<br />The jacket fits like a XL - - sleeves go to bottom of the wrists and it zips over my chest. Shoulders feel OK but only with a henley or thinner shirt. No way could I wear a sweater under this jacket. The hood covers my head but barely. I wish it were larger.<br />The material is a polyester and spandex blend and repels water well. It is not stretchy. Since there's no rain in my town now, I put on the jacket and soaked the sleeve under the kitchen faucet for one minute. The water ran off and left my sleeve dry. The jacket is lined.<br />I'm not happy with the snaps. They seem flimsy. Time will tell if they will rip out of the fabric or not.<br />There are two snap front pockets on the grey camo jacket. The colors are dark and muted so it doesn't look like a traditional camo pattern which is good."
4.0,"It's nice, but very thin fabric"
4.0,"When I read the description, &#34;Loose Fit&#34;, I was hoping for a looser fit than the typical tank top. It is loose, but just not as much as I wanted. Still this tank top is closer to what I wanted then another tank top I ordered. So you know the material is thin, think T-shirt."
4.0,"I really like this sleeve, I love the color and all the details that it has. I always buy this brand and I really like it.."
4.0,"Worked great for my daughter's soccer team (ages 9-10).  Her team wore them for about 4 games in 4 weeks and my daughter said they stretch out just a little bit, but they are comfortable to wear."
4.0,Tight in the bust and it stretches but the pattern stretches really bad with it. Otherwise comfy and cute
4.0,"It fits ok.  I wear glasses and I'd assume they'd have a similar effect as to wearing eye protection, but the protection is a bit tight.  It smushes the glasses into the face in a rather unpleasant manner.  On other notes, it looks great, and the padding feels about right.  The protection doesn't shift much when moving so that is a plus.  For looks, it works out great.  Your eyes can be seen through the mesh, but the rest of it works out well."
4.0,Love bathing suit ordered it a size up because I thought it was going to be to small. It still fits and it has amazing hold
4.0,lil tight
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my maternity pictures. I was a little nervous because usually white is see threw, especially under the bright flashes, but this material is thick and a little heavy, which was what I was hoping for. I ordered a small and it fits, so I would say it runs a somewhat big since I'm 7 months pregnant. All in all this dress was perfect for what I was looking for."
4.0,Nice dress at a good price
4.0,"I got this jacket in 2X and thought it would be bigger than expected since I usually get 1X or a size Large.  Anyway it fits fine even when I wear a thick sweater.  I thought the whole jacket would be lined, but it's not.  It works fine as a fall or spring type jacket."
4.0,Perfect fit but when you wash them they get wrinkled.
4.0,These caps are huge. Good for braids or someone with lots of hair.
4.0,"As my title suggests, this is a very handsome shoulder bag. Very roomy, with a lining that may be physically a little thin; I would have been happier if the cloth chosen had been more substantial. But I love the stark contrast of the black and white leather stripes; given my body shape, this is the only way I will wear horizontal stripes!<br /><br />This purse is worth the price;Vitalio Vera gives you a lot of bang for your buck. If I had one disappointment, it is a small one.....the belt design on  the outside must be unbuckled to comfortably access the contents, and the top zipper is not really necessary. But other than than, nice bag."
4.0,Very cute feel like cotton dress. Returning because it is very large on me. I typically wear a size 8-10 dress and I ordered a large...could probably fit in a small
4.0,"The material is light weight but see through. Overall, it's a cute top and good for summer."
4.0,"I‚Äôve had the bronze version of these sunglasses for almost two years. I have treated them carefully until I sat on them last week. I ordered another of those and this one. I like them a lot, though they are fragile."
4.0,"I am usually s-m and went with medium. It was a good choice. I ended up returning it because it was a little too fit around the arms for me. That's a personal issue for me. A friend tried it on and said it fit great and we are the same size. I got it for a 50s costume but also something I could continue to wear. Although I returned it, it was  a nice dress and good material"
4.0,"Nice item, the one ear was broke from where it connected to the band but was still wearable and my daughter liked it! All diamonds were good on ears!"
4.0,"This dress is very sexy! I 5'0 and 135 so I got a size medium, but it was a little small. I gave it to my sister who is two sizes smaller than I am and it fit her perfect. I got this dress for a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"It feels and looks good. I am just 5""4 and feel it is little shorter. I wear S size."
4.0,"Although I appreciate the protective sticker on the front to protect the screen, it was rather difficult to peel off and I ended up scratching some parts of it and a few pieces of the sticker is stuck in the corners. But the overall product is amazing! I love it so much and everyone got a kick out of it from my vacation to key west!"
4.0,"I purchased the 3X and the dress fit just as expected. Smooth,tight,with a well needed stretch. Would reccommend some type of shape wear being worn underneath. I would definitely purchase again."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace that looks just like what is posted. It came from China, so shipping took a while. I get lots of compliments on it and it goes with lots of outfits. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the chain sometimes pulls my hair."
4.0,"Love the design. Recommend this for Astros fans.  I did not research, but assumed this was a hard cover case that would be protective against being dropped.  It is not.  It‚Äôs handsome, I like it, but wish it was protective against drops."
4.0,Ordered an XL because of the reviews. I'm 5'8&#34; and wear a medium/large. The XL is huge on the lower part and fits like a tourniquet on my bust. Very sloppy sewing job. Loose threads everywhere and the zipper it's very poorly installed. Not sure how I'll alter it but I'll check jive something out.
4.0,This is a really nice product. The materials used seem to be top notch. The leather has a great hand feel. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars; it is giant. Much bigger than I thought when I ordered it. The wallet does fit in the pocket of my jeans (relaxed fit). It feels like a woman's clutch instead of a wallet.
4.0,"The earrings are very cute, only problem I have is they are so large"
4.0,Pieces are repeated just gold clasps and silver clasps
4.0,Love the color but it‚Äôs a bit of a tight fit.
4.0,"I liked it,  fit well and great for summer.  I returned it because I no longer needed it."
4.0,"Love them! Great quality, low price!"
4.0,"Good quality, especially for the price. I don't know about larger areas, but in my town, it's really difficult to find an inexpensive, everyday belt just to hold up your pants. I just wanted a belt to use for work (factory job). I didn't want anything fashionable, just utilitarian. Pay attention to the sizing, though, as the smaller (Medium) size seems to be the default choice when ordering. I have a 32&#34; waist, but I prefer the longer (Large) belt. I have one of each, and the Medium leaves just enough end to make it through the holder loop."
4.0,Comfy and fit as expected. Screen printed design is less sharp then pictured.
4.0,"Very flattering on the tummy. Great wear for a good date, holds everything in. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the hem is slightly off on one leg, but you can't tell."
4.0,I like this dress but for my body type I will have it  himmed shorter
4.0,Great product and I love the case
4.0,"Great quality, especially for the price. I'll be getting it altered slightly to fit perfectly since the fabric has no stretch."
4.0,"...so they are also heavier than I expected. Might not be able to wear all day. Also, the two different golds just look the same. Really rose-gold heavy. Well made though."
4.0,This is a cute dress that I will be able to wear all year.  It is cute with leggings an boots or sandals.  I'm 5'6&#34; and a size 10 and I like the way it fits--roomy but not baggy.  The front is a little fuller than I'd like (kind of reminds me of maternity clothes decades ago) but not a problem.  I'm sure I will wear it often.
4.0,Quality seems fine but couldnt get a good judge nc they are not to stretchy!! I got XL which always fits but this a very tight XL
4.0,"Its very cute but you get what you pay for.  As the price was awesome, the quality was not.  I've had it for 2 days and it already broke.  Its fixable, but don't expect durability with this piece.  I love the way it looks, so its definitely worth the cheap material.  All ya need to do is put a better, more durable chain on it and you'll get your moneys worth."
4.0,"Elegant, comfortable."
4.0,"fun product, could not find anything like this in the recent trip to Disneyland.<br />Appropriately sized nice look."
4.0,I thought this product was well made. I was a little disappointed because it was not tapered at all. More box shaped which I wasn‚Äôt expecting.
4.0,"Cute suit, order one size up and glad I did even though I'm typically not a &#34;large&#34;. Fit was cute (the top was a little loose but Didn't prevent me from being able to wear it) and overall was comfortable"
4.0,Great but broken and i dont wanna return‚Ä¶<br />Other than that its nice!!
4.0,So pretty and i love the gold touch but it was a little too long for me. It has a slip under it with an extra skirt attached making it long so i cut it off too fit my length better. Im 5' 140 and ordered a medium. I've added a before i cut the skirt part off and after picture.
4.0,"I really love the colors of this suit!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 134lbs and typically wear a size 6.  I got the large (us 4/6) and overall it fits well.  The reason for 4 stars is because I don‚Äôt like how the legs fit, it‚Äôs not stretchy and cuts into my legs.  Otherwise I love it!"
4.0,"A few years ago, when I first began to work at different summer camps I began to wear brightly colored trucker caps pretty much at all hours of the day. I did this because I like to upcycle them and make them fit my style, but it also helps with the Texas heat that was common in that area. I used to have a yellow trucker cap that I loved dearly but unfortunately due to excessive wear and tear I had to lay it to rest, after this I decided to start looking for a new cap to replace it and I eventually landed on this one. This cap was very good quality for what I paid for it and I loved the bright color of it as bright colors are typically something I'm attracted to. I put my own twist on it and added a smiley face on the back to make it a little more fun and it worked perfectly for what I was looking for. I wore that cap for quite a time and loved it dearly however it was a little thicker and bulkier than I had intended for it to be. The old yellow cap that I used to have fit my head perfectly and was rather malleable and this one didn't feel that way, and I didn't like that kind of feel as much. I personally thought that looked good backwards but I have never really thought of the trucker caps as good looking when they are worn in the proper way as they tend to pop up on the top of my head, but for me this is all trucker caps and not just this one in particular. It was a very good quality hat and after a few washes it tended to loosen up a little bit and work better, though it never got to be perfect. If you're looking for a trucker cap because its something you just like to wear or it's your style then by all means go for it but if you're just looking for a typical run of the mill cap than you might be more interested in a baseball cap rather than a trucker cap, but that is just my personal opinion."
4.0,"I was actually pretty surprised to see pads in the cups. They‚Äôre removable but still, little girls don‚Äôt need those! It‚Äôs a super cute bikini and fits my daughter pretty good. The top along the back looks somewhat stretched out to me, the elastic isn‚Äôt too snug there and sticks out some. The straps are adjustable. The bottoms seem to be a little low especially for a little girls swimsuit but doesn‚Äôt show anything which is fine. The ties on the sides of the bottoms are just for show and cannot be adjusted or tightened at all. My daughter has been begging for a bikini so this is her first one. I can‚Äôt exactly remember the size I chose but I think it was a 9/10 (the tags don‚Äôt say) and for size reference my daughter is 9 years old. The mermaid print is cute and this swimsuit washes well and doesn‚Äôt shrink. The quality seems great with no loose threads and excellent stitching."
4.0,It's good as a costume or with exercise. Helps posture and post partum. I have to go a size down soon!
4.0,"The darker pink color is more of a purple than pink, which is sad for me because I wanted pink not purple."
4.0,"Mask fits perfect, stretchy and comfortable. Print is not so visible on the black. But it's a good mask"
4.0,"I'm a flip flop guy.  In the summer you rarely catch me in anything else.  I've owned Rainbows,  Reefs, Tevas, and just about everything else including Skechers. These are pretty good.  The fit is a little small,  but not so much they are uncomfortable.  The memory foam feels good,  but my foot tends to slide a little in the flip flop.  I'm hoping with a good break in period this will stop.  The other pair of Skechers' flip flops I owned lasted for years, so I expect these should have similar longevity."
4.0,Fit a little big but still cute
4.0,The top fits perfect and super comfortable but the bottoms are a little snug.
4.0,The product was fine it ran a smaller than I would like for work purposes and freedom to move if I zipped it up.
4.0,"Love the fit & comfort. I was going to give a 5 star, but after the first wash the side Seam of the pant came apart. Hopefully this could be resolved."
4.0,These were super cute and my granddaughter liked them. She picked them out in advance. They were pretty big on her. I ordered the same as her shoe size.
4.0,"Others have said they‚Äôre see through, not the case but the fabric is on the thin side.  Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the pockets are not deep and your cell phone will fall out EVERY time you sit down.  If not for that I would give five stars.  Good for casual wear or gym."
4.0,"Good quality but fit slightly smaller than expected. Since it is a compression t-shirt, not a big deal and price point is far superior to popular brands. I will buy again, but one size larger."
4.0,"They look like extremely expensive shoes,even though they cost under ten dollars . I love them and I am thrilled I bought them. Very stylish. Very this season"
4.0,I ordered a medium and was sent a small. It worked out though the small fits perfectly and is a little big (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 142 lbs). Love the feel of this dress and how flowing it is. Taking it on a trip to Argintina. Super excited about the price!  Very reasonable but doesn‚Äôt feel cheap.  Giving this a 4 due to them getting the order wrong.
4.0,"Very nice. Ordered a Medium, fits a bit snug. You may need to order a size up."
4.0,"I ordered a small, I am 5 foot 7 and 125 pounds. It was very loose in the body, and too short, about mid thigh"
4.0,"I ordered two, but the second one was incorrect and sent back. They both arrived in good condition and I like the one I kept."
4.0,Great price but a little mallet then I thought
4.0,This is a decent Jersey for the price. I'm 6ft 215lbs and due to past  jersey purchases I bought xxl as polyester can shrink. It is too long even with shrinking it so if your my size buy large if you like some excessive baggy buy xlarge.
4.0,"The quality was great, liked it i had ordered 24months for my 16 months son was too large for him."
4.0,This shirt is nice but the droopy pocket is not good. I ordered three and two have a this very bad pocket. I will return.
4.0,I like this style and it fit me as expected. Due to some weigh gain it hide's the extra weight.
4.0,Pretty colors. Different than anything I‚Äôve seen in stores
4.0,Comfy and wearable. Colors great for summer. Love the pockets
4.0,Nice bracelet but very thin and small.. I have large wrist it fits and not tight but not loose enough!!!!!
4.0,Good value. Purchased for a theme wedding and will use again if I have the opportunity.
4.0,"Purchased this for my anniversary cruise, I absolutely love the feel and look of the jumpsuit. Tried it on for my daughter, she said, &#34;Mom, you look classy.&#34;"
4.0,"Frame is super flimsy, but lenses are great! Overall good buy. Would reccomend if youre looking for decent quality glasses that you dont mind losing"
4.0,"Beautiful colors and the bows are the perfect size for my infant!  The elastic however is too large for her head. I wish it was smaller since it is so stretchy, but I was able to use my glue gun to fold the elastic under the bow to reduce the size."
4.0,No me gusta üëé se suda con la reputaci√≥n y no es buena calidad
4.0,only complaint is the leopard print is not as big in the picture... which is what I loved about it. but still cute and nice<br />quality
4.0,"Dress is as pictured. A nice thin material, but not see through. Falls nicely and has pockets too. My only complaint is that if I wear the dress with the tag in the back, like normal, the seem runs down the middle front and the polka dots look off. If I wear the dress backwards, it looks like it's made from one piece. The neckline then goes a bit higher, but it's wearable. Other than that small complaint, I really like the dress!"
4.0,"I should have got maybe a size bigger , but other then that I love it üòçüòç"
4.0,"lots of color options, good zipper quality"
4.0,"I really like the material of the pajamas.  I ordered the 3xxxl for my husband, 5' 10&#34; 210 lbs. The 3xL was supposed to be a regular large.  My husband likes when tons fit a little baggy. So this fit him exactly as a Large would fit, but he wanted a little larger. He really liked the style and material though.  I would purchase again for a teen because it would better suit their body type"
4.0,I think this bracelet looks and feels very high quality. The only negative is that the clasp is not as secure as I would like.
4.0,"Researched Amazon and others and found that the price for these two units cost less than some places were charging for one. It was easy to program, although as with other older garage door openers, you have to use a ladder and do it in the garage.<br /> Unfortunately, when I went to use, the second one it didn't work. When I finally got it open, it turned out that the battery had somehow moved and had leaked.  Even with that, the price was still not outrageous."
4.0,"A bit thin, but overall its pretty good."
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It fits great, the color (I chose grey) is lovely, and it's very comfortable. However, two things stop me giving it five stars (and though they aren't deal-breakers for me, they might be for someone else). First: it shrunk a bit when I washed it, so if you're waffling on size, go one up. Second, and the bigger one: it MUST be ironed. Even if you pull it out of the dryer and hang it up immediately, it will require ironing with a hot steam iron. Just use a cooler iron on the belt since the black trim is synthetic and will melt. I don't mind ironing, and at the end of this day I LOVE this dress."
4.0,cute!! Ordered a large after reading other reviews- I'm a 34D and 145lbs. Top is a little big but it will work. For reference on size I wear medium swim bottoms from Victoria secret and the large fits like their medium.
4.0,"I got this tote on clearance at a great discount. I originally intended to use it as overnight luggage for my frequent visits to my ill mother. When I received the tote, it was clear it was not what I really wanted. However, with the great price and the leather (which is often hard to find now), I decided to keep it. The bag sat around for a while. Then I started using it as a briefcase-tote for work. It ended up working out great. It has a couple of inside pockets and slots to hold pens. The tote also includes a padded insert to hold a laptop or ipad. I didn't end up using that part, but it is easily removed if you don't want to either. The leather is a little stiff and does not have a ""high-end"" appearance, but I think I got more than what I paid for."
4.0,"I love these earrings, this is my second pair. The only bad thing is the push backs slide off easily so I lost one my first pair. Make sure to find a secure back for your earrings."
4.0,Very soft and cute but I wear a medium in most coats but ordered this in Xl and wish I would have ordered xxl!! It is snug I will have to wear thinner tops.
4.0,"I love this, although the back of the charm is hollow and doesn't look very nice as long as you clasp it facing outwards it's very cute."
4.0,"Basic watch, waterproof for surfing and other water sports."
4.0,"I've been eyeing this watch for awhile and finally pulled the trigger at a local watch dealer. There is no denying that this is a beautifully made watch and also vintage inspired. The proportion of this watch is my favorite of all the Seiko diver's watches. Even though it is a 44mm, it wears more like a 40mm watch due to the case design The bezel action is very smooth and easy to turn; the edge of the bezel is well made and make it easier to grab. Sapphire glass is not too reflective and easy to read the dial. The most beautiful part of this watch is the profile of the case, where it is polished to the highest level (see photos). The bracelet is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust the links. Since this is a Seiko watch, the lume is bright and clear. For the most part, Seiko's design of this watch is attractive and will satisfy many watch lovers.<br />***The negative:<br />1. At this price point, I expect a better movement than the 6R15, not that there is anything wrong with this movement. The Swiss offer higher beating and decorated movements at this price point.<br />2. There is some play between the end links and the case. Tighter tolerance is appreciated in this case.<br />3. The copy I got ran about 12-13 seconds/day fast. Hopefully it will settle down since the watch is still new. But the greatest accuracy, but reasonable.<br /><br />Overall, this watch is a nicer offering from Seiko. It is much nicer than your typical department store Seiko watches, and the price does reflect this. If you just need one watch for all occasions, this might be a good choice."
4.0,"I love this purse, its the perfect size for me. The inside is a brown and black cheetah print (super cute with the red )with three little separate compartments. The sides of the purse is collapsing and the front of the purse has a fold...it doesn't have much foundation overall in those areas. Other than that I adore it."
4.0,The material is nice and soft. Waistband soft and doesn‚Äôt cut into your akin.  However the sizing is off. Ordered an XL instead of a medium so I felt like I wasted my cash.  But The XL was too small and restricted my legs.
4.0,This is a gorgeous well made dress. Runs small so I ordered bigger & had it altered for my daughters wedding in June.  Definitely worth the purchase!
4.0,This product is perfect for Team Jacob! lol  My daughter loves it.  It is a bit pricey but it was for a birthday present so it was worth it.
4.0,"I suggest you measure carefully before buying a pair of these clip-on sunglasses.  My glasses are bifocals and a bit on the wide side, and I almost ordered the wrong design.  These overlap my lenses only slightly, something not at all noticeable to others.  On the other hand, if they were too short it would be readily apparent and they would look a little goofy.<br /><br />They do a great job of providing shade...the fact that they are polarized makes a big difference.  My son pointed this out to me as we were riding in the car one sunny day.  For example, with polarized lenses, the reflections on the windshield of items on the dashboard disappear.  I did a direct comparison with a pair of non-polarized sunglasses and the difference was significant.<br /><br />They are thick, well made, high quality, and attach easily.  Their being thick, however, brings me to their main drawback...they are a bit on the heavy side and this can make them somewhat uncomfortable to wear after an extended period of time.<br /><br />The only other negative is that when you flip them up, they really don't flip up far enough.  I found myself having to tilt my head quite a bit to look at grocery store items when I walked out of the sun and into Winn Dixie.<br /><br />So, minus one star for the weight and the flip factor.<br /><br />Overall, though, I highly recommend them...I would buy them again without hesitation."
4.0,"The outfit is super cute and as pictured, but it runs 2 sizes too small."
4.0,I am currently using the rose gold metal magnetic latch band and it is nice because it is breathable can be adjusted easily and stays connected.
4.0,Small chain but great shape love it
4.0,The color black is BLACK and not faded. The artwork is great
4.0,"Soft. Nice colors, washes well. Super cute"
4.0,I've worn it a couple of times and it is a nice watch with an easy to read dial.
4.0,"larger than expected, not as form fitting as the picture. maybe would have been better if they had an XS? it'll probably shrink in the college washers/dryers anyway tho..."
4.0,"I had done a very extensive search for a minimalist wallet/card holder for quite a few days. Some expensive ones and some less expensive ones and then I came across THIS!! I have only had this Fidelo minimalist wallet for a few days and I'm extremely satisfied with it. If you have never held one before you will be pleasantly surprised with how small it is and how compact it is in your pocket. It holds just about everything I had in my previous wallet. I've been carrying it in my back pocket and can barely feel it there as opposed to my previous Harley-Davidson wallet. Shipping was very fast, Fidelo so far seems to have great customer service.  You cannot beat the price for what you get. Basically you get three wallets for less than the price of one of many other name brand wallets. Thank you Amazon and thank you Fidelo."
4.0,Awesome comfortable fabric!
4.0,"Great quality product, nothing wrong with it at all. I wear it in my tragus and it didn't end up looking the way I pictured it would, but it still ended up being cute."
4.0,"I would give 5 stars, however the slip lining was sewn in inside out. It‚Äôs not super noticeable, but enough to annoy me. I bought the small for a maternity photo shoot and it fit perfectly! If I weren‚Äôt 8 months pregnant I would have definitely done an XS, so if you are buying for maternity, I would size up a tad!"
4.0,These shorts look and feel nice. They have 2 pockets. They are a little see through but as long as you aren't wearing some brightly colored underwear you should be fine.
4.0,I really like this.  My only issue is I have worn it every day to work and the silver is already wearing off the case.  I would definitely buy again.
4.0,My Grand daughter loves this.  The wig it different but fits well and she likes it
4.0,"Love the sleeveless design of this polo. Purchased for work and have been complimented on the nice style by both coworkers and the golf club members. I have 3 of them now but wish they had more colors available..(preferably in light pastels that could be worn for work).<br />They are lightweight,  comfortable, even on very hot days in palm springs area.<br />They pass for a nice, dress type shirt, are fitted & look good.<br />They do run alittle small in sizing so if in doubt, get the larger one. I am 5'9"" and 140#, I ordered XL. They fit good but I'd prefer a smidge more wiggle room in a work shirt..<br />If there were a few more color options and maybe an xxl size.. I'd give it 5 stars."
4.0,Runs very small. I orded a 4x and my son who wears a adult medium could barely fight it.
4.0,Very good product for the price.  I recommend it.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, unfortunately it was too small. Regifted"
4.0,"Its a bit oversized, which I wanted but maybe a bit too much. Soft and does not shed fuzz! Would definitely buy again, a size smaller."
4.0,Can‚Äôt complain for the price. My daughter likes them and that‚Äôs what matters.
4.0,"A little big, order a size down if in between"
4.0,"Great cardigan! Great fabric for the price, considering that you can pay anywhere from 24.00 or so on a cardigan at Target or 40.00 at NY&Co and the quality is ok. The green is more of a deep hunter green not as bright as in the pic. I usually wear a medium but in this particular cardigan I had to go with the large since it runs a bit small, even with the fact that I like my cardis to be fitted and tight around the arms, I never button them up or wear sleeves underneath. The sleeves are pretty long so if you're more on the petite size you may have a lot of fabric over your palm. I like them a lot, bought the red, lavender, rust, black and pink for starters"
4.0,"Warm, fits snug but still leaves room where you need it.<br /><br />I know it is made for work out gear but when layering it with other outfits the collar looks kind of weird. This is just personal preference otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Great lounge crew neck if that's all you want it for."
4.0,"I love these pants, except they are too big in the booty and waist.  I usually wear a size 4, slim cut, but these are too large.  Legs are nice and snug, however . . . the proportion is a little off for my body shape.  I will order and size smaller."
4.0,"My wife likes the look, color, trim ... but the fit wasn't perfect. It felt slightly small."
4.0,"The lotus flower gauges are really nice and I like that they are single flare screw-in backs. however, make sure you leave soaking in alcohol for at least 5 minutes because they lose color, meaning the gauges will be more silver color and have less black accents. You need to do this for the blue dream catcher gauges as well. The dream catcher gauges are double flared and I know many people hate that. I find the best way to put on double-flared is to lubricated the ear and insert them in an angle. These gauges were easier to insert than the hoop gauges. The hoop gauges in my opinion looked the best but were a hassle to put on. The double flare is really wide and it even took me a good 20 minutes to insert. Once I put them on, the hoop was another hassle. The little ball kept falling off, eventually I figured out  that you shouldn‚Äôt over tighten because for some odd reason the ball pops out when you do. I wore them all day and had no issues with them. For these reason I gave them 4 stars"
4.0,"The back is great, however, the back itself is a little heavy"
4.0,"I love these socks!! I have ordered multiple times for my kiddos. But this set, one of the socks had a hole in it when I took it out of the bag :( upsetting, but still worth the money!!"
4.0,"These earrings are for a young girl.  They are just too small but beautiful in detail, they just scream childish.  I gave them as a gift to a 3 year old!!!!! If you are looking for a child gift these are perfect. I did try them on and they looked ridiculous.  Please beware if you are an adult that these are not for you."
4.0,"The shirt is alright. I love the shape/cut of it, but don't much like the material. It fits as expected and looks just like the picture except the blue is darker than pictured. With the material, black trim, and darker blue, it looks like a shirt more for the fall."
4.0,I do see int give this 5 stars simply because it broke. Otherwise it would be 5 stars. It very comfortable to wear as I am a bartender and work with and wash my hands a lot. I used to work in fine jewelry and watches and I think I can fix it but was really disappointed about that. It just fell off my wrist while I was just standing about a week after I got it.
4.0,"I really like the fabric and the pleats do not crush or become wrinkled. The waist is a little snug. I'm a pretty standard size M or 8 in the US, and the waist is a little snug."
4.0,a little big- but shrunk on high in dryer to desired size. excellent quality and material!
4.0,These are adorable. However the posts were  bent all the way over when I received them.
4.0,Love the print love the material bust and waist area fits some what big will have to get it adjusted but that's minor doesn't take away from the beauty of the dress. Normally wear medium ordered a large am 5' 1&#34; 135 lbs
4.0,"Yes it is growing on me, but it is nice"
4.0,I am just not real sure how to use them yet but I am very happy with this product.
4.0,"I bought this set early in my pregnancy because my first body changes were 24/7 bloat, and widening breasts. When I packed away my too-small bras I was horrified to see that I only fit into two bras. Right away I searched for soft bras that I could sleep in, and grow in -I am happy that I found this affordable set.<br /><br />I usually wear a 34B or 34C. I ordered this set in a Large, and they fit perfectly! These pullover bras are very comfortable, easy to put on, and easy to sleep in. The pads are removable, so I took them all out right away because 1) I dislike padding in general, and 2) I don't mind if nipples are visible under some shirts because I am a mammal and nipples are not shameful.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they feel awkward to layer over. This issue with me is that all of my first layer undershirts are racer-back and these bras -especially the back- is very wide set (please note that I am writing this in December, so layering now is a requirement). Sometimes the straps do fall off my shoulders, and it really bothers me, but right now I'm just dealing with it because I bought these bras as maternity wear.<br /><br />I hope I can find a racerback version, until then, these bras get the job done."
4.0,"I should have paid closer attention to size, these were too small for me (18oz)...was looking for a larger size."
4.0,Hiking. Not bad 4 price. Feel cheap
4.0,"Make sure you notice the word small in the title.  Not sure they will fit me, probably better suited forva smaller head (kids).  Other than size they seem nice and look cool.  Comes with a cloth case and the sunglass lenses flip up without issue."
4.0,"These socks are just like normal socks, they are not to thick and not to thin. For the price compared to other toe sock brands they are pretty good. I have had no problems with them falling down. They are a left and right even though they are not marked, you can tell the difference when you put them on because of the big toe."
4.0,"The waist down fits as expected, but this was designed for someone with a large chest! And someone very tall. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 132lbs and had to hem the bottom up and take in the chest from both sides, but it is very pretty and worked fine once I adjusted it. Those are pretty easy adjustments to make, if you have basic sewing knowledge.<br /><br />**Picture is from after I altered it. **"
4.0,"I like the color that I picked.It's elegant dress for office and Party wear.Even though most reviews say that it fits exact size for different individual sizes,I think going up one size as you place your order is ideal.Otherwise the material of the dress is not too thin or show through.I might buy it again in a diff color."
4.0,"These are practical under shorts.  I do find the crotch a tad snug (which I say with no personal arrogance), but the cotton is comfy enough and the snug is not a deal breaker.  I do prefer a little more room, but not the laxity of boxers.  They washed fine and kept their size, which was good, and they will work well under bathing suits without an underlining and with shorts."
4.0,"I love the look of this boot. Also, I love the price. I purchased these a half size bigger than I normally wear because of everyone's comments. I'm pregnant right now so my feet are a little swollen but I wanted something I could just slip on. These are a little too tight. Hopefully when I'm not pregnant anymore I will be able to fit in them because they are adorable. I'm in love with the lining on the inside!"
4.0,"I‚Äôm glad I read the reviews before buying. I received my vest today and love it. I ordered a size up from my usual and it fits nicely (even with D cups!) I took off one star only because it is short. I‚Äôm on the petite side, being only 5‚Äô1‚Äù, but all sides don‚Äôt quite reach my hip and the vest itself is rather sheer. Granted, that may be a plus for others. Hope this helps!"
4.0,"Great puffer jacket, but the zipper is easy to mess up. Just a bit of a pain."
4.0,Love my bracelets! Comfortable and doesn‚Äôt tarnish.
4.0,Good quality of beads<br />Bad string quality
4.0,If u are chunky might show gut or panty line might want to size up to get rid of it or wear something to flatten ur stomach.
4.0,"Best fantasy draft board for the price. Nice and big, without distracting images on the background like other competitors. Names are clear and easy to read."
4.0,"The stone in the photo makes the stone appear to GLISTEN and REFLECT light.  In reality the stone is MATT with a very DULL appearance.  The design and overall quality of the ring is still very nice, but I am a bit DISAPPOINTED that what I received is NOT what I expected.  Another thing that I should make yoU aware of is that on the ring's BOX its description is &#34;NATURAL COPPER AZARITE GEMSTONE RING.&#34;  Azarite can be found nearly all over the world, but  EILAT is native to 2 mines in ISRAEL, present there at least from the time of the BRONZE AGE.  Eilat is also a COPPER containing stone, but has a more diverse MINERAL COMPOSITION than others that may be sold as EILAT, including Azurite, Malachite, and Chrysocolla.  Well worth the asking price, but if EILAT is what you're after this isn't it.  I'm still looking, but I will enjoy this ring in the meantime.  SHALOM!"
4.0,Really like everything about this bracelet except it is large for a stretch bracelet.  It will lay at the end of your wrist for sure.
4.0,"For the price and quality of these glasses, every one should want them! I get compliments all the time, and I let them know where I got them from too! Nice glasses/"
4.0,Sooo cute I love them !!
4.0,good quality and not too short.
4.0,"Fits well, easy to put on and take off. Good price."
4.0,One problem. It rides up a little! Otherwise very pretty!
4.0,"Was good with my storm costume, my only issue is that it was shorter than I would have liked so keep in mind that the length is 51 inches."
4.0,"Was a beautiful dress and was very well made, but even though I ordered my size it did not fit, it was a little too small. I advise ordering up a size."
4.0,"I like the wrinkle free, easy keep of this blouse!"
4.0,"Order many bathing suits but this one I'm for sure keeping! I runs a tab tight, I'm 5'7 145 and order a medium... It fits, but could have been a little losser, over all good quality and nice color"
4.0,It‚Äôs an ok product for busty girls
4.0,Wonderful little suit! Tried it on my LO once it arrived and it fit well. Looks formal while continuing to be comfy. Plan to use it for a special occasion coming up.
4.0,I love It but the edges are to sharp and the chain is super long
4.0,"The dress fit my beautiful lady love perfectly! My only complaint is that the actual dress is not the same vibrant red depicted in the add. It is a more muted red than the red in the add. I noticed this same issue with the other two dresses I have purchased through Simplee Apparel. That being said. The pricing and sizing have been consistently great. Given the right features for my very petite Lady, I'll be doing more business with you. Thanks."
4.0,great for a little guy
4.0,Great quality.<br />Durable<br />Adjustable in back.<br />Tight around ears. The way they are sewn there is no movement there.
4.0,I can tell it wasent the real thing since it had that tight plastic wrap around it. It did charge my watch tho and it fit just fine.
4.0,my only complaint is that it's not 2 faced as I thought it would be. otherwise its a nice product
4.0,Very comfortable and lightweight.  I actually wear these year round!üëçüèΩ
4.0,"Love the size and spacious interior of this bag. The cloth is good quality, too. The color is as shown. I don't like the the brand label (leather or similar material) sewn to the outside of the bag. I removed the label, but that left stitch marks on the bag. Also, an unfinished material edge is exposed to the inside if the bag; this is fraying, and therefore looks a bit messy. The frayed threads get tangled with my bag contents. It's not a huge deal, but a bit annoying. Overall, I am happy with the bag."
4.0,"Dress came with an iron burn on it. The iron burn washed out thankfully. It's a little snug even in the size that I ordered, so maybe order a size up? It works for me but could still be a potential issue."
4.0,"I'm not a huge fan how the house patch looks like it's just glued onto the scarf, or the thinness of the scarf itself, but my nephew loves it so that's all that really matters."
4.0,"House shoe does not have arch support, love the fit and grip."
4.0,"The cut on this fit me very baggy in the upper body and normally in the lower body, which is kind of frustrating because I feel like the bottom half wouldn't fit if I went down a size. The dress also comes down really low on the sides, so be advised if that's something you dislike. I can make it work wearing a belt with it to reduce the puffiness and volume of the upper half, so I'm keeping it because it is made well and a pretty dress even though it doesn't quite fit the way I wanted."
4.0,Nice pieces of jewelry. Not sure if the material is surgical steel since it is not as polished as I expected.
4.0,Great costume my daughter and her friends loved it.  Stayed inflated for two days while she wore it without any problems.
4.0,lace not as nice as shown
4.0,"These are great looking gloves, used them for driving.  The touch screen did work initially, but couldn't text with them effectively.  If anything I could answer calls with my phone.  After a few months of use in the Michigan winter, the touch screen does not work at all.  I first went with the medium, and they were too big,  the small are nice and snug, but a little short as they don't cover my wrists all the way.  I wore them this past nov-december in Chicago.  If I kept my hands in my pocket they would stay warm.  If out in 0-15 degree weather my hands would get cold with these."
4.0,Very beautiful.  The stone is a little too big.
4.0,"This watch is exactly as advertised and presented.  It is large face (47mm) with few frills, but the weight is not uncomfortable due to the leather band.  The movement is very tight and responsive.  Finding the A and B position on the stem is easy.  The &#34;unique&#34; design refers to the day of the week indicator, which I find the only weakness of the watch.  The &#34;red dot&#34; is difficult to see and often obstructed by the watch hands.  Otherwise, I like the quality of the materials, the deep set of the watch face, the coin edge bezel, and the comfortable leather band.  A Nice watch and a good value."
4.0,Great dress for summer! It is quite flattering and the color is beautiful. The material is quite thin which is great for the heat but not as great quality.
4.0,"The shirt fits snug and there‚Äôs not a bigger size available. I may keep it since it‚Äôs not terrible, but it‚Äôs not as loose as I would like it to be."
4.0,comfy but still showed
4.0,Great kids slip on
4.0,"It lasted almost a year before the compartment holding my phone came apart at the seam.<br />Thankfully I bought the 2 pack, so I'm on to the next one."
4.0,"It looks good. It keeps time well. BUT...the wrist band fits loosely and the snap lock keeps coming undone (very annoying).<br /><br />Edit: I purchased this watch Dec. 28th, 2017 and it was delivered Jan. 3, 2018. Sadly, as of June 22, 2018, it has stopped ticking, slowed down, and re-started twice. I don't know if this is a battery problem but I WILL address it promptly as this watch supposedly has a 12 month guarantee from the purchase date from the manufacturer. I will contact Amazon from whom I bought it from to see just what they can do for me.<br />I'll keep you folks posted on further developments."
4.0,"It's a nice sweater but on a 5'3&#34; overweight woman, it looks dumpy. Would be nice for someone tall and slim. Sleeves a little long. Front edges do not meet in front. I'm a 14, so can't see a size 16 or 18 fitting into it. I'm afraid I'll have to return it, which makes me sad."
4.0,"This seems to do the job and fits the hand nicely.  The watch I have is quite stuck, but this should have worked.  I am continuing to try it.  I had inadvertently been sent a 12 piece watch wrench.  The quality on that wasn't great.  I like this quality better.  The handle is very solid.  The pins seem a little wobbly, but it still tightened fine into my watch back.  I'm not the best with the tool, apparently, but if you are good with your hands, it should be a good product for you."
4.0,My daughter loves anything about outer space.
4.0,"Gorgeous. Just understand that midnight is actually black. There's no mistake, because the bag that it came in was labeled midnight. I bought a black one as well so i compared it. There's no difference, even in Arizona sunlight. It's fine, but i now have both a short and long black pretied."
4.0,"My 4 year and 6 year old sons were both in need of a pair of sunglasses for summer. I wasn't sure what to expect for sizing as my kids' heads tend to run big, so I figured that if this pair did not fit one of them it would fit the other. They seemed a little snug on my 4 yr old and fit the 6 yr old (yes, that seems odd, but very much like anything else with kids). They seem quite durable and have held up for quite awhile now which is always impressive our household. I like the style and so do they. They're a little fun and little stylish which is a great mix in kids sunglasses. My 6 yr old recently discovered that if you look through them at my phone it makes the screen look like all kinds of interesting colors so you may want to give that a try."
4.0,Heavy but super cute
4.0,This was cuter than I had expected! Fit true to size and we‚Äôll made. The back is completely open so you may choose to go without a bra. Length was good.
4.0,"Runs big. Size down! Usually I would be a M, went with S, room to spare. Very comfy! Bought black, somewhat thin, not quite see through."
4.0,The zipper pockets are big enough to hold my iPhone 7 but still look smooth and slim. Plenty of credit card slots and 2 big inside pockets. I want to get one in every color. The only issue is the decoration on the zipper is a little off. Would recommend this Wallet.
4.0,"Item definitely runs small, I bought a large and it fits fine from the top bit at my waist I have to good it because the band is very rigjt. I am 5'6&#34; and 140 lbs, more bottom heavy than top heavy. Very soft material would definitely recommend for fall/winter casual wear."
4.0,I like the dress but it‚Äôs to small.
4.0,My boys love the pajamas but the material is thin.
4.0,"I knew going in that this hat was khaki colored, not pink. But what arrived was more light tan than the green color shown in other pictures online.<br />Not a huge deal."
4.0,"I love the way these socks feel and the way they fit my feet.<br />They‚Äôre very soft and very comfortable. And, they retain their shape after washing on gentle cycle.<br />The only problem I found is the fact that a couple pairs of the socks that I received, definitely had the swastikas design on them. Which I find to be very embarrassing when my socks are showing. I don‚Äôt want friends or anyone that I meet to be offended so I wear those particular socks inside the house. I hate the idea of throwing them away because they are really nice and comfortable socks."
4.0,Nice but color is different has more yellow than browns
4.0,The little jems were blue and yellow so a little dissapointed it wasnt green other than that i love it. I am a huge ducks fan so it was a very good purchase for me. very satisfied aside from the coloring of the jems.
4.0,Weave rather loose - might snag easily.
4.0,"It took almost a month to arrive but it was all I hoped for.  I went up in size, I should have gone up 2 sizes.  It does stretch so I can wear it.  The zipper pull is on the left which is normally Woman's clothes, but that is alright."
4.0,"Look and feel great! Definitely recommend ordering a size up. I'm a medium-sized 8/10 usually but got the Large 12/14 as someone else recommended and they fit good. The fabric is not for hot weather though, it's not thin. It will be good for fall/winter.  Made well. I'm pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"Bought 1 pair for each daughter. One pair worked fine, the other pair did not. Left shoe would not charge or light up, right shoe would not turn off. Ended up returning defective pair."
4.0,Love the look.  My daughter told me I was very fashionable
4.0,Im 5ft 4&quot; and 140lbs.the medium was a great fit.top is comfy.however it was a bit wrinkled.
4.0,It is a very cute outfit! The neckline is a little deep from the front which means my baby has to wear an undershirt in the winter. Otherwise it fit well and looked super adorable!
4.0,"Producto f√°cil de instalar, materiales livianos, agradables al tacto, se ajusta perfectamente a la mu√±eca, habr√° que esperar para saber si son de buena calidad y talvez deber√≠an sacar en m√°s colores porque solo viene en cuatro variedades."
4.0,"Love this band, looks like my old metal one but way more comfortable."
4.0,I ordered the same size I always do and these seem to fit a little smaller.  My toes hit the end. I do like the boot though.
4.0,"Wish I would have gotten a small. I'm 5'1&#34; and 120 lbs. I have another similar suit from Cupshe in a medium and it fits fine, but this one is slightly looser. Regardless, I love it! Looks great on and the pattern is really cute!"
4.0,"Size UP! These are so adorable... and comfortable if you size up.  I'm normally a large as I like to wear my clothes ever so slightly loose (5'9"", 160lbs). I ordered a large and had to return and size up to 3XL to achieve a comfortable (not overly loose, just a nice drape loose) and for the waist to fit. Your normal size WILL fit too tight around the waist so do yourself a favor and size up probably 2 sizes. The beige is more like muslin, slightly sheer, but great for summer. The pink is a lovely orangey pink and super soft, not sheer. The khaki is more of a mustard color but still nice and not sheer either.  At the price plus pockets, these are keepers after sizing up."
4.0,I like the black best.
4.0,Good utility. Good for the price.
4.0,The sound of the two pieces jingling against one another drove me nuts. I thought i'd return it but ended up removing the longer piece and it's great now. I just wear it without the longer piece and get a lot of compliments. :)
4.0,"The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is, it's impossible to wear without revealing camel toe. Other than that I love it."
4.0,used this to propose to my boyfriend (he loved it) it came a day late but oh well!
4.0,Xmas gift for the wife. She really liked these and compliments them often.
4.0,"So far, I love this backpack.<br />I use this for paperwork that I need to carry to my students work sites.<br />It has plenty of room and seems well made.<br />I only wish that the darker color was available at my time of purchase"
4.0,Requested silver and got it with a gold face.
4.0,"This is a beautiful watch, especially for the price. It was easy to set, however, the band is short. I don't have large wrists and I have it on the first hole."
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô5 and 140 lbs, and a medium was huge!"
4.0,"Arrived on time. Good price. Looks nice. This pair of shoe bags are very cute. One bag is large enough to carry a pair of slim flip-flops, or pair of very thin sandals, or pair of very slim house slippers, NOT for a pair of grown adult running shoes, or a pair of high heel shoes, unless they are open all around, but that's a stretch (no pun intended). Looks like each bag can be used to carry or store a few pairs of little baby shoes or one, maybe two pairs of very small toddler shoes. I refuse to carry one shoe in each bag, but I can see how it would be feasible if packing a tight suitcase and you may need to strategically place each shoe in different area of of the suitcase or a packing box. I was about to send these back, but decided to use for something else."
4.0,"Absolutely love these. Only issue is the little rhinestones have started falling out. Will probably just remove the rest and continue to wear, but definitely a bummer!"
4.0,"Wife purchased for a Halloween custom, and has used it after a few times on the cooler days."
4.0,This ring has a lot of detail to it and is absolutely adorable. I purchased it for my best friend for her birthday and she was in love with it!!! Highly recommend for the penguin lover in your life.
4.0,I really like this product. I just wish they had elastic fabric string rather than an elastic plastic band...but it's cool once you don't abuse it. I also wonder if it's real tigers eye...It's so perfectly shiny and glossy. Overall I like it!
4.0,The only reason I am giving this a 4 instead of 5 is because the color is different from the picture. It is more of a Texas burnt orange
4.0,"This top arrives extremely wrinkled.  I soaked it in cool water and hung to dry.  Much less wrinkled after that, but will have some touch up ironing to do.  This is why I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,Item arrived intacted and in good condition<br />Was just as described although I would say they are more of a rainbow finish than any particular color.<br />Hard to see in lower light lettings. So I would say these are definitely for bright light settings.
4.0,size to specs and comfortable fit
4.0,"I get tons of compliments on this handbag.  If you like something just a little different, this is perfect.  Well made.  The only negative is it's heavy due to the material of the bag."
4.0,"Very nice, modern design! Looks great and unique on! Bigger then I expected, so it's easier to put on. Very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Very long but it shapes your body perfectly!  I'm 5'2, bought size S and it was dragging on the floor.  Nice material, not thin or cheap at all."
4.0,I bought this for my mother and she loves it. The fabric is a little thinner than expected but she always wearya slip so it's not a big deal. Color was very nice and cheery. She'd like this in a print if I could find it.
4.0,Runs small ... not to much stretch  L was right above my knee im 5'5 190 it was tight xl would be good not see though
4.0,"Liked sweater. It ran alittle larger than I expected. Had a snag with a small hole on sleeve. I used a very small  crochet needle to repair the snag, but still had a small hole that is visible. Over all am pleased with my purchase."
4.0,I like the feel fits well but it still steam up my glasses
4.0,It is very comfortable. I should have sized down because it's a little big
4.0,"I ordered the 41&#34; version (oddly, the order invoice listed it as 40&#34; for some reason even though I selected 41&#34;). So far, I really like this belt. Good looking and seemingly made with quality materials. The buckle is metal, so has some weight, but not too heavy for me. (Weighed in around 80g, with the entire belt at 140g.) I have a 33&#34; waist and use the belt to hold up 34&#34; jeans and shorts. When around my waist and tightened, I get between 3&#34; and 3 1/2&#34; of hangover between buckle and belt tip. This is quite a bit shorter than my other belts that usually have enough hangover to reach the loops on my jeans or shorts. In most cases, it just reaches the first loop, but in some it can't quite get that far. I'm OK with this as I had too much hangover on my other belts, but if you have a larger waist than 33&#34;, I'd highly recommend looking at a larger size than 41&#34; (not sure why they call it 41&#34;, actually, unless they are measuring the total belt without accounting for looping and stitching).<br /><br />It holds tight and in place without slipping, whereas other belts I've owned got lose and had to be retightened throughout the day. In the beginning, I felt that looping the tip around the fastener was a little slow and took some managing, but once I got it down, the process of putting on and taking off was pretty simple. Just had to get a routine and method in place."
4.0,"In today's social climate in this country, I thought this was the joke in the middle of a fight that makes the rest of the fight akward. This is a nice laugh and much needed"
4.0,"Bought this for my tween. She is normally a size small in women's clothes. This fit great, except that the chest padding is very bulky and does not look good unless you have at least a B cup size."
4.0,The leggings are very comfortable and has perfect compression. It doesn't press into my belly and hides my belly pooch very well. The side pockets are deep enough to hold large cell phones. Word of advice - Size down if you would like to have slim fit.
4.0,"I do like this ring & the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it doesn't really look copper. It's a dark brown, almost black."
4.0,loved the outfit but the shirt was very girly not fit for a boy.<br />Flowers in shirt.
4.0,"For the price, this was a great deal. My daughter loved it. She said it brightened up her day."
4.0,"A little stiff, but a few washings will fix that."
4.0,Shoulder strap is weird.
4.0,Bust area too tight and my boobs aren't that big
4.0,Super cute and comfortable! Fit true to size! I gave them 4 stars because they are slightly see through on the butt! You definitely need to wear solid underwear because any design or stripes show through! Other than that they are great and so cute!
4.0,"I picked these up for the my first triathlon and am very happy with them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Fast shoe changes!<br />* I didn't notice any slippage of my foot in the shoe, the shoe was on tight enough.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* A little more difficult than normal laces to install on the shoes. Not a major problem, though.<br />* The triangle plastic bit that locks the ends of the laces seems like it could come loose. I haven't experienced this, but it might be nice to have a little more instructions about how to really secure the ends of the laces.<br /><br />These laces are definitely keepers, I'm going to get extra pairs for my other running shoes and for when I have to get new shoes."
4.0,"This product is so pretty! It is soft and has two layers to it. There is a soft mesh layer on top that gives the scarf its color and inside a multi colored section that gives the scarf its pattern, its second color, and the tassels at the ends. Overall it is warm and soft, not itchy at all. However, when I received mine, there is something weird going on with the tassels. Some of them are oddly tangled and you have to cut the string between them apart because they share the same one. Then they get all fuzzy and you have to cut them off. However, I only had that happen with two of the tassels on the whole scarf, and it is easy to cut them off. Other than that, I had no issues with this scarf. These are cheap and are decently high quality! I would recommend them. I received the mint green one. However, the picture online did not show that the second layer had blue in it, which I did not know about. I thought it would just be green. I would also be interested in trying the coral one. Overall, a great buy! I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"This exactly what I was looking for!! I like to wear cropped jeans so these tube sleeves are just a tad bit long but I just roll them one time and I'm good to go! They're thick, stretchy and stylish. I am a very thin woman with very thin legs and I ordered the smallest size. They're tight like they should be üëçüèΩ"
4.0,Love the shirt  but  it  waaayy  to big.  What?  XL  looks  like a 3x
4.0,"I can't wear this dress until I fix it because it is way too big for me and really long, not what I expected but on the other hand I like the quality and it looks really similar than the picture shows. Thank you, when I fix it maybe I post a picture."
4.0,Fits great buy
4.0,I only gave it 4 stars.  If it was a right hand draw I would give it a 5.  I just carry it backwards which is no big deal.  It has a small zipper compartment on the front. I just keep Kleenex in it.  I needed a Kleenex and it was a hassle since it was not right on the front since I was carrying it backwards.  The quality is AWESOME  The strap is nice and wide so very comfortable to carry.
4.0,Do not put this in the dryer! It shrunk after maybe twice in the dryer. Soft and comfy material.
4.0,Most frequently used hat in my free time. Too bad there is no Forest Green.
4.0,"I hated giving this dress four stars, but it‚Äôs mostly because it‚Äôs see through and I bought the black. But it fits perfectly, very modest dress. Great for work!"
4.0,"Soft material, very cool graphic. Shirt is a little long. Would be perfect for people 6‚Äô2‚Äù. I‚Äôm a large 5‚Äô10‚Äù and it‚Äôs too long."
4.0,"The slippers are very well made. They are a beautiful petal pink. My only negative is that my grandaughter said they felt snug.<br />Of course, in all fairness she has feet like sasquatch so I can't fault the slipper."
4.0,"While these earrings are much as they are advertised, they do not have the quality look that would make me &#34;love&#34; them. I do like the arrangement of outside/inside sparkle of stones that gives the most concentrated look. They are fine for casual and everyday wear, they will not stand up to real quality stones and quality jewelry products."
4.0,"Strong and convenient !!<br />Used it for fly fishing, holding up my stripping basket."
4.0,"If you are looking for a bag that only holds your phone and credit cards maybe your lipgloss too, than this is the one for you. I love using it for running errands, it's light and not bulky. Strap could be a little longer."
4.0,After i had the dress taken in and hemmed my grand daughter looked perfect for ger snowball
4.0,Cute and comfy!!!!
4.0,Beautiful tie but darker than pictured.
4.0,liked the concept and it is convenient. Think it will blend with anything I wear.
4.0,"The material is quite thick and seems to be well made. The color is nice and overall this looks to be a good product. Unfortunately though, I ordered an extra small but received an extra large. So as far as the fit goes, I have no idea. If I had received the right size, I think I would have loved it"
4.0,I liked how the dress fit but not how the color red looked in person. I might buy one in another color.
4.0,"I got a small because I usually wear a medium and I read reviews stating that these ran slightly larger. I'm 5'7 at 168, athletic build and the small fits good. Not too tight but it fits. I didn't want a shirt hanging off of me so the small is good."
4.0,Good material  XXL  large quality well made  wash  warm  hang to dry .
4.0,"This is a really cute dress. I had to take it in a bit because the back was loose, but for the price, and 5 minutes of sewing, I can't complain. This served me well for a photo shoot, and would work well with white, blue, red or black accessories."
4.0,"I loved these leggings. The material is smooth and the colors are as shown.  I am 5 foot 7.5 inches tall and weigh 125 pounds. I ordered a size small. The small is too big. If you like a loose fit and usually purchase a small, you may like them. Unfortunately they do not have an XS. I don‚Äôt consider myself petite, but these won‚Äôt fit petite women. Sadly I have to return them."
4.0,Very slim around the middle
4.0,"Very pretty dress, but it was too small for me."
4.0,"Worked great for a stage costume for a squirrel character. But the tail doesn't stand up on its own like the picture, you can just bend the end a little for a curl. Nice and thick though!"
4.0,"Love this necklace, it looks really elegant and well made, not the normal costume jewelry around. You can use your fancy dress without remorse, when you pair it with this lovely piece."
4.0,Slightly bigger than I imagined but it makes a great fashion statement and it holds everything. Love it
4.0,"if the dress was a few inches longer it would have been perfect! i ordered a Large. overall it very well, but was not long enough. there was not a lot of stretch in the chest area. had i gone with an XL the length would have been perfect, but the bust would‚Äôve been to large given the deep cut. ultimately i returned it due to the length, but i do wish it would have fit because i was in love with it!"
4.0,Not very comfortable but cute
4.0,These shorts run small.  They re very light weight material and i don‚Äôt know how well they will stand up to daily wear and tear.  Due to the smaller than expected size i ended up returning my order.
4.0,"Very good for the money.  You may want to keep an eye on the two little screws, they may want to loosen up but a small screwdriver solves that."
4.0,Looks great on for an evening but they pull and are heavier than expected so special occasion OK but not everyday wear.
4.0,"These are pretty comfortable sports bras.  They have good coverage and their sizes generally seem to match up as advertised.  They don't give a lot of lift though, and I wouldn't market them for high-intensity activity. I had my sister hem the over the shoulder straps an inch shorter than they were to provide a bit better support. I'd say they're good for yoga, weight lifting, elliptical, biking, household chores, and non-bouncing activities."
4.0,"It was a nice necklace. We used this for an employee award denoting the number of years worked. It seemed sturdy and the chain was feminine but not too thin. I should have gotten a longer chain, but pleased with the purchase."
4.0,"Got this for my 14yr son cosplay. He is 5'4"" 145 got XXL but it was alittle small for him. It's made really good and the mask was very good quality felt like rubber not cheap plastic."
4.0,"Its a beautiful gown, gives a lot of room in the stomach region, which is good for folks with a chubby tummy.<br />I gave it 4 stars as though its true to size, the stomach region has a bit of extra space."
4.0,"I went a size larger than normal. Should have went up two sizes. But other than that, very cute and fast ship."
4.0,"Wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be see-through but it‚Äôs still cute and fits well for the most part. If you have larger boobs, I would get one size bigger."
4.0,"nice dress...thin material, runs a little small"
4.0,Adorable! Great length and quality. Would purchase again!
4.0,was a gift and she loved them.
4.0,They look great and others have complimented me on them. they are not going to last long as the price indicates but that is expected.
4.0,"Very nice purse. Very roomy, many pockets, easily cleaned, goes with anything. I can carry my Kindle in it!  I would definitely recommend it if you want a large purse."
4.0,"Heavy, really heavy !"
4.0,I love this t. Shirt fits great and it has become one if my favorite comfortable shirts.
4.0,"I really like the fit, very comfortable. The only thing is that it seems a little ‚Äúsee-through‚Äù. I don‚Äôt usually wear another shirt underneath, but feels like I need to."
4.0,Def not long term sunglasses.  Somewhat flimsy
4.0,"Overall it is a very nice strap. You can adjust it from 42-52 inches. There was some loose top stitching on one of the ends, but it didn't affect the straps purpose. As to be expected it is a little difficult to work the strap over the pegs, but it holds your guitar nice and secure once you have it in place (Do not cut your strap to put it over the pegs as this will reduce the effectiveness of it to hold your guitar securely).  The color is only slightly darker than what you see online, but still looks great. The padding is soft and makes for a comfortable strap paired with my acoustic, and would especially be nice if you pair this with a heavier guitar. Also if you are sensitive to smells you may not like this strap, as it has a very distinctive leather smell. It won't take over a room, but you can smell it since its literally right over your shoulder, but it should fade/mellow with time."
4.0,Goos
4.0,Fit perfect. I'm 5'2 and 124lbs. Small was perfect
4.0,I got this top & was so excited as the blue was such a pretty color.& the style is so nice<br />I got it for my daughter & her friends had told their mothers & next thing they was all buying the same top.thank you.
4.0,"Adorable litte swimsuit, great for the price! The top is a little more revealing than I like since  I will be chasing after a toddler, but I can easily swap the top and its still adorable! The bottoms are comfy and flattering. Love this suit!"
4.0,"The straps need to be made smaller. I slip in them now.  But beautiful, so when I get them fixed they will be fine."
4.0,Very comfortable and the polarized lenses are really clear period on the downside a lot of the red looks Orange must be more red!
4.0,Brought a size bigger to assure it fit my son. They look good. He is happy with them.
4.0,"Great Luke Skywalker jacket. Very good quality, the only problem was the XL felt like a Land the sleeve length was like a M."
4.0,Very sexy and revealing. Probably only for special occasions where one could get away wearing this.
4.0,Very pretty and light weight. it is nice but a little short  for wrapping more than one time. Colors looked like the picture wi
4.0,Large fit as expected. I am 6' 2&#34; 200 lbs
4.0,They run a little big so if you have a small face then they may not be good for you
4.0,Cute but runs a little smaller than what I hoped for.
4.0,"The connection to the batteries is deeper than the threads could go, so I used a paper clip to make the contact easier. Without this, it was not able to light up.<br />Does not come with batteries as described.<br />You‚Äôll need two CR2032‚Äôs and a paper clip."
4.0,A little thicker then I expected. Would be perfect if they were a little softer. Collar with Queenie ke is really cute! Nice outfit. Fit as expected. Very well made
4.0,Great quality for the price. Frame is sturdy and not flimsy at all. I'm a 5ft female and the fame is just a tad large for my face but I love the oversized frames. Great sunglasses!
4.0,"This jewelry set is gorgeous but upon arrival, one of the jewels had already popped out."
4.0,Cute. Versatile. Can dress up or down. I‚Äôm between a small and medium. It was a tad bit tight
4.0,"Very cute set but bra runs a little small. I originally ordered a size 36 D, but it barely fit. I contacted the seller to exchange for a 38 D. The seller replied to me via email in a timely manner, and made the exchange with no issues (a definite plus). I would suggest ordering a band size up for a perfect fit."
4.0,Over sized shell
4.0,Very good product. They fit nicely in my little purse.  Easy to find.
4.0,"My strap broke after about two months. But given the cost, that seems like a fair trade."
4.0,"I really like these. I usually wear a 9 so I bought XL. Could have easily worn a large. Still comfortable. They wash up great, feel great no ride up. I will buy again just a smaller size."
4.0,"Some of the seams look poorly sewn so I worry how long these will last. But overall, they function, still somewhat waterproof to an extent, and the many pockets come handy."
4.0,Somewhat bigger than I expected. Got this for my 3 y/o..front zippers are not actual pockets..the zipper sometimes gives me trouble. Ever since the first attempt fresh out the package. Keeps my daughter warm. Decent quality for price.
4.0,"Pretty, but tend to slip off my granddaughters heads."
4.0,I volunteer at a animal sanctuary. I needed gloves that would keep my hands warm and support the many activities like cleaning and feeding.<br />These gloves are great.
4.0,These tie clips are of good quality.  The variety of designs allows them to compliment or accent a wide variety of neckties.  I am pleased with this purchase.
4.0,Great with my Link Cosplay!
4.0,As described...love it.
4.0,"I bought this for my 3 year old. We live in the Pacific Northwest so that means rain for at least 6 months each year. This jacket really is waterproof and is flexible enough that my toddler can wear it for hours without being uncomfortable.<br /><br />The only bummer is that despite carefully following the care instructions, some threads came loose on the wrists after the first wash. It looks raggedly and I‚Äôm concerned that the wrist lining will eventually come off. That was disappointing to see given how much I paid for a child‚Äôs jacket."
4.0,This watch is overall a nice decent watch and I like wearing it.<br />When It first came in I immediately had to take off about 5 T bars because it was too big for my hand.<br />Thankfully it came with a little tool to make the process much easier.<br />After removing the T bars the watch fit very nicely and wasn't overly heavy. Its a great looking watch for going out and could easily look more expensive than it is.<br /><br />Lets start with the PROS.<br />I like the thickness and weight of the watch. Easy to wear all day but over time it does get annoying because of the metal band.<br />It appears to keep the time well and in sync with my phone. Time will tell though if it will stay this way.<br />The design is very nice and looks more expensive than it actually is.<br />The Other dials do work but more about them in the Cons.<br />Date ring is nice and not too flamboyient<br /><br />CONS.<br />It sometimes snags at my wrist hairs and that's annoying.<br />The sub-dials are not idea and or quality at that.<br />The 1/10 second hand will rotate about twice or 3 times and then will stop while the seconds and minutes will go on.<br />When you try to reset the sub-dials they sometimes won't work and then when they do the 1/10 sec will never stop at 00. I don't know why but its annoying so I just don't use them.<br />It looks like it would be nice to have but over all I think they are useless.<br /><br />Overall I think its a nice watch and good for just telling you the time and date. It has class and I like that. 4/5 for the sub-dials not working right.
4.0,"Pockets are, indeed, very &#34;tight&#34; as previously noted. The small compact insert is useless if you are wanting to use it as pictured. But, overall, it's a nice wallet"
4.0,Good delivery on this item. Great color.
4.0,"The color is good and the material is soft yet reasonably sturdy, but this was too small for me. To be fair, I took a chance -- I'm a 36DD and the sizing for the large listed 36D. With other reviews saying that it was very stretchy, I took a chance and it didn't work out. The overall quality is good, though, and my hope is that with my continued weight loss my cup size will calm down enough for this to fit.<br /><br />If you're on the upper end of the scale for the large, this probably isn't the bra for you. I took a star off for stretchiness -- the construction is good, but this isn't going to help much with high impact workouts. Even if it fit, I wouldn't try running in it"
4.0,i looooooooove this print - but when i got them these look vastly different than the 12-24 pairs of socks i've bought from other brands.  They look HUGEEEEEEE.  I'm keeping them anyways cause eventually they will fit her and i love the mary janes. :)
4.0,"I bought them as a christmas gift for my brother and i was worried that they were way too big, they looked huge! when my brother tried them they actually wernt as huge as i thought, he does need to grow into them though. theyre a real cute pair. go raiders!"
4.0,Suit was a tad small though the size was exactly what my husband wears.  Encouraged him to get a little more active and shed about 5 pounds for a more accurate fit...
4.0,it was the wrong size was unable to get label to send back for refund.
4.0,"These are very nice earrings for a good price.  They are stamped as advertised, and I have not removed them since purchasing them a few weeks ago; they have held up very well."
4.0,"It was a gift, and they loved it."
4.0,Cute top. worked perfectly as my water park cover-up. Super soft. Definitely wash it first as it comes with a funky chemical smell that comes out with the first wash
4.0,Thank you very much!!!!
4.0,No long enough.  But still a nice lightweight cardigan
4.0,Great shirt for workouts. A little longer than I would like and you for sure need a workout top or tank underneath.
4.0,After long deliberation I decided to purchase this dress. It fits perfectly.  The only problem is I have a big rump and it carries the back up a bit but still not too short.  I will surely buy again in different colours.
4.0,"I bought this shirt 3 weeks ago and am just now able to eat solid food since my jaw has been unwired. I made the mistake of wearing this incredible article of 100% cotton ferociousness to a sportsbar/nightclub in North Phoenix. Of course I got in free because the bouncer was so intimidated by the burning crimson eyes of my Grizzly shirt, he simply averted his own weak, brown eyes and stepped aside.<br /><br />As I strode in, several sad excuses for men screamed, dropped their Bud Light Limes and dove under the tables, thinking it was a real man-eating bear. Their women knew better than to be so easily frightened. They could smell the testosterone wafting off of the freshly printed design on the front, and one look at the shoulder-to-shoulder tape and my seamless collar had them fighting amongst themselves for the chance to be mauled on the dance floor.<br /><br />I chose the blondiest of them, and with her eyes half lidded, hungrily devouring the awesome image on my chest, she breathed, ""How heavy is it?"" I grunted my reply, ""5.6 oz, with double needle construction throughout"", and with one flick of my wrist, spun her out on the dance floor.<br /><br />The problem was that I didn't see the guy already out there in his Three Wolf shirt, as he had his back to me, dancing all girly. As I planted my feet majestically in the middle of the floor, letting my new blonde prize begin her Dance of Bruin Seduction, this joker that dared to wear a Three Wolf shirt to the same club as me turned around, and with a sudden crack of lightning, his triple Canis Lupus locked graphic eyes with my singular Ursus Horribilis and all H.E. double hockey sticks broke loose.<br /><br />I hate to say that since this was the first time I wore this shirt out in public, I just couldn't control it for longer than a few horrific seconds. It broke my jaw, lacerated my arms and dislocated my shoulder, but that poor s.o.b. barely had time to realize he brought only three wolves to a bear fight before his ego was chewed to metaphorical ribbons right in front of every awestruck desert hillbilly in the Arrowhead shopping district.<br /><br />If you dare to buy these bloodthirsty threads, I recommend you take some cage-fighting lessons or only go to off-season craft shows until you think you can handle the terrible responsibility of knowing what might happen if you cross paths with some fool in a lesser shirt."
4.0,"It's a nice ring, but I can't make it small enough to actually fit my finder the way I want it to."
4.0,"They were a bit of a challenge to get into the ear, then trying to get them to click shut was another issue, they are  better suited for a kid or little person."
4.0,I bought a medium and it‚Äôs a little loose just like the pic of the model. Material is thin and seems well made. I have washed it a few times with no problems.
4.0,I would recommend buying a  slip to go with but it is a fun dress go lots of complements
4.0,They dont fit the best but thats mainly because i have longer fingers than most. They are really well made and warm though.
4.0,This tags are very good
4.0,Love the look and feel of the hat but I have to fully extend the band in order for it to fit. Yes I have a big head at 7&#34; 1/2 but there should be a little more length to the adjustment band. I have a &#34;high and tight&#34; military style haircut so if my hair was any longer it would not fit.
4.0,If I would have sized down it would have fit perfectly. I may order again with a smaller size. Overall quality of the dress was good and I'm sure it would be cute with the right size
4.0,"Wish it was a little longer, but very cute and comfortable"
4.0,It looks a bit like a night gown.. My husband thought it was for bed.
4.0,The fit is a little off on me and I dont know why and it doesn't quite look like the picture but it's still cute and comfortable to wear around the house.
4.0,Fits as expected. Good god die.
4.0,"I usually wear a L/XL. Im curvy, 5'7&#34; 200 pounds. My hips are 15 inches bigger  than my waist. I still have a little muffin top. With that being said, I found these pants flattering. I ordered a XXL but they fit more like cool jeggings than anything. I am going to return them and get a XXXL. I wouldnt recommend this for size 16+. Otherwise, just get 2-3 sizes above your normal sizing and it should be good. The quality really wasn't bad at all so I disagree with that. Even though I saw one loose string, I never felt at any point that the pants would rip on me. It's worth it and it's really sexy and unique."
4.0,"They're actually exactly what I was hoping for/expecting -- really cute, shiny, spandex-fitting leggings. They're a bit thin, but honestly, they're $12, sooo...no complaints. Perfect for an ugly sweater Christmas party. I bought the red and white striped with the belt, and the color is really vibrant. They look exactly like the photo. I'm 5'5''/130ish lbs and really athletic/lean and got the small, which I think fit fine. My husband immediately said &#34;they're too big for you,&#34; but besides being a little long/baggy, they're totally wearable. Happy with them."
4.0,It‚Äôs not as tough as I would like it but still serves it‚Äôs purpose definitely keep you cooler and the sun off you
4.0,It works well. It is much more the size of an adult watch though
4.0,One of my favorite shirts. It fits really nice and flatter. I'm only giving 4 stars because the embroidery could be attached a little better but nothing a little fabric glue can't fix.
4.0,A few had mixed colors on them overall not bad
4.0,"Great dress, purchased in white - fit as expected and a bit see through but I'll be purchasing a slip to wear under. Over all, great purchaseüëç"
4.0,Good Quality shorts at a Great Price. Exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"I have extreme pain from Plantar Fasciitis. These are very comfortable inserts.  I have very high arches and these seem to help with that.  I feel like my arches are propped up a lot better than with inserts you buy in the store. I do wish that the heel had more cushion as that it wear the pain is the worst.  I added heal ""gel"" cushions along with these and that helped."
4.0,Love the band. Easy to replace my broken original Gear S2 band that Samsung refuse to replace after it fell off 10 after I bought watch. Like the fact that  this band is one size fits all and more flexible than original band. Shipping time was very quick.
4.0,The only thing I would like different  would be to have it a little longer!
4.0,"For an XS it sure feels like it's a M instead, but you can still pull it off. The material is soft and comfortable, nothing what expect from looking at the picture provided. Great shipping and arrival!!!"
4.0,"It is very cute but it got here very late, the post office had to re-tape the package; the package was all torn up as was the little while pandora box that you unfold and use as the gift box. It was punched full of holes. Sad as I was giving this to my 16 year old grand-daughter as a Christmas present. I will give it to her for her bday tomorrow. Wish the box looked better."
4.0,"Adorable dress! I‚Äôm a 34G and wear a 14/16 (40-34-41) and the xl was too big, large was perfect. BUT, the zipper broke the second time I wore it, so I exchanged it."
4.0,"I'm not sure of the material.  It's pretty thick and in Florida it might be too warm.  Dress fit and style are great.  Color different, but I like it.  Not sure if I'm going to keep only for the reason of the thick material."
4.0,Like it just to small in the waist area
4.0,"Not too notch, but close! Very nice for the price!"
4.0,"Most of them were good quality but some of them looked like they were made in a hurry, but my 12 year old daughter (Soon to be 13) liked them and said they go great with her loom band set."
4.0,"The fit was per the measurements, the fabric is of good quality, and were fairly easy for my husband to don as his first costume for steampunk/knight costumes."
4.0,"Order a size or 2 up!! I am between a small-medium but I got a large, glad I did! Super cute and comfy. Highly recommend! Also everyone was shocked when I said these were from amazon"
4.0,"This top is absolutely gorgeous.  My only complaint is that the bodice is a little more snug that I would like and the sleeves are tight as well  The rest of the top fits beautifully.  Also, the neck is more scooped than shown in the pictures and the scoop is wider on my shoulders than I usually like.  But it's a really beautiful top."
4.0,Priced right - looks very pretty
4.0,So far LOVE comfy w/o feeling like a sport bra or just a tank with shelf bra.
4.0,They appear to be true to size and material appears to be good quality.  They are gift.
4.0,Works well for blocking harmful light. One of the pairs I have is perfect. The other pair fell apart a bit quicker than I'd prefer. Still worth the price. Probably better for at home grows than commercial applications.
4.0,Will not be wearing til summer.
4.0,I hope to wear this while using the barre. It is long enough and should be good during cool weather
4.0,I bought these for my son who wears them to workout. He loves the lightweight fabric and the length. (size M) He did not like the liner and cut it out.
4.0,"strangely thick material, a little wide but cute"
4.0,Came as a set with 2 pair. Very decent quality for the cost.
4.0,"Traje muy c√≥modo. La tela suave, de buen grosor. Queda muy lindo. Muy complacida con mi compra."
4.0,digital not as easy to read as I had hoped
4.0,Nice pendant not giving 5 stars due to connection piece it looks a bit cheap
4.0,"It measures about 2"" by 1.8"". It is very detailed like the adult size. I purchased two to add on to my gtm bags. I will purchase more in the future if the price $6 or less. I originally purchased this pin at $9. Overall a good buy, definitely for those WCW fans."
4.0,"It's very cute, and it looks like the picture. The size chart is accurate, but there is no stretch in the fabric at all. I would have liked an elastic waist."
4.0,"I actually loved these shoes, but the usb plug on the shoe hurt his foot and was too uncomfortable to wear, will be ordering a different style<br />The colors were bright and really cool"
4.0,It fits great over similar material.
4.0,Nice belt. Runs a little big but worth the purchase.
4.0,"These are great for summer, bedtime or to wear under a hoodie or other shirt in cool weather they are cute and launder well but very thin material. Grandsons love them!"
4.0,madd tight so good compression üî• these perfect for braids too n only complaint is they rip too easily cause the fabric is weakk
4.0,Nice gloves for the price. Only downfall is that the magnet for the flip open for the glove is kind of weak and doesn‚Äôt secure the flap 100% of the time.
4.0,Cute for a little gymnast.  Long for a little girl... but looks cute on.  Great price.
4.0,"This watch was given to me from a friend about 4 years ago. I wore it for two years every single day and never had any trouble with it. I am very hard on most things (I go through shoes quickly, clothes quickly, etc...) This watch proved to be very durable. The reason I stopped wearing it, and also th reason I hesitate to give it 5 stars, is the band is broken. I just noticed one day the band was more loose than normal so I looked closely and sure enough one of the small rings on the link that attaches the band to the face was broken. I could just buy that new link piece (it took me until this week to get it fixed so I haven't been wearing it now for 2 years) but I could not find the peice on the fossil website. I will probably give them a call to find the link because I do love the watch. The band is really scratched up, I think it help up ok for a while, but like I said, I am tough on things. The crystal face has a few scratches in it, even though I had one of those silicon covers they make for watch faces on it for about a year.<br /><br />Summary: This is a great looking watch, you won't be unhappy with your purchase. The fossil brand althoug not top notch, is a good brand. The watch is semi-durable if you are hard on things. Buy it, you'll love it, and most likely you'll have no issues with it."
4.0,"What I loved about this product is that it‚Äôs super affordable but the material isn‚Äôt cheap or itchy. At first I thought it was going to be like those picnic table cloth feel, BUT it wasn‚Äôt. It has a little stretch to it as well and it‚Äôs super comfortable. Now that I think of it it‚Äôs perfect for everything from picnic dates TO back to the future type of photo shoots!"
4.0,"I bought this watch for my elderly mother but unfortunately, her eyes are so bad, she can't see the gold numbers against the black.<br /><br />The watch itself, is very nice, just not feasible for my mother.<br /><br />I am going to have to sent it back for, hopefully, a refund.  I will be ordering another watch with black numbers against a white background."
4.0,Cute. Has a rubber odor.
4.0,It was what it said
4.0,"These undies are WAY sexy! They look, fit and feel great, with the 95% cotton, 5% Elastane  blend providing great comfort (the former) and sexiness (the latter). These are clearly high-quality garments demonstrable through their material, the quality of the stitching, and the care to detail. The design elements are hot ‚Äì cut higher than most briefs at the thigh, fairly low-rise though not as much as briefs that are labeled as such, a wide waist-band that in addition to contributing to the good fit adds visual interest to the garment, and the front pouch that gives excellent support very much like a jock-strap though without the constriction. This last feature has the added benefit of a ‚Äúpush up bra‚Äù effect for guys that will be much appreciated by your significant other at relaxing moments. The Amazon page for these underwear advises buyers to go up a size from their usual choice as they run small. This is absolutely correct. I have a 34-waist and usually buy underwear labelled ""large,"" defined in most popular brands as fitting 34-36. I ordered the XL for these, however, which was exactly the right choice. I've become a big fan of Bshetr products. Purchasers of these undies are likely to become so, too."
4.0,nothing astonishing to me though it‚Äôs a simple rash guard
4.0,Great tracksuit that's comfortable and breathable. The material isn't at all thick so chilli days okay but really cold days no. But the color is great and the fit is good. The legs are just long.
4.0,"I normally wear a size 4 pants/skirts and a small or xs shirt. Average size is &#34;small.&#34; However, I'm used to items purchased online being too small so I purchased a size large. It is slightly big on the top but the bottom fits great. I think a medium would look too tight around the waist. Especially for this light gray. Overall good though."
4.0,for oacassionally use only
4.0,Just what I wanted--great price; only 4 stars as it took a very long time to arrive.<br />I can wear it next summer.
4.0,"Very cute sweater, great fall piece! It runs true to size, I ordered a size up and had to return and exchange for a small because the medium was a little too big."
4.0,"This is super cute! Fabric is a little thinner than expected, but very cute on. Will probably have to iron before each wear. I ordered a size up and fits great! For size reference I ordered a medium and am 5'3"", 130#. Would reccomend."
4.0,"Well made, fit as expected. Have not had a chance to test them yet. Feel like they will get the job done well."
4.0,Came packaged nicely and is very cute. Only complaint is you have to put the little charms on yourself.
4.0,Well made gloves.  Sized a little smaller than most gloves.  I advise finding a website with the hand diagram to place your hand over to find the proper size.
4.0,Super thin compared to my under armor but they are still warm enough for cold weather
4.0,"Love these gloves. Nice leather, soft and warm Inside. I think they run small- I needed a large."
4.0,This tank top is weird. I got it and it fit funny to my body. I wash it and it fits better. It‚Äôs very bulky and not very form fitting.
4.0,This safety vest is good for runners or bicyclists working out on dark streets. A little tricky to put on but with practice can be put on quickly.
4.0,"Not linen. Nice, lightweight cotton. They shrink a little (I'd prefer another size up if I bought them again.)<br />But pretty good for the price."
4.0,"Little too flimsy, but pretty good otherwise."
4.0,The logo on the front is a silk screen so its okay but not like real stitching.
4.0,The material is comfortable
4.0,"Super soft polyester.  Thought it was cotton, but it's alright."
4.0,"The following is from our teenage daughter because she's the one wearing them:<br />I really enjoy these earrings as their design is simple and sleek, but are still interesting pieces of jewelry. I enjoy the customization of wearing one chain link or two. However, an issue I have is with the images of the products. It is shown in nearly all of the pictures that the rounded part of the earrings go through the ear, but it is the straight edge that clasps through. Also, the rounded edge of the second link on each earring would not stay upwards, as it would simply slide down. I enjoy the earrings for how they are, but this could be an issue for anyone who is intending for a different style of product. Wearing them for a few weeks now, the gold has not changed color at all, and neither has my skin around my ear. I think, generally, this is a good product."
4.0,"The fabric is a little thin, but it may look better layered under a vest, etc. it is long enough for me and I'm about 5'8&#34;.  It feels great on -soft and not too clingy."
4.0,My daughter loves it. She is only 11 and on the smaller side and the XS fits her perfect. I gave only 4 stars because while it worked for us the sizing was small.
4.0,"Bought this for my brother as a gift because he really likes this show. He loves the hoodie! It's very soft on the inside and smooth on the outside. I haven't washed it yet so I'll update when I do, to see if the printing holds up. I only gave it 4 stars becuase I did size up one size (not true to US sizes). My brother is a medium in his other jackets/hoodies but I did size up one size (got him a large). I'm glad I did because it fits him very well.<br /><br />Edit: I've added images of the inside of the hoodie. The inside is fleece/soft. Also, it survived its first wash too."
4.0,The fabric is not what I expected and it is quite a bit shorter than the picture.
4.0,Nice ring I like it. Good for  a man or lady  with large fingers. Nice design. Definitely a recognizable chewy.
4.0,"Soft , warm and comfortable"
4.0,The fabric is actually as nice as the pictures!! luxe. I found the sizing a bit small and the exposed buttons strange but it actually is a nice blazer-esque sweater
4.0,"I loved the looks of the shoes but unfortunately the shoe tended to gap on the sides .  I generally have that problem with any shoe, sometimes I am lucky that the shoes don't gap on the sides and I usually tend to buy several pairs be it the same color or a different color.  Maybe the problem is that the shoes are not deep enough at the heel area."
4.0,The fit was true to size. The color is not as bright as the picture shows.
4.0,Fit me perfectly but I found it too short even at my height. I wish the fabric had a bit more stretch. The color is lovely and the material is really soft.
4.0,"Good comfortable, cheap shoe for everyday wear for kids."
4.0,Very comfortable. The colors are awesome. I dislike the very visible seams. They are even more evident than they‚Äôd be with a hand made item.
4.0,I like this cap. It is well made and exactly as pictured. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that it is a little bit small. I am a size M. I have different caps and hats and I fit almost all the time in a size M with no problem. I used a hat stretcher and it is fine now but I should not need to use one.
4.0,"I barely know my watch is on my wrist.  Comfortable, easy to slide on and easy to install."
4.0,"Really good quality compared to other brands out there. Love the color, only wish it came with a case i would have gave it 5 stars"
4.0,My son likes the sweater a lot.
4.0,"Very pretty but not the green I thought it was going to be. It's actually not green at all, just blueish. Still pretty though."
4.0,"It is great; however, the end is a little unkempt, which is perfect for the comfy look. I am just hoping that over time, the bottom doesn't unravel."
4.0,"cute for my daughter, expensive for a single pair of socks."
4.0,My daughter was excited to receive this Christmas morning.  She has worn in almost every night since.
4.0,I didn‚Äôt like that I could see the white elastic band but it is very nice.
4.0,Very satisfied with the design and color matching.
4.0,"Sexy, silky and long.<br />This kimono runs a little small so it was a little snug unfortunately, but still served its purpose.<br />All around nice kimono just buy the next size up and this will be all you ever wanted!!"
4.0,It was not a flattering fit and made very cheaply.
4.0,I love the color and sturdiness of the band. However I find it hard to stay up during the day as the magnetic of the band starts to moving as I‚Äôm walking and doing stuff
4.0,"The watch band works pretty well after using it for a couple weeks. You will have to adjust the tiny screws so it attaches firmly to your watch. The pin removal tool they give you is garbage though. It may work for you, but mine had a bent piece that pushes the pin out, so it didn't work. I ended up purchasing a better pin removal tool that worked excellent."
4.0,Love it. Fits nice. Soft material
4.0,Overall a good watch strap for the price
4.0,"This cover did a pretty good job of protecting my luggage, I did find quite a few scuffs on my brand new luggage after removing the cover.  They were not as bad as they could've been though. I love that I can easily spot and find my luggage."
4.0,I like the way it looks and the way it fits.
4.0,Pj‚Äôs or shorts
4.0,"Nice quality- thin but warm. Because the socks are a blend, they do create pills and lint balls, but hold together reasonably well. Not for the tundra, but great for the city."
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, will go down in size."
4.0,"The dress was beautiful but, the sizing was a little small. My dress came a little to big for me."
4.0,Kinda a pain to make tight around waist. Seems good quality.
4.0,Great fit. Great price. Wish it were a bit tight were the calf were to create the bubble look. Received compliments. Would purchase again.
4.0,Add one size  to your kids current size before ordering.
4.0,Get value. I need a red large?
4.0,It‚Äôs a nice shirt but it couldn‚Äôt fit around his head. I had to stretch the neck alittle bit. My son doesn‚Äôt have a big head either. This the first shirt I‚Äôve bought that did this
4.0,Recommend it fits well. It has a nice look.
4.0,I bought these earrings for a birthday gift for my teenage granddaughter and she loved them. They are nicely made but a bit heavier than usual for her earlobes. She wears them anyway but they might be better suited for an adult. Nicely packaged and mailed quickly. üòÅ
4.0,These are excellent quality and a great value but they are definitely larger than a standard size 12 flip flop sandal.  I live in Jamaica so it wont be possible to return them because of the complications of returning items to the US from here.  I can purchase another pair but I will also try to call Amazon customer service to arrange another option...They are usually excellent with things like this...I would do well with an 11.5 instead in these sandals...I love them otherwise though and will be buying them again for the look and the support and the heavy duty quality
4.0,I like the product but it says fold over!<br /> It does not !<br />It fits me good a large and I‚Äôm a size 6 bottom so it runs small
4.0,"I love the print of this skirt, the colors are as shown.  I ordered a size up (large) based on reviews, but it was too big so I returned this.  I'm 5'6&#34; 140 lbs and wearing a size 6 pant.  I think the medium would have been a much better fit.  It's also pretty long, which wouldn't be a problem in heals."
4.0,Useful for Computer viewing and night time driving.
4.0,Love the way it looks on but it does run a little small for bigger brested girls
4.0,"I ordered my normal size because of a review that said it was baggy. For me, I would have been more comfortable with a size or two bigger because it‚Äôs not baggy. This was very tight and fitted on me and I don‚Äôt like my clothes that way. I washed and dried it and it still looked good after doing so. This seems well made and I had no issues with the hoodie string in the laundry. Also, it‚Äôs cropped. In my picture, the blue top underneath is a pajama tank. If it hadn‚Äôt been so fitted, I probably would wear it with a tank underneath because I‚Äôm not the person who will wear cropped. So, if you like your clothes fitted, order your normal size. If you like it looser, you may want to consider a bigger size."
4.0,"Good fit for waist and comfortable, but mobility in hips is limited."
4.0,"Thick cushioned socks.  These are great they are  a little higher on the ankle which is good for hiking boots.  The cushion is great and these are warm. The socks are comfortable and wash well. Great socks for walking, hiking or even aerobics.  Nice mid ankle mens socks."
4.0,"i love, bisuturia beautiful, I love, I congratulate"
4.0,"Comfortable fit, great dress down Fridays at work."
4.0,Great value once you get past the toxic smell.  It took about 6 weeks.
4.0,"The shirt looks great but is a bit short in length. Granted, I am 5'8&#34; and need a longer length shirt. So if you're tall just keep that in mind. Overall, it is cute and lightweight."
4.0,A bit too small for my head
4.0,"Pretty dress however gems and jewels fall off easily. Only glued on, not stitched. Packing was terrible. Crammed in a bag, not a box. Placed in my mailbox ,not brought to the door."
4.0,"I love the suit, but the bust is huge. I have a large chest, but these are huge. I am a seamstress so altering the cups was easy for me. I love the longer skirt and the retro pattern."
4.0,Small but I'm losing weight so it will be ok
4.0,"I thought i was gonna be small so i purchase a size bigger, but it was actually truth to size and too big for me."
4.0,"I was sad when target got rid of their tanks w/ the built in bras.. so in a desperate attempt to find a replacement, I ordered these. I am SO pleased! I like them better than the Mossimo ones even!!! Definitely buying a pack in every color - and some repeats!"
4.0,These would be perfect with a nose wire and no logo.
4.0,I read the few reviews available and they were right. i am 5'7 and 140lbs and wear a true medium however i ordered an xl and it fit perfect. The quality of the shirt was great and washed well. also i gambled that the toddler size would be true to fit and it was. my daughter wears a 5t and that's what i ordered and it fit well. i would have rated this a 5 if not for the sizing.
4.0,"really cool glasses, wish the temples were longer for us guys. clubmaster seems geared more for women. purchased for my husband but too small."
4.0,I love this top. Only complaint is that the hood is a little heavy so you are constantly pulling the shirt back up.
4.0,Great quality. But definitely a ladies cut. Not for big busted women.
4.0,Cute inexpensive gift. Price was good
4.0,"Bought two of these and, while they work fine, the colors are disappointing. My photo makes them look better than they are. The pink is a washed out baby pink and the green is dull. Functionally, they work great on a Charge 4!"
4.0,Very nice bras.
4.0,Nice shirt and fits ok. kinda long on the arms but I see from the model that the arms are a bit slouchy. overall I like it. I'm 5'4 260 pounds and I believe I ordered the  3X.
4.0,"The masks are really pretty; however the order only has 2 masks, photo is misleading."
4.0,Very good for the price. I like the unique shape as well. And the arms reach past the lenses when folded!
4.0,It‚Äôs what expected. Count see out of it and it wasn‚Äôt comfortable. But still cute costume.
4.0,Really cute light up sandals.<br />Fits as expected.
4.0,"The heel hight is perfect. They are fairly comfortable, but just like any over the knee boot they fall down after 20 steps. Other than that they are great and the material cleans nicely."
4.0,"Fit well, just slightly small. Very comfortable"
4.0,Very nice shirt. Exceeded my expectations. Fits great. Loose fit.
4.0,"It came in nice packaging. Not quite as pretty in real life as in picture, but still pretty and comfortable"
4.0,"Very comfortable, even after a long work day.  Helps me with my leg problems."
4.0,They are nice for the price and they stretch good
4.0,"Nice length, but pretty sure I received the white stone instead of the pink. I don't hate it and for ~$10 the cost per wear should work out nicely. Will likely purchase several in multiple colors. The chain isn't real gold and the quality is about what you'd expect for $10. This shouldn't shock anyone :)"
4.0,Loved it - just not for me
4.0,Better than i expected.  I'm using 6 cards. Can fit a few more.  Half as bulky as my wallet. Not using flap to hold cash. The stretchy fabric holds a few bills without using the flap
4.0,Worked great on my glasses. Easy to install
4.0,"Fits well, really like the way it looks and it's comfortable for the summer heat."
4.0,I like de fabric
4.0,These shoes are very pretty but unfortunately I had to return them as they were to small and they didn‚Äôt currently have a bigger size in stock.
4.0,Very cute dress!!
4.0,The ring didn't look exactly like the picture but for the price it's okay I recommend it though
4.0,I thought these would be too bulky to wear for regular slippers but they are just fine.  I bought them for part of a costume but now I wear them for slippers as well.
4.0,"I love the colors and the bra fits pretty well, but I find the inserts to be a little awkward and difficult to move back into place when they shift in the wash.  The leggings are a really comfortable material, but I found mine to be just a bit too small, still wearable, but wouldn't mind a little more room to move around in them."
4.0,Good booties for my 10 month old. They stay on well and offer another layer of warmth.
4.0,Love the material!!!!
4.0,I am on the smaller side of a 36C and it fit fine? The removable pads were crinkle and weird looking so I removed them immediately and threw away. I would prefer a little padding but not the padding in these. The lace is pretty.
4.0,Well the Elite lens is really what it claims this is my 3rd pair of lens from Revant. My 1st and 2nd was their Enhanced lens Blue and Titanium. It‚Äôs as good as the original lens from Rudy Project.
4.0,"I do like the fit on me, it is eye catching. However the fit gets easily loose. The elastic threading holding the shape have already come out and can be seen if one looks closely.  I would recommend a very gentle hand wash and to lay flat to dry to try to make its fit last as long as possible."
4.0,Beautiful dress and great quality for the price but runs very small. I‚Äôm typically a size 12 and the size 14 was still snug. Dress is also super long - I‚Äôm 5 foot 7 and would need to wear a decent size heel to avoid stepping on it.
4.0,Love the dress fit as expected and very comfortable
4.0,My niece in law loved them
4.0,I like the stretchy material and comfortable fit
4.0,"Very comfortable, size and color slightly different than appearance in the description.<br />Although this item doesn't specify a size, as a one-size-fits all for swimsuit coverup, it came packaged with a sticker stating it was size Large.  Personally, I find it runs a bit oversized, although the material is very comfortable and lightweight.  I plan to use more so as a comfortable loungewear during vacation in a hot climate.<br />The color is also slightly different than the description photo as the blues are slightly more muted.  The seams are nicely completed though and the sleeves are a batwing style.  I am 5'7&#34; and the length reaches down to my ankles.<br />Overall, a nice casual coverup and multi-use item.  This can easily be thrown into a suitcase without worry about taking up space or wrinkling.<br />Item came to me shipped earlier than expected which was appreciated.<br />This item was purchased at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review."
4.0,"Being one of the women &#34;blessed&#34; with a large bust, i often have trouble finding bra's that fit right. I recently found a style i loved, but the band was around my torso was just a smidge too tight. I looked at a few extenders, but ultimatly choose this one as it had the 3 color options. The extenders fit my bra perfectly, the hooks line up exactly. The extender adds just the right length to make my bra fit comfortably. I have had 2 on 2 different bra's for about 3 weeks now. The stitching is not the highest quality, but so far neither has come apart at all. I have washed them, but not dried them, and they are still in good shape. I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Turns out the other buyers were right.  This yellow is slightly darker than a golden yellow, almost bordering mustard.  Was expecting more of a bright canary (or golden) yellow like the monitor.  Upon closer inspection and reading some more of the reviews (especially for yellow and pink purchases, I notice that the colours of the clothing pics look slightly different (and probably inaccurate) to the colour of the fabric pics (which might be more accurate).<br />Other than that, my Medium fits like a Large... I know it's supposed to be a loose fit, but compared to other Mediums I've purchased, this one is bulky at the back... I feel a small would have much shorter and probably tighter sleeves, which I do not want, because the sleeve length is fine.  Disappointed, but the colour is still loveable, and I will probably have a seamstress/tailor take it in for me."
4.0,My daughter loves it. A little loose but otherwise great product!
4.0,Cute top runs too large and the leg warmers are huge and unnecessary.  Would be better to have a cute pair of booties instead of leg warmers. Tutu is absolutely adorable n so is the headband.
4.0,"Super comfy, perfect fit. Ordered 2 more!"
4.0,"It would be prefect if it was the color I thought it would be based off picture.  Had a cute orange fox sweatshirt but these shoes are actually light brown. As far as fitting correctly, they seem right but I also am new to this who infant shoe thing"
4.0,"Bought these for my two teen aged boys - they fit great, although a little shorter than anticipated."
4.0,Cute bracelet. Will be nice for the spring/summer time.
4.0,"These are beautiful shoes, but just have a strange fit.  I buckled them on the last hole and they were still too wide for my daughter.  I'm hoping that as her foot grows she will be able to fit them better."
4.0,Very colorful and roomy! I will use it as an everyday bag. Took away one star because it had a slight odor that I was able to clear with some febreeze! Still a good buy!
4.0,"This fits great as a shirt, not so much as a dress-like top, as shown in the pics. Nice soft material."
4.0,"Very cute, but about half as long as pictured."
4.0,Top and bottom too big.
4.0,"Llego a tiempo, y el producto esta en buen estado, muy c√≥modo"
4.0,Smaller than I expected. Nicely made.
4.0,like them much
4.0,My daughter really likes this dress. It looks very &#34;dressy&#34; and made for a great Birthday Dress for her party.
4.0,a little &#34;cheaper looking&#34; than pic shows
4.0,"I love the GIANT size of this tote (Accommodates all the swimming detritus for a family of 5) and it looks great as well. People always stop me and ask about it. However, due I am sure, to the giant carrying capacity, the grommets just can't hold up to the weight and the handles pulled through. We just tied the rope around and it works fine."
4.0,Its a functional wallet. I can't say for sure if it actually blocks rfid or not though. It does have a weird smell that will hopefully fade with time.
4.0,This is a very nice top. The only thing that I didn't like was that the inside lining is white. This is not a double-sided floral print.
4.0,"Fabric and color good, size slightly smaller than your standard large"
4.0,"Fantastic quality for the price, but it does have it's weaknesses. I would not buy this for normal everyday work, but it works great if you're not throwing it around."
4.0,"Although this is a nice dress and has a range of sizing to chose from there was a few flaws. As soon as I opened, there were beads falling off. It could have been something that happened during shipping. You can see where those beads came off, but you have to be looking really close and paying attention to see it. I have worn this dress once and thankfully no other beads came off, while dancing. I wore it to a local benefit event. Plus there were lots of empty strings on the top, missing the rhinestones or beads, more around the back. Again, it wasn't noticeable, unless looking for it, but it could be because it was a black color. There was also plenty of extra beads and rhinestones in a ziplock back that was close. but I don't think I will be adding them back on.<br /><br />Other than that I do like the design, and the length. It is one of the shorter dresses and looks really cute on. It is a bit heavy though, but not a problem for me to wear. Mainly the top piece is where most of the weight is. Then the bottom has many layers of tulle and the inside layer is a more softer fabric. Which makes it more comfortable when wearing. It will need to be hanging, or it will be easy to wrinkle. Had no problems with the back zipper and there is also a little hook on the inside, at the back of the neck to close up the top. There are two inter strings, to hang the dress from to keep it looking good.<br /><br />This is a dress that for wearing to formal events. Like prom, and could possibly be worn to a pageant, if this is the look you are going for and not a big contest. I did achieve the look I was going for and had many compliments during the formal event. I am happy with this choice and color. But there was a few things I wanted to point out. I received this product for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Great starter watch! Came in good condition, however could have been more secure in the box. item was bouncing around."
4.0,"This is a good wristlet with some design flaws.  The bill slot is on the credit card side when it should rightfully be on the coin-holder side.  Who wants to unzip both sides at the cash register?  Also, i agree with the reviewer who said that the card slots were too tight.  i can say, though, that this issue gets better with time as the product gets worn in.  Neither of these things would make me return this wristlet. It suits my needs, there is simply room for improvement."
4.0,"I ordered one pair of these and one pair of the similar ones by best fitness sold for $13,99 each. I have bought 3 previous multi packs of compression socks for my husband by other manufactures and they were all problematic so I figured when buying from new manufactures this time I would order one of each and wait to order more based on his preference and how they hold up in the wash.  They hold up well (have been washed in hot water multiple times and put in the dryer without losing elasticity or shrinking) and most importantly stay up on his legs while working and provide good support and pressure. He works 10-12 hours on his feet and these have been the best by far. I have ordered additional pairs. I would have given five stars except for the $10 per pair price point but they were still less expensive than the best fitness socks and a better product."
4.0,Sleeves were a little shorter than I expected. Other than that it's a compression shirt looks to be well made and looks just as pictured. I t again
4.0,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the sleeves are super long. I got an XL because I‚Äôm a chesty/curvy woman (5‚Äô7‚Äù, 210lbs) everywhere fits awesome even with an extra sweater underneath for the super cold days, it‚Äôs just the damn sleeves."
4.0,The size I picked was to large for me. Be aware of that. Review the size chart before picking a size. Otherwise it's a beautiful shoe.
4.0,"My wife purchased this one for a special occasion. She was pleased with overall looks, size. The only thing she didn't like was the back. it looks like a different material from the front. Other than that is a good looking blouse."
4.0,"Ehh.. I guess it will do and I will use for now but.. wish it had a couple of hidden pockets underneath the cardholders with side entries like many other wallets. It is very simple and not many card slots though it has plenty of room for another card panel to have been inserted since the large zippered body allows for more volume but the space is not utilized well.üòï A newer non-plus sized phone with a phone case does not fit well in front pocket as I've had to force mine and work at stretching out closure flap in order for phone to fit. I'm sure that's what most people wish to do with the front pocket, is put their phones in it.. they should've made the pocket a quarter to half inch longerüôÅ The width of the pocket it fine, it's the length that needs work. I was hoping to get this in black but so far, I've only seen the two oddly tinted colors offered. I chose the purple which is not an eggplant or plum that I hoped for according to pics and reviews, but is is rather a brownish with a wine/burgundy tone. So far, Stronghold RFID Wallets are the most protected according to tests and many reviews and the men that I know usually use Stronghold brand so I wanted something protective for me as well therefore I purchased one and chose this particular wallet for the pocket for my phone and the zippered enclosure as well as it being a wristlet. I will use and keep this for the time being but hopefully Stronghold will take these design issues into consideration when designing their next women's wristlet rfid wallet.<br />****update: This color has grown on me and I really do Like this color a lot now!!üòÅ"
4.0,Like them . Sorta hard to clasp . But all an all like them .
4.0,"Excellent shorts, I have several from Costco, this pair was sized wrong."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loved it. She let me know they run a bit big for a medium, so figured I would share that bit of information. It came on time and was nicely packaged :) It does not have pockets!"
4.0,"I love this pajama!!! Excellent quality, very good finish and they fit as expected!! Good quality material and really light weight too. It fits well and I feel true to size. Get delivered very fast and well packed."
4.0,"Beautiful looking and reasonably priced. My only complaint is if it touches your skin it may turn you green, but if it is only in your hair and not touching your forehead, it should be fine. My wife had a green leaf on her forehead, but nobody saw it, so no big deal."
4.0,Used the clutch to convert my mulcher from direct drive. The upgrade works GREAT! Bill
4.0,Very beautiful. I was really happy i bought these!
4.0,The color pattern is good. Fit is a little on the small side. Disappointed that the shorts don't have a built-in liner but I can get around that. Probably should go up a size.
4.0,Absolutely adorable print. Not a big fan of the material but it cleans easily.
4.0,"Was pretty and fit nicely on me, got a large and fit nicely I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 190lbs, a little short length wise on taller women"
4.0,"Love the ombr√© color, dress fit good other than it was a little short for my 5‚Äô 10‚Äù height but it was fine for a beach vacation."
4.0,"Fits well, remind me more of tights than leggings. Can't say that I mind, though."
4.0,"I bought the shirt because of the saying - too funny! I kind of thought that it looked like a workout shirt, so I'm not that surprised that I have to wear it with a sports bra (because it definitely shows whatever type of bra you're wearing underneath). I ordered a small and it fit loosely which is what I prefer. Bra size is 34B, FYI. Definitely would have worn this as a normal shirt if it was so low hanging, but like I said, if you wear a sports bra and wear it as a workout shirt or something around the house, it works!"
4.0,Good fit can't wait for the season to change
4.0,These earring were cute but the color was almost red I was looking for more fuchsia in color. I returned but was very satisfied with the transaction.
4.0,Very comfortable! Just one thing the sweater came very wrinkled and looked like it was used and returned. But it‚Äôs okay I still like it the sweater was in good condition thank you.
4.0,"Great pair of socks, typical Stance quality, which is stellar"
4.0,"Really cute and soft. It DOES get black lint all over my child's neck and legs; we'll see if that goes away after a few more washes. But comfortable firetruck pajamas went over really well, and the black color is less likely to get stained with breakfast than the previous mainly white pjs."
4.0,This is a great hoodie! It's a bit smaller than expected though. But comfy! I had to return it because my preggo belly couldn't fit in it lol. I was looking for something baggy enough that I could wear during my 3rd trimester. They gave me my refund no problems! I'd buy from them again for sure :)
4.0,It is more durable than expected. Lasts a full work day and comfortable to move around. Bought for a teacher to wear over clothes. Order 1-2 sizes larger than you think because size runs a little small. Does the job. Reordered already.
4.0,I love the bottoms. Cheeky but not a thong and great quality. The top is slightly adjustable but still was a little large and i ordered my normal size so I wish that fit better or was more adjustable. I'm keeping it but I will have to be more careful making sure the top is secure while wearing it.
4.0,Nice material a little more dinner outfit than office
4.0,This kit is really nice. It comes with a lot however its missing one of the most important items Crep has to offer and that is the Crep protect spray. In my opinion the spray is extremely important because it deflects dirt and stains from your shoes. I feel like a small bottle should have been included in this kit at $50 but instead you have to purchase the bottle of spray separate. All in all a decent product and i do suggest buying just know what you are getting before hand...
4.0,FABRIC NOT VERY THICK
4.0,Nice and light and fits well. Looks like it will hold up well but I haven‚Äôt washed it yet. Bought for a trip and doesn‚Äôt seem to take much room in the suitcase at all. Will go with a lot of clothes I‚Äôm taking and be easy to travel with.
4.0,I'm 5 1 and I weigh 118 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits me perfectly. Thanks!
4.0,"It's good but not great. 4 out of 5<br />I love that you can adjust the aize.to your liking and sizing. A lot of others are limited to you have to fit them, this fits you. It's very long but at the same time it's not. Not sure if I'd recommend if you have a long torso and a belly. I have a smaller torso and it barely made it.<br />Now the reason I don't love love this is because when you close it, the velcro doesn't stick very well. So if you buy it, wear loose clothing. It also folds, doesn't hold its shape very well at the top."
4.0,My has used 3 times. Still fogs on very cd days.  For the price is ok. If you ski often you definitely need to invest more money.
4.0,"While a gorgeous dress, my wife forgot her Euro-size."
4.0,"So far so good. They don't exactly feel cheap, but they aren't extremely high quality either. They look nice. I've used for a month or so now, and everything still looks good. Time will tell how they hold up in the long run."
4.0,not crazy about the feel of the fabric it's heavy for poly and it's a bit too big but I am keeping it for more variety.
4.0,The color is amazing and the product never looses it's shape
4.0,Injured my elbow several weeks ago. Still don't have range of motion to put on a back closure bra. These bras have been a lifesaver. I bought 2. Comfortable especially since I am used to wearing underwire and these just have elastic. They stretch enough too so I can  pull the left hole over my injured arm. Zipper connects pretty easily without a struggle<br /> Bra Pads come out so you can wash bra. Great find!!
4.0,"The fit of this shirt is perfect for me. Also the design - I used to have a 1980 Z28 exactly like the one shown on this shirt. The transfer, artwork, and color are very good quality."
4.0,Good alternative
4.0,Cute hoodie....length is good...love the pockets
4.0,Really Nice !!!!!!
4.0,"I really like it but I wish the sleeves were longer and the cuffs were shorter (odd length of for sweater cuffs). It looks nice on,  I ordered one size up and it fits nicely."
4.0,"These are decent entry-level ties, to get you started in the tie-game. They help add some diversity to your collection and are budget friendly.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Cheap<br />+Look nice from a bit of distance<br />+Three-pack<br /><br />CONS<br />-One started to fray quickly, the other two a bit quicker than I anticipated<br />-Hold knot crinkles<br /><br />For the value you paid and what you are getting, it's a positive experience. I would recommend it for someone that needs a variety of ties and colors, but bear in mind you should upgrade each one fairly soon to a better quality."
4.0,"Very nice tailoring, color and fabric. I normally wear a size 10 on the bottom and 14 on the top. The size xxl fits perfect."
4.0,Sterling silver.<br />Heart design with cheesy inscription.<br />Length was a bit short for my wife‚Äôs taste.
4.0,"When I bought them I thought they charged and kept them hot. They do not, you have to be plugged in to use them. When they are on the work great, just inconvenient with the cords hanging around."
4.0,Ami hijo ke encanto
4.0,"This is a very nice tank. The stripes matched up well, it's light weight, washes nicely. I give it 4 stars because it's cut almost like a racer back. Shows my bra straps."
4.0,To small cheaply made. Broke the first time granddaughter put them on
4.0,Love the product. Goes great with Christmas
4.0,"Had to cut the sleeves because they squeezed my arms too tight. Other than that, love the dress and I look fabulous."
4.0,"Very nice line, a little light weight for winter unless you wear it over tights."
4.0,It was shipped vacuum wrapped and took a couple of days to 'relax'. I got the Army green and I love the color and the loose fit.
4.0,This is the 2nd dress that I have bought.  It fit great and everyone at the Christmas party asked where I got it. Will be buying more.
4.0,Was snug to get on but my son likes it
4.0,"Great gift! Be careful of it tho, the sword slips out when it pleases."
4.0,"Perfect for me 2XL,I needed XL"
4.0,Looks like I expected.
4.0,Received compliments. Very nice purse. Not to big not too small.<br />Cons: handle part where you would hold it does flake a little maybe thats the correct word - I believe darker tan color not as light like appears in picture<br />Yes would buy again. Hope this helps.
4.0,"The pants that I ordered are not the ones I received.  I actually am quite happy with the ones I accidentally received.  They don't have a zipper or button in the front as the ones shown.  They have a side zipper which makes them look much more professional.  Although I don't even have to unzip them to get them on and off, they are comfortable and move well with me when I do massage and skin care.  I am happy with this because the ones shown would not have been this comfortable. than the ones shown which was what I purchased them for to begin with.  They fit nicely, they are very comfortable but are much too long on me even in the highest of heels they still drag on the floor so I will have to have them hemmed."
4.0,The zebra print is starting to peel off already.
4.0,I love the style and so far seem to be comfortable - I did purchased a bit larger but wear with socks - great.
4.0,"Really nice shoes! Very flashy and cute. They are comfortable and fashionable! I adore the satin laces, and the sparkle factor is ""wow""! Fits true to size. I have narrow feet and wear a half size, so if you don't have either, might be better to order up a size to have comfy toe room."
4.0,This product is adorable! & I love that I don‚Äôt have to worry with putting holes in my daughter‚Äôs dresses with pins. This has to be the strongest magnet I‚Äôve ever seen. Only downfall is the stone fell out when I took the magnet apart. But nothing a little super glue won‚Äôt fix.
4.0,Nice but dyed
4.0,Tremendously help<br />With my  battle with led headlights
4.0,I have problem with green ears but if you take them out everyday it‚Äôs not an issue!!!!
4.0,"These shorts seem to be really good quality, and my husband says they are really comfortable. That said, we ordered his normal size and it was just a bit too tight. I ended up ordering more in the next size up, and they are perfect. So I‚Äôd recommend sizing up."
4.0,They are very nice belly piercings thank you
4.0,Very recomendable..... this is the kind of T-shirt you will use every day in summer time !!!!
4.0,I love this pants. They are true to size and super comfortable.
4.0,"I truly loved the necklace, I received it a few days after my dog passed away.  I didn't know he wouldn't be with us when I ordered.  I felt like he sent me a message.  I deleted 1 star because I didn't realize it was so tiny. Other than that, I love it."
4.0,"I like the fabric very much, I like the collar and cut around the neck. very comfortable to wear and looks great. I bought one in white, but the xxl was a bit to large overall. but for the price I wont return it, i will wear it anyway."
4.0,It came the day promised and in protective packaging.  Beautiful piece looks just like the picture. Came with a nice  storage  pouch  I like how the leather &#34;chain&#34; is a slide to adjust vs tying it. 4 stars for now until I see how it wears.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet lighter than I thought but I like it although this is the second one I bought the first one was ordered but they only sent a empty box
4.0,"Nice case, product"
4.0,Good quality piece. Heavy knit  was used as a cheer costume in Grease production. It is small for a woman but fit my 12 year old exactly as I had hoped it would
4.0,"The material is great! These actually look really nice too. It was more comfortable than I expected, I am able to wear it all day and still feel and look good. I washed it in the delicates cycle on my washer and the came out the same as they were before washing. It just makes my clothes feel better on.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Grandson, age 5 , loved them"
4.0,I ended up being allergic to it because of the metal but it did break easily
4.0,"Good onesie for a cold night out on Halloween or just cute PJ's. It's a party city costume, you get what you pay for."
4.0,It‚Äôs pretty kinda big if you have small wrist. Good material not heavy but not super light.
4.0,"Nice design, As described and as expected"
4.0,This dress was super cute but unfortunately too large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and 160lbs and the large was too big
4.0,"So the white, while not sheer, the pockets stand out underneath as a brighter white.<br /><br />Very comfy, loose fitting dress otherwise!"
4.0,Works for what I need them for.
4.0,"We used this all weekend for a convention and got a few compliments on it. Clear bags weren't mandatory, but security thanked me for carrying one and said it made their job so much easier. It's an attractive little bag and I love the guitar strap. It's a great crossbody length and fit. It is quite small, so it won't hold a ton. But it held a phone, wallet, room key, lipgloss - everything that we needed it to. We won't be using it that frequently, so I expect it to last for years. My reason for reducing a star is that it mixes gold and silver. There are silver zippers on the purse, but gold on the strap. I wish they were the same. Otherwise, it's a great bag and I'd still recommend it if you don't need a very big one."
4.0,"Love the look but plus size beware, is you have bigger arms it will cut into you."
4.0,"Usually wear a medium in pants unless I want them oversized but I ordered a large so that it wouldn‚Äôt have to stretch a lot and be even thinner than I expected. It looks tiny for a large and is still a little see-through but nothing too bad, maybe just wear black underwear. Also maybe it would be less see-through if I didn‚Äôt have larger thighs and a butt. Still pretty good though."
4.0,Nice simple a-line dress. Good quality sequins. Was a little snug for me and I didn‚Äôt love the neckline. The sleeves were tight for my bigger arms. Ultimately returned because it wasn‚Äôt the flattering showstopper I was looking for.
4.0,THESE GLOVES ARE AWESOME. THEY KEEP MY HANDS WARM IN 15 DEGREE WEATHER. NOT SURE ABOUT 10 OR BELOW. I'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT GETS COLDER HER UP NORTH. ONLY THING ANNOYING ME IS THE BUTTON CLIP. IT COMES OFF ALL THE TIME ON ONE OF MY GLOVE.<br /><br />EDIT: 9 F in Minnesota right now. My hands gets super cold in 1 min.
4.0,These are larger than I thought but very pretty
4.0,I never wear lace and this dress looked cute so I  took a risk and I am happy with my purchase!
4.0,"I through they was waterproof, but some how my socks got wet."
4.0,If you want dark sunglasses... these will do!  Love them.
4.0,could have came with better instructions...didn't come with any good clear instructions
4.0,Vivid colors but got a hole in shirt after a couple washes.
4.0,"This shirt is very nice, especially for the price. It was a tiny bit smaller than I expected. Very good overall."
4.0,It offers great protection for galaxy watch. I would recommend this to anyone who works in a rough environment where you always bumping your hands or wrist or just needs it for sport activities.
4.0,"Great quality with tons of gadget storage. Only wish would be for longer ties available like 72"" or so. I like to tie in the front and these are just a hair short for me to do that. Other than that this item is perfect for my needs."
4.0,"Looks like the image, appears a but smaller but its dimensions are correct. When it first arrives it has a weird scent, as it has probably travelled overseas, but it works exactly as I expected it to."
4.0,They look ok. But polarization is fantastic. Wear them when I fish the beach and offshore.
4.0,I brought the coat for my 8 year old who had a class presentation. He was suppose to be a Chemist. The fit was a little big but I was ok because the Toys R  Us  lab coat that I previously brought was way too small and the sleeves were short. It was also really thin. This labcoat is sturdy. Buttons had strong stitching so one pull didn't mean we had buttons everywhere and deep pockets so he could put his note cards and hands and whatever else he needed in there without stuff spilling out .<br /><br />It even washes well. He spilled something on it and I washed it in cold water and it didn't shrink or fade. So definitely a good purchase.
4.0,"Fits well comfortable, does glow in the dark as promised. Sizes are true to size, I wear a 5 and it fits just right."
4.0,This is a good looking sarape.
4.0,"The fabric and quality is better then I expected.  I did order a large based on the prior reviews, but then returned for a medium.  I wanted to wear it to a birthday party, if not would have returned it for a small and regret not doing that.  It fits fine, but would have been better sizing down again."
4.0,I was disappointed in the band cause the picture showed a loop holder to keep the band in place but there was no holder
4.0,Style is flattering
4.0,First use this morning as liners for waterproof socks for mountain biking in 32 degree weather. Feet stayed warm.
4.0,Very cute! My 10 yr old loves it!
4.0,"When these socks arrived I was a bit disappointed with the quality. They were not as thick as I expected and seemed to be a cotton acrylic blends. But they wash well and keep their shape. Can't really complain! They will work just fine, especially for the greatly reduced price I received!"
4.0,Received pictured product however when it arrived packaging said ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs‚Äô even though male pictured.<br /><br />Husband (wears men‚Äôs med) will be able to wear shirt but pants are too small around waist. No time to return since there were purchased for child‚Äôs pirate birthday party this weekend.
4.0,"My girlfriend was SO SEXY in this dress!!<br />I don't think it would last if you used it regularly, but worked great for the wedding we went to.  Everyone thought she looked even better than the bride, poor kid!  lol"
4.0,"This dress is VERY pretty, and I love the pleat, as well as the stretch to the fabric. Bit odd it has a zipper since it stretches, but that's fine. The yellow color is just what I was looking for. However, the top was just a little too snug, and for some reason has a weird half shelf bra attached that causes a line directly across your chest. You can see the line in the product photos too, but on me it looked weird; I'll probably cut it off. I'm not super flat but also not particularly well endowed, and usually wear XS since I'm 4ft11in and 105lb, which is what I ordered. But since the top doesn't fit great, I ordered a Small instead and plan to keep whichever fits better."
4.0,Works great looks better in pictures then in person
4.0,"Good leather sandals, soft. Just had a week to break them in. Reef is good brand. Maybe for people with wider feet could be a problem. they are exactly and I do not have wide feet."
4.0,"This band is beautiful and perfect for my small wrist! I have a hard time finding bands that work, this is perfect. It's also super easy to install.. The only downside to this band is it's a little short and the band falls out of the loops often. Also bonded leather."
4.0,"Ordered a medium, I would need at least an extra large. It is very small with unforgiving fabric.<br /><br />However, it has an exceptional shape and look‚Äîwish they had it in the right size"
4.0,I live these for the price they are really big. And the back they come with is plastic bit it works and they are really cute I have 3 ear piercing and this one covers up 2 of them so u can't wear with other earrings. Over all really like them.
4.0,Nice cool and stylish
4.0,"Cute, runs a little big and very heavy."
4.0,"Husband uses this watch for work (phones are not allowed in work area) and he really likes it. It‚Äôs comfortable, durable, well made and it work great. Only complaint is the strap could be a little longer. It fits him but  just!"
4.0,"Very pretty, but came with a broken stone."
4.0,"A little on the small side, but cute.  Quality is good."
4.0,What I received was pretty much what I expected. The only downside to them is that the part that you put in your piercing first is a bit short. So I just opened it up a little bit by using pliers. Other than that they are really cute & arrived sooner than I expected.
4.0,This is a cute track suit. Made of a light knit material it is comfortable. The material is thin and the cut is forgiving. The ankles are elasticized. The pants are a little short but still wearable. Comfortable for working from home or running errands. Would not call it winter weight or especially warm. Cute.
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet, like it very much."
4.0,can't beat the price. quality is decent. bought it for a &#34;this is us&#34; fan because it resembles rebecca's necklace. she loved it!
4.0,"I love Olukai sandals, these fit great and are very comfortable and cute"
4.0,"Love these. They have pickets, but they are quite long. Wold be a great pair for a tall man."
4.0,I really love these and gave them a 4 star because they are so fragile. If they get slightly tweaked they will break at the ends. Keep the box it comes in to store them properly
4.0,Weird fitting on bottom. But overall cute.
4.0,great product. did not have instruction with though
4.0,"Love them, going to buy another one. Perfect under skirts"
4.0,Cheap bracelets for a cheap price. Bought to use for my Hippie outfit on Halloween. I would buy again.
4.0,nice fit<br />brighti colour<br />order one size. larger<br />very comfortable with great support
4.0,I ordered up and it‚Äôs still too small. Cute tee but I wish it flowed in the dark like the men‚Äôs versions. I‚Äôll wear it for works outs.
4.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful and very well made.  The dark green color is rich and the fabric is heavy with just the right amount of stretch for comfort.  This is definitely NOT a flimsy dress.  The pleats are beautiful and give the skirt a good  amount of swing.  A fluffy petticoat underneath would make it even more retro.  The buttons on the sleeves are very nice.  I am 5'4"", 130# and busty.  The size medium fits me perfectly.  Shows a little bit of cleavage but not too much.  Usually with this type of dress, I have to add a wide belt to hold and cinch the waist.  But this dress is so well constructed at the waist that a belt is not needed.  Unfortunately, the dress arrived with faded streaks on the bodice and sleeves,  but I love it so much I'm sending it back for a replacement.  Hopefully the replacement won't have the same problem.  I'm giving it four stars, only because of the faded streaks.  If the replacement doesn't have that problem, then I definitely give it 5 stars."
4.0,It could have been a little bigger but otherwise I love it.
4.0,For petite person.  A little long.
4.0,"I love it,the color look jus like the photo"
4.0,"Pretty cheaply made, had sharp rough edges. Not very impressed..!"
4.0,"This dress was surprising cute! Wore it for Valentine's Day. I am 5'7"" and 115 lbs. I wanted to wear it as a tunic over pants and it fit perfectly. Quality was good for price!"
4.0,"I followed the size chart given to me and i still feel like this dress is just a little too snug a around the chest for what i like, and i am not in any way busty. I do love the dress, it is very well made and when i get in my petticoat, i know I'll truly be in love.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price for my honest review."
4.0,Like everything so big grandson will eventually grow into
4.0,I love these. I get many compliments on them. They're great for the computer and watching NHL hockey games on tv. My only complaint is that they scratch very easily!
4.0,"These are nice camis but I agree they run a little small. I'm usually a medium but after reading the reviews, I got a large and it fits very well (I'm 5'5"" and 145 lbs.) I Like the adjustable straps and the lace covers my 'older' de'colletage! They're also nice and long to cover your 'bootie' if you want. Fabric is very soft and on the thinner side so perfect for layering."
4.0,Keeps my feet warm! Love em
4.0,"Only negative is paying $ 60 to have wrist band adjusted to my size and date on watch very tiny.,otherwise a very nice looking watch that runs on light."
4.0,"For the price, you can't beat this dress!"
4.0,These socks are really cute and well made. I'm on the larger side and they fit without being too tight and come up right past my knee. The cat detail is adorable and I would buy these again in another color.
4.0,Good fit and comfortable. Good buy!
4.0,"Bought this for me... I'm 5'3&#34;, currently 38, 28, 40. 135lbs. I went ahead and ordered a petticoat to wear with it and they both arrived as expected. So, as other reviews stated, yes the torso is shorter than the pictures, and yes this does appear a bit childish. So I gave it to my 11yr. She hated it on the hanger, but loved it once she had it on. She's 4'5&#34;, 126lbs. Perfect fit! If you're buying this for preteen/teen, go for it. BUT, if you're over the age of 25 and you want look like it, leave it behind."
4.0,"The color and pattern are really cute. This suit has a vintage vibe because of the cut/style. The padded top is nice for giving an extra push for the girls. However, the shape of the padding feels off. It's a bit square-shaped, but maybe it will mold to the right shape after some wear.<br /><br />The bottoms had extra fabric on the front, so I'm not sure how flattering that would be once this gets wet. The bottoms were also ever-so-slightly-too-small, as you can see them cutting into my butt.<br /><br />Normally I'm a small (32C bra) for tops and medium (size 28) for bottoms. I'm 120 lb, 5'5"", athletic/slim build, with a longer torso. I ordered a small."
4.0,I love these. This is my second pair. Someone at work stole my first pair.
4.0,"It's orange and it's a hat, what else could you expect. Great costumer service. It's also really bright and great for hunting."
4.0,"This was made from a thin fabric. The wings are so pretty! I just didn‚Äôt care for the mask that kept falling off as you have to tie it on your head. It ended up breaking apart easily. So flimsy. But if you wanted pretty wings, I would purchase this and buy a nice mask."
4.0,This color is a little see-thru
4.0,It is a good one. You should have a good size match
4.0,Love these. Very comfortable.  It's like having nothing on but better.
4.0,Works great and it really helps! Love the ear plugs it came with and the nose clips too!! Too bad ain't completely anti fog. Overall it's great and great price
4.0,"Nice watch. Its simple yet beautiful. Looks good when going out for a date. Cheap yet expensive looking. Also, I love how they took a photo as proof of delivery. Keep it up guys."
4.0,I expected cotton and I received nylon. It was going to cost me to return them. The company did work with me. Be careful to be specific about nylon or cotton.
4.0,Buckles have  open areas where belt strap shows through  they work fine and haven't cracked yet like the slide belt straps did. I like slide belt buckles more but these straps seem better and these belts cost 1/3 of slide belts
4.0,"Comfortable shirt, but for an XLT, the chest and waist are very baggy and the sleeves aren't long enough. It's more like a standard 2X than an XLT. I'll probably cut the sleeves off and wear at a nascar race or float trip."
4.0,"Dress fit great, belt too small though!!"
4.0,"Fit snuggly as expected, dry quickly, warmer than expected"
4.0,"I thought that one pair were black, the listing didn't say. I should have asked.."
4.0,Very cute fits well. I am 5' so come do just above my knees. Nice to wear with yoga pants
4.0,Love the overall fit and fabric. A tad too short for me to wear as a dress (I'm 5'7&#34;) but a tad too long with leggings. Will probably hem it for better balance with my leggings.
4.0,"See through for sure, very stretchy and comfy. Wear a long top to cover your bottom"
4.0,"Colorful. Of course they are not thick- they r thin bcuz they are stretchy and a thick material wouldn‚Äôt be as breathable. These are perfect if you have kids. They can pick a color for every outfit and they‚Äôre not expensive for an 8 pack. I bought these for my son (teen) and he opened them up on Christmas, his cousin liked them (Also a teen) and I just ordered another pack for cousin."
4.0,Just what my son wanted. Hard to see at night when lights are on. Will also have to work on the mess over the eyes to be able to see better even when lights are off. Other than that it's a really great mask!
4.0,"As far as anti fog spray goes, this one does a decent enough job. Fog sprays aren't the end all, and you'll have to apply it to whatever you're using it for on a semi constant basis to keep up the anti fog properties, but this one holds up for a while. I it put on my shades to help with the whole mask issue and not being able to wear sunglasses. 8/10"
4.0,Very nice! Used it for my Rosita cosplay and when I made the ponytails you did not see the lace or seams underneath. This is my second purchase from Simplicity and I would buy again.
4.0,"I ordered this band to replace a white one for my Garmin vivo 3 that had started to yellow after sweating on it for a year.  This band is fine, but just a little thin for my taste."
4.0,"The flexible nose piece is not really adequate for the mask. Otherwise, I love it."
4.0,Love the dry fit.
4.0,Thick buckles on the side of the stays. Can't really wear them with &#34;skinny&#34; pants for the buckle outline will show though the pants.
4.0,"Good quality for the price,nicely made and no problems with them."
4.0,"Good looking nightgown, but who am I? ...Just a guy."
4.0,"THEY FIT PERFECT, I REALLY LIKE THEM!!"
4.0,"Room for Toes ! Like the Wide Toe Box.<br />Entire interior of the uppers is lined with foam, probably to help them keep their shape but, it makes them warmer than they need to be."
4.0,The large fit perfectly for my size. The top is very adjustable.
4.0,These are comfy and fits well under clingy clothing.
4.0,"I have no complaints. It has served us well. Don't let your kids near it though, it rips easily! Kids are pretty rough so I still recommend it."
4.0,"Some what small, very soft"
4.0,These socks where tested on the Appalachian trail. They did not disappoint. They stayed in place. So comfortable. And washed well after the hike.
4.0,"While I love this jacket for 5 year old, the first one they sent was not in new condition- no tags & seemed to have animal hair all over it. Amazon made it right, sending a replacement. The replacement was definitely new. Coat is nice & warm plus it‚Äôs waterproof. Would definitely by another when she grows out of this one."
4.0,"Overall I like them, they are a tad bit warmer than I would have liked for the purpose I purchased them.  But they serve other purposes just fine.  Note of slight disappointment:  The zippered pockets are faux pockets, not real, just-for-looks.  I really like pockets and not just the apparent appearance of pockets.  I might have bumped them to five stars just for pockets, despite their unexpected warming ability."
4.0,"This is a great-looking product.  It is an unlined shell of water-repellent fabric that is breathable and lightweight.  If you were planning to use it for skiing, you would definitely need to include this with something insulative as part of a layered system.  My wif is rather short (5'1"") and a little round, so we got the XL hoping that it would be big enough to allow for layering.  But the arms were too long and the midsection part was too snug around the breasts.  She liked the side zip vents to allow for sitting comfortably, but the arms were 6"" beyond the end of her fingertips and were a deal-breaker.<br /><br />Thankfully, the Amazon return process was completely painless and super efficient."
4.0,more of a yellow green color but very cute.
4.0,Super cute. Perfect for work under a sweater
4.0,"The color was very close to photo.  I matched it to my ‚Äúbright & warm‚Äù color fan and it matches.<br /><br />Nice classic style and light weight enough to wear any time.  The buttons are the same color as the sweater and I may consider replacing them at some point with a contrast color, but they are well sewn.<br /><br />I will definitely buy more."
4.0,"It's very pretty,but the closure doesn't fit up against the body of the purse the way I would like! I have it to my daughter and she loved it!"
4.0,"Nice gloves, a bit large, but nice. Used for hunting, so the flip-fingers are convenient; velcro is good and strong"
4.0,"I love the color (I got the burgundy), and it is true to size in my opinion. It is more clingy than I usually like, but not so much that I won't wear it. Also, I had no problem with it being too see-through, which can be sometimes be an issue with tops at this price point."
4.0,"Great water shoe, made well, fits true too size ."
4.0,"The pants feel good. I have big hips small waist and they fit me. I ordered the size I usually wear, no problems except that it feels a little tight on my thighs."
4.0,I love these belts! They are very stretchy and clasp easily.  They can make dresses and skirt and top combos instantly look better. Only giving four stars because I had to rebuy them when my white one got color on it from my clothes. I wore it with a black shirt and the color transferred onto it and would not go away. They are cheap enough though that I just bought another set and I think I‚Äôll give the extra black one to my friend.
4.0,Got these in today and they are very high quality. Very smooth with nice weight and a perfect fit. The tiger's eye and Jade are slightly darker than pictured but I like it. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star rating is because the ends are much more domed than pictured. It gives it much more of a gemstone look than what I was looking for.  I understand the color variation with natural stones but not the shape.
4.0,"Not as heavy as my old packing cubes.  These don't stand on their own and the material is pretty thin.  The zippers arrived unthreaded, but seem to have rethreaded easily.  On the plus side, the bright colors will be easy to find in my bag and they won't add any weight to my luggage.  On seeing the product in person the cubes seem overpriced.  I would sometimes use my old packing cubes as a bag in itself, but I don't have confidence this set would hold up outside of a suitcase."
4.0,"I ordered these for my class for Unity Day.  They were decent quality for the price and fit me and my 5th graders equally well.  The only real problem I had was with delivery. Two thirds of my order arrived on time.  The other third will be arriving after Unity day despite ordering in plenty of time and originally getting a delivery day of 3 days before I needed them.  So now, some of my kids don't have one.  Thankfully, I also ordered headbands and have plenty."
4.0,"The shoes are good quality but run big. My daughter wears a 7, and I bought a 7 in these but there was about 2 finger width extra of length in the toe. The Velcro straps on top are nice and long so there's plenty of room for chubby feet adjustments."
4.0,"Not the best quality, but good for price"
4.0,For the most part I have no complaints about this watch band the only small thing that bothers me is it bunches where the band connects to the actual watch because it's a little wide it has to be scrunched in that area.
4.0,"It is definitely cheaply made (obviously), but if worn correctly it can be cute and make a statement."
4.0,"The dress is super cute, I just wish it wasn't swimsuit-like material. My baby loves it, so it's ok."
4.0,Nice fit and good quality material (thick and lined).
4.0,"Pockets are a fun detail on this piece. Makes this dress functional for longer wear. This piece is lightweight and easy to wear, perfect for a hotter summer day. Could be worn for day, or, even a nightshirt if you prefer. Great fit."
4.0,Super cute. Fit well and the elastic does not stretch out every time you take a step. Surprisingly good quality.
4.0,Complimented my 20's dress perfectly!
4.0,It‚Äôs a little long but it fit nice!
4.0,"The fit was as expected, however the dress was a little more see-through than I would like."
4.0,"Bought this for my little sister(she's 21) because she absolutely loves jewelry, but doesn't have the money to get her own. She absolutely loved it, and was convinced it was worth much more than I paid for it. Looks really nice, and appears to be good quality(the chains so-so quality). would def recommend"
4.0,Good but I got sent an XL and I‚Äôm tiny so I‚Äôm not sure how well it‚Äôs gonna work for me
4.0,Good cotton dresses for summer playtime. Fit was good. Soft and comfortable.
4.0,So soft. A little thin like those well worn t-shirts but this does make it very comfy.
4.0,"I‚Äôve only used these for 1 trip but so far I‚Äôm impressed they are excellent quality and made it through 2 flights, 2 ferry rides, and customs! I did not however use the locking mechanism even though I would have liked to because I did not see a place for the airline to use a key and didn‚Äôt want to risk my luggage being torn open. Other than the lack of a universal airline key hole though I have zero complaints!"
4.0,"Cute print but I didn't expect the material to be so thin. This is not a sweat top. But, my daughter loves it."
4.0,"This is definitely a comfortable bra, although a bit too big for me. I got the XS which I am normally in tops and sports bras, but this fit like a S to me. It offers medium support and I love the color. The only thing a little odd and kind of frustrating is the padding inside keeps migrating upwards. You can indeed take out the pads thankfully, but it's just weird they keep floating up higher in the bra! All in all a nice one, but not great if you need running-support or if you're a true XS."
4.0,Love the way it looks. Launders well. The only problem i have with it is that its itchy about my neck.
4.0,Great quality  but I ordered a M and got  a L. Too big for the  person I got it for.
4.0,"I'm usually a small but I decided to go up one size after reading the reviews. The top fits perfectly but the bottoms are very tight and are very cheeky. Over all a good bathing suit for the price, but would definitely go up 1-2 sizes. I'm 5'3 and a 34 B and the medium (too) fit perfectly."
4.0,I love it. I get many complements on it. The chain hasn't broken. Looks just like an apple. It was cheaper when I purchased it.
4.0,Saw the bell sleeves and I had to get this! I‚Äôm obsessed with bell sleeves. I got the XXL - it‚Äôs a little on the small side for the XXL. But it still fits me (I‚Äôm plus size and still like room in my clothing). I‚Äôll be wearing this probably for Christmas so between now and then - I have some time to lose weight for this fit more comfortably. It‚Äôs super cute and the material isn‚Äôt thin. Has a nice thickness to it and weight. The perfect length for me too (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5). I think I‚Äôm going to pair this with some black hose and it‚Äôll look super cute! I feel like this can be dressed up or down. Perfect dress for later in fall and winter. Love the color too - I got the burgundy (wine red) color.
4.0,"It looks great and glitter, but it`s too hurt at back-cloth."
4.0,"The flap for the chin and nose is a bit too small for my teenage son, would fit a smaller person better I am sure but if you have a large head and are excited for the mask it may not cover your chin. Warm and well made otherwise."
4.0,"Nicely made piece of Indian inspired jewelry. The workmanship is nicely done but the sad part is the simulated emerald stone is done in a resin, which really does not deter the look but makes the quality different"
4.0,"I am very happy with these sapphire studs.  They look great with diamond jackets.  Very good for the price.  Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because they are cz instead of the real thing, but as I said they look great!"
4.0,"Really attractive and practical &#34;sweater&#34; - Wish I had gotten the plain front version, but this one will do just fine!"
4.0,"This is an awesome looking hoodie that really stands out in a crowd. I really like the graphics and the use of color in the dragon graphic. About the only downside is that the fabric is not all that thick for hoodie material, so it's not going to keep you very warm in the winter. Fortunately, I live in California where the winters are not very cold. If I lived further east I would probably not be so happy with it. The draw string is a bit longer than I am used to. It's not long enough to be annoying or get in the way though. The construction is pretty solid. It's been through the laundry once without coming apart. I'll return to update my review if it shows any signs of coming apart in the near future though. Altogether, I am pretty satisfied."
4.0,Purchased as a gift. Was well received.
4.0,This T-shirt was as shown and described. Great shirt for lounging.
4.0,"I bought this in the pink color to wear with a jumpsuit that had a slash in the back‚Äî I wanted to wear something that wouldn‚Äôt be too showy if it peeked out the back. At first when I put it on, I felt like the cups didn‚Äôt fit very well, but after ‚Äúsettling in‚Äù to it, I liked the look and feel a lot! Very pretty."
4.0,"I ordered the necklace for my daughter for a gift. I received both the necklace and bracelet which was nice. But the bracelet not only did not have the same logos as pictured, the cheap strap broke before my daughter could even put it on. Since we only wanted the necklace in the first place (which she likes), I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. I guess it is a warning that the necklace is decently well made but the bracelet is not. I recommend buy the necklace but not the bracelet or the two piece set."
4.0,"I like the shirt, seems to be good quality, not too thin. Not super soft, like the oversized fit"
4.0,Very lightweight material but not thin or see-through. I usually wear a large to x-large but ordered an xx-large and it's a little loose but not too big.  It is super low cut (probably because I ordered a size larger) so I wear a tank top under it.  Tail of shirt comes to top of leg so very long in the back (which is why I purchased it).
4.0,Nice strapless bra. It‚Äôs a little under sized and once you wear it all day it‚Äôs starts to dig into your skin. Overall it‚Äôs comfortable!
4.0,Bottom edge of skirt rolls up
4.0,"Great fit and look. Not great quality cotton,  but not awful, very medium quality softness."
4.0,This purse is adorable and the perfect size. Lightweight and fashionable. I love the country western look. I bought this to go with my cowboy boots and am very pleased with my purchase!
4.0,Cute dainty design. The diamond accents are hard to see when your wearing it you just get the appearance of something hanging.
4.0,These sunglasses work like a charm.  They are very stylish and block out the sun.  The lens interchange easily.  I would recommend these sunglasses to anyone.
4.0,I love the color and the fabric.  I fits a little smaller than the size. I would order next size ip.
4.0,Love the cut of this shrug!! Fits perfectly. The yellow color is a little deceiving. It came out Crayloa marker bright yellow - not as subdued as I needed.
4.0,"I love this dress.  It way better constructed that would be expected, especially for the affordable price.  It is also not too fitted at the top.  Only downside is I found it to be a bit on the heavy side (probably because of the crinoline)... but all in all a great buy!"
4.0,One size and I‚Äôm a bit on the larger size so a bit snug especially on my legs but wearable.  Comfortable and not see through.  Advertised as having pockets though they don‚Äôt but not a big deal for me.
4.0,Ok here we go. So I bought these because after losing weight and not working out I loss the nice booty I had. I loved the results from weight loss but didn‚Äôt look the same from behind. So I decided to get a little help to look nice when I dressed up. This look sooo nice in a dress as well as pants. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because I wasn‚Äôt happy with the line in the panties that sit between your but crack. But to be honest to make it look totally natural it had to be made that way. It‚Äôs not totally uncomfortable but if we‚Äôre design different would have been a 5 star product. I will definitely order another one.
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable. The bottoms are not to short. The other reviews about the jumpers size running big, is correct. If u wear a xl, order lg. Definitely order a size smaller to get the best fit."
4.0,Be just like Mr. Two Bits! High class Gator gear ... :)
4.0,very pretty bracelet but to small for my arm. i wish i could have kept this bracelet. very nice!!!!!
4.0,I like the loose style but it was a tad small in chest. I hope it doesn't  shrink when i wash it.
4.0,"Dress is as described! It seems like good sturdy material. Comfy and cute. I am short (5&#34;0) so it was a little longer on me, but i still like it. Good buy for the price! I ordered a medium."
4.0,I was wondering which color it might come cause I did choose one... there was no option but it came with all colors in the pic a few different ones .. very good for the money ..
4.0,"Great bag, has plenty of zipper compartments. It holds a lot of gear and is made to last. You would be hard pressed to find a better bag for the price."
4.0,Very eloquent
4.0,Fits nice and I love the way they look.
4.0,"the resin in the product spilled and beaded on the outside, but other than that it‚Äôs great."
4.0,they are barely visible and they last a long time. very reuse-able and safe to use during a hospital setting.
4.0,Decent shirts and price - run just a little small.
4.0,Cute dress!! Great for summer
4.0,"This style did fit my face and had the backing, ended up letting my sister have them though."
4.0,"The dress fit well, the material was a little lighter than expected and the belt was kind of cheap but over all a nice dress and full skirt, I got a lot of complements. Glad I bought it"
4.0,The material is so thick that it is hard to make a pretty bow if you do untie the bow that they give you.
4.0,"The liner worked well with these and other shorts. Unlike other padded bike underwear I have tried these had longer legs with enough grip not to ride up as I rode.  Shorts were fine, although I would have liked another pocket or two. Overall a good product for a good price."
4.0,"The item was actually much smaller than I anticipated. I thought it would be used as a wallet, when in actuality, as the description indicates, this is a business card holder. Therefore, the size is appropriate for its intended use and any issue I may have with the size is a problem with my own ability to pay attention to the details provided.  The item is very well made, attractive, and arrived promptly and in great condition."
4.0,"Dress is cute for the price and is made with better quality than something from Forever 21. However, I did receive one of the knock offs- with no cap sleeves, different buttons, and a different label. Not that disappointed due to the price, fit, and quality. Beware if you must have/want Acevog. Mine is the hunter green colour and the make is from &#34;iHot&#34; according to the label sewn on the dress."
4.0,These really do keep my calves and ankles warm and I wear them around the house. They are tighter and not as slouchy as other leg warmers and may be too tight on larger legs. They wash well ( I don‚Äôt put them in the dryer).
4.0,"Cool belt, especially for those who like to dress differently from the crowd. Feels very nice to the touch, soft, yet very sturdy. My only complaint is that the very first time you set it up its extremely difficult to get the buckle open, even for me, being a 220 lb man. Very easy and simple after that."
4.0,Perfect for a marry poppins and very costume!
4.0,Easy care and good fit
4.0,Cute but I would size up if you need extra room in the chest
4.0,Doesn't exactly look like the picture but it still works perfectly fine. I almost like the design of the one I was sent better than the pictured one.
4.0,Just what I needed for a weekend bag. Light weight and durable.
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, these are VERY long. I had to cut them so they would hit my ankle. But otherwise they are nice.  Somewhat of a sheer material when you bend over or if they are stretched too much. But nice otherwise!"
4.0,Bought them for my girls to keep dust out of their faces. Only problem was I was shorted one
4.0,Cute little key chain!  Love the color and style!
4.0,I know it's very inexpensive but the gold is super fake looking. More so than what I was expecting. I do love the design of it though.
4.0,"It's handy to have a face covering that I can wear pulled down, then quickly and easily pull it up when needed. I would have given five stars if they stayed in place better, without needing adjustment."
4.0,Light weight. Look great. I just wish I could have gotten them without reflective lenses.
4.0,"It's not a legit engraving, more like paint, but it's nice for the price and it came in a week early."
4.0,nice comfortable sandals will order again.
4.0,I took off one star because of its bigger size. Could have been little smaller.
4.0,This is great for the price. I added 4 stars because the bottoms are much cheekier than I expected from the picture.
4.0,"After reading the reviews I thought I would need to size up, but I wish I would've bought a small. I'm 5'6 110 pounds. A small would've been perfect."
4.0,"I really like this shirt, it is a basic and comfortable top to wear during hot days. I bought large size, it is larger than I expected it would be from the description in size chart but it is still a cute top.  I would order the size you wear in tops normally and not go by the size chart. It is a high low designed top , and it is pretty long on the back, so it would cover back side nicely.  I think it is a nice shirt to wear with shorts,pants or even a casual skirt. It is a nice casual top to wear during weekends to enjoy relaxing time with family. The zippers on shoulder area ad a touch of something fun to this top.  The top is a nice weight and drapes nicely.<br />Shipping was fast and there were no issues with the seller.  I would recommend this item to a friend or family member.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I was not compensated further for a positive review.  If you find my review helpful please mark &#34;yes&#34; - feel free to ask any questions. Thanks"
4.0,"Decent, cheap, umbrella."
4.0,"Good value for the price , as with many of these glasses in this price range the lenses scratch easy."
4.0,If you‚Äôre tall these are great. If you‚Äôre short like me you‚Äôll need to hem them. These are like 4 inches too long for me. But super comfy and they look great. The fabric is polyester and the zipper sticks a bit on one side but finding pants like these seems to be tricky so I‚Äôm keeping them.
4.0,"It‚Äôs smaller than I expected, but I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the details so I can‚Äôt complain. It‚Äôs very cute though"
4.0,It's a nice jacket but the arms were too long. We ordered it for a December wedding but its not going to fit her so we had to order a different jacket for the wedding. We kept this one for her to grow into though because it was so nice.
4.0,the product is great very fast delivery
4.0,Soft and flowing dress. Nice color. Very comfortable.
4.0,"These are pretty, fit great, and feel great! I took away one star because as these are worn, the material tends to lose its elasticity. After a couple of hours of wear, there is virtually no support left, leaving the tiny thin straps to hold all of the weight. At that point, the straps dig into the shoulders. OUCH!!"
4.0,It's a bit thin but light weight. My daughter actually loves it. The material is also nice.
4.0,Loved the shade of green.  Pockets are always fun!
4.0,"I love these, I‚Äôve been wearing them with everything!<br />The only problem is, the tunnel itself is not long enough to go through my ear and for me to be able to screw the back on. Not sure if I just have thick earlobes or something, but I‚Äôve just been sticking them in and being careful that they don‚Äôt fall out. All is good so far, I teach 1st grade and they survive the day!"
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and weigh about 125. I ordered the small in pale pink and it fit fine. It does state that it is a ‚Äúloose fit‚Äù which was what I wanted. However, on my 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 110 lb daughter who often wears a small, it was too big.<br />The pale pink is really nice. I wore it for my daughters high school graduation and got so many compliments! The fabric is not high quality, but for the price, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be. I live in a small town and ran out of time to go shopping for a dress. So on a whim, I thought I‚Äôd try something from Amazon. Glad I did."
4.0,I got this shirt and was surprised how cute it was! It fit good. I got it when I was three months pregnant and I am currently seven and it still fits good with some stretch. The only downfall is when I washed the first time there was some cracks in the design.
4.0,Cute! But Poor stitching quality. Doesn‚Äôt hold my boobs :(
4.0,It's nice looking and flexible.
4.0,A fun shirt for summer.
4.0,"This is going to be a gift for grandson. I think the fabric is rather thin, but I doubt he‚Äôll mind."
4.0,"The belt is nice and stretchy, so it should fit a broad group of people. It's a little too big for me, but I can still wear it. I gave it four stars because sometimes when I lean forward the clasp will come undone. I wear a size 2 for reference."
4.0,The bracelet is beautiful ; it has only one problem : the clasp is not well made and in my opinion it is unsafe because it simply leans  on the other part  and it does not assure  that it will not open.<br />I took the bracelet to a jeweler  who is in the process of changing it.
4.0,Really cute..I usually wear a small..but took the advice in the reviews and ordered medium..fits really nice..I'm 5ft 122lbs..
4.0,"This is nice for summer at the office. I have had it a few months, and it is starting to pill a bit. Not unexpected at the price."
4.0,This product works great. My daughter wore it many times under cute strapless tops and dresses all summer
4.0,The material is somewhat heaver than I expected I will wear them in the winter I was hoping for a lighter weight material. The product is nice and fits well but will hold off wearing them till its colder.
4.0,nice dress dress
4.0,Cute but did not fit.
4.0,"After one day, a charm fell off. It‚Äôs what you pay for since it‚Äôs on the cheaper side."
4.0,Needed more compression.
4.0,I love this bathing suit and got a lot of compliments on it. I wear a size 9 jeans so usually I buy clothes in medium or large but after reading the reviews I order a size bigger and I'm glad I did because the xl fit perfect.  I only gave 4 stars cause day 2 of going to wear it the back piece to hook the shoulder strap broke so I had to sew it when I got home
4.0,Good beanie.
4.0,"Sharp colors, good fit.  I have an athletic build."
4.0,"For the price, it's hard to complain about anything with these glasses."
4.0,"For the cost big the gloves,very satisfied."
4.0,"I already own a pair of these and I love them- but the new ones I received are different. The small size is longer (too high for me) and the fabric is not as high quality/soft. I‚Äôm sorry to say I‚Äôm dissappointed . They are nice socks, but I‚Äôll probably have to donate these and and find another brand. I don‚Äôt think I can return because I wore them once to see if they would be ok.<br />I washed them and they seem softer. I‚Äôll keep them"
4.0,Fits like expected.  I liked the fabric pretty well.
4.0,I didn''t expect it to be so big..........I like a dainty watch......
4.0,So far I‚Äôve had the boots for about a year. They are very comfortable and light weight. No they are not waterproof as they are breathable steel/composite toe boots. Haven‚Äôt had any issue with material separating as I‚Äôve experienced with higher brands around 200 bucks. Only flaw I‚Äôve came across is the loops for the shoe strings. I‚Äôve broken one loop but I tie my shoes up super tight without giving the thought to the fact that it could possibly rip. If they reinforced the holes for the shoe strings this boot would be a great bang for the buck. And to add I work in a refrigerated/freezer environment often
4.0,"I LOVE this necklace!! It comes in a beautiful storage pouch with instructions on how to make your purchase last for a long time. I do not care for the name of the company, Evil Beauty, I would change it to EverBeauty or something similar. I deducted a star because I was scratched by a piece of the plastic string/wire that's used to hold the necklace together. I fixed it by cutting the piece low enough to hide within the beads. The droop of this wood bead necklace is perfect and it is not heavy. The clasp feels like a quality metal and is easy to use...not too small :-)<br />I wear this necklace with anything and I always receive compliments throughout the day! My friend is from Ethiopia and she is begging me to buy one for her (she doesn't shop online) because she loves it so much! Great jewelry, great materials!"
4.0,This is definitely made well enough to keep your head warm! Battery seems to have decent life. Sound quality it good.  My biggest complaint is that sometimes the bluetooth doesn't work right. The headphones get choppy and cut out music like you are out of range but my phone will be right in my pocket.
4.0,Looks just like pic.
4.0,"Beautiful dress!! I've been wanting a dress that has the vintage look for some while.  After looking at several dresses I decided for this one. Couldn't go wrong with the style. Only problem is that I am on the shorter side and the dress is a bit too long, but it is manageable. I am planning altering the length.  Other than that the dress is perfect!!"
4.0,MY SON REALLY LIKE IT
4.0,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS JACKET, IT'S UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL!<br /><br />But... It's semi-fitted, and when zipped up, It's snug on my waist down, which I don't like. I was really hoping it'd be more loose. Also, the drawstrings aren't as long as it's shown in the photo.<br /><br />However, I'm confident that I'll still be able to rock the hell out of this jacket :)!"
4.0,I should have ordered Medium
4.0,very small but cute. My granddaughter liked it
4.0,These are cute - they are much bigger than I expected
4.0,Thank you again for shipping to Korea.<br />Overall I like it very much. lol
4.0,"The Jersey is great, the embroidery is great and it even has s fight strap (which I will never need for the beer league I play in). The only complaint is that this a fashion Jersey not designed to be worn with pads. I don't wear shoulder pads when I play, but if I did the Jersey would be too tight. I do wear elbow pads and there is not enough room in the sleeve, too snug. If ordering to wear as a fashion Jersey then order your normal size, if ordering to play hockey with pads order 1 size larger than you normally would."
4.0,"Wife is 36DD, 36‚Äù waist, 38‚Äù hips, 5foot 6 inch tall. Usually wears size 4-8 or Medium in clothes. Ordered size 6, based on other reviews didnt want super form fit tightness, looks great still curves, but not so tight you can see ‚Äúeverything‚Äù going on underneath. Will buy more from this vendor."
4.0,"Quite okay.  As you might guess, the tailoring (sleeve seams, etc.) isn't terribly well done, but for the price, quite okay!"
4.0,Comfortable fit true to size
4.0,"These are definitely longer than I had expected them to be (I am petite though). Otherwise, the material is substantial for a burnout tank."
4.0,"These are some well put-together suspenders.  There are no frayed ends or loose stitches, and the leather work is well crafted.  I'd echo the concern of another reviewer about the clips; they can slip off if given too much tension.  I got them because they have button straps, though, and those hold on tight.  They included a pack of 6 sew-on buttons if you need to make alterations.<br /><br />I got a laugh when I purchased them, and Amazon suggested that I buy an entire Doctor Who costume to go with them.  Fez and bow tie too? Sure!"
4.0,"Awesome and so shiny, however many of the CZ's have fallen out within a couple months. :( I wish it would have lasted at least a while longer."
4.0,"While these are very comfy, while wearing I noticed the right leg is much longer than the left! Ummmm. See attached picture. Disappointed<br /><br />UPDATE: Returned and ordered a replacement and they are good! Fits nicely. Super comfy. Thank you!"
4.0,It fits a little snug in the hips and butt area but i am on the curvy side
4.0,"These fit a little large prior to first wash, but then fit great. I just washed wish cold and dried, and all pairs now fit well. I was super hopeful that the grips on these would keep them on better, but I still have to readjust them a few times throughout the day. Overall, I would rate these as a good value as most no show socks have these same issues."
4.0,"This dress fit really nice, with the length just at the ankle. It's great for flats or sandals, but might be too short with heels. light and airy which is perfect for the summer!"
4.0,Delivered as stated and product is as expected so far.  I have not worn or washed the item yet in fairness to this review~
4.0,"Nice shirt, not too thin, great fit!"
4.0,Super cute jacket HOWEVER do not buy if you want any sort of rain protection. Might work to cut a little wind but zero rain protection beyond a slight sprinkle that the kiddo is only out in for a couple minutes. Literally. But it‚Äôs $10 bucks so still worth a try for a super lightweight outer layer.
4.0,great gift for the cat lover
4.0,So I got this on sale for $10 which it was definitely worth $10. My son who is going to be 5 and is also autistic and super obsessed with Luigi lovessss this costume! It definitely was a lifesaver.. next day delivery I mean come on now.. I bought the medium and it‚Äôs a little long on him but nothing a needle and thread can‚Äôt fix. The hat is perfectz the mustache however sucks! So go buy a pack from the dollar tree. The number one flaw though is the ‚Äústraps‚Äù & ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù was literally glued on... so I just got a needle and thread and sewed it because my son was about to pop it right off. I provided before and after pics.
4.0,"Bought this dress for work. Fits wonderfully. I'm 5'6 around 135lbs with bust size between 36B&C bought the large an it fits like a glove. Not fitted and not large on me, just right...<br />Good quality material..."
4.0,I like the sweater. I bought 3 sizes too big so it would look oversized. 4x and I usually buy 1x.
4.0,Looks nice. Good quality
4.0,"These are really cute! and make crocs look 100x better, but they are really loose and move around a lot when you walk‚Ä¶ but they don‚Äôt come out."
4.0,"Attractive and comfortable, but not very darkly tinted. I received the blue lenses and the tinting is actually brown. I like them, but not dark enough tint for AZ driving"
4.0,slides down on my nose.
4.0,"Have not yet used the wider extenders, but I expect they will fit as comfortably as the two-hook style."
4.0,reordered one size bigger as the first order was way to tight
4.0,This item is nice quality but runs very small. The 18 was too short for me. In the crotch area.<br /><br />I am 5&#34;4 size 14.
4.0,"Very well made. Excellent heavy weight fabric.  My only complaint is the zipper tabs on top at the neckline can be a little irritating. I have sensitive skin, so I sometimes add a small scarf."
4.0,"Good, thin zip up hoodie for use when it is not cold."
4.0,I like the way it fits and feels
4.0,"It‚Äôs not as bright as I imagined, but it‚Äôs still awesome."
4.0,"The color I needed.  Not real heavy, the knitting is a little loose but I use it regularly."
4.0,"Loved that they were endless hoops; however, didn't realize they were so small. Ended up giving them to my three year old cousin."
4.0,So far so good‚Äîthese are becoming my go-to earrings. Love that they are so unique. The only thing is the teardrop-diamond pair doesn‚Äôt seem to look right on my ear. Maybe my earlobe is too small? Other than that they‚Äôre great.
4.0,So pretty . Bust  is very small
4.0,Very pretty but doesn‚Äôt have a locking clasp
4.0,"Fit true to size and very cute, but pilled after the first wash :("
4.0,A little more flexible than I was expecting they are almost to flexible. Behind the ears isn't curved enough to stay on the face but for the price they will do.
4.0,I ordered a medium and is true to size. Compression is nice!
4.0,No laces to tye!!!
4.0,Definitely size up I ordered xl and i would have been happier with a bigger size. Overall very nice dress I got a lot of compliments and was comfortable.
4.0,"Wrong color description.<br />Fits as expected, good product"
4.0,"These were perfect for what I needed. I needed a pair of snow boots for a trip in January. Since I would only spend a few days in the snow, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on boots that wouldn't really be worn a lot. Fit was a bit big but I could wear them OK for my trip. They do a good job of keeping your feet warm and dry even trudging through the snow. All-in-all a very good value for the money."
4.0,It has a slight rose gold hue.
4.0,"I really liked the way these pants felt on, but they were too short for me."
4.0,Bought this dress along with the one my daughter is wearing from Amazon. It was super cute and flattering :) I got alot of compliaments. Bought this dress as a photo session w/our family and it suits me well. As well the dress for my baby. Thank you
4.0,The top is really nice but I think it runs a bit large and long. Just a heads up for your consideration.
4.0,"Super cute. I will definitely wear it. It feels a little cheap, but doesn't necessarily look cheap.  Definitely order a size up if you're between sizes...the material has no give and the shirt is, over all, slightly short (not too short, but if you are between sizes and size down, it probably would be too short."
4.0,I have big hair so the somewhat large hat should do well.
4.0,It makes a great conversation piece. The cord is separate from from the Thor's hammer. You have to tie it on yourself.
4.0,"These are high quality goggles.  Fit and finish is excellent.  I notice no distortion through the lense.  The only reason I marked them down one star is that they do not fit over my glasses comfortably...either my glasses are a bit to large for goggles or goggles are a bit to small for glasses.  Bottom line, this is a quality product and would recommend it to anyone not wearing glasses or having very small glasses."
4.0,My husband usually wears a 2x. I ordered it in that size but did shrink in the washer a bit. Otherwise great product!
4.0,"These are a Christmas gift so I‚Äôm not sure on the size yet, but the quality is great! Soft and thick slippers, very cute"
4.0,I have been totally pleased with all items purchased
4.0,"I really, really want to love this heart necklace, but it is just OK. Online pictures did not match the product I received. In my opinion, the necklace shown is super silky and smooth. They one I received is uneven, looks handmade. I don't think it is a problem; just different than I expected, and many love the look of handmade items.<br /><br />I have a thick neck, and it barely fits.<br /><br />All in all, for an inexpensive item it is good!"
4.0,"very nice for the money, bought for a gift"
4.0,"It's just beautiful and I love that the size is adjustable to three different sizes. Only thing I don't like is the tail end of the cord is especially long since I use the smallest size adjustment, and it's too stiff to tuck in to where it stays tucked in. The cord doesn't seem like actual leather to me, but more like plastic or vinyl. Had that part been leather, it probably wouldn't be so stiff."
4.0,Really nice looking.  I bought a size up since my arms are rather large but the sleeves are still too narrow (narrow sleeves are only reason for 4 stars).
4.0,"Purchased for fiance. Overall good fit, but the part where it lays on your thigh was a little tight and seemed to not have any stretch to the material."
4.0,Love these. They were slipping a bit during certain poses but held up well through most of the class
4.0,"Top fits nicely but you need to go up a size, it‚Äôs also  a little short in length but overall good fit. I got the black so it‚Äôs day to evening, wear with skirt, shorts or jeans."
4.0,"Basic Wayne's World hat. Not the highest quality, but it gets the job done."
4.0,Excellent product!<br />I've used the product for a week now and am perfectly satisfied with the product.<br />Excellent build quality.<br />Everybody I've shown these to immediately wants one as well.<br />What I'm wondering for another addition to the product line- would be to also come out with a hat that has Bluetooth earbuds as well.<br />With just a small amount of wire extending out from the hat.<br />For some folks that would rather use buds style for the sound isolation outside.<br />Just a thought- but thanks for a great product! It's going to make my long working hours outside SO much more enjoyable!
4.0,After few washes they lost their tightness.
4.0,Was a little loose for a thin neck.  Be careful if you sneeze so don't impale yourself lol!
4.0,Gaps in the chest where the buttons are
4.0,I gave it four stars only because the fit was expected however a good bit too short for a normal size 6.
4.0,"It was great to find compression stockings with a fun print.  They did come up high enough to be true knee highs.  The only negative, which is true for most supprt hose, is that they really squeeze my feet.  If that is a concern, I would suggest purchasing one size up.  Have fun with these!"
4.0,"The ear loops were quite small, making it uncomfortable to wear after a short while.  They should be made longer with the rubber adjusters for better comfort."
4.0,"This swimsuit is really cute. I'm 5'3, 105lb, and around 32C bra size. I ordered a size large and it's a little loose in the tummy and the bottoms slip around sometimes, but it fits ok enough to wear. My only complaint is that sometimes I worry that the boyshorts underneath might be a little see-through since they're not lined (the rest of the swimsuit is though). The skirt covers that though, except when it floats up. It comes with removable push-up inserts. I've washed it in the washing machine and it came out fine."
4.0,"It arrived sooner than expected. It fits as expected; I am usually a medium and it fit perfectly. The only issue I have is the length. The pants fall perfectly on me; however, if I were a tad taller the length would not be flattering."
4.0,Super cute. A little wide for my face- they don't stay on top of my head well at all.
4.0,have to remove links as it is too big
4.0,6'.  215lb 17.5 neck arm 36. Muscular xxl was a good fit
4.0,very confi dress and I love it..thank you
4.0,"They are so cute! I would have given them 5 starts but since they don‚Äôt make half sizes it is a little frustrating to have to size down and my toes are crunched, but the next size up was huge and flopped off my feet. It‚Äôs hard to get a good fit!"
4.0,The material is very soft and light. This is more of a cover-up than anything to keep arms warm though as it's pretty thin. The sizing is somewhat small so I'd suggest ordering up one from their recommended sizes. Color was true and design is as pictured.
4.0,"Interesting shape. Well constructed and appointed with pockets but demands some thinking about use. Does take a 40 ounze Thermos and ample plastic food carriers, so will be a kinda snack-truck ln it's first outing. Fits my body well so need to get it out & about to see how it changes my body space."
4.0,Nice looking shoes and my son loves them. The charge does not last long at all though which is fun when you have a meltdown in the grocery store over
4.0,"Great price, great reviews, fast shipping. I opened the package and instantly thought the material wouldn't work out.. But after I survived the day without any bulging I was so delighted.. Now only issue is one of the silver buckles popped when I took it off."
4.0,"Nice glasses, great fit.  I wish they had come with a case.  I bought some from a different vendor and they came with a nice case."
4.0,Gave this to my daughter when she graduated Physician Assistant school.  She loved it.
4.0,It's a little bigger than I had anticipated. I have used it a few times. I think it would work better if it were a bit smaller. I carry small bags so its too bulky for me to carry sometimes.
4.0,Love these sleeves but only complaint i have is that they dont have thumbholes hence the 4stars. I wear these when im doing yardwork and dont feel like throwing on a sweater to avoid the sun because these are convenient and i can just wear a tshirt and stay cool while getting things done out back. Im a plus size woman and these sleeves fit perfectly without rolling up or should i say rolling down?... I even gave a pair to my husband to use when hes helping me outside because he doesnt like to use sunblock before going out in the sun and he loves them as well. Only wish they had thumbholes tho but oh well!
4.0,"Great watch in appearance and performance. I have had it for a few months and the chrome finish is as new specially in the push buttons which is the weakness in a lot of watches because it peels off. The only flaw is a rubber watchband piece which cracked around its metal inserts, I solved the problem removing two of the inserts and the rubber piece that cracked and replacing it with two of the watchband pieces that I had initially removed to fit my wrist.<br /><br />My other complaint is the time it takes for WEIDE watches to arrive, I have 2 WEIDE watches and both took more than 2 months to get to Miami."
4.0,Arrived way earlier than expected. Mine arrived  a couple days ago while it's still advises on Amazon that it Is tracking. The earring Fits right ear only. The metal was slightly meals or enough to elongate dragon body if able to fit around ear appropriately. Dragon was much skinnier than anticipated. But benefited barely feel earring is present on the ear not heavy.
4.0,"It's an ok mask, but there is a stitch missing in the making of the front.  Causing it to stick to your mouth and nose , making it hard to breath."
4.0,"this dress is a little tight, I'm hoping I will continue to lose more weight"
4.0,"I really liked this case, but was too small for my sunglasses.  I returned for a refund for that reason only."
4.0,It‚Äôs cute. It gets snagged on everything but the one size fit is perfect. I‚Äôm typically a medium fit.
4.0,"quite satisfied overall, however i was disappointed in the lack of an inside pocket.<br /><br />Packaging needs great improvement, because i'm  going to have to take it to the dry cleaners to see if they can remove those folding marks.<br /><br />for the money, and if it lasts a couple of winter seasons, it will have been a good investment.<br /><br />note : i would have paid a bit more for thicker material ."
4.0,"i bought these for my 93 year old mother because the adult sizes were too big, but these are too small for her"
4.0,Great cheap buy. I have always wanted a top with the ring in it. It‚Äôs amazing.
4.0,The sleeves are a little tight...had previously ordered a larger size in a different color and decided to try a medium this time.  Otherwise I really like it and it‚Äôs a really nice casual shirt.
4.0,This is a beautiful eye glass holder.  It is very well constructed.  I wear it like a necklace all the time if I am working on a project where I am constantly needing my readers.  The only thing that could be better is if the flowers didn't turn over to the wrong side.
4.0,Company said they updated the fit because they were running too small. Fit was still a little too small on me but the style is very cute and comfy.
4.0,"I gave it 4 starts because it fit small and I will return it,  otherwise it‚Äôs beautiful"
4.0,Looks good and durable. Love it!!<br />Removed one star as the inner belt kinda punches the wrist which is very uncomfortable.
4.0,"Very warm , good for winter walking outside."
4.0,"The ring looks nice and was as expected; however, my husband was just measured at a jewelry store and he was exactly a men's 9. So that's the ring I ordered. The one that came although marked a 9 but measured to a 9.5"
4.0,I purchased this hat as part of my halloween costume. It did was it was supposed to do. But I couldnt imagine wearing this for anything else. It is a little stiff and you can bend it to your liking.
4.0,Flashy costume pants and super fun! Only thing is you either need to wear a long shirt or wear nude underwear / tights or else you can see right through them
4.0,This has a weird cut. I had to bunch one of the sides together in a knot to make it look somewhat cute. Like the fabric and it's soft and flowy... but had to make it work for me. Have also tied it into a cute short dress... sorry for no pictures.
4.0,Nice compact reading glasses very comfy and in durable case.
4.0,"The Shomer Tec titanium escape ring with shim/saw is mostly well made.  The fit runs small, so I took a size 12 for a finger I normally wear a size 11 on.  The ring itself is light but strong, with an excellent polished finish.  The micro-saw/shim is as good as you can find for the money, as as it balances price, flexibility, rigidity, and the sharpness of the saw.  It is sharp, but takes the bend of the ring, so is a bit tricky to use to cut.<br /><br />Worn, it looks innocuous, but takes a little getting used to as you might feel a bit of the saw teeth.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court"
4.0,"Great item for my kids. Bought to use for baseball games as they have to wear it during games but not when up to bat. Only thing is that it's on the small size. Stretch is good for the most part but my kids liked to open their mouths a lot so it got in the way. I would have preferred some more ""room"" there. Bright colors."
4.0,Like the watch very much classic styling bold dial with red secondhand this is probably a watch and will use for many years. Overall a good watch for the value.
4.0,"Fits well, even on a smaller head"
4.0,Runs small in the bust
4.0,It's ok what was expected to be
4.0,"Color was very accurate to photo online. Very comfortable and fit well.  I didn't care for stitching detail on the bum...it was not flattering to me... but this is probably body specific.  I think it would look good on someone with a substantial backside, but not on flat bottomed girls like me."
4.0,fits a bit tight
4.0,"This isn‚Äôt a bad product, nor is it the greatest but man is it convenient. I‚Äôve had this for about 2 years and it works like new still. I don‚Äôt use this during the summer but definitely in the winter time and the cooler days I will use these for sure. The sound is surprisingly decent, the sound almost sounds like someone‚Äôs holding a speaker next to you but not at the same time. You feel like it‚Äôs playing from your phone at first but really it‚Äôs the beanie. Once you get used to it, you‚Äôll like it. It‚Äôs nice to be able to listen to music/podcasts but still be able to hear conversations with your co workers. A definite stocking stuffer or a cheap buy."
4.0,Little thicker Harder to pry open
4.0,People were impressed with this necklace
4.0,The pants legs are about an inch too long. The length of the ruffle
4.0,Delivery was on time and the item was in brand new condition. This is a beautiful watch which will definitely earn many compliments!
4.0,Classic good looks and a comfortable  fit.
4.0,"This bangle snaps open and close, which is my only complaint. It looks nice but is a pain in the a** to put on and take off."
4.0,"Fluffy ,,,,,,very hard bottom"
4.0,Nice mask for holidays but not protective enough for COVID. Two masks needed or additional fabric needed to provide adequate protection.
4.0,"The dress fits perfectly and is a nice, heavy material. I wish the scallops at the bust were sewn together, rather than separated. Wears and washes well."
4.0,I have it in white. It has a kind of shimmer to it.
4.0,"Glass Lenses always seem to be the clearest, although there is weight associated with glass . Once I got used to it , it didn't bother me. The price is right! The Lenses are dark"
4.0,These are a lot better made than I thought! My son loves to tote around his toys and clothes for sleepovers in this bag. And it definitely helps keep my hands free!
4.0,"They‚Äôre LARGE. Ordered 6ga, my current size, and it looks like I‚Äôm going to have to stretch to a 2ga just to get em in, and have the middle settle at around 4ga. Idk if they sent the wrong size or if this is expected. Compared the flare end to end with a 4ga and there were much bigger."
4.0,"This is a thinner jacket than it looks, it's less warm than a sweatshirt, especially if there's wind. The pockets are big and the material is nice, and it fits well (5'0"", 112 lbs, athletic build), but it's definitely more of a decorative jacket than a functional jacket"
4.0,"Not breathable fabric but it fits and it's cute, so pretty good for a cosplay imo. You will heat up in this, like no pun intended. The pants are too much for me XD it comes with so many belts, I honestly don't know where they all go."
4.0,"Everything fits well except the mask. The mask is insanely tight (see photo). My daughter is 11, approximately 58‚Äù tall, and the child XL fits perfectly. I do wish the hood either didn‚Äôt have a zipper or was removable (you have to unzip the hood partially in order to unzip or zip up the bodysuit. Quality seems well and you can wear it without the mask which is what we will probably do. FYI: My son is wearing a Spider-Man suit from another seller üòÇ"
4.0,Cute but it took us a while to get all the bracelets untangled
4.0,"We do a lot of grilling over a camp fire so we're forced to bend over into the wood smoke.  It is much more smokey than a charcoal grill and much more so than a gas grill.  We searched for glasses kind of as a joke and were surprised that they were an actual thing.  Anyway, we really like these.  They work as advertised and the case is very nice.  We can just throw them in the camping equipment and not be concerned about them getting scratched or pulverized.<br /><br />As far as what they claim they do:<br /><br />Barbecue like a Pro with these comfortable and adjustable grilling goggles from Troops BBQ!<br />  I still can't barbecue worth a damn whether I am wearing these or not.<br />Keep your eyes safe while maintaining a high level of style and comfort.<br />  eyes safe - yes; comfort - yes; style?  hell no.  Be prepared for some &#34;grilling&#34; from your peers when you put these goofy things on.<br />Protect your eyes from smoke, soot, heat, embers and splattering grease.<br />  fully agree<br />Clear lenses are anti-fog, offering maximum clarity and eye protection.<br />  fully agree<br />Thermoformed protective EVA storage case and cleaning cloth included to keep goggles clean.<br />  awesome case as described above"
4.0,It is comfortable and pretty.
4.0,"Big for me, but it is beautifull"
4.0,"My father wanted soft mock neck shirts. He is satisfied with the quality, cost and comfort (feel of the shirt). Good product for the cost."
4.0,Like it very much but i would consider ordering one size larger if i would purchase it again
4.0,Great necklace with bling! Well made. Has a larger lobster clasp so easy to hook and unhook. You can‚Äôt beat it for the price!
4.0,"So yes, there are two versions of the District 12 arena jacket. Yes, Amazon flip flopped the prices and images...more than once. I own both versions, one preordered through Amazon and one ordered through another company. I was lucky enough to get both versions, collectively, for less than the original $119 retail value of the full replica.<br /><br />Personally, I love both versions. They are both useful as not only replica collector pieces, but also as costume pieces and everyday use (I have only used the nylon version and have yet to use the full replica though). They are comfortable and hold in heat well (even the nylon only windbreaker) just as described in the books. Word of warning for those who do choose to use their jackets: either invest in Febreeze or let your jackets hang a full day in a well ventilated area after each use. I found that not only do they hold heat and keep you warm, mine also held in your natural body odor."
4.0,"I love love LOVE this necklace! Its cheap, but still well made. You have to be careful with the feathers, as you should with all feathers. And two if the feathers came off, but you can easily put them back on by bending part of the loops attached to the feathers and attaching it back to the chain!<br />Easy peasy. My mom thought it was really pretty as well when she saw it!"
4.0,Bought it for my 10 year nephew. He is a big Pokemon fan. Nephew is tall for his age and the small size fit him perfectly.
4.0,Very cute. Still fitting my 6 month old.
4.0,fits perfect just a lil bit too long for my taste.
4.0,This it a cute and comfy sweats outfit.  The fabric is great and I love the color.  It seems to run a bit small so if you can order a size up you should.
4.0,"Fits my 1873 Colt perfectly - high quality. Comfortable, my wife loves it."
4.0,Nice bracelet - needs to be larger for a man. I ordered a second one just to get extra links.
4.0,It was super cute and well made. The cat logo is embroidered. Comfortable fabric. Pairs great with leggings. I ended up returning it because it was a little large and didn't look quite right on me. It comes exactly as pictured.
4.0,works well - wish it came with a cover
4.0,"I had hoped that, like my great-great-grandmother's broach with this appearance, this one would have a thread blade built into it.  It was not advertised to have one, so I wasn't expecting it, but it would have been nice :).<br />It was easy enough to modify this one to add the circular thread blade."
4.0,Super cute and fun to wear.
4.0,"Sizes Run small, but very soft and good quality."
4.0,"very classic looking, loved the look now i just need to order the braclet and ill have a great set to sport around"
4.0,"Who doesn't love a cute dress? Upon putting it on the first time, I didn't realize that there was a zipper on the right side, so for those of you trying it on, don't just pull it over your head! The measurements are accurate for the most part, though I think the hemline would hit more flatteringly on a taller lady (I'm 5'4&#34; and it hits just below the knee). It's a lovely dress that doesn't need a petticoat to flare out, but the dress I received had a hole in one of the pockets. So, for the extra effort of patching it up (and the sub-par stitching work), I'm going to dock a star. The pockets are internal, however, so you won't have to worry about anything showing."
4.0,Very pretty...just the right touch for your summer tops...
4.0,"I bought these for my wife And some others as well. These look better in the picture then they do in real life, but I can't complain, they still look nice on my wife. For the money you can't go wrong. They fit her well and she is a size 7. These are a little cheaper and have to be tied at back of heal. No metal clasps or anything like some like products."
4.0,Beautiful ring but band could be thicker.
4.0,"Great for the price, but they stretch out pretty quickly."
4.0,Ran wide and looked cheap
4.0,The site wouldnt let me pick a size but for $6 I just ordered it hoping it would fit. I‚Äôm typically a size small/medium. They sent me an XL and by surprise it fit perfect!!! So excited. Love the material and the color üíú
4.0,"This pendant is awfully pretty, but the rings holding it together are crap and it fell apart on my wife the first time she tried it on. You can fix it with a pair of needlenose, but you shouldn't have to."
4.0,"Very cute and dainty. I got this for one of my best friends for Valentine's day (Galentine's, if you will). She took the rose gold and I took the silver. I suggest painting over them with a clear topcoat nail polish because the coating will wear off pretty quick. My silver one is getting pretty brassy. But yeah, I like them, and they're dainty enough to wear it all the time and not really feel like you're wearing a bracelet which is nice if you type a lot for work."
4.0,"Fit as expected; slightly thinner fabric than what the reviews said, but fine with a tank top underneath it."
4.0,Nice and comfy. Washes up nicely.
4.0,very bulky
4.0,"A little expensive for the conductor hat. The material could be better. It was cute but the thing was it came to me with one of the buttons off. Thank goodness I found the button so I could sew it back on. I gave it 4 stars , but I thought it could be better . That is why I did not give it 5 stars."
4.0,Its way to long & it makes it hard to wear
4.0,"I love this dress so much. I did size up according to other reviewers. I'm 5'9 and 165lbs, 36d and the length is just a little above my knees. It fits comfortably but I took off a star bc it opens a little in the chest in between buttons. The fabric is different feeling but I'm okay with that, especially in the summer heat. The only downer is having to wear something underneath so I'm not flashing anyone."
4.0,"It punctuate fine. I got some space upper part (around shoulder), but I don't feel uncomfortable when I run or do yoga."
4.0,very comfortable to work out in.
4.0,Very cute! Will look great with jeans and capris!
4.0,"This is a great little purse, holds a lot of stuff, I like that it's washable and the exterior is rugged enough to take anywhere, plastic zippers and lots of interior pockets. The only thing I didn't like was the Velcro strap on the front won't close , but the top zips up so my stuff won't fall out if it tips over. Otherwise well made and would purchase again or a different style when I need a change, don't think they will wear out anytime soon."
4.0,My son wanted this for school. Came very quickly. Seems to be decent quality. He loves it so that is all that matters. Spent a lot less than I would have in the store.
4.0,"These are sooooo cute. I absolutely love them. They fit my girl perfectly, and the color really pops. They are made well, with a soft insole, and nice stretchy elastic around the ankle. There is even a cute in print on the bottom of the sole of the name brand. I have 2 main complaints. These aren't leather like a lot of moccasins, but I knew that from reading the description. The issue is that the fabric doesn't hold well. My daughter (17 months) was able to pull off one of the fringes. While it's small enough to not be a choking hazard to my daughter, it could pose an issue for smaller babies. The second issue is the scent. You will definitely want to air these out. They have quite the chemical scent. If you are aiming for green living, you may want to avoid materials like these or be sure to put socks on your little one first. Since I knew where these where shipping from, and have made foreign purchases before, I was prepared for the scent and this doesn't bother me so much that I won't use them. Just wanted to give others a head up.<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review of the product. I never guarantee positive reviews."
4.0,"Received in 4 days. Perfect for any patriotic occasion. Fun, cute and good quality. Will pair with my American flag bikini for the 4th of July!"
4.0,Love love love these leggings!  Very breathable and not see through!  The only bad thing is the seam split a little on one of the legs as soon as I got them. The hole is low enough that it doesn't bother me which is good.
4.0,"This is a great dress. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the padded top. If you wash this dress by hand no problem, but if you use the delicate cycle, the padding folds over. You cannot straighten the padding out, unless you open the seem and then re-stich."
4.0,Thinner material than expected.
4.0,"I wish I'd known about these sandals years ago.  I first ordered the flip-flops and I actually prefer that sole.  The heel is lower than the middle of the shoe which makes the arch support even more pronounced.  It's very cushy and I love them BUT I can't get used to the between-the-toes thing...it hurts.  I'll keep trying to adjust, but in the meantime, these sandals are doing a good job.  Sole is very comfy but the heel is a bit higher."
4.0,Looks dark red in the photos but is much lighter red...it is however the most comfortable band I have put on...but I am very sensitive about jewelry/watches on my wrist.
4.0,Sticky enough to last a whole day standing up in a wedding. Does not necessarily provide support for heavier chested women but will squeeze your chest together enough to make your bust not look saggy. I would buy again. Cant beat for the price! I have not tried washing yet.
4.0,The only thing I would change is I would like to have the adjustable strap in the front. I have never understood why these are in the back.
4.0,"I have a small head so it fits okay, but is a little small even for me."
4.0,Wish they would have had x-small size.<br />Small size is.
4.0,VERY PRETTY.  IT'S NOT OVER POWERING.
4.0,Use is on my boat as lunch/cocktail table. Works well
4.0,The image on the shirt is vinyl so I‚Äôm not sure how it will hold up over time. Overall a good purchase
4.0,Love the feel of the material.  It's a bit slinky with stretch. I should have bought a size larger to get the more loose fit I wanted. But it's a great dress for the price.
4.0,"I like this, my only problem was the elastic waist was too tight! Everything else was cozy, but the waist was so tight that I just decided if I'm going to be able to wear this I'm going to have to cut it. So I made some adjustments and now it's fine."
4.0,My husband likes the quality. It works for almost all his pockets
4.0,"It is very cute and it fits great. The fabric isn't what I expected; I thought it would be softer, thicker, and warmer like a sweatshirt.  It was thin, and the material was coarse.  It's cute to throw over an outfit, but it isn't warm and snuggly."
4.0,"The Whoishe Women Leatherette Handbag set arrived in a dust cover, which I'm always pleased to get with my handbags.<br /><br />This is a set of 3 bags, the largest is what I would consider a medium size handbag and has both carrying handles and an optional adjustable shoulder strap. The bag is large enough to hold my full size iPad Air.  There's an outside zipper on one side of the bag.  Inside the bag there are 2 pockets with zippers and 2 pockets without zippers.  The top of the bag zips closed.  The two smaller bags are good for a cosmetic bag (smallest one) and a clutch (middle sized one).  The zippers and hardware on the bags work well.<br /><br />I ordered the bags in white with the gold accents.  I really like the color.  It's more of a pearly white and is beautiful with the gold zippers, dangling gold butterfly pendant (removable) and metal gold hardware.  The handle is well padded and comfortable to carry.  All 3 of the bags are lined on the inside with a shiny brown lining.<br /><br />The bags seem well constructed.  The outside of the bag is a vinyl material that can be easily wiped off to keep clean.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the bags is they seem a little flimsy.  The largest of the bags won't stand up on it's own (the 2 smaller bags aren't made to stand up).  When I stand it up, it folds over or tips over.  I don't know if the vinyl is just thin or if other handbags I own have some type of insert between the lining and the outer material to make the bag stiffer. The bottom of the bag doesn't have any type of rigid insert to assist in the bag staying upright.  There are 2 patches of oval vinyl sewed onto the bottom of the largest bag to help protect the bottom from normal wear and tear when the bag is set down.  I personally would prefer gold metal purse feet, but since the bag won't stand up anyhow I guess it doesn't matter, except I think it would look nicer.<br /><br />I received the Whoishe Handbag Set at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, which I have given to assist other buyers in making informed purchasing decisions.  If you have questions about this product or review, please comment and I'll answer to the best of my ability."
4.0,I received a 26 it was a true 26 way to big so I returned it and was refunded by Amazon right after I drop it off at UPS which was awesome the suit it's self was very nice I plan on buying a smaller size
4.0,"Loved it,unfortunately it was too big,re-ordering  the medium,I'm 5'9,180lbs,ordered xxl was wayyyy too big"
4.0,"Definitely good for blocking the sun, but let's the air through more than other glasses I've worn. Also a bit difficult to see the cell phone screen when biking, so if you're using a map while riding, might not be the best choice. Comfortable, and does a good job keeping my eyes protected otherwise. Also, a great value for sunglasses."
4.0,"These are great game tokens and counters.  They are a thick, durable, but light weight plastic with the markings etches into the tops.<br /><br />We bought 2 packs and use them whenever we need some physical tokens to help us keep track of counts.  They also make great stand-in tokens for if you develop your own games.<br /><br />Random notes:<br />- these pieces have a joyous sound when clinking together.  Sounds great in a little money pouch.<br />- The might be cheaper on Broken Token's parent site, but Prime negates the shipping cost.<br /><br />Overall happy with the purchase.  I would recommend if you find yourself wanting some extra count tokens or some coinage currency.  The only reason I took one star off is because the &#34;1&#34; was printed upside down on my tokens.  Not a big deal but bugs the heck out my OCD sometimes."
4.0,"**Update: Purchased this in Feb and it's now near the end of May. The item has held up extremely well. Of course now the price is cheaper than what I paid for it...but that happens! All in all, it has a great look, I have received many compliments on it and it looks great. Just wanted to do a quick update for anyone on the fence**<br /><br />I just received this item so I'll update it if the product fails. Very easy to replace the pins and links if you have common sense skills. Since I'm a female I took all of the spare links out and added 2 back in to fit my wrist. Placed the extras back in the bag if i need any of the spare pins. I did have difficulty removing one of my pins however I didn't need it anymore so it went in the trash. Needless to say I crushed it while trying to remove it lol. None the less, the item looks great, good size and I like the fact it came with extra pieces. I wear a lot of black for work so this will blend in nicely vs my old Fitbit rubber band and silver frame. This band came with the frame backwards (2 buttons on the left instead of the right) I just flipped it to the other side of the band and it's fine. If you wear any type of expensive watch that's around the same size, it won't seem clunky. I have a fossil band that's identical except in silver/gold"
4.0,It did fit a bit larger than expected. I love the soft fabric!
4.0,Ok so these are so cute but the issue was I ordered these two months ago and forgot about them that's how long it took to get here but the fit is great the look is great. Comfortable very cute. Im just glad it arrived while winter is still here. So 4 out of 5 because it took that long. So update wore them one time and the sole started to fall apart. I had them on walking around I would say maybe 3 1/2 hours this is a negative star now - üåü
4.0,Price versus quality is very good. The only thing is that for my personal taste it is very fragile.
4.0,Same as Emily about sizing.  And returning it would have also been more expensive.  Wish they would make an XXL because of this.  Otherwise great belt.
4.0,"Works very well as a good belt, does not droop or anything, fits perfectly"
4.0,I like my new scarf.  Thank you.
4.0,It fits good l love it
4.0,The service was great. The fabric felt wonderful.
4.0,Extreme comfi
4.0,Received these and was a bit surprised that they were made out of a more yoga pants athletic material and not cotton or like sweatpants at all.. Did not read the specifications. They are comfortable and cute for the most part. A thicker athletic material as well. Size large fit me well too which is what I wear now.
4.0,Mi pedido era color rojo me llego azul me los quedare por los necesitos con urgencia tienen buenos materiales lo pondre a prueba
4.0,I had been looking at these for months.  I like them and have worn them several times...only thing is that the foot bed is narrow.
4.0,"My 16 year old is skinny and average height. These were great looking shorts and fit him just slightly snug around the bottom. The waist was great - usually this is too big. I am returning them because I'm certain with one washing they would be tight around the bottom. If your son has a flat or very small bottom, then this will fit.  I wish they had size 18."
4.0,It's as expected. arrived in a good shape.
4.0,Initially I got these and the button was broken I like the pants so I am Iris change them for another pair.  Surprisingly they fit fairly well they do turn the slide down so you have to wear a belt butter other than that the fits pretty good they are quite loud and make a fair amount of noise when walking and running but I‚Äôm gonna keep trying them out on the range and through my tactical operations see how they do .
4.0,Nice dress for the price. It‚Äôs very flattering and can be worn to many different events. The flared skirt helps hide the belly/hip area. I‚Äôm sure this dress will look great on most body types.
4.0,"This dress is very pretty. I ordered this because I like the style.<br /><br />First impression, I love that<br />The material is soft.<br />This dress requires little maintenance because the material is wrinkle resistant.<br />Also be careful how you care for it 100% polyester.<br />I also like that it had a built in slip, so it isn‚Äôt see through.<br />It‚Äôs true to size, I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. Arm length is long enough the top of the dress stretches.<br /><br />The only reason for 4 stars is because I didn‚Äôt like the color on myself. To me It washes out my complexion.<br /><br />Overall, great dress, low maintenance, well made and is very comfortable.<br />üëçüÜô"
4.0,The diamonds fell out but it‚Äôs cool to have as a replacement for when I go outside and etc
4.0,This is beautiful. Wish it was just a bit bigger around the top area. But it's so stylish & comfy.
4.0,"No male in my family would where these. I got them for me, a stylish female. They work great with the phone."
4.0,a little tight in the shoulder/upper arm area but not so bad that I would return. wear this when i go out often!
4.0,Liw quality fabric but like the style and fit.
4.0,"I'm 5'2"" and 130lb I got a size medium, it was really cute but wish I got a small. The outfit is not the best quality but good for going out or for a costume. Make sure you take the tags off because as you can see in the second pic they are see through."
4.0,the dress feels good and is mostly as described but I would recommend purchasing a size up from what you usually wear and it will most likely be perfect.
4.0,"These are good packing cubes, but they are giving off a plastic odor that I am hoping will dissipate before I will be using them. The cases themselves are a nice, plastic-lined material. The clear cover is similar to the heavy plastic that makes up the bag covering a new comforter.  The handle on the bags is a nice touch. I like the sizes. The big one holds a couple pairs of jeans nicely.<br /><br />I was given these at a reduced rate for my honest review."
4.0,Beautiful copper  but the wrist straps are a bit flimsy.  Love it though and it looks great.
4.0,Very cute. Simple chokers
4.0,Not a great support bra but an excellent bra when you need to cover those headlights and a need for no straps. I absolutely recommend. Storage bag and I reused the adhesive for the sticky cups.
4.0,Just got it<br />So far so good<br />Don‚Äôt like how it holds your cash but overall it‚Äôs ok
4.0,I bought this for my gf and ended up giving it to my ex and she loved it
4.0,"I like the thickness for boots, but the roll down feature I could live without.  It rolls down and you can see it if you wear leggings."
4.0,They seem like good quality but they are baggier around the calf and ankle than I had expected.
4.0,"I needed a thin but warm sock to wear with sheepskin lined boots.  These socks do just fine but interestingly, their Small size is sized at beginning size 6!  They are a bit long but stretchy so they work but I find it shocking that the size Small now seems to start at size 6 in shoes!  Years ago as a young woman, small size which I wore started at size 4 and 4 1/2.  Size 5's and 5 1/2's will do the job and thankfully these socks are stretchy but still a bit long.  They work, though and I'm grateful for it."
4.0,When I got the 1st pair they were too big and i normally wear a medium. So I got the small and they were way better! I love these!
4.0,"El largo esta muy bien y tambien de la cintura, pero estan un poco angostas de las piernas, por suerte mi hija es muy delgada, asi q no le aprietan pero la tengo q ayudar a ponerselas."
4.0,My grandson loves it. The only thing that would make it better would be to make the zippers (in front and back) open more.
4.0,"Fits my gear, good and quick shipping. No hassle."
4.0,"In the South, when it finally does get cold, it is usually a wet cold that seems to cut to the bone. Multiple layers greatly helps with the body but the face and head have always been more challenging.<br /><br />This Balaclava does provide a very warm head protection. Although I am sure it has a lot of uses for runners, skiers, and other cold and wind related outdoor sports, but I am using it during hunting season.<br /><br />The fleece material is excellent for keeping your head and most of your face warm. And it seems to be well sown.<br /><br />It's design is such that it can be worn 6 different ways, although for me I found that 2 were not very practical ‚Äì the beanie (just looks odd on me and forms more of a pointy elf hat) and the doo rag (same issue).<br /><br />The only complaint is in the ‚Äúone size fits most‚Äù area. I would not consider my head to be all that large. In fact, for most caps and hats sizes, I am perfectly average. This Balaclava however, fits me a little smaller than I expected.  It has adjustable drawstrings on the side, but I had to have them fully let out to get it on my head.  Also, part of forehead (my retreating hairline) is left exposed because it does not come down far enough on my forehead.  I can layer a kerchief under it to fix this, but I wish it was bigger.<br /><br />Overall I like the design and the material but gave it 4 stars because I wish it was bigger to cover my forehead more. And although it's a bit snug and short, the parts it covers perform the task it was designed to do and keep my head nice and warm.<br /><br />As a frequent online shopper, I use reviews to help me decide on purchases so I always look for opportunities to share my experiences and help others.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.  I did not receive any compensation for my review and there was no promise or expectation of a positive review."
4.0,My hubby loves them! If you have curves order one size larger!
4.0,It's a classy nice fit. I love the style. It's just what I expected. Thank you!
4.0,"Extremely comfortable and fit great, but they make a slight squeaking sound when I walk."
4.0,"Very cute, good quality for the price.  It came quickly.  I would buy again."
4.0,The product is nice but kind if small for a 8 year old boy. Good thing that my grandson is skinny and it fit him but it would not last him long
4.0,"The product is the same as advertised. The only issue I have with it is the blue paint/ material on the band peeled off the first time that I put it on. Granted, no one will ever see the part that has now peeled off, but the band quality could be improved."
4.0,"Great shirt, good price."
4.0,"This dress is adorable. Bright, cheerful, form-fitting. The only problem is with the thinness of the material, you can easily see a visible panty line. I'm too old to wear a thong, so this is a problem. I tried wearing a slip under it, but you would still see the panty line, and that's annoying. I am going to try some different styles of underwear, but as it is right now, adorable as it is, I can't wear it. :("
4.0,It arrived on time and I like how it fits.
4.0,"This looks so great! The design is fantastic and very attractive, and printed clearly. I always get smiles and comments when I wear it.<br />It's printed on a typical stock shirt (I forgot the brand? Anvil maybe?), medium weight. It's not the softest fabric but after a few washes and wears, it gets softer. The green fabric looks fantastic.<br />I was surprised to see that it ships in a great little canvas bag with a great brand design printed on it! Really sets it apart from other brands and makes it perfect for gifting.<br />I'd give it five stars if it were just a little bit softer, but I'm happy with it regardless."
4.0,Material could irritate your skin specially if you have sensitive skin.  Color doesn't fade
4.0,"Just an FYI, if you're wondering if the stretch of these is along the same lines as yoga pants, they're not. Go with your actual Jean size. This is coming from someone who has thick thighs and a butt, so bear that in mind as well. Other than that, the material is super soft and I'm sure if the size I got actually fit me, they'd be nice and comfortable.<br /><br />Drawback - they seem a bit overpriced."
4.0,"My father was in the military and I loved his flight jackets. This is the same color, but not the same fabric, and far less expensive than the original MA-1 jacket. It also does not have the heavy filling that the original MA-1 flight jacket has. However, I gave it 4 stars because it fits true to women's size, and the fabric (which is a bit crinkly at first, but it softens with wearing it) is perfect for the purpose that I bought it for: to wear while working outdoors and in the barn. (It's great for keeping hay out of your shirt.) It is sized generously enough to wear layers under, but looks fine with just a t-shirt. It's also warmer than expected because the fabric really keeps the wind out. So if you live in warmer climates that don't usually drop below freezing in the winter, this jacket works well."
4.0,"This is a casual tshirt dress. It's very comfortable but somewhat plain. I ordered a solid color and it looks ok but I had to wear jewelry to dress up the ensemble, which I normally don't wear. I would order this dress again, but in a pattern, preferably floral if available.<br /><br />Since it's a tshirt fabric, be careful of size. Its stretchy and you might want to size down."
4.0,It's a little big but it's cute but it would probably  shrink a little in the dryer
4.0,"Space between the moob cups is a bit short but it does fit and is cute. No, &#34;moob&#34; is not a typo. It is NOT 1930 and you ain't my mommy."
4.0,"Plastic, not metal."
4.0,"Comfortable and nice. Only down side is that it lifts but doesn't separate, therefore giving you &#34;uni-boob.&#34;"
4.0,"A good solid ring. Well balanced, sturdy, happy with the design, and wear ability of the ring. Plain and simple, can say so much."
4.0,The cloth is light and stretchy.  Fits as expected.  Perfect for summer hot days
4.0,"Very good quality dress, just like the picture."
4.0,"I purchased this item for myself because it is a fun item. It has proven useful with the polar vortex winter we have been having, especially for walking the dog , runs to the mailbox and cleaning the snow off the driveway and sidewalk. I just grab it and run outside, I have something warm on my head a place to put my hands if my gloves aren't in my pockets. Didn't give 5 stars because it is overpriced and was rather crushed looking when it arrived but it is fluffing up with use."
4.0,Cute shoes but run tight and at least 1 size (possibly more but they didn‚Äôt have any bigger sizes) too small.
4.0,thin sole but otherwise very comfy
4.0,"What a lovely silk scarf! So colorful and vibrant, and reminiscent of Spring time!<br />It is not a large scarf, but the size is listed right here on the product page and tells you exactly what you are getting! I am plus sized and still was able to tie around my neck, but I actually wore it around my hair and felt very pretty :)<br /><br />The colors are beautiful and the silk is soft and silky to the touch. I love how it feels!  While not large enough to wrap around your waist as some do, it does wonderfully wrapped around your hair or as I mentioned, your neck.<br /><br />You can also tie this to your purse for a POP of color, or tie it around a belt loop as an accessory that brings silken flowers out against your clothing.  I love it, and my daughter is trying to take it from me already!<br /><br />I appreciate receiving this beautiful sample for my true opinion."
4.0,"Nice chain, cute turtle üê¢"
4.0,"Arrived same day, looks good. Great gift."
4.0,These cuff links are a gift to the groomsmen from the groom.  They will look so nice with their tuxes
4.0,I got the size 3-5 for my daughter and they are pretty big on her but hopefully they last awhile!
4.0,Product fit well for my son. He has skied multiple times a week and they have been washed many times and they are still great. High quality!
4.0,It's a nice lightweight tip. I am on my high school's varsity lacrosse team. I bought them for under my uniform during cold night games. My only complaint is it's a little snug in the arms but that probably varies depending on how toned someone's arms are. Over all very satisfied.
4.0,"Nice boy hoodies! Made of light weight material! Not good at keeping you warm, but definitely stylish!"
4.0,"These were a buyout that I just happened to catch a good price on. I wear a 7-1/2 but according to others went ahead and ordered the 8B. I guess they were running low and I got an 8W instead. Although I would still go with the 8 (too small won't get worn at all), I didn't want to send them back. They are very warm and comfy. In order to keep them on my feet while walking I had to insert a foam pad. That helped a lot but still, my feet slide around in them when I walk. Now, IF they were the right size for me I would say (mostly) great! However, I feel very dorky in them and they look huge on my feet. They look just like the picture and are warm and well made, however. They'll look better if they can fit you tighter but as it is, I look like I'm walking around in my husband's shoes. I just wear them of an evening and for that they work just fine. If I wore them all day I would have sent them back. Next time, I'll buy from a store where I can see them in person."
4.0,My daughter purchased and wore these.
4.0,Pretty but larger than I thought they would be.  Nancy reviewing
4.0,Stylish design.
4.0,"I love the coat. (Burgundy) However, a button is missing from the belt. The lining of the coat doesn‚Äôt fully cover the coat. The coat is cut small. Please order a size up. The Quality is great and it looks just like the photo. I hope this helps. I only gave it a 4star because of the missing button. I hope this helps."
4.0,"WAY too small. I wear a medium/large and this large is too tight and uncomfortable. Cute though, soft, just make sure you get a size larger than you normally would and don't wash in hot water with other whites."
4.0,"The dress was  bit large. Still very cute for a summer dress, but I would buy a smaller dress. Also the draw string around the waist is a little odd."
4.0,"I ordered these slippers for myself originally.  I Ordered size 9, not realizing I had selected a men's 9...much too big for me.  I was prepared to send them back, since my husband wears an 11, but before I repackaged them, I tried them on his feet.  They fit like they were tailor made for his feet.  Obviously, a  men's 11 would be much too large for his size 11 feet.  They are very comfortable, according to him, but make his feet sweat, and he frequently slips them off for some air.  They seem to be well made, but we've only had them a few days, so time will tell."
4.0,"I was so happy the boots fit properly and they look really really good. There's no excess glue anywhere or those white glue marks that you sometimes get with less expensive shoes or boots. The laces were really well constructed as well as the grommets and the inside of the boots were more supportive than I ever would have expected. Love the tab on the back of them that kind of pokes out so that you can lift them by the tab and pull them on at the same time. The souls had more texture and grip to them than I thought they would have had. The material actually looks like leather if you squint sideways a little bit which was super surprising. I have a collection of Doc martens these are not that level of quality but are perfect for trotting around town, fishing, going on little adventures, doing a little bit of work in the yard."
4.0,This is a really awesome little necklace for the anime lover in your life. It is definitely something that you do not see a lot. Great item at a great price! I love the long chain as well!
4.0,The color and quality is great.  It is a little tedious to open though
4.0,Nice watchband. Seems to be made from quality.leather and the stainless buckle is solid. The frame is just a hair bigger than the one one that came with the watch but all three buttons work fine. The band itself is decently soft and supple right from the box. Didn't make a mistake buying this one. Very satisfied.
4.0,The dragon looks great for the price that I paid. It worked perfectly for my Asian murder mystery dinner party called Year of the Dragon. The shipping was fast and I received it ahead of schedule.
4.0,Great piece at a reasonable price!  Fit very well.  Received numerous compliments on it for a show.
4.0,Wish it had a side pocket for my water bottle but works well as a gym bag.
4.0,"I bought this for my mother for mother's day and she absolutely loves it. I live in a different town, so I wasn't able to give it to her in person, so the fact that it came in a gift box was absolutely perfect."
4.0,I ordered up a size but would've been fine with medium<br />Was worried about butt coverage
4.0,Fun and light weight.  Good for Red Hatters. Unusual shape. Hat can slip along a horseshoe shaped band so that it can be worn in various positions; off to one side or centered.  The band puts enough pressure on my head to cause a headache after a while so I doubt that I can wear it for an entire evening. There is a comb attached but I have short hair and it slips and  does not  anchor the hat.
4.0,Was a nice product
4.0,I am 5'7&#34; and I ordered the XXL; it's a little short for wearing to the PTA meeting but perfect for the beach.
4.0,"fit as expected, but it was not comfortable for all-day wear."
4.0,"I'm 5'9 175 lbs. flat butt, long pretty legs. These were tight on my gut, super high rise(which I love high rise) and VERY long. I ordered gray size L. They had a citrus smell to them as well. Didn't mind that but was odd. Overall, great price and if I lose about 7 lbs they'll be fine on tummy and I can roll them down a bit for them not to drag floor."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, great colors and pattern. Comfortable fabric, well made. But unfortunately even the S was way too big on my size 2 daughter."
4.0,"Discrete bracelet, beautiful, love It!"
4.0,So nice that I had to keep it to use it again in the next winter. Thanks.
4.0,Yes. My husband love it. Great for traveling!
4.0,I purchased these earrings to complete the look I had in my mind for a red dress.
4.0,Great top! The material is nice and soft and flattering.
4.0,"I absolutely love this top. The material is nice (not too thin or too thick, just right), the sleeves are cute, and the style is really cute too. I would give it five stars but the size is a bit small. I'm 5'3 and 114 lbs and it is a little tight on even me. Not too tight but it fits more like an XS than a Small (I ordered the small). So if you're not as petite and between sizes, I would go up a size."
4.0,"Its a nice beanie not to hot or cold. Inside lining some times slides out, but just need to adjust it once in a while."
4.0,Great pack for your money. Obviously not one of highest quality but it is good quality. The only issues I have seen with this pack is some of the nylon straps have come unsewn and need to be re-done. other than that its held up great. Only have been on 1 hiking trip with it. Hope it holds up for a few years.
4.0,Really like to night or foggy driving.
4.0,"Size was fine. I ordered up a size just incase, figured it's getting taken off anyway. The bottoms are the best. Cute that they ti in the back and are cheeky, yet cover my little bit of over flow belly in the front. The top is sized ok. No support for a bigger chest but the adjustable shoulder straps help some with that. Quality Lacy material and not too rough"
4.0,"I got this earring set during Amazon Prime Day, for a great deal. I love the ""mis-matched"" look, and I have a smaller set of ""ear crawlers"" that I purchased from Amazon that I wear every day. This item cam very quickly, and it is very nicely packaged, ready for gifting. The crawler earring is a lot larger and clunkier than I had anticipated, and on my 30-something, tiny ear just looked overwhelming. Also because my ear is so small and flat to my head, I had to pinch down the cuff portion very tightly to keep the earring from dangling off. It ended up hurting that side of my head. However, I gave the set to my 16 year old daughter, who LOVES the earrings and does not have any discomfort issues. She wore them that same night to a birthday party and she said everyone complimented her and wanted to know where she got them. So I would highly recommend for younger people, who don't have disproportionately tiny ears like I do :)"
4.0,Very comfortable and fit great. Would be 5 star but first pair wore out quicker than I would have expected. Tried a pair of Spenco brand but they were no where near as comfortable.
4.0,"I loved the idea of the clock setting itself, but, the voice has an Australian accent. Which is fine for me, but not so much for my 85 year old mom who has trouble with her own accent.  I had to go back to the old fashioned talking keychain. :("
4.0,"Decided to step up to a real Stetson, since the price was reasonable and I like the way it looked in the pic.  However this hat was made in China, by Dorfman Pacific, under license from Stetson.  Has some wierd creases around the base of the crown which I'm trying to figure out how to eliminate.  Wife says it looks good on me, so I guess I have a new Summer hat."
4.0,The Shirt Is Better Than It Would Be. It's Extremely Softly & Fits Just Right.
4.0,"Love the case...probably not the most durable/protective, but love the design."
4.0,Runs very small. I had to order the coat a few sizes larger .Very cute coat.
4.0,"This shirt‚Äôs a little more sheer and shorter than I anticipated, but it‚Äôs really cute! I love it tucked into a skirt or tied in the front."
4.0,2nd and 3rd ankle strap is rather large but shoe overall fits well
4.0,Was tight but stretched
4.0,"It's very difficult to find 100% cotton, so on that basis this is a great sweatshirt. I've bought this brand for years. Quality remains very good. However, I find the material to be slightly thinner than the Authentic Pigment ""ringspun"" and ""crewneck"" styles used to be able purchase through Amazon.  This style is also considerably tighter in the shoulders and arms than the aforementioned styles. The photo of the model is a relatively accurate depiction of the slim fit. Waiting to see how the size holds up after washing and drying."
4.0,I love it very warm fit perfectly the only thing wrong is too hard to put my feets inside the boots maybe i need to stretch it ..otherwise perfect for NY weather
4.0,The hoodie is of very good quality and the design on it is well done. But when you order please order a size or 2 up. I bought a womens medium for my 14 year old daughter who is 5'3 and 100 lbs and it barely fit her. So its good quality but order at least a size or 2 up.
4.0,Lleno mis espectativas
4.0,Love the sweater I got many compliments but fits little snug I would go one size up next time
4.0,"I got these for the hubs, because I have a similar pair of sandals that I love. Mine are over 10 years old, and getting a bit ratty, but they offer arch support, and as a result are probably the most comfortable pair of summer shoes I own.<br /><br />He's been wearing worn out flip flops that he got at the drug store, on sale, nearly worn through. Every time I see them, I'm irritated and offended. These new sandals are so nice - oiled leather strap, arch support - I wish they had them in my size.<br /><br />And I wish they had them in his size. He wears size 10.5, so I ordered a size 10. Still slightly too big when I compare them to his existing shoes and those truly appalling flip flops. They're close, but just not quite right.  It looks like the arch is in the right place - but comparing the shoes, they're just  not going to fit the way a shoe you can wear every day, all day, should fit. So when I finally give him these, he'll have something really fashionable - and arch supportive -  to slip on for trips to the mailbox."
4.0,Very nice not to thick can wear on a sunny and not be sweating
4.0,I dislike that the price was a little high
4.0,"This is very pretty dress with good materials. However the fit was a little off for my body. The sleeve length is shorter than expected, though this information was not provided in the product details. The sleeves seemed longer in the advertised pictures than they really are. After reading the comments, I ordered a Large. I am 6‚Äô tall and weight in the mid 150 range. The sleeves are 3/4 or less. While it is well constructed, the dress had room in hip area but snug in the waist. I usually order based on the bust size, which is always the same for me. I would recommend this dress. Just make sure to read the measurements and are comfortable with the size ranges provided."
4.0,"As others have mentioned, the toes are a bit long, but this is not an issue as they don't bunch up.  For those who have grown to appreciate toe socks....these are great!"
4.0,This is way way bigger than expected. Just bought 2 big face Oulm watches. This is definitely  too big for my taste. The watch looks exactly like the picture and the delivery was fast. One less star due to its size. You must have a really big forearms for this watch to look good on you.
4.0,"Fits great. Unsure why some reviews say it's too small and doesn't fit their head. At first I accidently tried putting it on upside down and it didn't fit...maybe that's the issue some people are having without realizing they're putting it on wrong. When I realized the correct way to put it on it fit great. As far as the warmth...I used to wrap a scarf around my face until I got this...and compared to the scarf this is not as warm. I will say that I did not except it to be as warm as a scarf, however I do wish it was a bit warmer."
4.0,"Logo is fuzzy, like a blown up old picture missing too many pixels. Very soft shirt, one of my favorites because of the comfort."
4.0,Loved it at first but it was heavy And got stretched out probably due to the weight. It did break and was not fixable. It was pretty while it lasted.
4.0,"My 11 year old likes this dress very much. Casual, but still a dress. Just wish it wasn't so much rayon. Washed in machine, then lay on dryer rack to dry. Hoping no wrinkles when all said & done."
4.0,"Great for dress up or fashion. Not so practical for winter weather. The fabric is not waterproof and the fur and leather are fake. The flaps aren't functional. It's super cute though. It fits my husband perfectly, it's a little too big for me (it covers my eyes). There were a few loose strings on it, but nothing that affects structural integrity."
4.0,"difficult to put on, and the numerous bands don't lay flat and bunch up."
4.0,"I love the colors and how big and easy to read the face is. Reason it got 4 stars is because it was already running when I got it (not sure how long it will last now) and its a bit loud, like I sleep in a super quiet room and have to put it under the clothes pile because I could hear it from across the room (but I'm a little sensitive to noises when sleeping)"
4.0,For the most part the stones are solid and most of them blend well with each other but the amethyst stones are way off.
4.0,This is the belt that has been needed for many years.
4.0,The dress is pretty and I really wanted to fit it. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô9‚Äù with a bust of 34/36 inches. I usually wear a xsmall or small. The dress was way too long for me and I could not fill in the top of the dress. It felt more like a medium.
4.0,The presentation of it
4.0,Love it but a little big in size
4.0,"Cute, fits good,maybe a tad big, but covers."
4.0,"Warm, washable and fits perfectly, very pleased.  Thank you"
4.0,"I bought 3 of them in different designs. I actually like them! I also love the front part where it feels soft and comfortable for my forehead. The only problem is they seem to run small for the amount of hair I have or my head size, plus after washing them they seemed to shrink. It could have been my fault."
4.0,I brough this because my original nursing pin was stolen when I move and my Nursing School had closed.
4.0,"Fast shipping... very soft with large hood! My reason for purchasing was the zipper on the side... love the idea!  I dislike that fact that the zipper is only on one side and that there is no front pocket.  I purchased 2 of these for my daughters and I suggest sizing up 2xs.  Unfortunately, because of the no pocket in the front and zipper just on one side I will be returning them.  If those this don‚Äôt bother you this is a great hoodie!!"
4.0,"Super soft. Very comfortable.  The neckline does not lay like it shows in the picture. It is a true turtleneck, not v shaped. It washes up really well. The sleeves shrunk a but in the laundry. Color has stayed very vibrant and nice though."
4.0,"There size, shine and weight were all good. But what I didn‚Äôt like was the clasp so much."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a little uncomfortable to wear after 20 minutes. But it looks great, it really depends on what type of nose you have because when I use it it stays but for my sister it falls out."
4.0,The top is too loose on the boobs. You‚Äôll be letting it all hang out. I‚Äôve got to sew it closed to prevent too much cleavage. You can see inside the fold. The rest of the dress is awesome! I really like it.
4.0,"I ordered it a bit too big, but these shorts feel nice, wash in the washing machine and dry in the dryer just fine, and are really cute."
4.0,Its small and the back light doesnt work but all in all very nice water proof i use it for work and i forget i ha e it on very light weight so thats a plus i recommend
4.0,the joggers pants looks good
4.0,This shirt so nice and comfy
4.0,"It‚Äôs super cute on. Pants part is a good length. The jumpsuit has more of an orange tone than brown and it‚Äôs a little see through if it is stretched too much, and it definitely shows curves. Overall I‚Äôm pleased with it. These are just things to think about."
4.0,My wife loved them. But the pictures are a little misleading the stones are maybe half the size the show in the picture with the lady that has one in her nose. Overall good product
4.0,Cute I like it
4.0,"Love the dress, and it fits amazingly. Comfortable and it has pockets! It is a little long, but I am 5'2 so I expected that. The top is also slightly see though, but not that noticeable."
4.0,"This device did a good job measuring my 2-year-old's feet. The device is made of sturdy metal and high quality. The instructions are easy-to-read and clear. There are two minor drawbacks. First, the underside has sharp edges, so it can't be left unattended with toddlers. Second, the width measurements use an apparently proprietary scale of B-C-D-E-F, and though I searched online, I could not find any sure way to match up these letters with manufacturer shoe widths of S-M-W-XW. So despite having this sophisticated instrument to measure kids' feet, I had to guess what shoe width to buy. I would still recommend the device, and it is superb for foot length, but I wish that the width measurements were more applicable."
4.0,Comfortable and lightweight  but order next size up because it runs snug
4.0,So comfortable and high quality! Love these leggings!
4.0,The beanie is very warm and soft. It's a little snug and short though. Seems perfect for sewing on a Seahawks patch if you have one lying around.
4.0,"I have been having increasing trouble reading, especially fine print, so I finally opted to try reading glasses.  I didn't really like the cheap plastic reading glasses at local stores, so I ordered these, and I like them.  They seem to have solid construction, fit well, and work well as far as near sight."
4.0,Fits / looks cute.  Keeper.
4.0,"Love this, beautiful, functions as expected, but it didn't come with the small wrist strap which was the strap I needed."
4.0,I liked it looks cool
4.0,"I ordered 3 pairs, I ordered the pink and the blue and a black pair, the first two are great, the black pair is ridiculously short, they are shorter than capris, and they were supposed to be long and they are see through completely, super disappointed<br /><br />Edit* so decided to try on the black, and they are actually cute, still a little short but will work, so changed my 1 star to 4 star, only wish they were longer"
4.0,Stickers were off
4.0,"I don't know if it was my mistake, but I didn't undestood at all that I was buying a green and brown sunglass. I was quite surprised when I opend the box. It is green and brown! After a first moment of shock, I started to like it. And this ray ban model is very cool. If you have a round face, it doesn't lift when you smile, diferent than other big models. Very nice!"
4.0,This one replaced an old one I had previously. Fit's perfectly.
4.0,Bought it for my toddler (size 6) to wear as a costume. Fits like a dress...added leggings and a white long sleeve shirt and it was great. Wish blsck part of hood was mesh
4.0,They fit nicely. Wish they were wider.
4.0,It's a good quality hat. looks like cat ears.
4.0,this belt has lasted and i often use it as a nice touch of bling as a way to brighten my more muted clothing.
4.0,"I opened the box and saw this shiny gold bracelet.  It looks expensive, good quality,  adjustable.  The only thing I donr like about it is , too small.  The picture looked bigger than the actual product."
4.0,"When winter hit this week, I started looking for warm but cool looking boots. My friend recommended these boots and they are very sleek. I was very disappointed that they seemed to run small and my normal size in Uggs was too tight in the toe box area. If you want a sleek winter boot, this is for you! I am giving the boot 4 stars because if this boot had come in half sizes, I'd be wearing them right now!"
4.0,"Just as pictured!  The beads are a dark red, just what I wanted! They hang very long. My hair hangs just below my chin so they look great! Not too heavy. I love them I gave 4 stars because one of the red beads were missing. I am going to exchange them. Too pretty just to return! Note......I did exchange them and there still was a chain without a bead. I guess they are made that way. When I put them on you really couldn't tell so I am keeping them."
4.0,"I can usually fit into a large but couldn't here. Oddly enough it fits my waist but gets stuck there and my shoulders. I'm 5'7"", 180, and 33 inch waist. No XL option. If you feel confident you're smaller than that it really is a cute dress. Will likely give to my sister."
4.0,I am a 34DD and the torso area is kinda loose on me.
4.0,I love this sweater. Work at an office and wear it to work all the time. Gave 4 stars because there was a small hole in the seam of one of the arms. Not bad enough to send back as I can fix it myself easily.
4.0,"This is a gift for my granddaughter, who has several already. Thought they were nicely made...really small for me but I won't be wearing it."
4.0,"Bought these for our daughter who was taking horseback riding lessons, and they have held up great. Fit as expected, soft yet sturdy leather-like material (not plastic-ish at all) and the pink color was really cute, not too bright. Our daughter has worn these to death and they are still looking good 2 months later!"
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Small (3mm) and good looking.
4.0,"For gift giving during the holiday season, these scarves were great!! The price cannot be beat! Quality is nice, not the best, but for the price it's incredible!! The patterns were all cute and there was something to match everyone's taste."
4.0,The lenses broke after a month
4.0,"This product was perfect for my little sisters Elena of Avalor cosplay. Altough it is a tad heavy than I would have ecpected,"
4.0,Did not fit my head ....had to return.
4.0,"Fits good and made of good quality. Looks great and the fit is good, maybe a bit on the slim side. My only complaint is the elastic on the wrist are tight.  For a large I don‚Äôt think I should have a problem getting my hand out but I do struggle slightly."
4.0,Fit well and fastens securely
4.0,Loveeee them but it broke the first time I tried to take them out of my ears.
4.0,Shirt was a little shorter than I prefer. I‚Äôm afraid to wash as i don‚Äôt want it to shrink. Overall though shirt is fine.0
4.0,It's more complicated than I have the patience for. My kid loves it so that's the best part but I wouldn't purchase this again.
4.0,I am very pleased with my ring. It looks as good as the real thing and at a fraction of the cost. I received my order quickly
4.0,I think the skirt is very pretty. Runs a little small in the waist and it is very long but will wear with wedge shoes to get added height so does not drag on floor. I am 5‚Äô8
4.0,[[ASIN:B00N4GX0X6 G-SHOCK MIL-SHOCK Adapter]] A bit hard to fit but works like a charm on dw5600e. here is a picture with 24mm zulu strap.
4.0,Its as cute as the picture. I love it!!! I will definitely be ordering this suit in another color. The fabric seems very sturdy unlike most bathing suits. The bottoms don't ride down they stay where they should. If u r worried about the size always size up. U can always fix a bathing suit that's too big. But the one I ordered was perfect in size.
4.0,"If they were two beads longer, they would fit better. But they look nice."
4.0,"This pendant is quite large, so make sure you look at the dimensions to ensure it fits your expectations. I love it and love the way it sparkles."
4.0,"The material is good. I believe the dress could be comfortable. It's just that it was a bit too close for me, which means it runs small. It's made in China, so... Had I realized that I would've gone up a size"
4.0,Loved the quality... shirt was smaller than expected.
4.0,So cute and soft. Love the red color and the length. I have a large bust (38J) and there is no stretch nor is there too much boobage. The fabric can be a little clingy to the midsection.
4.0,Super cute - WAY TOO SMALL<br />If they fit I would have sported them though. A bit sheer as well.
4.0,"I didn't like the way it fit, the padded boob area isn't great. Also you you'll need a good spank to hide any trouble spots."
4.0,seems to work
4.0,"Too big for my 5 year-old. They slip off of her head when she looks down. Otherwise, they are durable, well-constructed and a fun design."
4.0,"Good shirt. Somewhat cheap quality, but good for the price."
4.0,"Looks just like the picture. I'm usually a size 10 but lately have been wearing 11's so as others mentioned, I sized up to an XL and it fits well. However, as a few others also noted, it's not a stretchy fabric and is a bit snug putting it on. Once it's on, it fits, but due to the non-stretching, I think it looks a bit stiff and bulky (not the most flattering fabric for a mini). The zipper cover wont lie flat, and the back bunches just a tad. I find the fabric a bit scratchy and generally cheap, so even though I adore the style and it's exactly what I was looking for, I may keep searching and go with a more expensive brand, especially given that it's summer and I live in a tropical climate where itchy fabrics are simply intolerable, but for you bargain shoppers looking for savings over quality, this should do the trick!"
4.0,Comfortable and warm until it gets 15 or lower.
4.0,Nice quality.  Good size.  Just right  Medium bag- not small at all.  Don't care for the large gold beads too much but I get compliments on it often.
4.0,When it arrived two of the drawers had fallen off. I glued them back in place and it seems to be fine now. It is not top quality stuff but for the price it is fine and will serve it's purpose.
4.0,"Very tight fitting around armpits and irritates in that area. Product runs small.  Still well manufactured, and strong stitching. üëç"
4.0,They are very nice. The packaging they were shipped in was not the best quality. When I opened them they were bent a little. I still wear them. They do scratch easily. I have a scratch already and they arrived at my home less than a week ago.
4.0,Super cute and make my butt look amazing. Color is great. Pockets are awesome. Only complaint is that They were a little short in the legs. I'm 5'7&#34; and they were a little high up on my ankle.
4.0,Such a fun costume for any fans of the Umbrella Academy!
4.0,"Nice jewelry piece. But it took to times to get it right. The first, it was incomplete and broken."
4.0,Good quality boot liners!  I would order again.
4.0,Great clip on earrings.  Cute for winter.
4.0,"I can feel the seams between the stripes when I walk, which is not an issue but ideally i wouldn't be able to."
4.0,"Good quality,description misleading-padding not quite there"
4.0,looks great but a tight fit on my big head
4.0,Shoes delivered as advertised.
4.0,Very nice shoe!  This is the former model and was pleased to find it as the models in most local stores are newer and I dont like them as much!  I shopped online at Amazon while in the shoe store and was pleased to find exactly what i needed!
4.0,"looked great, lacing up was awesome. however, on my body -they do not stay up. had to constantly pull them up. i am 5 ft, 130 pounds. measurements are 36, 26, 38 for reference. wore them for a costume and sprayed them with glitter spray paint. looked great for one time use."
4.0,They are very pretty and good quality but were pierced not clip as advertised so I hadto give them away
4.0,"My neighbors girls loved these. fast shipping, great price."
4.0,Never used these before but it was a bit confusing on the back part of the sandle.
4.0,"when buying this dress make sure you order a size to big because the dress runs small, but a very good price and beautiful dress for parties, banquets, weddings and proms."
4.0,"I love the cut, the fit, and strap adjusters. For that reason I'll be keeping it. Will be good for playing with my child and not feeling like I'm going to expose myself at the splash pad. However, I really don't like the pattern.  In this case, being able to relax a bit more knowing I'm fully secured in there outweighs that I think it's not very pretty."
4.0,"Nice shirt, thanks."
4.0,"These are extremely cute but I wasn't expecting them to have a rectangle shape. The Green and white one broke off in a day but besides that, the rest of them are good"
4.0,"So I now live on this top in the summer ... in my own house ha ha. I'm 40, 4'11 and about 180lbs ... and had my 1st (and only)  child almost 2 years ago.  I'm about a 40/42D at this point.  And this shirt is adorable but doesn't work for bigger chested women (unless you're rocking a colorful bra for your husband or man lol). It is very comfy & cute though."
4.0,I was wasn't expecting the watch to look as nice as it does. I will update my review after CNA clinical to note it's durability.
4.0,"I am a nurse and needed a decent watch that can stand up to every day wear.  I love this watch.  It is water resistant, and can work in military time.  Plus it has the day and date (great for those of us who work the overnight shift).  Plus it's so cheap that if it breaks, it's easy to replace.... however after months of usage, it's still working great."
4.0,Material a bit think but I love the fact it has a bit of sleeve and its shorts vs bikini bottom that I feel overexpose. My daughter prefers it over other bathing suits. Bought a few more
4.0,"This is a cute top, great colors.  I ordered a size down because I don't like baggy tops and it's a good fit for me."
4.0,"Very nice fit, love the cut.. They fit very well. The material has a tendency to wrinkle quite a bit.. Needs a very hot iron to get rid of the wrinkles.<br />Other than that, awesome pants."
4.0,Looks fantastic ..
4.0,"These are very pretty, but small. Great for a teenager"
4.0,"The size seems bigger or at least wider than regular small, which may be good for women with big breasts - not my case hah.<br />It is very light, expect no warm in the winter but it is wide so plenty of room for underneath layers.<br />Overall, it's cute. I can foresee that it will get easily damaged if a string gets caught on something... I plan on wearing it for photos, ugly sweater events and probably on Christmas day üéÑ‚õÑ"
4.0,"This a a pretty solid and heavy umbrella.  As with most umbrellas, they are pretty simple and easy to install/set up.  One in place, I opened it up.  It cranked for a while before opening, but I think this is par for the course.  There are no instructions, so for first time users of an auto-tilt umbrella, you just keep cranking until it tops out and tips over.  It shouldn't break.  It's designed to be cranked this way so you can use the tilt feature.  If it does break, you have an issue with the manufacturer.<br /><br />One design flaw that this, and I think most other umbrella manufacturers suffer from, is not adding a second hole in the pole, 90 degrees to the one they put in it to connect the two pole pieces.  This simple addition would let the owner tilt the umbrella in a total of four directions.  If the umbrella only tilts in a single direction, it would allow at least two directions.  4 holes would make it pretty weak, so there might need to be more thought put in on the engineering side.  If you decide to make your own holes, any pole/umbrella failure is on you.<br /><br />Aside from this, when you are near the tilt range, there is some auto drop as well where it finds it's sweet spot.  It seems ok and the umbrella stays fully open.  The crank mechanism seems pretty solid as well.  Time will tell (as with most things).<br /><br />The one thing I have not confirmed is how weak the pole is where the screws push into it to hold it in place at the anchor.  It SEEMED as though the pole simple and easily bent in or allowed the screws to pierce into it.  Since everything is anchored in place, I really don't care, but I'm curious.  As of now, it's secure and acting like an umbrella.<br /><br />Choose a color you like and I believe this is a recommend."
4.0,"Not the wool looking fabric I thought was in the picture, but it's pretty heavy, and stretchy which can be good cute and fits well."
4.0,Stayed on her feet while she‚Äôs busy destroying my house lol
4.0,"I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding. It was beautiful, very flattering, and accentuated my hourglass shape. I received a many compliments on it. I wore shape wear underneath for a more streamlined look. My only gripe is that it rode up the entire day and I was constantly pulling it down. I tried hairspray underneath it as recommended by some friends, but it didn‚Äôt help at all. Great dress, just annoying to have to pull it down constantly."
4.0,Waist feels a little big but they are very comfortable!
4.0,The material is super lightweight and has a nice feel. Tie dye pattern seems to be unique to the piece. Did shrink some when being washed.
4.0,Simply beautiful!! In keeping with my bohemian style üëçüèΩ
4.0,Love it should've gotten a size bigger
4.0,"The Mask was really nice with the picture on it , but the downfall is it is really thin its not for protection its for show you would have to put another piece of material in there if you want to wear for protection"
4.0,"This suit is much nicer than I expected it to be. My only complaint is that the shoulder strap is way too long for me, but it fits everywhere else and the strap is a pretty easy fix."
4.0,"My wife really likes to wear this. It has a weird shape, but it is fashionable. If you want to surprise your wife with a unique clothing article, get her this. You'll probably get some sex out of it."
4.0,I would have given 5 stars but I got sent the wrong pair of glasses- same style just not black. Liked them anyways so I decided to keep them.
4.0,Fits great and keeps her ears warm. The ears are floppy and concerned they will eventually come off. They are fine when she wears it just when it is not being worn it flops.
4.0,"The fabric was thinner than I expected, but my granddaughter thought it was one of the best Christmas presents ever!"
4.0,Really cute - just a chemical smell like others said when it arrives in package. Shipment arrived as expected and on time!
4.0,"Loved this dress! Wore it for my gender reveal, my theme was ‚ÄúWhat Will is bee?‚Äù The chest area Is not stretchy and did Not fit me.. Buttons wouldn‚Äôt close I had to wear a spaghetti strap underneath but, It overall fit. I would‚Äôve gone a size up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 at the time I was about 165lbs 24 weeks so about 6 months pregnant and I ordered a L."
4.0,Wearing a pendant or piece of jewelry can be a ritual reminder of something one wishes to focus on for themselves.  This pendant is worn by some as a symbol or influence for chakra alignment.  I wear it to remind me to be kind to myself and others.
4.0,"Really loved these glasses.  I ordered the gold trimmed with blue mirror lenses. They look far more expensive than the price charged and came well packaged.  I liked the soft case and they also came with a little keychain double screwdriver, that I wasn't expecting.  Really nice.  I only deducted one star because I got a glare on one side.  I could see the reflection of my face in the corner when I stood by the window and it was pretty distracting.  I'm honestly not sure if it's just my vision (I'm scheduled for surgery)  or if it's a defect in the pair I received or if it was because of the mirrored lens.  If not for that, I think these glasses are a steal and presented very well."
4.0,"I bought these for work. I have an outside job. They say ‚Äúwarm‚Äù but I‚Äôd definitely suggest wearing thick socks. My toes are cold with regular crew socks. They also aren‚Äôt supportive so I got insoles which really helped. The picture shows them after about 3 hours of work. They seem to hold up well so far. If they cost any more then I might be disappointed but the price was decent for the product. After making the necessary adjustments, they are nice boots. Lightweight. Overall I‚Äôm happy with them."
4.0,"This looked great on me, the only thing ia that the top was a little large, but that often happens when you have a triangle body. Use a clip and look perfectly fine."
4.0,"Very cute, slits aren't as high as photos (given that the model is tall, I'm only 5'3&#34;, and the slits start about 3&#34; above knees). Color as photo, soft material, but it had many loose threads off the package. Both (off shoulder) sleeves are supposed to be elasticized top and bottom, but mine on the left bottom side's elastic came broken. I had to break the other side so it won't look wonky on."
4.0,"Simple necklace. Pretty. Holds scent of oils for about 18 hours, maybe longer depending on quality of the oil. Make sure oil is dry before putting on your neck as some oils can irritate the skin.<br />I do wish there were more loops in the back for adjusting the Length of the chain."
4.0,"I have yet to wear this with a bathing suit as I had planned, but the piece itself looks like it is made fairly well for a piece of base metal jewelry. I am a fairly petite woman, this piece fits on me similar to the model."
4.0,"I ordered this bag by site. I was looking for a patent leather bag for church but wasn't sure if I would find one that I liked.  I took my chances and it worked out just fine. I immediately fell in love with my patent bag, and wanted to find it in another color.  So far I haven't found a different color, but I'm satisfied with it either way."
4.0,"It's cute. The blue cording looks a tiny bit inexpensive to me, but it's well made and sized right."
4.0,"Good for big heads, like mine..!!"
4.0,"Nice band, easy to adjust, stays when you set it"
4.0,Looks nice bought it for a friend who is a survivor hope she likes it
4.0,Charm fell off after a few wears but easy to put back on
4.0,"Virtually all belt buckles will last a lifetime; however, the leather (?) belt itself definitely does not last, specifically with heavy usage. Bought these replacements that were shipped from China, so it did take a long time to receive them. But they looked like well worth the inexpensive price that I paid. Now, I just hope they will last."
4.0,These laces are fine.  They were wider than I expected.  I probably didn't read the description.  They are lightly waxed.  I bought to ware in  a 6&#34; dress boot.  I would say these are more for a work boot.  But they are well made and will last.
4.0,"Very, very cute shoes. Very well made, feel expensive. The only thing I suggest is buying a size bigger, they run a tad snug."
4.0,"Looks classy and fits nicely. I'm a 10 and bought a large, a medium would have fit better but it's still a classy look."
4.0,Great product great merchandise excellent on shipping and also the pricing is great.
4.0,beautiful color and pairs perfectly with a white crop top and brown shoes. I don't think it flattered my body shape as well as it could though. It fits nicely at my waist but then kind of puffs out at my hips. It might just be because my hips are curvy. Otherwise cute and stylish
4.0,I got this to pot on my backpack to remind me to look for the light. It‚Äôs a perfect key ring size!
4.0,These are made well and comfortable.  I usually wear a medium and was afraid the large was going to be too big but they do shrink and they are a little small after washing but overall I'm pleased.
4.0,It looks so good.
4.0,Recommend ordering one size up
4.0,"You get exactly what you paid for, overall good watch for outdoors."
4.0,"A little long for me but I am 5'1&#34; so I expected that , good fit , comfy, and you could pair a number of different color tops with them"
4.0,"Pros: Very cute top and surprisingly well-made for the price.  The embroidery is quite pretty (and not flimsy) and the material is thick enough that it's not see through (I have the shirt in white).  Cons:  The material is not bad to look at - it appears to be a crisp cotton, but it does feel a bit &#34;polyester-y&#34; when you wear it, and while it's not horrible, the shirt can be somewhat warm since the material doesn't breathe all that well.  The shirt also does run a bit small - I'm a size 8 or 10 (34DD bra size), and I ordered the medium.  The medium fit, but it was just a bit snug across the bust and shoulders.  It also is a little short - the elastic waistband hits a fraction above my waist (I'm 5'5&#34;).  It works, but I probably could have gone into a large to have a bit more of a &#34;flowy&#34; look.  All in all, a good deal for the price, and I've gotten several compliments on the blouse when I've worn it out."
4.0,Great work out shirt ...
4.0,"My husband has sensitive eyes so he has to wear sunglasses all the time when he's outside our in bright lights. He's been that way for years so we've been thru plenty of pairs over the years between then getting lost, kids breaking them, or them just plain wearing out.  We were really impressed with the quality of these DoSmart Aviator sunglasses.<br /><br />The sunglasses are made well with high quality material.  The frames don't bend easily and the lenses seem like they will be somewhat scratch resistant.<br /><br />They fit my husband really well.<br /><br />The lenses are mirrored.<br /><br />The only thing that he had a complaint about is when he's looking at his phone or tablet with them on there is kind of like a rainbow effect.<br /><br />I recieved these DoSmart Aviator sunglasses at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,I really like this although a bit snug in my upper arms.
4.0,Love love love the shoes...laces are my only issue...come untied all of the time
4.0,"I got this and I am not a goth person, I like the style and the lace. I also had hoped that the bust area would be good some someone with DD and it is! My husband doesn't love this dress but I really like it, it fits well, it's flattering and I think it's cute. The material is on the thinner side so beware of wearing this during the day."
4.0,This bra met most of my expectations. I bought this for easy breastfeeding access but the double closure makes it slightly more difficult. It is comfortable and fit as expected. The color is nice.
4.0,"Pretty decent watch with necessary features. The instruction sheet was hard to read, but it functioned per the instructions. Did not validate the waterproof feature of this watch."
4.0,The wrong size was sent but it still fits if i put on a the smallest hole. I ordered a size medium. I got a large. It's a tiny bit loose unless belted over a sweater or two layers. I'll be definitely using it to belt things in winter. Cute style and good quality for price. My measurements are 36 29 41<br /><br />I have a 29 inch waist. Medium would fit.
4.0,I use them to walk dog at night.
4.0,Top part fits great but you very certainly NEED hips to fill it out.
4.0,"The shirt is very nice, however, I was expecting the shirt to be white and the sleeves to be maroon.  The shirt is yellow and the sleeves are maroon.  Do not rely on the picture!"
4.0,Great material fits a little loose and is longer than I would like but I am only 5ft 1 in tall.
4.0,Gift for sister. Multiple use. She said she likes it. Will see if she has it on on pics in California and or Montana anytime soon
4.0,"So cute, but be prepared as there is 0 arch support. The shoe itself is comfy enough to wear around for a little bit, but not a 9 hour work shift."
4.0,"Good quality, but the glue used to attach the top piece is visable. A quick sew would have been nicer."
4.0,New ce watch but the battery was dead on arrival rediculos and I can't get the back off.
4.0,"The size chart is way off. I wear a size 8 dress, and the chart placed me in a medium. I couldn't even zip the medium up. I returned the dress and got an XL, which fits perfect without clinging/being too tight - professional yet curvy!"
4.0,"I really like the comfort with these pants.  They are a little long, but I am on the shorter side, so I wasn't surprised.  I bought a couple of other pairs in black at Costco and knew I liked them, so I found this pair online."
4.0,I like the style and fit of these sunglasses. They‚Äôre the perfect lense size for aviators.
4.0,"My daughter and I like this hat.  The inside lining is soft and warm. She has very thick hair, and is able to pull her pony tail through the hole."
4.0,Be careful because they unravel pretty quick.
4.0,Right color and size
4.0,Bought this for my daughter Dance class I had ordered for bigger size and  it's still snug around the shoulders and you have to wear certain underwear because it rolls up.<br />Youbhave to wear  bikini type underwarev so it doesn't show
4.0,"I ordered Large because I wear 36D, but Small size in shirts. The elastic on the bottom is a little large for me, but maybe the M size wouldn‚Äôt have fit my breast? Idk - maybe I‚Äôll try an M next time. The material is good and the color is nice too - and they‚Äôre comfy, I wear them to ride my bike so not a lot of impact, but they seem to hold on good."
4.0,Like this dress but it has alot of stretch.
4.0,Color looks just like the pic. It is so pretty
4.0,"Good bag though the closing flap isnt closed very well,it done with miss matched velcro, but as a man on forarm crutches  it's uses to hold Bluetooth over ear headphones,E-Book reader cables and charger, so a great over little cross over sholder carrier."
4.0,Cute simple necklace
4.0,Thought it would be a little bigger.
4.0,"Just bought this Casio G-Shock Casio G-5600E-1JF G-SHOCK Tough Solar Watch (as stated on Amazon) because it was declared as a ""Japanese Model"". When I received the watch, the back case and buckle both indicated made in  ""Thailand"". Other than the misleading watch information, the G-Shock appears to be in good condition, the adjust (A) button (top left) is not recessed and usable, and all the functions worked properly.<br /><br />Pros: Surprisingly compact, light-weight, durable, very legible, basic features (world time, 24-hr stop watch and count down timer, and user-friendly.<br /><br />Cons: Misleading model label"
4.0,Decided to keep them...snug to pull up but comfortable one I have them on.rode in a car for 12 hours.. comfortable and not stretched out eat all. Gave them a 4 due difficulty getting them over my thighs and hips
4.0,this product is exactly like the description. its good quality and does what its supposed to. has 6 slots for pictures and fits perfectly in the wallet.
4.0,Super cute. Not too thin and not too thick. Only complaint is that I got 2 blacks instead of 1 black and 1 red.
4.0,"as expected, the metallic sheen fades a little after the first washing ‚Äî but that is pretty universal. The legs seem to be a bit ‚Äúbaggy‚Äù but perhaps just meant to be tapered for a larger thigh. Front zipper is convenient, but potentially a bit dangerous ‚Ä¶"
4.0,I love this bag it is the right size for me
4.0,This runs pretty big. I would suggest ordering a size down from your usual. It's really comfy and cute though.
4.0,Super cute! True to size! Docked 1 star because the bow was large and heavy and only attached via safety pin.
4.0,Great for my program
4.0,"This straight line skirt is a step in a pull up style.  It seems to run on the small side so be aware.  This is the type of item that is good for travel as it‚Äôs good for both day and night wear ‚Äú2-4-1‚Äù as my auntie always said.  It need care in laundering and needs to be hand washed which is OK.  But you can‚Äôt twist or ring out which is a pain.<br /><br />This is basic, cute, and can be dressed up or dressed down.  Utilitarian."
4.0,"Great quality for a favorable price.<br />My only wish would be for a ""livelier"" color gray as opposed to the dull version as provided."
4.0,"It very comfortable to wear, but you gotta tighten the string for it to fit your face much better for a more comfortable wear. And you need the filters for the mask"
4.0,Quality and style were perfect. I gave 3 stars as there was a 5 inch hole on side - complete manufacturing error.  I returned and purchased another one- look for that review....
4.0,My husband wears this almost everywhere. There is the occasional issue of the mechanics slipping out of one ear but nothing I‚Äôm not able to fix without trouble.
4.0,"Well made, can use pins while making a dress, can also show lovely dress on form.Form has a nice finish on the base, able to set it anywhere.Glad I have it."
4.0,Nice quality band. I appreciate the included tool to remove links. I was surprised how nice the band is for the price.
4.0,Nice simple pair of Cashmere gloves..nice and soft.  Best was the price!
4.0,"This hung too low for me so returned, but I could see a young adult loving them"
4.0,It was a weird gag gift
4.0,"They were exactly what I wanted! I'm glad I read the reviews before buying them and got them a few sizes up. Otherwise my review wouldn't be four stars, lol."
4.0,Loved the product except for there were no arch support and a hair too short.
4.0,It's nice but has a residue smell
4.0,"Similar to a previous review the tab holding the pad onto your bra strap doesn't necessarily stay in place but attaching a small piece of velcro to the top of the pad works well. They are a nice  small, well made shoulder pad. Exactly  what I was expecting."
4.0,"This was a gift.<br />Good quality beads.<br />Only thing I didn't like is that you have to be careful when adjusting. You don't want to pull the adjustable strings too hard or it feels like the the bracelet may snap.<br />But I wanted something adjustable and this definitely is.<br />Purchased for a sports player so he will have to be taking it off (which requires loosening) and I'm concerned that over time it will break.<br />Overall though, recipient seemed pleased with gift."
4.0,This is a nice selection of four diffferent sizes of colored carabiners.  They open and close nicely.  Well done.
4.0,Love the Tiger eye natural stones !!<br />It's just I'm not 100% happy because I have tiny wrist and I can't tighten it tight enough .
4.0,"This is very nice black material, which I like, but the zipper rather detracts from the jacket.  It's an inexpensive zipper and I see trouble with it ahead.  Too bad - very nice jacket."
4.0,It fit fine but no washing information in english.
4.0,Sexy comfortable cotton underwear! Love different colors and patterns.
4.0,Belt worked like a charm. Just add one size bigger than your pants.
4.0,The threads were messed up on a lot of them.
4.0,Nice adjustable apron<br />Easy to wear and packets are quiet handy
4.0,"Cute cute cute! I'm 5'6 105lbs 34b and ordered a small. However, the torso part is a little short. If it hadn't been a gift, I would return it for a medium but I don't have the code for returns in this case."
4.0,It was pretty & didn‚Äôt look cheap at all. Easy to wear & was perfect for a Derby party.
4.0,"Super cute, super soft! Only draw back was the length.  With it was a little longer."
4.0,"Owned similar before, they all are a bit stiff at first. I fail to find any like these that do not give me a &#34;uni-boob&#34; look. I'll stick to wearing these during spring and summer yard work."
4.0,The front string is way too long.
4.0,Love this shirt. It fits well and is pretty with all the different colors.
4.0,"Color in photo is a little off. They are more a pale, robin's egg blue and not purple-ish. Still gorgeous, and currently my favorite pair."
4.0,"This is a nice looking casual belt.  It has a pebbled finish, and a distressed, brushed nickel buckle which works quite nicely with jeans, cords, khakis etc. The belt is described as leather, and it certainly looks like leather but it does feel odd, slightly tacky, and doesn't smell like leather.  I suspect that it is a bonded leather product, and that the tacky feel will diminish with wear."
4.0,"Great fitting, loved it"
4.0,"These earring are very cute, but I had a hard time keeping the leaf stay on my ear. But that being said, I do have small ears. If I squeezed the earring tight on my ear they did better."
4.0,"Fit well easy to adjust, only problem I have is the chrome coating is coming off on the inside of the hooks from wear and sweating while working.  They are very easy to hook and unhook just need a thicker coat of chrome or a different material on the hooks."
4.0,Excelent goggle but too fragile. It broked on my third use. It broked on the strap lock.
4.0,Was a little smaller than expected but very comfy to wear.
4.0,The ring is pretty but the middle ‚Äústone‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sparkle like in the pictures.
4.0,I think this locket is beautiful. One thing to keep note of is that the picture makes the paw print look engraved but it's actually like a off white fuzzy/felt material. I think it's beautiful but I would recommend putting a layer of clear nail polish over it because the fuzzy material gets dirty but the nail polish will seal it in. I am happy with my purchase overall! And would buy it again
4.0,"I'm 5'3 and the length of the pant legs are a bit long.  Still super cute, but definitely does not look 100% like the picture."
4.0,I love dragonflies and ordered several of these most of them were great one of them was poorly made n the body slid off. Great bye for the money though
4.0,"Sexy, brilliant, time period, I love it. I will wear this hat into the ground. I cannot wait for my next opportunity to wear it again. The word simply cannot have enough perfect pill box hats."
4.0,I like the look of these earrings.
4.0,Luv it! Very comfortable!
4.0,Fresco pero la tela no es la mejor
4.0,"These socks are very comfortable for a compression sock and are extremely durable.<br />I have several pair that are nearly 2 years old and they still look and feel like new,<br />Great sock with good value!"
4.0,The quality is decent but the product runs a little small.
4.0,good buy and good fit. material light weight and airy
4.0,"Love the necklace, just wish it was 6‚Äù longer."
4.0,"I like these shirts. The material is light and beathable. I ordered a medium and The fit is a little snug, but I think a large would be too big. The colors are pretty and the black accents are nice."
4.0,I believe my grandson will enjoy receiving his favorite WDW character t-shirt on Christmas Eve.  High quality!
4.0,Fits a little big but still cute great material very stretchable I should have gotten a smaller size.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7cd8ceb6213878a083b4af2dfd615659]] I'm an avid pin collector so I usually try to get my hands on whatever I can find. There aren't a lot of options to buy pins in bulk so I thought I'd give these a shot. I was worried because the reviews kept mentioning getting all medical ones. I didn't as you can see but there are a few that are less desirable. They are all very high quality regarding picture and thickness so that's why I'm pretty satisfied. I wish they'd cool it with the motivational And book related pins, but I did get some cool ones like the snake skull and the creeper. Just don't expect to get what you see in the pictures they show you. This is a gamble."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:551e314ef1a97390b4d2cc6398c19271]] Edit:<br /> Video added. It‚Äôs more spacious than I initially thought. It can hold my iPad pro, iPhone, checkbook wallet, dove small lotion container, and still has room for more. The rest of the review stands. It‚Äôs not horrible at all, but it‚Äôs not the most supreme bag either. It‚Äôs good for the price.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />The bag is exactly what you pay for. The purpose of my purchase is a bag for my younger sister to use while on a school trip. It should survive long enough to serve its purpose. The bag‚Äôs fabric has a strange texture, soft but slick. The print is blurry on the fabric, but you can still make out the design. It is comfortable to wear & use. Holds what a small-medium purse would hold. Seems okay in the seams & zipper quality. I wouldn‚Äôt be too rough on them though.<br /><br />So, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmeh‚Äù in quality for the price. I still intend to give it, but I likely would not buy another."
4.0,It fits my wrist well and dial is easy to read.  The edges of the band are somewhat sharpish but comfortable once it is on.  The size is between a woman's watch and a man's watch.  All in all it seems to be a good product for the price.
4.0,They were exactly as I expected. They look a little cheap and the heart is fairly big but they looked fantastic with my wedding dress. The backs of the earrings were a little loose.
4.0,"Adorable dress, but it is definitely made for those with smaller chests! I'm a 38DD and ordered a 2XL, it fits but it's very tight in the chest, so I've opted to just not wear a bra with this dress.<br /><br />CONS: It is difficult to zip up by yourself because the fabric doesn't stretch, and the half-layer of tulle underneath the dress rides up and generally doesn't look good, so I'll be cutting it out. The slip it comes with is a &quot;one-size fits all&quot; that's better suited for a size 4. I had to buy a different cami dress for underneath.<br /><br />PROS: I mean, have you seen this dress? I look like a fairy goddess. It's exactly as pictured and all embroidery is in perfect condition on my dress."
4.0,I didn't think I could pull this off but I really like this shirt! It is cotton/spandex according to the label. But feels like a stiff polyester and has a little sheen. The print is on the shirt so if you're big busted you will stretch the print out see gaps. So cute though!
4.0,Fits as expected! I'm 225 and 5'1. It is long on me but I just tie the ends up and it looks fine. Purchased an XL and it fits very well!
4.0,Buyers be aware that no tail means even under full extension it is not made to hang around your neck. The full extension puts the glasses under your chin.
4.0,Beautiful suit. Too small in the bust. I'm a D
4.0,Purchased for my son in 5th grade. Overall it seems like an alright backpack. It is pretty small in that it's not very wide. He has a 2 in wide folder and it barely fits into the backpack when empty. Not sure how it's going to hold up once he has all his home work in it.<br />There is a laptop pocket inside and a front pocket but that's it. Wish it had a water bottle holder on the side.
4.0,I love the durable material it is made of. And the pattern is cute! I do kind of wish that the openings were a bit smaller and I didn‚Äôt have to tighten the opening to make sure my bags don‚Äôt fall out every time.
4.0,"Nice and sparkly, but smaller than expected.  I knew that I ordered the 6mm size; I even looked at my ruler to decide. Because the picture is really big, it's still difficult to gauge the actual size unless you see it in perspective, either next to a common item, or on a model's ear.  Please include a more useful picture."
4.0,Good lightweight shorts for banging around the house.
4.0,"Although the coat is super cute, soft, and warm enough for a below zero North Dakota winter. I find it to be difficult to zip. The belt thing is also crooked as one other commenter mentioned but mine wasn't as bad as hers was so I am keeping it anyway. Good coat for the price especially for plus size. I think the zipper will fix itself in time."
4.0,"Pretty dress! Might run a tad small, but I also don't think my size is the same as it used to be since I just had a baby. Pretty and fun dress for a good price! A little low cut, which makes it easy to breastfeed in but I also felt very exposed. The price was right and it looks like the picture online."
4.0,Fit fine.  Good daily sock
4.0,"Liked the style, color and the material. Wished Armholes were smaller so bra does not show."
4.0,My little girl absolutely loved this and now will swim in the pool on on her own and the best thing is we can take it on the boat because its coastguard approved.
4.0,"As a piece worn for Pride Party, this was the perfect garment for its purpose. However, your skin underneath the neoprene gets hot and when it gets hot and sweaty it rubs. That's the nature of neoprene know this going into it and you're fine. BTW... If you use an aerosol anti perspirant under where the neoprene is going to be touching your body, it rubs less because it doesn't soak up as much sweat.<br />Before warned once it gets hot and sweaty the neoprene can have a bit of a smell to it that is hard to get rid of again this is the nature of neoprene. know these things before going in."
4.0,"La tela bonita, muy suave pero le quedo  demasiado  justa, es importante comprar una  talla  m√°s"
4.0,It's really cute on. Exactly as described.
4.0,The small pill-like case is cute and fits easily in a backpack pocket or briefcase.  The umbrella is mall but serviceable.  I will use it for travel and overflow but not as a main umbrella because of the size.
4.0,Very well made.  Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband.  He loves it!
4.0,"Washes well, I lay on a drying rack to dry. Looks nice with black slacks."
4.0,"Very cool logo, received compliments, but was not expecting such a lightweight Tee for the price."
4.0,Love this necklace received lots of complements
4.0,"Muy bonita buen tama√±o, capacidad y durabilidad, bonito color verde militar, aunque el color dorado de las franjas no es muy de mi agrado."
4.0,"Liked this dress, but it didn't fit so had to return it.  Was well made and quite pretty."
4.0,"Great bag.  Only complaint would be with the interior zipper pocket.  Basically isn't one.... if you use this compartment, your stuff is just behind the liner.  Otherwise great bag!"
4.0,"So far so good, 4/5 until I see how long they last... Feel great so far, feet breathe pretty decent as well. not too hot, but it's been cold so far as well."
4.0,Bigger than expected.  It was nice but to big for what I wanted.
4.0,"Wore the dress on a trip to Mexico. It was so lightweight and perfect for the temperature! The dress fit great and made me feel sexy. My only complaint is that the slip, which is visible where the dress slits, is ENTIRELY too short. It stopped right at my crotch. I ended up wearing a pair of darker spanks underneath just so I didn't feel so exposed. Had the slip been longer I without a doubt would have given the dress 5 stars."
4.0,Being follically challenged and often wearing a suit I needed something to cover the noggin in winter. This hat is perfect. It is warm and looks good with a suit. When the temperature gets above 40 or so it goes into the closet.
4.0,"I love this bag for the functionality, and was one of the only options that had all the features I was looking for. It fits my laptop and has a lot of storage for other items, but isn't too bulky where I feel  like I'm carrying luggage. The material helps it withstand the weather too. I use this bag for commuting and was looking for an option that wasn't a backpack. I have to walk a lot so crossbody was preferred, but I found there to be limited options and this bag has really impressed me. The only complaint I have is that the strap when wearing crossbody isn't that comfortable, but the reality is it has one in the first place, so I'll take it. I also am a little concerned for how it will hold up overtime because the leather on the corners is already ripping (and I've only be using it for about two weeks). Overall I'm happy with it so far though."
4.0,"it is a  very cute set, very durable. I had to glue the grommets down when I got the bag, which would be easier to do than send back. looks exactly like the pic. The large bag is bigger than I originally thought,  which is good, enough room for everything."
4.0,smallish
4.0,Not very good quality fabric but it is cheap
4.0,"This dress fits beautifully! Its super cute and the dark red is exactly like the red in the picture. I am super impressed with it. Only complaint would be that the material is kind of thin, if I wore any patterned underwear you'd probably be able to see it! Still super happy for the price!"
4.0,It is a nice necklace at a good price. I happen to love elephants and collect everything with elephants.
4.0,"Well made durable leather,  color fades after awhile but still a good wallet"
4.0,Nice fabric and I love the color. They fit a little smaller than I expected‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs probably me putting on some winter weight.
4.0,Very well done and good service.  Will make great Christmas presents for the guys in my fanily.
4.0,"I bought this set hoping that a few pairs of the earrings would work out, and it exceeded my expectations. The earrings are of totally reasonable quality given the low price. After a couple wears the 'gold' studs look a little worse for wear if you look at them really closely, but are still totally wearable. I've gotten compliments on a couple of the earrings, and people were surprised to hear they were a cheap Amazon purchase."
4.0,"Love these glasses - great style and look awesome.  Only have two criticisms:<br /><br />- Glasses are a little too narrow for my head, so I stretched them very carefully by bending the middle<br /><br />- The glasses and arms are connected with tiny screws and nuts that tend to get loose.  To prevent the nuts from falling off and the glasses from completely falling apart (which has happened once to me), I put crazy glue on the screws/nuts/hinges of both the arms and the parts connecting the frames.  This prevents the screws from coming loose."
4.0,Tight around the chest but comfortable
4.0,"I love the dress just wish I would have ordered a size smaller.  I ordered the navy polka dot in an XL.  I am 5 4"" and weigh 150 pounds.  It still looks really nice and is very pretty.  Not a stretchy fabric, more of a lightweight poly blend.  Good quality too!"
4.0,"Very cool.  DId not give 5 stars becasue of the weight, they tend to fall off easily."
4.0,"Unfortunately the item arrived damaged. The vendor worked with us and gave awesome customer service. The fit was as expected. The quality appears good, not cheap. It would have been a five if they were not damaged."
4.0,"Great product quality, but does run a bit small so customers will have to order a size up when purchasing this set. Thanks"
4.0,I love the look of this but it is kina cheap feeling. Rough to the touch a little. But what can you expect for under $15.
4.0,"these fit well have a decent reflection and darkness to them, three day shipping. good price for five bucks, well worth the five bucks"
4.0,"I like it has a lot of room and a zipper pocket in the middle. I didn't like all the plastic I had to remove from EVERY gold piece, some are very hard to remove and still stuck under some pieces"
4.0,"I was very happy with these! They came in quickly and they are super cute. The metal on the backs of them were bent however, but it was easy to straighten them out"
4.0,"Nice material.  Adequate fit.  A bit tight in the lower legs  and sitting tends to pull the waistband down in the back.  Also tried 38x32, but they were too baggy all over."
4.0,Perfectly well made. Very nice
4.0,As soon as I first put them on I wanted another pair. Fit is true. Nice looking longer legged shorts. I could definitely tell a difference when wearing them as the chamois padding helped keep my rear comfy. Highly recommend. Probably will be buying another pair.
4.0,"Truly is 925 Sterling silver. Stamps are on the Cat and the Paw print ring, couldn't find the stamp on the ears. But I've been wearing them since the day I got them. And not a single sign of it turning my fingers green. The only problem I had was that the Cat needed up breaking. But the company fixed the problem very quickly with no problems."
4.0,Is lovely
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised by these pants. I bought them for work. Very comfortable and good fit.
4.0,This coat is so cute and stylish. It keeps you pretty warm and the fleece inside is really soft. The coat seems to run on the small side. I am a medium but had to order two sizes up from that to fit just right. Ended up getting a XL and that fit perfect. Nice little coat.
4.0,Could be stronger but product great for the price.
4.0,Love the pattern but it's small more for a child/teen rhinestones make it heavy but overall good quality.
4.0,"Nice to get down to basics, a simple, basic, analog watch that works for its basic needs."
4.0,My daughter will have to grow into these.  super cute though!
4.0,"With any captive bead rings, the opening is usually set tight so the bead doesn't fall out under simple pressure. You can fix this by stretching the ring just a little bit. After doing this I have no problems getting the bead in and out. I use them as a lip ring and the one thing I can say is a down fall is that the bead is really small and can be difficult to line up, besides that, they look great."
4.0,"Exactly what I needed!  It's football season, so that means sitting in the bleachers all day long in the blazing sun...  I usually hold a golf umbrella over my head, but that gets tiresome.  I searched for umbrella hats on a whim and found this one, and it's perfect!  The description says &#34;red&#34; but it's definitely maroon, which is awesome because it's our team colors.  The material is cheap - there's a small worn hole in one section that was there when I received it, but I'm not using this for rain purposes, so I'll deal with it.  And yes, the plastic tabs that hold the elastic band are a bit scratchy, but I attached an old headband over them so I don't feel them.  I saw other reviews that said it blows off the head too easily - those customers must not be attaching the cord that's included...  There's an adjustable cord included, and when attached, keeps the umbrella hat securely on my head.  My oldest son thinks this hat is super embarrassing, but I got so many compliments from other fans in the stands.  I even showed a few fans the link to where they can buy one for themselves, and I expect that I won't be the only one wearing this at the next game!!"
4.0,"This dress fits just as expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 140lbs and I chose a medium. I do carry most of my weight in my butt and thighs so that made the dress a touch short for me and it‚Äôs a little bit see-through. Other than that, it‚Äôs great and I‚Äôd definitely recommend. Fabric was soft and comfy!"
4.0,"Very cute.  Inside sticks to skin when it's wet, child might not like the feeling of stickiness.  Fits on the large side.  A bit too large for my 46 inch, 43 lb 6 yo.  Sleeves are long, waist on shorts are a bit large.  Perhaps it will shrink in the wash."
4.0,These are comfortable and cute. I like that the coverage extends to the sides.
4.0,"The only thing they could have improved on, is to make the buttons more secure to the fabric.<br />This fabric on this dress is a soft and a little bit elastic like.  Which, I love."
4.0,"Like the fabric, but it is pricey!"
4.0,"I am 5'4&#34; and 128lbs. A large might have been a bit too big. Good thing is they don't shrink. The black shirt is a perfect basic tee, nice and soft and comfy. Crew neck keeps everything tucked in where it should be. White shirt is a nice thick material and barely see through. Recommend for your basic wardrobe collection."
4.0,"I received this Women's Stretch Adjustable Strap Lace Tank Top and so far it is really nice. I usually wear a size small/medium and i saw that some people had said this ran a little small so i decided to go with the size medium just to be sure it fit, but i think it is actually more like a size large. It is a little loose around the middle but i like my tank tops to fit snug so maybe other people just prefer it a little bit looser. It is a very stretchy material, it is a tad bit thin but not any worse then other tank tops. The lace is very pretty it kind of weirdly comes together in the center which looks a little funny but its not too bad. I usually like my tank tops to have the built in shelf bra just for extra support, which this one doesn't have but otherwise it is very nice. I actually love how long it is too, it is perfect to wear underneath another shirt or sweatshirt. I hate when a tank top is always too short and rides up all day, but this one doesn't have that problem at all. Very nice and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice and pretty tank top!!<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest review and hope that this review will help out others when looking to purchase this product!"
4.0,"Pretty dress. Looks a little more drapey on the model (and a deeper v) - was a little poofy on me, made me feel like a fairy. Ordered a medium as I was worried about length and it fit well."
4.0,"These cord locks work great for use with homemade cotton facemasks, allowing the elastic cord to be adjusted to fit different ear/head sizes.  My ONLY COMPLAINT is that the seller failed to include the ""threaders"" needed to pull the cord through the cord locks on my second reorder,"
4.0,Love the shirt and does look like the pictures.  The sleeves in the forearm area do fit a little snug but not in an uncomfortable way.  The bows on the back do need a little care in making them look more like bows so I did have to work with them a little.  Overall I do not regret the purchase.  It is a unique shirt and I really like it!
4.0,"I read the reviews and had to try this watch. I have small wrists and never can find watches to fit me. This watch fit perfectly, and I love it."
4.0,"It's smaller than I anticipated, even after ordering a size up like previous reviewers suggested. However, it does look nice on."
4.0,"My daughter likes these summer clogs. They're great in the garden and mucking around the yard, as they can be easily hosed off. Lightweight crocs knockoffs, fairly cheap quality, but they'll last the season, and she'll have outgrown them by then; and she's happy with the unicorns."
4.0,Gloves kept my hands warm and dry
4.0,"After opening the package and pulling out this shirt, I can say that it's my type of shirt, I'm going to like it. I thought it looked a little short but after putting it on, it was perfect and it fit me well too. It came fully unbuttoned so after I put it on, I buttoned the front and my sleeves and took a look in the mirror, I liked what I saw. Then I took the shirt off, buttoned up the back and slipped it back on and I loved it! This shirt can be worn both ways, to give you a little room with the back unbuttoned or for a nice slim fit with the back buttoned up.<br /><br />I have a lot of shirts made of chiffon like this one, it's thin, light and breathable. The front of this shirt is double layered but the back isn't which doesn't bother me. I think that's actually quite stylish. I did tug on the fabric near the seams to see how well this shirt was sewn but it looks fragile. I'm afraid I might rip this shirt if I'm not careful and that's my only disappointment. It's a really nice looking shirt, just needs better stitching to hold it together. I would buy another color though, the one in blue has also caught my eye.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased review. My reviews are my own and are not influenced in any way. I enjoy writing honest reviews based on my experience with a product whether it's positive or negative. I am not compensated or forced to voice my opinions. I hope my honest review has been helpful, thanks for reading."
4.0,"Gave it 4 stars for the price and the amount and variety you get with theses<br />Pros<br />- so many different types<br />- the price<br />Con<br />- the quality, but what can you say with that price."
4.0,Nicely made but not all cotton like description states.
4.0,"This pin is a nice quality and gets compliments it is just a bit larger than expected.  Good quality, not to heavy and nice back closure."
4.0,"Suuper cute! Looked great with my outfit at Hulaween! The only thing is it runs so small. I followed reviews and ordered a size up. I should‚Äôve gone two sizes up. I wear a 34 DD and normally wear a medium and ordered a large. I was able to button it closed, but even with it open it was a little snug on my arms and at my shoulders, I probably would‚Äôve been more comfortable with an XL. The only other thing is the lights do not continually flash in sync. They start off that way and then after a few flashes no longer line up. Overall it‚Äôs still a super cute fun jacket and I can‚Äôt wait to wear it again!"
4.0,"After reading several 1-star reviews, I decided to take a chance on this. I really wanted the Among Us masks and I could not find any paper ones like this. So, I ordered. They took a while to arrive but that's probably more due to supply issues right now. Anyway, I did get all 60 of the blue hero masks, 20 in each design. They're cute and they're a good size for kids or a very small adult. The price comes out to a little more than $3 a mask, which is a lot for a kids disposable mask. But like I said, I paid for the Among Us design so it was worth it for me. I also kind of wish they were individually wrapped, but that would probably make them more expensive too so oh well."
4.0,I needed this to cover my arms while driving and prevent sun burns. Works great for my need.
4.0,"Cute dress. The top fits a little tight and the skirt is a little long, falling below my knee. Because of the length, I wouldn‚Äôt want to size up. (For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 130 lbs.) I would order another in a different color/print."
4.0,love this dress - wore to a wedding reception on one of our hottest days 112 degrees with the heat index. only thing i didn't like were the pockets - no need for pockets on a dress like this.
4.0,"I bought this for a friends wedding and wore it this weekend. I normally don't wash the dress I buy right away in fear they will shrink. Well this dress NEEDS to be washed, alone.<br />The color bleed onto my skin.<br />LOVED how the dress fit but would return for refund if I wasn't outside the return window."
4.0,"I love a lot about this, but there's too much side boob showing off, so I'm returning it... it's awkward to wear<br /> around family or really anyone who I'd want to take me seriously."
4.0,Didn't know it was a slim fit
4.0,"I ordered several of these type short sleeve t-shirt dress for my daughter.  They fit well and the cotton is soft.  The pink color, however, is gross.  It looks more like Pepto in person.  Returned due to color."
4.0,"Love these &#34;tennis shoe sandals&#34;. They're like walking on air! This is my second pair of Bzees. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the bottoms don't have any tread/traction. For me, personally, they could also use a bit more arch (which I always add to my shoes that won't accommodate my orthodics), but it's a decent arch support for most people."
4.0,"It tells the time and is even water resistant, not much else you need from a watch!"
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fabric. There was more white than i expected, but I liked the look.  However it was way too big and even though I ordered a small. Seems as if an XXS would fit even though I usually wear a medium to a large"
4.0,Solid ring. Good detail. Go up one size because it's chunky and it will fit just fine.
4.0,"Amazing dress. Ended up not needing it for the event I originally bought it for,but love it so much, I don't have the heart to return it. Beautiful dress!!!"
4.0,I loved how many different tongue rings there are. I found a few that i loved and tha i have worn a few times.
4.0,too small but i love it!
4.0,"Love the dress, love the pockets; they stick out a little and need fixing occasionally, but overall very pretty. Would give 5 stars, but the dress was a little sheer in the white stripes"
4.0,"A little cheap looking,  but good for price."
4.0,Order a size up and you will be fine
4.0,My mother likes it it's fashion so I would shower with it on to keep its shine.üíì
4.0,I got this dress for homecoming in black and it was a perfect fit when I got it. I added a belt to add a little sparkle but the material and quality are great. The only problem I had was the stitching on one of the straps was a little wonky.
4.0,Comfortable feel of silk. The leg openings stretch out while wearing (because these are true silk) so do not expect athletic level support. Feels ‚Äòau natural‚Äô and gives the sense of freedom while being fully clothed.
4.0,"I use my husband‚Äôs account. But anyway, I wear a small/Medium for everything. Ordered a medium, black and it was just wayyyy too tight! I am 5‚Äô7, 145 pounds, and wear a B cup. Other than the size issue, I loved it! Material was soft. Will be buying a Large"
4.0,I ordered it a size bigger and I could have ordered my true size! It‚Äôs very thin/sheer and you will need a black slip.
4.0,these pants are really cute and super comfy! got tons of compliments when I wore them to work. my only warning/complaint is that the material is SUPER thin. meaning you‚Äôd have to wear nude underwear because it‚Äôs see through and also definitely wear a thong otherwise you WILL have panty lines. I originally wanted to wear this with a bodysuit but unfortunately it was a white bodysuit that wasn‚Äôt a thong at the bottom so it just was not possible in these pants
4.0,I love these swing dresses. They‚Äôre perfect for anywhere.
4.0,Too small for my liking so had to send back.  But that was my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions.
4.0,I was looking for something simple and these fit the bill.  Wore them to work after receiving them and received lots of compliments
4.0,"The bill is a little longer than I'd hoped. Otherwise, really nice!"
4.0,Helps keep hands warm. The fingers in the glove are a little to long for me.
4.0,"ok,but I think they are too heavy"
4.0,"Perfect for my Simon Chipmunk costume; adult or child-size. Gave 4 instead of 5 because the lenses are slightly hazy. I plan to wear them all day and would have preferred them be completely clear. They're clear to look at, but absolutely transparent not when on. Still perfect for this costume and a great buy. I'd recommend."
4.0,"Very pretty, simple made dress. Not bad for the price. Looks beautiful on my little girl and sizing is correct. My daughter is a local festival queen and this dress will be used for parades. I like that the flower is detachable and can also be used as a hair clip."
4.0,"I loved them for a while.  I legit wore them almost everyday, but eventually they started to smell a bit, and you can't shower with them, so it just decreases my fondness to them( I don't like to constantly remove and put on things).  But they're worth it.  It's pretty great and it looks great depending on the outfit, so buy it! :)"
4.0,"Fairly comfy, but a tad short. I'm a 13.5-14 and the biggest sized sockwas are a tad right. Also heavier than expected, but still an extremely light sock thing. They will serve their purpose of a camp shoe quite well while backpacking."
4.0,I have ordered a couple sets for my daughter and her friends.  They are packaged as pictured and work as expected.  The price is very good for this product.
4.0,"As so many have stated the crystal is loose plastic.  BUT all in all for the money, it's a nice watch.  I love the skeletal case, where I can see the inner workings at work.  I started to panic when I saw the shipping estimate for times, but it came WAY early."
4.0,"The material feels cheap, BUT I still have mine and it has yet to be broken, I love it!"
4.0,Clear graphic as described just seemed a little small
4.0,A little work when it comes to putting it on because of the different parts but it went well with my husband's costume
4.0,I bought these for nezuko and they are perfect! Just a little tricky to figure out the straps but once adjusted and fixed correctly it was great. True to size I wear sizes 8 and 9 and got the size 9-10 and it surprisingly fit great!
4.0,Excellent lightweight strap. Appropriate thickness for both men and women. Its starting to yellow although i use a purple wipe everyday. -1 star because i accidentally bought 2 and they wont allow me to ship using my own money. They have a prepaid shipping label thats the same cost as the item.
4.0,Made kind of cheap
4.0,"True to size. The top is a BIT large, but that's not a huge issue for me. Everything else about it is perfect."
4.0,"Fit true to size , the material look cheap"
4.0,These are a little bigger than I expected but they‚Äôre beautiful and are decent quality.
4.0,"I wear a size 9 in men,so I always get one size bigger and it fits fine...but the straps were alittle loose.oh and GTM store sells them for 11$ when they are in stock."
4.0,They are not as sticky as I would like but my daughter loves them!
4.0,True to size. Comfortable. Easy to wash.
4.0,"I bought 2 sizes up from my regular size and these still feel too tight, however with extended wear, they do seem to be stretching a bit (which might be a &#34;con&#34; for someone else)"
4.0,"Good quality but I should have ordered a L,  received very fast.  Very pretty."
4.0,"Good value for the money,When cleaning a little Dawn and luke warm water ,dry with cloth.They will  stay clean sparkling ."
4.0,Charm fell off first time I wore it. Luckily found it and had it put back on.
4.0,Worked great under my daughter's pageant dress. A bit itchy so she wore long basketball shorts underneath.
4.0,"Cute little charms. The finish isnt as sooth or shinny as I thought, but it isn't rough to the touch or scratchy. Heavy little suckers, but work great as charms on jewelry. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase"
4.0,Loved these necklaces great price just what I wanted .
4.0,Just have to hand wash otherwise they shrink!
4.0,"*sorry for sideways image* I'm very top heavy (36HH) so most times I have to size up my dresses so that that can fit comfortably around the bust area. I've worn this dress twice now and I've gotten on average about 5 compliments each time.<br /><br />The dress is not see-threw, it's lightweight and comfortable to wear. Disclaimer: I did have to wear a small safety pin to not have 'the girls' all out on display. That's why I had to knock a star off. If it were a true wrap dress, this wouldn't have been an issue. 5'5 and 173lbs I ordered a Large"
4.0,"These are very cute but the only issue I found was that the length of the nose pin itself is very long and the ball is at least 2 sizes bigger it was very hard to push thru my nose. My nose is 20g and the ball was at least 18 or 16 eek! The colors are great and I like that they're acrylic I hadn't tried acrylic for my nose, they glow in blacklight too."
4.0,"I got this to use as part of a costume to use only once. It looked great, no complaints."
4.0,The shirts did not fit as expected.<br />I should have ordered a 3x
4.0,Love how cute they are .. we used them for airplane rides so she could be comfortable
4.0,Intricate & beautiful!  A little on the heavy side.
4.0,"Nice material but runs a little too small. I have a 34""-35"" waist and ordered a large. Should have ordered the XL"
4.0,Overall great fit and looks good but it's a bit snug in the shoulders.
4.0,Nice enough but too small for me to wear despite extender chain. Will give away to thin teenage niece.
4.0,My teenage son and nephew really loved it. The silver on the black braided leather bracelet is very fashionable.
4.0,"I use this as a fall/winter nightgown. It's very cute but also very thin. You can basically see the shape of everything going on underneath. I have a few piercings and you don't need to guess at where they're at, you can just see the shapes... Needless to say I don't wear it in public.<br /><br />It does shrink when you wash it. The sleeves are a touch short now while the body of the dress went from almost too short to definitely too short.<br /><br />Still I like it and it's cozy to wear around the house. My sister liked it so much that I got her one too."
4.0,"This necklace is very cute, trendy and versatile. The only issue I had with it is that there are very sharp pieces on the extender chain. I basically can not make it longer with out the back of my neck getting scratched up.<br /><br />The item arrived very quickly."
4.0,I like them. My girlfriend likes them. What's not to like?!
4.0,"nice and good quality, but too long for my wrist"
4.0,Bought for a gift. Pleased
4.0,"Overall, they fit well, but I constantly had to pull them up because their was no elastic band in the waist to hold them in place. Nice yoga pants though."
4.0,"My husband likes the pair of ties. The gray paisley has a little dot of blue in it so it's really nice and the pink has a small pattern that looks really good for summer. Just keep in mind these are a little on the shorter side. My husband is average 5'11 and if he tied them like other ties, it would hit shorter than normal but to remedy this, you can adjust how you tie these, though, to make them work. It's not a big deal for two nice ties."
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful stud. I used it as a monroe, even though its a bit large, I got many compliments on how beautiful it is. I would suggest using this only when dressing up though, because constant wear, such as showering, face washing, sleeping, etc. can cause some of the lovely gems in the center to fall out. I will buy another one for special occasions, but if you are looking for something to keep in 24/7, this may not be what you want."
4.0,"Worked great with MY shoes!  Easy, non-bulky, flat fit into luggage.  One bag fit woman flat sandals and extra socks (3 pair- rolled up), SECOND bag,  2-1/2 inch heel woman sandal and scraves (2 laying flat).  STRETCHY material ONLY.  BUT, if you have women athletic shoes, women shoes with platform or &#34;non-sandal&#34; with higher heal you MUST utilize BOTH bags for the pair.  If you keep this review in mine you will be satisfy with your purchase."
4.0,"If you‚Äôre in between sizes like I am, I‚Äôd size down. I am between a M and L and went with a L but it‚Äôs a tiny bit big but I also have a small chest. I am 5‚Äô5 160lb for reference. Cute shirt though and not super thin material."
4.0,Fits great and feels great!! It got pilly quick with all the extra fuzz attached to the shirt is the only complaint.
4.0,"Nice , really delicate"
4.0,"Very beautiful and comfortable shoes. But as suede, it needs regular cleaning."
4.0,Very good product. Good fit. Dries well after use.
4.0,"For the price this is amazing. The sizes are a little off I think, it is a lot larger than I expected. The outfit is so cute. I have seen similar little rompers in baby boutiques for 30$ so I'm definitely satisfied. It took a while to arrive but most things from Chinese sellers take longer so I expected that. The quality of the product is good. The fabric is a little rough but it is well constructed and has good stitching."
4.0,"Although I haven't used these LifeAngel Cut Resistant Gloves much yet, so far, so good.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, I cut the pad on my middle finger while drying (but not actually using) my mandolin. Ended up that I needed six stitches. While at the walk-in clinic, the nurse and doctor mentioned that they have at least one &#34;mandolin&#34; accident each week. Because of this, I decided that I needed to take some precautions to prevent future accidents.<br /><br />To date, I have not had a reason to use a mandolin slicer but these gloves seem to work effectively for regular chopping.<br /><br />I purposely tried to cut through these gloves with my sharpest silicone knife and I could NOT damage the fibers. That's very positive.<br /><br />I normally wear a medium glove. The length of the fingers were fine, but the width was a little large. Not a big deal.<br /><br />After more extensive use with my graters and mandolin(s), I'll revisit this review."
4.0,The bracelet is pretty just dont get it wet or it will rust and leave a green rash on your body
4.0,"I like the glasses they reduce glare , not so dark you can't see, seem to be very well made."
4.0,Just needed cheap - polarized sunglasses. Don't particularly like the pearls - but I do like the overall shape.
4.0,Worked very well.very pretty.
4.0,"I only bought this for the arm panels and pelvic flap so I wasn't upset that the vest dosnt fit me. I'm 5' 10"" and 230 lbs. The upper arm segments are big and bulky which i like buy my be a problem for smaller people. The main vest does not fit me and isn't to adjustable. If you are not overly big than this should work for you"
4.0,"This blouse fit as expected. However, I withhold judgement as to how it would hold up in the wash. I would reorder this blouse in a different color."
4.0,"Ships from China, so it took about 5 weeks to arrive.  Fit is great; true to size and stretchy.  I am 5'8 and the length was great."
4.0,"thin, but good quality and price"
4.0,Beautiful wallet!!!
4.0,"I like them very much because are comfortable and very light, definitely I recommend üëåthem"
4.0,"Got this for my tragus. I probably could have gone w 5/16 to make putting it on a little easier. Super cute in.<br /><br />I'll update after I've had it a little longer. This thing fell out in the pool. Had it less than a week :(<br /><br />I'd advise taking it out before swimming, this is something I've never had to even consider with my other tragus rings.."
4.0,"Beautiful top. Nice material. A little overpriced, but you pay for the label."
4.0,"Smaller than 12mm, reordered a size up"
4.0,Very nice good price. Delicate though.
4.0,Would buy better then Walmart sun glasses for about the same price
4.0,my daughter loves these slippers. she wears them everywhere! they look as they do in the description
4.0,I was a great  gift
4.0,The ring is a little too small for my glasses frame. If you have frames that have a wider temples it may not work for those glasses. Looks great and put together very well just wish I could use it for my glasses.
4.0,Buena confecci√≥n
4.0,"This will go perfectly with my Disco outfit I found, also online, for our 40th anniversary 1970's theme party I am throwing."
4.0,I liked the purse it was perfect size beautiful colors what I did not like was the inside had no pockets.
4.0,"Good material, not a fan of the loose neck. Would give 5 if they made the neck fit better."
4.0,"I love these skirts. The colors are vibrant, and the material is soft and silky - if a little bit cheap, which is why I didn't give it the five stars.  That being said, the skirt is really lovely and easy to dress up or down. it is long and fits true to size, I'm 5'5"" and it touches the top of my shoes. Best of all it has POCKETS! I love the pockets, easy to put your phone or cash in. I get compliments every time I wear it."
4.0,This leotard looks to be good quality but it definitely runs small. I bought the Small for my daughter who normally wears a 2T or 3T and its quite snug. I know they are supposed to be but she won't be able to wear it long.
4.0,"I bought it for my husband, a little small so I'm wearing it."
4.0,"The plus is the product arrived 11 days earlier.<br />The downside however; the material could definitely be better, it feels cheap. Also, depending on how you like to wear your clotha, order this 2 sizes bigger, I ordered a large instead of a medium after reading a few previous reviews, but it still fits a little too 'snug' for my liking. Overall though, I'm pretty happy with the purchase and will wear the product."
4.0,These glasses fit over your prescription glasses.  The lenses are big and see thru.  They are not attractive because you can see your glasses underneath.  They kind of look like bug eyes.  But they cut the glare and who can see you in the dark while driving?  Not pretty but they work.  The glasses are light but well made.
4.0,I got this for my sister in law as a small token of my sentiment. She loves it and all have asked where she got it.
4.0,"I like these skirts a lot. I own 2 and they are both a bit different in length but it is a small enough difference that I'm not bothered. Waist stretches well. The ties can be a bit tricky at first to get to lay down properly but I found that tying with a slight downward angle helps.<br />I bought these for belly dance costuming but I end up wearing them to work too, with boots!"
4.0,This scarf is absolutely beautiful! The material feels so soft and silky for the price! I was incredibly shocked when I opened it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the beige parts in the scarf didn't appear to be beige but more of a soft blush beige color. All in all it is a great scarf for the price.
4.0,"My older cashmere sweaters are incredibly soft, but this sweater, like another one I recently bought, is not as soft and a tiny bit scratchy. I hope it gets softer over time.<br />I sometimes buy large or extra large because I do not like tops too form fitting. I went with an XL and am surprised how form fitting this is. It actually looks great on, but I prefer a little bit looks like in the pic. I think this sweater runs small because XL usually fits me a little bit looser.<br />Still, this is a great quality sweater and I look forward to wearing it this fall."
4.0,My daughter likes these. We mow have gotten two pair of them.
4.0,I thought that the watch was supposed to come with some QR stickers to place around your house or office. I did not receive any. Other than that I just unboxed the pavlok and will be testing it first thing in the morning.
4.0,"I liked the quality and feel but it is very short. Width and bust was fine, just short."
4.0,"I love the space in it, the material and the size, just love it!!!"
4.0,"Pretty good socks, fit is tight and they provide ample compression. They are a little pricey, I have a similar pair that I paid less for at TJ Maxx but it's hit or miss with them."
4.0,The more i wear them the better they feel Love this kind of boot
4.0,"She said it fits fine except for the sleeves, which are tight. Other than that it looks good.<br /><br />Product was discounted in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"Super comfy, giving it four starts because the material on the inside sometimes comes off on your skin, so you end up with tiny felt pieces on your legs"
4.0,Gift. She loved it!
4.0,Arm and shoulder fit perfect.  The length of the jacket is a little too long.  But over all it's pretty good
4.0,This is a gift do hasn't been received yet. The fit looks to be good. The fabric is not the regular cotton that I expected but I think it will be fine.
4.0,"What I received was a lighter brown. Definitely vinyl. The Velcro  patch stuck on the case is wonky.  But nice, functional eyeglass case.. I like it."
4.0,"Like the dress, my only complaint is its a little see through and the patterns aren't quite even. I am 5&#34;8 160lbs and I got a medium, and it fit perfectly if a little tight around the chest (I'm 36C)."
4.0,Great dress. Simple yet elegant. I ordered a medium and it fit me just right and I'm 5'8&#34; and 145 lbs. Liked it enough that I ordered it in another color.
4.0,"0ga x 1/2"".  The end of the bar is hollowed out to match the curve of the ball.  The threaded stud is in the bar, mostly protected in the hollowed area.  It works in my frenum...sort of.  Skin gets litely pinched where the ball and bar meet."
4.0,This is a very sweet little necklace. It did take a little while to arrive since I believe it was coming from overseas but my daughter loves it.
4.0,"I have a slightly larger head than the average person, and the ear bad was still a touch loose on me. Otherwise great quality and sharp looking."
4.0,"I ordered a medium. I'm 5'1, 115 pounds, 32D bra, and size 5 pants. The medium fit perfect for the top and bottom. I really like each piece of the bathing suit. Fits very well and feels comfortable. Came with a slight smell, could be from the padding in the top. Only big complaint is that there is no way to adjust the back since the design is knotted with no easy open/close clamp. Would buy from this company again."
4.0,This is super cute I was expecting it to be kinda loose but it was pretty roomy even for me and I‚Äôm a busty lady I would‚Äôve gone down a size had I known but overall still looks good.
4.0,I really wanted dangled earringle
4.0,This didn‚Äôt fit me very well it was tight ok the arms & upper body & I couldn‚Äôt pull it down. I gave it to my sister.
4.0,Liked cause it fitted me right
4.0,Entirely too tight even in a large. If you're tiny this will likely be perfect. Sorry but I can't wear this. Sending this one back.
4.0,Fine for the price. Takes a little effort to dewrinkle.
4.0,"this ring will be good for beach or pool or everyday; no need to be very careful of this.<br /><br />it is sturdy, has a slight sparkly look, not too much. nice colors.<br /><br />Fit is good. delivery was prompt. Price is reasonable."
4.0,"First ordered this style dress from a different vendor and loved it so much I ordered it again from this vendor. Perfect fit and perfect for any occasion - I've worn it to church and work. Ordered an XL. I am 5'4"", about 205-210 at the time of purchase, and I usually wear a 14/16 dress (in department stores). My only complaint is that the color is way lighter than I expected (reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 #ImPetty üòÜ) but since I liked the dress so much, I simply toned it down with a black blazer and black heels."
4.0,Lindo vestido muy comodo
4.0,"These would be AMAZING, if the holes to put your glasses in were bigger. Could not get any pair of glasses I own to fit. Sad because I threw away the packaging before I tested them out, can't return now."
4.0,"The Saris is lightweight and relatively easy to use. I have a fairly lightweight bike, about 20lbs. I mount it on the flat trunk lid and rear bumper of my car. I'm afraid to put more than one bike on it in fear of it coming loose. I also added stick-on furniture pads to the points that rests on the car surfaces (trunk and bumper). It just seems like it's going to scratch the finish or rub the paint off with the weight of the bike."
4.0,"So far so good, it appears to be well made.  The real test will be after it has been washed a couple times.  I bought because of the Russell brand.  Years ago it was a well respected brand. Hope it still is."
4.0,Bought 2 as a gift for my friend.  He liked the 1st one and asked me to buy another for his son: so I did.  He's pleased.
4.0,Cute dress! The dress fits bigger than expected so that was a bummer. I used their sizing guide and guess it sized me one size too big.
4.0,"This is the second item with Titanic coal that I have purchased from 401 DESIGN. It is a great key chain, and I wear it as a pendant on a chain. The only issue with this keychain is that the tiny rubber plug on the bottom (holding the glass vial of coal inside of the metal tube) can be easily removed and is unreliable. I had to replace it with a tiny plastic plug that I found around the house. If it wasn't for that, I would give the product 5 stars."
4.0,This was a spare of the moment acquisition. When they arrived I was beyond believe. These things were of the upmost quality were not flimsy were very well-made for the price. Would definitely purchase these again if needed.
4.0,Look's good on.
4.0,Perfect and very sturdy
4.0,"Nice, but it's unraveling; also smelled like smoke when I first opened its bag...had to spray it down with Febreeze"
4.0,"I normally wear an XLarge but got a 2XL and it fit ,  an XL would have been too fitted. As for dress it was ok, the picture looked better."
4.0,"It fits good, different quality but nice."
4.0,"Like the pants, a little on the thin side, but they look at fit well."
4.0,These were awesome. A little bigger than I expected. But I like them.
4.0,"Beautiful and fits well. It hold water, its not be worn after swimming, take it off."
4.0,"These socks are cute, stay up nicely without falling or being to tight. They are comfortable and not to thick. I work in a warehouse with 12 hour shifts and I cant have overly thick socks as my feet swell by end of shift so I can feel the difference. I like the material and have no complaints but one......<br />cons: no toe enforcement , I wore a pair the first day and by end of shift when I came home I could see my big toe trying to come through already so these wont last long. These would be PERFECT if the toe area was re-enforced."
4.0,"Very well stitched, much higher quality than popular name brands, and in an uncommon color (slate blue).<br /><br />My one complaint is 25$ (31 with shipping) is extremely steep."
4.0,Very cute shirt but a bit short. It‚Äôs fine because I was planning on tucking it in and now I don‚Äôt have to but it barely grazes my waist and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3‚Äù and have a short torso
4.0,Everything was exactly as I was expecting except that it costs more than maybe it's worth and was smaller than I had originally planned.
4.0,"These are sweet, simple dresses‚Äîthey ran a little small for my needs butI love the patterns and colors."
4.0,"Works fairly well, for the price. Runs about 2 min fast a day, and I do need to wind it slightly daily. Since I'm a woman, I changed the band to a black velvet one, and I think it looks smashing, like I've got grand dads old watch. But, I change watches frequently. Would love it in a silver tone."
4.0,The clasp is a little<br /><br />Small
4.0,It's a nice short and fits well. I removed a star due to the short being a bit move see through than I expected.
4.0,Beautiful dress for price
4.0,"Beautiful!! but not sure if it fits correctly on me , good quality for comfort and makes for a fancier loose top"
4.0,"Nice and  comfortable sandal.  Perfect length for my size 7 shoe, but the (m) is a little wide.  Great arch support."
4.0,This is the second bracelet from strapecode I have purchased. No issues with item. Really dresses up watch.  Have had no problems with a number of items purchased from strapecode through Amazon.
4.0,"its pink, it's an apron"
4.0,Dress is cute but alil smaller than I had hoped for my daughter but still wearable
4.0,He enjoyed it
4.0,"These earrings are super cute! They are fairly large and the design is very pretty. However, the backs bend pretty easily and wearing them the first time irritated my ears a little bit. I think that will be remedied by cleaning them, however. I will be wearing them a lot!"
4.0,Light weight and convertible into a backpack! I can not wait to travel with this!
4.0,"The straps are a little short. Remember this is wool, it will shrink and it's a little itchy. But over all I love it and it does help keep me warm."
4.0,"They're super cute. I've had mine a couple of months, and have gotten some pretty good wear out of them. I wear a different one every day, but I do wear one every day. They just started breaking; not all of them, but most. It's not a bad buy, though. They lasted for a while and definitely worth the price."
4.0,Love it fit perfectüòÄ
4.0,good but a little expensive
4.0,So cute! I'm 5' 3&#34; 110 lbs. Arms are a tad snug and body is lose; wish there's a zipper. Still love it; lots of complements.
4.0,Just a little bit loose but wearable. A lot for the price
4.0,"This dress is as advertised, loose, comfy and good looking.  The fabric has a backing woven into it which makes it feel resilient and adds some body.  I am pleasantly surprised by how nice it looks:). I chose the black printed on khaki.  The tag on mine says 90% cotton and 10% linen but I‚Äôd be surprised if there was not also some synthetic component.  However a cool gentle wash and line dry will work fine.  Happy with this purchase."
4.0,Solid and reliable pair of glasses!!!!
4.0,Super cute and it comes in a fancy looking Swarovski box that makes this bracelet look like a very expensive bracelet. It's magnetic to open and close but I have not had any issues with it opening when it wasn't supposed to as other said they are afraid to loose it. I do agree with other reviews that it is not very big and I would have liked it to fit a little bit more loose as well. But I have a somewhat small wrist so it does fits but if it was just a little smaller and it would not have fit. I don't wear it often due to it not being loose enough for my liking although it is very pretty and I recommend this as a cute gift for a special person in your life. And this price definitely cannot be beat.
4.0,Cute but longer then expected
4.0,A good time piece. Nice design.
4.0,I liked the concept but I'm allergic to the lining. But it is perfect for my daughter. It's still a nice mask.
4.0,"It is a practical, decent quality watch. It is not flashy or too large & heavy and it's not trying to look like a bargain Rolex, all of which would apply for most Invictas. A mature person sure of himself would wear this... not an attention seeker. Not extremely dressy either. I think that's a plus, as it could be worn in more situations. It's more unique too. Unlikely you will run into someone who has one. It should be clarified that the bright numbers do not glow in the dark. The hands glow in the dark but they are not self-glowing like tritium, so the glow fades after awhile. However the green color of the numbers is brightly colored for day time use. Seems like the guts are Asian, but it does ship from Germany, for what that's worth. :-)"
4.0,It was a little difficult to fasten it but once I got it on it was perfect
4.0,I bought the deep tan. The color is so rich and the shoes are comfortable. Great dressy shoe.
4.0,This dress was very comfortable. The fabric was soft and stretchy which had the positive of being comfortable but ultimately made it kind of slumpy and unflattering. I ended up returning.
4.0,Very cute even though a lot  Shorter than expected. Average build 5‚Äô2 girl. Still have to wear something underneath. Still love the style.
4.0,Looks nice with a denim jacket.
4.0,Great fit ! Good for the price . They‚Äôre not truly dri-fit but i still love to work out in them
4.0,"The shirt was tight in the arms and across the chest, should have sized up. My daughter now wears this and she looks super cute, wish it had fit me."
4.0,"A little TOO thin for me, but that's just personal preference. I like the mesh that helps cut back on sweat since I'm on my feet all day. My favorite feature of them, however, is the strip of whatever it is they put on the bottom of toddlers socks that makes them non-slip. These socks stay in place no matter how much I'm running around work."
4.0,"The size indicated medium, but I am a size 2 (x-small/small) in most clothing so becareful when purchasing.  Be aware of the measurements provided and measure yourself.  I purchased it based on the measurements not on the size provided.  Costume fit great.  Got a lot of compliments."
4.0,Purchased a size medium<br />Quite pleased
4.0,Super comfortable but they are pretty thin
4.0,"I hate that they STUFF them with the plastic feet. It stretches them out in the heel area. I have 4 pair of these, all the same size. But this pair slips off my heel. Just hoping this will change. If not I will have to get heel guards. Have waited so long for a blue pair. Looking for Two Years.<br /><br />Ok, Now it is June and they do not slip in the heel. They relaxed back to the same size 8 of my other pairs of these shoes. I find I choose these over the others because this pair goes with everything."
4.0,Made of bodycon material fits and looks as pictured
4.0,loved the shirts and fit well  The only problem was that the buttons were sewn on very poorly and had to resew them after losing 2 buttons on the red shirt.
4.0,Looks as advertised can come apart of handle incorrectly
4.0,Size was smaller than ordered. But still super cute !
4.0,Cute but a bit thin for the price paid.
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings. They‚Äôre exactly what was in the picture, and make for a nice addition to an emo/goth/punk style. My only complaint is that some of the earrings are a little small and don‚Äôt fit over my earlobe very well. They seem like they were more designed for children to wear. Still, the ones that do fit look great and I love that they are lightweight and aren‚Äôt too heavy on your ears."
4.0,"A little lighter weight than expected. That being said, it fit my wife just fine and looks good."
4.0,"Pros: Perfect for events commemorating armed service members, comfortable, soft, fit as expected (I wear medium sized shirts)<br />Cons: Color is not as vibrant as illustrated in the product image, I would guess it's about 2-3 shades less<br /><br />I wore this to a funeral that was honoring a CMSGT in the USAF. The theme of the funeral was red, white and blue so I found this tie and decided to order it immediately since the funeral was taking place in less than a week. It fit perfectly the first time and matched the navy blue suit I wore. Highly recommend this tie, but as I said, just don't expect the colors to be as vibrant as the one shown - however it is a very beautiful tie that I would 100% wear again."
4.0,"Perfect fall color and so comfortable, especially for how cheap it was!"
4.0,"nice, I'm sure my step daughter will love them!"
4.0,Good quality material very soft and thin! Size down
4.0,This pendant I classify as the best for casual wear.  I wear on the weekends or out & about but isn't not suited for my work or my going out events
4.0,Heavy and clunky but pretty decent quality
4.0,very nice i would recommend buying it.
4.0,"Beautiful dress and very well made! It's on the smaller side - I ordered a L being 5'3 and 140 and it's a bit tight. The zipper is also hard to get over the one spot where the top and skirt part meets in the back. Other than that, very pretty and well made dress!!"
4.0,Perfect dress for work. You will need a slip as the fabric is fairly thin. I received a lot of compliments when I wore it to work. Great value!
4.0,"The dress was very comfortable, there was a problem with the finishing on the hem.  1/4 inch left open.  Other than that the dress was nice I would try the company again."
4.0,These do exactly what I wanted.  I could do without the non-skid bottoms.
4.0,"Lightweight shirt, great for working out, training, etc. It does have a somewhat cheap feel to it, but all of these silky type shirts do.<br />A lot of reviews say the fit is way too small but mine was fine. Just a smidgen more snug then I'm used to, but still acceptable."
4.0,"Fits well, reasonable quality.  Four star due to slightly higher hat than I prefer, but will definitely wear it frequently."
4.0,Great product and by summer these will take off
4.0,"This is much prettier in person. It's light and warm at the same time. It's very well made, and looks beautiful on. I am quite ready for this upcoming cool weather!!"
4.0,"I am a large man that has a lot of trouble retaining fluid.  These 4x fit well around the waist, but in the legs, it was tight. Therefore, I am ordering a larger pair next time.  I recommend these to anyone who isn't retaining fluid. They are super soft and no tags."
4.0,"All of the earrings were pretty and small like I was hoping but, I did not like the hump on the longer cartilage earring because it did not allow the earring to lay as flat as possible and caused it to swing freely and move around."
4.0,"These seem like good quality, but they do run very small."
4.0,"Cute, worked well for my first experience riding at a dude ranch. The price was great!"
4.0,I don‚Äôt like how the smiley faces rub off. I wish it would stay on for longer. Still cute though.
4.0,El estampado en algunas partes no se ve
4.0,I like these. Wish they made a size twice as large.
4.0,Good quality but way too small (and I did measure based on the guide). It also was delivered much faster than amazon said it would be initially.
4.0,"This Camisole was advertised with a little type of light bra inside! Really!!!<br />There is not any type of of bra, or something to hold you up a bit.<br /><br />The fit is tighter then what I expected, holds you in a bit,  the material is thick, which is nice, and this comes down long.<br />There is not any adjustment on the spaghetti straps, which I do not need one for now. But I‚Äôm thinking<br />when this starts to stretch out it might be needed !<br /><br />I wear a size 10, and my daughter is 5‚Äô9, wears a 4, 7, and this fits her nicer then me.."
4.0,"I broke a buckle on my backpack, so I decided to go with something a little more rugged and simple. These G Hooks were perfect. The only drawback is it took forever to receive them. I honestly almost forgot about ordering them. Ordered the G hooks on 7/29 and I did not receive them until 9/8. They shipped directly from China, so I guess that is to be expected."
4.0,"The earrings were a lot smaller and thinner than I expected, but they are nice. They are about a 1/4"" from top to bottom. The studs are also shorter, so if you have thick ears, you may find them hard to keep on. However, they would be fine for a child or teenager."
4.0,Fits well!! Thick and comfy!!
4.0,I ordered this for shoulder surgery comfy but buttons are actually pretty hard to snap without a little help ...
4.0,I really like it not sure if it should be a dress or shirt because It looks better as a shirt to me but overall I love the color and material
4.0,"Very pretty. Slight smaller than I expected based on the picture, but still a good size. It would be helpful to show them on a real person, so it's easier to understand the proportions."
4.0,I love this polo but it turned out to be too tight on me.
4.0,"It cuts into the thighs at the point the fabric connects the mesh. But overall, very lovely and well-made."
4.0,"I wasn‚Äôt expecting much when I purchased these because the price was so cheap but when they arrived I was so shocked. They are really nice. They are slightly thinner than my other silicone bands but it‚Äôs not noticeable. They fit my watch perfectly and the material is soft, pliable and very comfortable. Best buy yet!"
4.0,Just as pictured the only thing I would of liked different was longer straps.
4.0,"I bought two of these dresses, one in black and the other in ‚Äúteal.‚Äù The dresses fit as expected and are indeed a t-shirt like material. They‚Äôre extremely comfortable and I may even order more! HOWEVER! The ‚Äúteal‚Äù dress is not teal as pictured. I‚Äôd call it more of a seafoam green. There are some reviews stating it‚Äôs shorter than the original Nesting Olive. I don‚Äôt own one to compare but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, a very medium everything in build, and it comes past my knees by a couple inches."
4.0,My 4 year old daughter loves these unicorns and that's all that matters.....they'll fit a while. Purple & pink :)
4.0,"I bought these for my little sister and although they look very simple and stylish, it was a incredibly hard for her to put it on herself. Trying to pin the hole in place to secure the earring is very hard, as it is very small."
4.0,Jacket is nice but size runs small
4.0,A bit thin but very nice and comfortable
4.0,"I bought 2 pairs of these shorts 2 months ago (April 2017), 3rd time through the wash both pairs had rips under the rear pocket and the seam on the top rear pocket was also showing a hole, for the time I was able to wear them they were a great fit at the waist and didn't irritate the scars I have on both knees from Total Knee Replacement, overall very comfortable but now they're in the trash.<br />  Update as of July 2017, got an email from the company representative stating that they knew exactly what the problem was and they had taken steps at the factory to correct the problem, they sent me another pair and hopefully the problem is resolved, don't want to stand in front of the washer and dryer to run them through a couple of times, but the response from the company was good, I had bought another pair from a different distributor, same manufacturer, same problem, I wrote a review on their site and I am not going to hold my breath waiting for an answer from them.<br />  As I've said before they fit great, I am 6'6&#34; and still recovering from two TKR's, the shorts are more than long enough, when I sit the bottoms don't cut into my legs, I'm going to go ahead and order a few more pairs and hope that the factory problem has really been solved."
4.0,Recipient pleased with gift
4.0,"The robes are soft, medium thickness, nicely designed, and great for wearing outside if you‚Äôre heading to/from the spa on a chilly night. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù and 190 lbs. - the large is, as expected, great fit around shoulders and torso, goes a little below my knees, but is short on the arms.. say a few inches above my wrists with my arms hanging down (not a big deal for me).<br /><br />The 2-star rating is because of shipping delays. I ordered a total of 10 of these robes (gifts for the guys going on my bachelor party trip). As of right now, I‚Äôm waiting on 6 out of 10 to arrive, 3 days after the projected prime delivery date. As far as I can tell, no attempts were made to deliver that parcel so far. Will update rating upon company rectifying this problem.<br /><br />EDIT: the delivery problem was due to Amazon's logistic team, not the retailer. Updated my rating to 4 stars."
4.0,"This is a beautiful watch. It looks high quality and it wears well. It‚Äôs the kind of watch that If you take care of it, it can last for years"
4.0,"Looks good, but man it stinks. Going to air it out, but stinks bad.."
4.0,The straps are kinda cheap but it gives the amount of coverage I need and honestly for a girdle it‚Äôs really comfortable. I paid $80 for my last one and it wasn‚Äôt even as good as this one. I‚Äôm about to order another one to have extRa straps
4.0,I like these cloths to clean my silver jewelry.
4.0,"It's an adorable belt, looks it gets 5 stars! My only complaint is the way the buckle is makes it a little harder to buckle,  it takes a little more work. But I love the belt, it is worth the additional time."
4.0,Looks great and a great size but material is a little itchy for sensitive skin. Very warm though for those polar vortex days lol!
4.0,"Was able to get the expected fit using the chart and description. They are very comfortable for my daughter to wear. The insoles inside stay in place, which was an issue for us with similar styled shoes. The material got a little worn around the toes, but no holes or anything that makes them unwearable. They held up at the beach and pool. Would definitely purchase again."
4.0,Great T-shirt. Image was fine and it didn‚Äôt shrink up after washing.
4.0,More of a Blurpul than dark blue
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 122# and measurements are 34D/32DD-32 waist, 38 hips and ordered a medium. The thick wide waistband is awesome! After 3 kids, cancer, chemo, weight gain from all that and weight loss I have a bit of loose skin and smallish love handles and these shorts hide it when pulled up all the way. My only issue is I expected the shorts to be tight and they aren‚Äôt. Small bathing suits are always a bit tight and medium usually fits fine. These fit against my skin but not tight in the least. Just tight enough to not fall off if I were to jump in a pool but not tight enough to hold any fat on except under the waist band. They feel nice, are thicker than cheap shorts which is nice but not exactly top quality either. A good mid range pair of swim shorts in my opinion."
4.0,"The look and feel with my Panerai is great.  I couldn't be happier.  The band isn't as thick as some others, but it is comfortable and it's easily adjustable.  This band did not come with the tubes that other Panerai specific straps come with.  The stems that come with it will not fit a Panerai they are too thin and not long enough.  You'll need to use ones that come with the other bands you have."
4.0,Good necklace for the price.
4.0,Gorgeous dress but it runs small.
4.0,I got these because the leopard print is so cute! After putting them on I realized that they don‚Äôt have as much compression as I like for working out. Only returned them because they were a little bigger and to see if the smaller size (size S) would give me the compression I was looking for but for activity around the house they are super comfy.
4.0,"Looks really cute when you wear it.  The fabric feels like a silky polyester, and is comfortable around the face.  it also has adjustable ear loops, which I really like.  The mask does run big, so if you have a small face, this will fit under your chin.  IMO, the pocket and the filter are pretty useless - since the mask is big there are lots of little side gaps through which the air flows in.  If you have a bigger face, and the mask fits tighter on your face, the filter might work OK for you.  Regardless of the filter, the mask does have 2 layers, so it meets basic safety criteria."
4.0,"The material is soft and as far as sizing, I went with the chart and only found the fit to be a little loose (I cautioned and went larger bc of the reviews). Normally I wear a size small so if I order again, I'd size up to just a large. XL was fine around the breast area, but lots of room oin the waist."
4.0,"Runs large, shapeless"
4.0,"This maxi has an easy style that's ideal for transitional weather. The fabric is lightweight and has a hint of stretch. The buttons up the front are functional. If you're a larger cup size, there may be gaps. I found the fit to run small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Great gloves but thin. Great price. Good for show (costume) or driving. Not for work. Took 3 weeks to get because they shipped directly from china. If you have small hands they will fit loose. My Daughter likes them.
4.0,The necklace is lovely. The only downfall is it was smaller then I had expected
4.0,Not a fan of the white liner for the outfit wish they would have went with another color fabric to pipe the too
4.0,I love the fit it was what I expected here is a few pictures it can be dress up or down.
4.0,"These are perfect for the price! I love that my infant can't kick them off!! They arrived early I bought 3 pairs! (Pink,purple,coffee) true to color and size! I will definitely order again soon."
4.0,"These are really classy looking sunglasses that won't make your wallet cry if you lose it! What's awesome about these sunglasses is that it's polarized. It also comes in a great gift box and bag, so you're ready to give it away as a gift! It's definitely very affordable and works great in the sun! I would definitely buy this if I needed a pair of sunglasses to wear as a beater but still works great as it's designed for! It's a great gift to give! My only complaint is that the lens itself is a bit thin. However, I can live with it!<br /><br />*NOTE: This product was offered to me for free/at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"Sometimes these straight shirt dresses widen a bit for hips but this is cut straight. While it fits, it makes the top feel large on me."
4.0,So cute. Runs a tad large.
4.0,THE PRODUCT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED.
4.0,"this dress is AMAZING quality for the price. dresses like this usually cost upwards of $100- this only cost 20!! it is not the most tailored dress, but it's nothing that you can't fix. it runs a little large, so maybe order a size down. overall a really cute dress!!"
4.0,"They were the right size for my hands but when I put them on of the first time the stitching on the right hand started to unravel.  After stitching it back up, the gloves work great, thank you so much."
4.0,Fit daughter perfectly.
4.0,Perfect except for invoice!
4.0,Lovely. Pictures don't do justice. Light but not flimsy. Nice believable size. Nice color.
4.0,A little narrow and long in the fingers but overall comfort and quality is good‚Ä¶price is also good.
4.0,"I got this for my daughter and I usually like below the knee so I got it larger, figuring it would fit one of my three girls that was in a row. It worked really well for my medium daughter, so it's long enough that if you go up a size it works well. The quality is good and it's super cute.<br /><br />My complaint is that under the arms you can honestly see into the front of her chest. The sleeves and cut around the top are just made so that it's noticeable. She's young enough that it's not critical, and she can always wear a tank top underneath, but an FYI if that matters to you. I took off a star for that."
4.0,"The paw print had a great sparkle and was super comfortable to wear in my Tragus piercing. Unfortunately in less than two weeks it unscrewed itself from a super tight screw to falling off. I managed to not lose the stem but the paw print is no where to be found. I would rebuy, but I can‚Äôt chance their products not staying tightened. :("
4.0,like the material it wicks sweat away quickly so its not visible for long periods of time.
4.0,Product was not what picture entailed...had no loop as indicated...wasted money
4.0,The customer service was great. They replaced a faulty battery with a brand new pair of gloves. Can‚Äôt beat that.
4.0,This pair of glasses was purchased to use in the car so that I can see in the distance and dashboard instrumentation.  Anytime I'm outdoors I use them to read garden products directions. I've had so many compliments of these.  They fit so well and the bifocal is perfectly placed for reading.  Love these.
4.0,"Very cute comfy socks, I like the fact that even if it shows out of the shoe a bit it's still kinda cute... such a shame that they are so thin, one of them already has a little hole in it :-("
4.0,"Love it. Soft and comfy. I bought my normal size and it fit perfect. But it did shrink once I washed it. Still fits because it stretches, but I would have liked the sleeves to stay long. Now they stop at my wrists."
4.0,It‚Äôs looks and feels great. It‚Äôs jot to tight where it shows every flaw or your bra strap bumps. I gave it a 4 because I thought I was getting a 3/4 sleeve dress and got a capped sleeve dress.<br />Even though it was a mix up I have to say that the dress sits so well on the body that the cap sleeve covers that stupid arm fat where your bra sits so I decided to keep it. I recommend anyone who struggles with Brady issues like arms back fat or anything else is women may not pick about our selfs try it. You will be surprise I know I was
4.0,"Bought this dress for a Harry Pottery Yule Ball (Slytherin Gal here). Got the custom fit- Dress came SUPER QUICKLY- PLENTY of time to get it taken in a bit. I always get nervous about ordering these things so I anticipate that I'll be needing alterations- there won't be a ton!<br /><br />Sequin fabrics are notoriously heavy weight but this is very light and not scratchy under the arms at all! Very comfortable dress.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5:<br /><br />It is shorter than I'd like; they didn't take into account the heel height I sent them, I'll be searching for new shoes.<br />There is an odd odor to the fabric that will eventually be cleaned out, yes, but it's still...sort of gross.<br /><br />Other than that it's perfect!"
4.0,"I like these as a replacement for my wedding ring at work. They are thin, but that's the point. They work great stacked, the colors are as shows-the pink is sheer though. The size works well too because my fingers are a little chubby, size 8, and they don't dig in like the thinker silicone rings."
4.0,Hot works great
4.0,"seems like decent stitching, cute dress."
4.0,"For a petite, the length work perfectly.<br />I got the white dots on navy.<br />It‚Äôs a lovely dress.<br />34C/D fit well in size medium."
4.0,Had this shirt for awhile now. Has washed well and hasn‚Äôt faded or piled. Colors are beautiful actually. Fits as expected with the exception of where the sleeve meets the shirt. Unexpectedly snug. Fabric is nice flannel. No stretch.
4.0,Very good quality but runs waaaay too small. I'm solid M and was able to put it on only on one leg... had to return it
4.0,The skull never is gonna visible as full detail unless u have a HULK neck or really fat neck ..but looks amazing for sure
4.0,"fit as expected, cute"
4.0,This dress is great for the price. Unfortunately it just didn‚Äôt look good on me true to larger boobs. It looked more like a trash bag. With smaller boobs I think it would hang a lot better in the places that you want it to.
4.0,Material is a bit thin IMHO.
4.0,"Nice enough, neck a bit untailored."
4.0,I bought two and they both get the job done.  I like the wide heel. I have an old one that has a small heel and it was ruining my shoes and the pressure from the springs is all in one spot.  The wide heel evens out the pressure and so the shoes do not get damaged. Good fit for my size 11‚Äôs normal width shoes. Will purchase more if I need to.
4.0,"I really liked this dress! It was great quality, and liked the color. The only thing was the waist was too high. I would‚Äôve kept it, If the waist would‚Äôve been lower."
4.0,I ordered the size 6-7 for my 5yo and the tutu skirt was a little too short for her. You definitely need to put a short under or tights. That‚Äôs the only reason im giving 4 stars. The quality is good and the color is beautiful.
4.0,FANTASTIC look and fit.  BUT in true fashion sleeves are short AND were average proportioned
4.0,"Overall happy with this purchase. I originally bought a small because it said 4-6, and I am a size 4 normally. However, I had to return those and get the medium because they came down really low in the back and showed my backside a little more than I wanted. The mediums fit only slightly better, but allowed enough coverage for me to feel comfortable in them. Once wet, these do 'bubble' like a normal bathing suit and are not skin tight like regular spandex."
4.0,"Keeps his socks on, but they are so small that they may fall victim to the sock monster in the dryer."
4.0,"These are great  , my only complaint it that the strap on the thing is a bit flimsy, or I should say, the clasp on the strap. I ended up gluing the clasp shut because it kept coming open and the purse would come off."
4.0,"For the money, this is a great scarf.  But beware it's not as long as it looks in the online picture, or I would have rated it higher."
4.0,It was kind of confusing to get on at first but besides that it was fine. I would suggest to wear something thin but warm underneath it just incase you get cold.
4.0,"Nice thin socks, but are a bit small."
4.0,"Great for GYM ,  Shower and Jaccuzi<br />Where you expect it to get WET.<br />But NOT , a walk around Slipper outside.<br /><br />Does not even come close to my walk around Island Slippers brand.<br />In Hawaii , we wear a LOT of Slippers. (that's Flip Flops to you)  :)"
4.0,The material was soft and the dress was comfy.
4.0,It's perfect for people who wants to travel light but come home with more stuff.  The materials and the make exceeded my expectations.
4.0,Didn't receive black choker but two grey ones. Pretty upset since that's the main one I wanted.
4.0,"My boyfriend is 6'2"" and 225 lbs.  He generally wears a size XL or L in t-shirts and pants are 36"" or 38"" with 32"" or 33"" inseam.  The 3XL is tight on him, but it's a tad stretchy, so he'll make it work and keep it anyway.  The material is very light, and it's a good style.  I'm on the fence still as to whether or not it's worth it.  But he likes it."
4.0,Nice beach shoe.  Found it to be a size too big
4.0,"My only complaint, there wasn't an option for a yellow shirt. The closest I could get was orange. Having said that, the orange shirt looks and feels great, if not totally accurate."
4.0,"I really love this bag, very cute for special occasions!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a belly shirt unlike the photos. It stops above the belly button in the front and goes wide. Not flattering on short girls.
4.0,Item keeps shirt in place well however the belt ripped at a whole only 2 months of use! Does not hold up to repeated use very well. Cheap enough that not a huge deal but wish it lasted longer.
4.0,"Love this top!  Fits great in size and length.  It's hand wash only, but I've washed it in the washing machine and just line dry it and stays just fine."
4.0,I usually wear ‚ÄúL‚Äù but this shirt was too big for me. The material is great so I will be purchasing a smaller size.
4.0,Wished bag was a bit larger. Worked great at Metlife stadium for concert and Prudential center for concert.  Very sturdy.  Had to downsize what to bring because bag was not as wide as expected. Overall nice though.
4.0,"Very comfortable! However, very form fitting. If you like a looser fit, order a size up. I was skeptical when I opened the package, but when i put them on, they stretched very nicely."
4.0,"It was a bit more snug than I expected, but its okay. I still love the design."
4.0,"I was so excited to order this suit at such a great price! The color watermelon was very complimentary to my summer tanned skin. Sadly the size 10 which was my recommended size barely contained my 38D bustline. I did have to pull this suit up with vigor to get it on but enjoyed how it contained my little poufs of belly. I returned it and attempted to order a size 12, hoping it would fit my bustline but it was unavailable. I ordered a size 14 and it fit my bust but I wouldve needed the straps, the body part was too loose especially for my backside. For reference I am 5'4"" and 145 lbs. Sadly this size 14 will need to be returned and I will keep the Ann Cole bandeau suit I ordered, in a bright deep pink that fits so much better, has great top support without needing the straps."
4.0,They're not just for Christmas they are Winter mittens! üëç‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,"This dress was beautiful... I was wanting something sexy but classy to wear to a wedding.  It does both of that.  I did have to exchange it for a smaller size, it does run a little big in the bust area. so that' why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I'll post pics when I get the new size. :)"
4.0,I love it!! Very soft and comfortable!!!
4.0,Good hoops. Not heavy which is great. The only reason I have it 4 stars is one of the clasp broke off the first time I was putting on the silver hoops. I can still wear them I just use a different back. All the others were fine.
4.0,"Good quality and color, only wish the bracelet was a little wider and chunkier."
4.0,"Just like the title says, the 9-ball keeps them super tight and is just great, the 8-ball on is a little underwhelming. It leaves a bit of space in between some of the balls. It's still a decent rack, just not 'magic'."
4.0,"Working at a school , I like to wear a Tee that goes with the event we are celebrating. The Tee worked perfectly for Valentines day. It just ran a little big  in size."
4.0,These gloves are really warm even in the sub zero temp Minnesota. But it is not as snuggle fit as I expected. Other than that it is very sturdy and warm.
4.0,if I wear too long they do make my ears itch
4.0,Exactly as advertised. Not heavy and a good fit on an &#34;average&#34; wrist. Very happy!
4.0,"Cute earrings but of the ""delicate"" quality..... I bought them for a Mexico trip and in the water/pool they never tarnished or broke, but they are almost made of pure wire... so they bend/lose shape easily. When i packed them in the bag and pulled them out they were misshapen pretty badly. If that doesn't bother you and you're ok to just reshape or accommodate when needed then I would happily recommend. Overall the shop/seller was super professional and quality packaging so I will likely make other purchases."
4.0,Beautiful tunic.  A bit tight in the bust but just right every where else
4.0,The sizes need to be more clear. I ordered twice because the first pair was too small and a second pair because of the sizing confusion. Great product just a confusion in the size chart
4.0,I was very please with my purchase the belt fit as expected and the leather is a good quality
4.0,"Item as described but at first glance at the box doesn't look classy but if you try and open it and check on the watch, its heavy and feels like solid.. but it looks great.."
4.0,"I hate bras ... but this one is surprisingly comfortable. For a bra, that is ... There is some slippage, but it stays on and holds me up without the &#34;muffin top&#34; you sometimes get with a push-up. A smooth profile under fitted tops."
4.0,"Fits well, a shiny fabric that doesn't wrinkle, but then, also doesn't breathe.  Comfortable, but the pattern isn't very figure flattering.  It does wash well by hand, and doesn't require ironing.  I rolled it when packing and it was fine when I arrived.  For the money, not bad.  Most important, I'm just 5'4 so most long dresses drag, but this one comes to the ankle so is perfect."
4.0,Good quality but not all the same size
4.0,"They weren't what I thought they were but that could have been my own stupidity. It has taken a while for me to review, but I wish they had more descriptions. They weren't for my lip, which I no longer have done. However they are perfect for eyebrows and ears. Great quality and cute colors!"
4.0,"Great fit, I'm 5'9 165lbs 38b and got large, not too fitted but just right.  The foam pads are a little unnatural looking so I used ones from another bralette, the ones in the tank were a bit pointy for my smaller bust."
4.0,"Especially for the bargain price, these are fun to kick around in.  Yes, they have a pungent chemical smell to start, but it does fade over time.  I added an extra insert for support and I glued the shoelace knot since they‚Äôre decorative."
4.0,"I bought this thong to surprise my girlfriend, she mostly wear cotton thongs, but so simple and no ornaments. When she looked at it she loved the butterfly and wearing it makes her look so good! It is the perfect compliment for blue jeans."
4.0,I get so many compliments on this dress.
4.0,"I like the fit overall, just didn‚Äôt care for the quality of the seams. But I was very cute and I would buy it again. I haven‚Äôt washed it yet but hope it washes well. I wouldn‚Äôt dry on high heat just from how it feels."
4.0,Super pretty but got scratched in just a couple days.
4.0,Great ripstop hat. Its the perfect weight material to wear in 95% of situations. The only reason I took away 1 star was because I did not receive the long billed hat like I had thought I'd be receiving. That could've been my fault too though. Still a great hat I plan on keeping and using.
4.0,Great very practical and looks pretty too!
4.0,"I love the outfit but it runs way too big! I got a 6-12 month for my daughter who is in 9 month clothing to wear for Christmas. I could save this for next year, it is that big. I'd say it's more like a 18-24 month."
4.0,Super cute. Easy to sleep in. Very brassy gold.
4.0,The Nokio product looks good I only use it once so far.  The only problem so far was with the delivery
4.0,"Warm and colorful, but I wear a size 10 shoe and they are a bit small for my big feet."
4.0,Cute print. Comfortable. Had lots of compliments. Material was thin but great for the price.
4.0,Not a loose tank. An XL typically fits me loose with some room underneath. This tank fit more like a M/L than an XL. I will say the tank is made of quality material and soft. The tank shipped as expected.
4.0,Looks beautiful like picture.
4.0,"Honestly,  what do you expect for the price? Its true that it has a way too revealing neckline and is see through,  but its cute and I still plan on wearing it.  Will be good as a swimsuit cover or if you just really like to show off the goods! It arrived quickly and looks as pictured."
4.0,They are smaller than i had expected them to be. And im not sure of the quality besides being able to distinguish what the charm is supposed to be.<br />Im using them on a wind chime. But im sure if you were using them for jewelery they might turn your skin green.<br />It was better than going to Hobby Lobby or Michaels and spending a minimum of 3.99 PER CHARM. 4 stars for filling a need without breaking the bank.
4.0,"Great soft leather, everything I expected, a bit thinker than I'd hoped, but I like really thin wallets"
4.0,"Although it's still summer and long-sleeve shirts aren't in season, fall will be here soon enough and they'll be needed.  When I saw this nice blue shirt among the Vine offerings, in my size (medium) I ordered it.  It arrived within a few days.  As shown on the product page, it is a sharp, medium-blue color, with white 'chain' stitching.  The shirt is 100% cotton, which I prefer.  It's very soft and comfortable against the skin; the body fits me well, as does the neck.  It's a good choice to wear with khakis, allowing a 'nice casual' look.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I noticed that cause me to deduct one star.  First, as seems to be the case with medium-sized shirts these days, particularly those produced in Asia (this was made in China), the sleeves are too long.  I wear a medium with 32&#34; sleeves (as one would buy with a dress shirt), but the sleeves on this shirt are more like 34&#34;.  Fortunately, the sleeves have two buttons so the inner button can be used to ensure it won't hang over your wrists, although that leaves a bit of extra material bunched up at the sleeves.  There is only one extra button provided, many have two or more.  Lastly, the shirt showed loose threads in various areas of the stitching, unexpected from a shirt that has a 'suggested retail price' of $79.99 (!).  The tax value is less than $2.00, so that's one heck of a profit margin.  While I would purchase this shirt in other colors, it is certainly nowhere close to being worth 80 bucks.<br /><br />Bottom line is that it's attractive, colorful and comfortable, and I am happy to have it and will definitely be wearing it when the weather cools, but again, the retail price is totally unjustified, in my opinion."
4.0,I do love this jewelry holder. But it's kind of short so my necklaces don't dangle. Otherwise very elegant looking
4.0,"I love these panties. However, one of them ripped at the side seam after wearing it for one day. It's not that they don't fit. I think that one was just defective."
4.0,"Thin material...and not a lot to fold, but does the trick."
4.0,"I really like this head band! I ordered it in hopes to wear it by Halloween, but I didn't get it in enough time. That's okay, I ordered it at the last minute to be fair. I wore it on Christmas and New Year and I looked adorable! The only things I dont really like as much is that it hurts my head a little bit (not much), maybe because of the material (alloy, so its metal-ish). The ears were also a little uneven for me (one of them learns a little more forward than the other), but it isn't majorly noticeable and it may not come like this for everyone. The rhinestones in mine are all still there, but be careful because there's a chance they can come out. All in all I really love this headband! Very cute and adorable!"
4.0,This scarf is very pretty as a headband. It's very silky in texture so it may be hard to secure but add a few bobby pins and it will stay in place!
4.0,I can wear the ring on different fingers comfortably.  Each finger gives the ring a new look
4.0,"These boxes are full of nicknacks and junk but my son, nieces and nephews have a blast opening them.  I‚Äôm glad I found them on Amazon because they disappeared from the stores."
4.0,"The ""gold"" on this just doesn't look right. I will say I have received a lot of compliments while wearing it.  I like it. I want a nicer one."
4.0,"The rings are great and very flexible. They are a little larger sized than my actual ring, so when you're ordering, maybe order a half size down. I wish they came in more colors (RED!!!) These rings are excellent for working out and wearing at work."
4.0,"When I got this band I was super excited, I'm obsessed with sunflowers, I wore it for a bout a week or maybe a little longer and the bracket holding the insert part for the watch fell off. I WAS able to repair it but now I only wear this band on ""special"" occasions."
4.0,"I received two of these today and was very surprised as although I had looked at this wallet several times, I didn't remember ordering, especially two! Since I had gone ahead and ordered a different wallet, I didn't need these and I have contacted the company asking if I can return for a full refund. I do not know at this time if it will be approved or not. As far as the quality, for the price they are very nice (and I say 'they' because I inadvertently ordered not one, but two üòä ) and they have a lot of storage and places to keep personal items. I have read other reviews and I certainly do not agree with the negative comments at least based upon looking at both of these wallets. They were both made well and I can only assume the negative comments were based upon unrealistic expectations meaning perhaps they expected an $80.00 wallet for a cost of under $20.00. It is a very nice wallet for a very reasonable price."
4.0,This earring is so beautiful. But my only fault is it should really be a pair
4.0,This is super cute.  Ot is just to small.
4.0,"My husband and I have been looking for a good alternative to our metal wedding rings for those times when we don't want to wear the metal, expensive ones.  When going to the beach or pool we don't want to risk losing our rings so we usually don't wear them.  Or when my husband goes on fishing trips. There are several professions where metal wedding rings can be dangerous and these are a nice alternative! This set comes with three rings in different colors.  It's nice to have different options depending on your preference.  They were light and comfortable to wear. My husband was pleasantly surprised with how much he liked these.  They come in a nice bag for safe keeping so I know where they are when I need them!  I would have especially loved to have known about these when I was pregnant with my son and my hands swelled up too much to wear my rigid metal rings!  I'd love to see different colors or designs for more options but the color options included in this set are nice.  While I was provided with this set to test and review at a promotional price, these are my honest opinions."
4.0,Most are a good round shape. Some like to stay folded.
4.0,I‚Äôm 5-5 and a size 12. I ordered the large but would probably take a medium. It‚Äôs a cute hoodie and love the tunic length. The pinks are a little too loud for me but it‚Äôs a comfortable material and I do like it.
4.0,"If there was one that had white fur around the edges, and just a little bit heavier, but overall GREAT CAPE!"
4.0,Beautiful &amp; useful
4.0,"The lady shirt fitted as expected, whereas the guy shirt was a bit small. The fabric felt nice, even though it is a bit thin"
4.0,"The costume is very cute.<br />But, the shedding is absolutely terrible! as if I was a dog. The purple fur got all over my clothing underneath. üò©"
4.0,"A well-built slim design aluminum bumper case, but like any metal case it does take away from the cell phone signal a little bit."
4.0,"Very cute olive dress!  Thin, but not see through, long and with a good flow. I find I like wearing it with a belt. Normally wear a 6 or 8 and got a medium and it fits well. Some of the stitching was coming out a little, but overall a good deal for the price!"
4.0,"Nice, a little bigger than I expected but would rather have that than to small."
4.0,Fits good but a bit short for sitting.
4.0,"Small scarf ring. Good for a square silk scarf, not for thick cotton. Very smooth inside so no worry about pulls on fabric."
4.0,Decent everyday earrings
4.0,But freaking FRIZZY! :(
4.0,"A little tighter around the hip than I like but otherwise fits well. Looks just like picture, had lots of complements"
4.0,Nice but a little smaller than I thought it would be.
4.0,"Wash before you wear.  If not,  it gets lint all over seat, other clothes ect. But it's warm and I will enjoy wearing it."
4.0,"I ordered a size 6 for my granddaughter who wears a 5. Runs pretty small. I would suggest buying 2 sizes up...at least.  Very soft and cozy though,"
4.0,"Is very small, but I love the desing. Pretty."
4.0,"Great dress, good stretchy fabric, which was better than I expected! The dress was shorter than pictured...but then again, I‚Äôm tall."
4.0,The dress looks better &#34;on&#34; than on the picture. its fits nicely. Perfect for work office or church :-)
4.0,I bought this at a cheap price because I thought that it was cool and would fit my sense of fashion. Well it does. It looks awesome. I get LOTS of compliments when people see me wearing this.The back looks kind of scratched when I opened the package for the first time.
4.0,"Was lost in route, received refund abd was told if they arrive my kids could keep them. My babies love them a little small but nice"
4.0,Okay so the mask face part is 7 1/2 which would be too big for kids but you can make it work somehow üò©. The mask comes with 2 filters which is pretty good already and the design is somewhat good. Y‚Äôall I recommend- ü™≥üòè<br /><br />Update: you can customize the straps üòà
4.0,"As expected, arrived quickly.  Good phone case!"
4.0,"I bought this for my mom earlier in the winter and she loved it, she still uses it when she goes out running in the chilli mornings it‚Äôs a good jacket and the material so far it‚Äôs been durable."
4.0,Works great and it's cheap. Too bad the band will probably break in 2 years as all casios do. That's the price I pay for wearing it in the shower.
4.0,"Very cute. Great fit, although sleeves seem a little short, but you can pull them up a bit for a 3/4 sleeve effect."
4.0,"I love this belly button ring, but I do not recommend sleeping with it in, can get a tad uncomfortable and get stuck to your clothing."
4.0,I like the fact that it's affordable.<br />It last about 3 years before it breaks again.
4.0,"I bought these for gifts for after photo shoots, I do a little treat after every shoot. My kids love them. They took a few and they are not easy on toys so for the fact that they haven‚Äôt broken or ripped yet it says a lot."
4.0,"My daughter loved it..,"
4.0,My wife looks(and feels) WONDERFUL in them! They are certainly a beautiful accent and make her look so BOURGOISE!! I would recommend them to all of the OTHER good lookin' women out there in AMAZONLAND!
4.0,A bit smaller than expected but is cute & comfy
4.0,Great shorts. I love everything Jordan and these shorts are no different. Comfortable and fit just like they should. Look great! A+
4.0,"Very nice! Very light weight, great for a summer bash!"
4.0,"Cute sweatshirt.  Took over a month to receive, from China to Texas.  Opened the package, and the labels are peeling off around some of the edges.  Pretty sure the lettering is going to come right off in the wash.<br />UPDATE: was able to GENTLY iron the couple corners that were peeling, and they seem like they are stuck on there good, for now.  Then washed on delicate (cold) and, so far so good.  Nice sweatshirt otherwise!"
4.0,A little big they're also pretty thin
4.0,The swimsuit is very cute in the picture however the gold is a little cheap looking in person. Also I didn't realize there are cut outs in the bikini bottoms so that was a little surprising. Its cute but doesn't look like the photo to me.
4.0,These are the perfect size heel for work and go great with slacks or skirts. They are comfortable to wear for your 8 hour day.
4.0,"I really liked this dress and it was nicer quality than I expected. nice thickness of fabric, seams were well sewn. It was a very good price for the quality although it did run small so I gave it to my sister for her birthday."
4.0,"These are nice socks, cute design, but they are very snug and strongly elastic so I feel like they are cutting off the circulation in my feet somewhat."
4.0,I am in love with it
4.0,"The purse and detail are  beautiful. This is a large handbag.  I ordered the Wine red hoping the color in the picture depicted the actual product.  This is more of a true red, not a deep wine red."
4.0,I love the skirt and the fit is perfect except the zipper broke before I was even able to wear it. The zipper would not budge over the bulk of fabric between the waist and skirt.
4.0,Excellent quality is just a little hard to see through the design on the eyes.
4.0,Great quality for price. Not really high waisted comes below my belly button! Definitely a thong!!!
4.0,"Nice gloves. A little tight. Can't wash, so how do you clean?"
4.0,As described good quality. I ended up cutting the trees off though and putting on my laptop as a memento of home. No trees in our skyline :)
4.0,Took a few days to break it in but looks great.  Have received a lot of compliments on this band.
4.0,i really fell for these earings. Even in person they are really nice. They are a b-day for a friend. she loves them!!! i want to go for the necklace !!! ;}
4.0,great for my allergies for when my hands swell and I can still where a ring. Wish it had more colors to choose from.
4.0,"So, really nice and comfortable socks. Only reason for 4 stars is they slip down your calf. Otherwise, perfectly padded where you want it."
4.0,"Nice shoes, well constructed, good soles, all around a quality dance shoe for both rhythm and smooth."
4.0,"Amazing! I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews but I must say this dress was perfect. The reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the  gold division covered a bit of the front area. But HEY! It flattered my figure making me look slimmer. It wasn't much of an issue but just letting you know as it is not a 100% true to what you see on the picture. Regardless, I'm still loving this dress."
4.0,"I typically wear a large, I am 5'8, 165 lbs and ordered an XL here.  They are a little tighter than I would like but still wearable.  The color is great (Hunter Green) and the material is very nice, super soft.  It's not heavy, probably best in Spring and Fall."
4.0,Nice bright color
4.0,Not an item for every day wear it started to peel and turn pink‚Ä¶ it was an overall nice looking watch belt.
4.0,GOOD value and durable
4.0,It works if you are working out üèã
4.0,Nice for a coffee lover. It's not high quality metal and looks it. Not a horrible price. My daughter liked it a lot so I think I'll invest the $30 and get her the sterling silver one.
4.0,"a little tighter than expected, a little bit of a weird fit with the shorts underneath, but still very cute skirt"
4.0,I'm back for more so that says it all. Color runs with pink so careful.
4.0,I BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER. JUST HOPE SHE LIKKES IT. WILL SEE HER SOON.
4.0,"My wife liked hers but the side piece didn‚Äôt think it was funny at all, should have thought about this first"
4.0,"It's OK,keeping in mind quality/price"
4.0,"According to the size chart and amazon size recommendation, my usual size 9 should have fit. My foot fit on the sole, but it was WAY too tight over the arch and they were a little too narrow, so I returned them and replaced with a size 10. The 10 is a tiny bit big, which makes me wish they were available in half sizes, but they still fit well! I‚Äôve done yard work on them, ran errands, and walked my dogs with no issues. I have plantar fasciitis, and our tile floors kill my feet after a long day of cleaning. I‚Äôve gone through quite a few pairs of walking shoes/sandals with various insoles, all of which only provided temporary relief. So far, my feet are surviving my long days of errands and cleaning. My only complaint is that they‚Äôre incredibly squeaky when wet.<br />My advice is that I‚Äôd you have a high arch or wide feet, go a size up."
4.0,This is great. But unbuttons very easily. I have to use a clip to hold it together. But the material is comfortable!
4.0,"This is a great product. Nice, comfortable, and easy to put on and off without it pulling your hair."
4.0,The sellers are great. Had a snag in getting these. The seller was great to work with and we were able to get a great result. You will not be disapointed with them.
4.0,Overall I would recommend this sports bra. It did however fit larger than I expected and does not provide support for high impact workouts.
4.0,I'm plus size wearing a pants size 20 and they fit me
4.0,Pure leather
4.0,i almost sent them back because of the way they fit
4.0,"I have purchased this hat twice. The first one, I lost on the last cruise we were on ( standing on the pier and the wind took it and in the water it went. üòï) I love the way this hat looks. It looks western, but not. Holds it shape. Would have gave a 5 star, but the band on this one was a little loose. A little hot gluing and its fine. Great summer hat to have.."
4.0,"Nice, good size and good quality"
4.0,I ordered a Small and it was huge.  I usually wear a size 6 and between a Small and Medium in tops (usually a medium due to wide shoulders and D-cup chest).  The X-small would probably be slightly roomy but fit ok.
4.0,"Decent quality, the only issue I had was when I tried screwing the side rods on, they wouldn't screw all the way, so I couldn't put the horizontal bars on it, so I had to unscrew them a little so the bar will stay across, but it isn't very stable."
4.0,The fabric makes the draping a bit odd.
4.0,"I wasn't prepared for it to be that big, plus I wear a 5 so it's really huge on my hand. I was hoping it was like my ring for traveling, which it is, but mine is only a 2 carat center. I am keeping it, but I'm not very comfortable wearing it so maybe I should send it back. It is nice."
4.0,Tiny hard to get in but beautiful  so far so good
4.0,"I have several pair of these and so far they are my favorite to work out in. these particular ones run a little smaller than their long length black ones that I have 5 pairs of currently. for the price they are great. they hold you in, but not uncomfortably so, however the color  is more of  grey, not navy at all really."
4.0,Looks like pic but really short
4.0,I gave it a 4 star real nice looking and great to wear confortable wear inside and out thank you.
4.0,"The glow powder used in this is very very cheap. Doesn't glow at all really. So, I changed the glow powder to a aqua strontium aluminate europium doped powder and the glow will light up an entire room after being charged with 350nm  blacklights for 20 seconds and holds glow for over 20 hours. The cork comes out really easy so, you'll have to glue it in place once you have put your powder of choice inside the vile. The chain is old looking. Vintage like. And that's how it's suppose to look. 4 stars overall. -1 for the crappie glow powder but this is easily fixed."
4.0,"These masks are more breathable for working out, which is why I bought them. They cover more of the face, but that leaves more room under the mask. I don‚Äôt necessarily like the way they look, but I‚Äôm glad I can work out without having to move the mask to breathe. They are relatively comfortable. Recommend for moderate work outs."
4.0,bit close
4.0,Looks as pictured. Thick material. Not bad for the price
4.0,Matches my white jacket love it good for the price.
4.0,"I am very happy with my purchase.  This 10 foot 360 degree rotating umbrella is everything that the seller promised.  I have had it for 2 weeks. It has been used during high winds, rain and 99 degree midday sun. It has performed flawlessly. The base and frame are solid and are both well-constructed. The thick high quality navy canopy is elegant and totally blocks the sunlight.  The ability to rotate from one area of seating on my deck, to another area of seating, with the option to tilt extends the amount of time we are able to spend in shade.  I do not anticipate any rust or fading, since it appears to be well made.  I am confident this umbrella will stand the test of time.<br />As previously mentioned by Jim on Apr 25, 2020,  The 4-piece plastic weight set sold by wikiwiki does not work properly with their 10' offset umbrella unless spacers and longer bolts are used to attach the umbrella's rotation assembly to the cross base. I used Jim‚Äôs workaround and it works perfectly. Here is how Jim did it: (thank you so much Jim!)<br /><br />‚ÄúAdequate clearance between the foot lever bracket and weight can be achieved by using a stack of 15 stainless steel 1mm thick M8 flat washers as spacers between the rotation assembly and the cross base at each of the four attachment points. Doing this requires using longer M8 x 35mm stainless steel hex socket head cap screws at each of the four attachment points instead of the four M8 x 20mm screws that came with the umbrella. I wrapped each of the four stacks of 15 flat washers with clear tape to hold them together before setting them on the cross base and then reattaching the rotation assembly to the cross base. The modification required using the wrench that came with the umbrella and took about 10 minutes. I purchased both the M8 x 35mm screws and M8 flat washers needed for this modification here on Amazon.‚Äù<br /><br />Overall, I feel that it is a great value for the price. I would buy it again, and would recommend it to a friend."
4.0,"Fit overall, but the sleeves weren't as tight as I expected. Still, works for a casual/business/club shirt depending on how you work it. Good buy."
4.0,These are cute earrings that are beautifully dyed.  They are as pictured with two types of feathers along with colored beading.
4.0,This is an amazing belt. It's heavy and very detailed.  The etching is one of a kind. Love this title!!  WWE did a great job on this one!!!
4.0,"Very pretty, runs small"
4.0,"I am going to call this a tunic. I am 5'8"" and this barely covered my bottom and would be a problem walking, sitting or bending over. I am a curvier person and this is a nice outfit when you don't want to wear something tight all the time. I usually wear size 10 to 12 in pants, 36 C bust. I purchased the large and it was true to size. The garment is very cute and looks great with leggings or skinny Jeans. The color and design match the description and photo."
4.0,Shoes are very comfortable. The only problem is the strap buckle hits at my ankle bone and created a sore.
4.0,Nice and silky very elegant
4.0,Fits my swollen wrist and other wrist.  I am a stroke survivor. I can't handle any kind of latch. This is easy.system for me to put and take off. I don't<br /> Like it not being waterproof. Other than that a good buy.
4.0,"I love these inexpensive Casio watches. They work great and last forever. Not sure if it‚Äôs the particular watch I got, or all the watches of this type, but it seems to lose a second a day."
4.0,"as advertised....good fit, good feel."
4.0,"It's not as wide as I thought it would be, but it works. The color is nice and the buckle holds well."
4.0,Wish there was more compression.
4.0,a lot smaller than i thought but came exactly as pictured
4.0,Had to tie the scarf at the bottom so it wouldn't fall off or move.
4.0,Its super Pretty!
4.0,"Was able to put my shoes, bathing suits, and clothes for the next day all separate. Was also able to keep clean clothes from the dirty"
4.0,"This watch band looks fantastic on my diver.  The red stitching really pops!  The silicone material is very pleasant to the touch, although it wants to always be straight, and likely will never conform to the wrist.  Not a real big deal.  My only complaint is the buckle.  It doe not have the needed shape to properly conform to the band and lay flat enough.  For the price, I understand the low level of sophistication in this buckle, but I would gladly pay more for a better buckle.  The band just looks so good though."
4.0,I bought it for my birthday and literally loved it. The emerald charm feel off out of now where and I‚Äôm extremely sad and now the bracelet is turning but that‚Äôs because I wear a lot of body oils. Everyone thinks they are Alex & Ani. This is worth the buy though
4.0,Husband likes the watch band but the pins that came with this did not fit his 42mm Galaxy watch so he had to take the pins out of the original band and put in this. So far it seems like it will be a good purchase.
4.0,"My toddler is about a 6 1/2 to 7 . I ordered her a 7 it's a little Loose but I will but a thick sock on with it. They appear comfy. And the light work , and she loves the lights!"
4.0,"Got them for my bowling competition, Alley Katz the l material is good quality just wish they were a little bigger, they almost loom like devil horns"
4.0,I'm not saying it will make your Gotchya water proof. But i just accidentally put mine through the washer twice and it wouldn't have survived if it wasn't in this silicone holder.
4.0,"Great variety but good repitition in gears. There are a few very large ones and a few very small gears, but a ton of medium sized gears. Some gears were a little rusted but they were only 16 out of the whole batch which I think is pretty great. Great value for the price!"
4.0,Looks awesome and fits well. Tint is very dark so careful when wearing indoors
4.0,"The length was perfect, especially since I‚Äôm so short. Loved the train. Got tons of complements"
4.0,"I am allergic to metal and was looking for decent plastic earrings that can help me keep my piercings open. Totally willing to spend $9 on this set, and after a few weeks I would describe it as $9 well spent. I would not have described it as $20 well spent.<br /><br />They are exactly what you expect for $9. None of mine has broken or fallen apart, and I am able to wear them without the metal reaction, so I have to say I'm satisfied. But I feel limited to the darker colors (there are several sizes of black and cobalt blue choices) because the brighter ones that attract more attention look a bit ridiculous, in my opinion. They are not fooling anyone that they were even $9 each."
4.0,Nice looking cufflinks. Just a little smaller than I thought  they'd  be.
4.0,"I'm 5'5""  and wear a 16/18. I ordered a XXL. The weight and quality are good . I like the pockets.  I COULD have gone down a size to XL. I will reorder in other prints. Though,  it IS a bit long on me... I may have to hem it a little."
4.0,The flag and the emblem are in vivid colors.
4.0,"They are comfortable. Lightweight, and cover most of my periphery. I use them at work, I am a nurse in the middle of this covid crisis. I use them to protect my eyes. I cannot wear glasses underneath them, and goggles are more protective (but I can‚Äôt tolerate them for 13 hour shifts). These glasses work, just make sure that you purchase the correct lenses. I thought I purchased the fully transparent lenses, but accidentally purchased the tinted lenses. I tried to write the company and ask for maybe replacement lenses, but I‚Äôm unable to replace just the lenses."
4.0,Personally i would give it 3 1/2 stars. It fits tight around the lower leg area and there's no loops for you to put on a belt other than that it can pass off in the office.
4.0,Super comfortable and fits just as I needed it to. Great product!
4.0,Product came in just a few days and was just like the image above.
4.0,"Not sure of the origin of the tennis bracelet...but they were a big hit in the 80's and apparently are considered vintage. I was too cool for a tennis bracelet in the 80's and as my teens would attest, I am no longer cool. I am looking for a vintage piece, but in the meanwhile gave into the temptation of this bracelet for the price, for the small 2mm settings, and for the 6.5 length offering. The length is a rare offering anywhere. Usually, I have to have links removed. Concerned about a prior review that reported some twisting and several that reported missing stones after little wear, I considered the price, and the fact it could be returned and went for it. Mine, when laid out straight is straight. The clasps is not easy to work, but is very secure. All stones present and secure. They are small, but I like this. If a stone jumps ship,the clasp breaks ,or it does not hold up to careful wear, I will promptly say so."
4.0,"I love this ring! It did arrive with the zipper tag bent (which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars) but I easily fixed that with some flat pliers. That said, it's well-crafted and detailed while still looking and feeling light. Jewelry that's both punk and delicate is SO hard to find, and the fact that this ring is handmade out of sterling silver and ONLY $20 dollars is just too good to pass up!"
4.0,"The glasses work great and the power is spot on.  I thought the glass was a little larger but it is narrower than I thought.  It only has one case as well it would have been nice to have a case for each set,  Not a big deal."
4.0,"It is nice soft silicone.  Pink is nice and bright.  The strap is much longer than original Garmin strap for medium size, but the little loop that holds the tail of the strap slides to accommodate all the extra length easily.  As you can see at the left side of the photo, the strap wraps all the way around my wrist.  Buckle is silver metal.  Hopefully, there's not a lot of nickel or copper in that metal.  If so, I'll get a nasty rash from nickel and copper will tarnish fast.  Too soon to tell."
4.0,"I think it is a cute pin, just smaller than I thought it would be."
4.0,Bought as present very nice and gift bag and stuff nice too
4.0,The colors were bright and the material is comfortable. The colors did not fade away after multiple washes.
4.0,Stylish but a little bit too bug for me. I received this item for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,"Belt is very nice, and it was delivered to me right on time!"
4.0,Smaller than I thought but I like it.
4.0,Very cute for Christmas morning in the house in FL
4.0,Great product for the money. Pants aren‚Äôt the best quality denim.
4.0,Little bigger than I expected but it is still nice...just wished it fit better...
4.0,Fits like a medium small. Absolutely love the print
4.0,"Looks good, just not a fan of the fit."
4.0,Very simply but elegant bracelet! It stands out on your wrist! The only criticisim I might have is you need to slightly bend it because it doesnt stay clipped that well.
4.0,Nice bag. Just the right size for me. I don't like a tote bag but need it big enough to fit a book and any electronic device I take with me. The color is a bright tan with a slight orangish tint. Material is soft.
4.0,The item is as described and fit as expected. It is soft and comfy.
4.0,"Color is lovely and design is pretty cute overall. It did run a bit smaller than expected though. I anticipated some tightness in the bust area due to my bra size, but there‚Äôs no way the hip measurements are accurate. Just keep that in mind! But it is cute as can be."
4.0,Took a long time to arrive but like the material.
4.0,"Very nice top.  Material was a bit thinner than expected, but nice fit overall."
4.0,"I ordered newborn. The outfit just now fits my two month old, and he is a larger than average baby. The outfit looked huge to me at first and I put it on him today and it fit! The outfit is so cute, the value is great, and I will be using it for photos of him very soon."
4.0,Perfect and love the bright colors!
4.0,"The material is so soft, it's a really cute and comfy sweater. It just runs a little big so had to return mine for smaller size."
4.0,Nice for price! Don't expect them to last more than a couple times.
4.0,I like the selection! I wear the triangle one a lot. It ended up being my favorite. I love the bow one but have yet to get it to look right. The plain one i added some rhinestones and studs and it looks better. It waa a good deal and they haven't broke yet!
4.0,"I gave this dress 4 stars even though the dress did not fit me. I am so sad to be sending it back. It is a beautiful dress. I read another reviewer's remarks about the quality, and she was absolutely correct! This is like something you would find in an upscale store. The material quality is beautiful and the dress comes ready to wear unlike other dresses I saw in pictures that were wrinkly and cheap looking. I must be short waisted. I have problems with dresses like this fitting properly. A friend of mine tried it on thought and it fit perfectly and looked beautiful.<br />The only issue was that the zipper was difficult to work and it stuck in several places. Otherwise this is a beautiful dress, well worth the price of only $30."
4.0,"For less than $2 a pair these are great for party favors or vacation. I bought these for my family as we head on vacation to a water park, for the price I won't be as mad when they leave them or break them. Fun colors!"
4.0,Good quality but slightly heavy.  Delivered right on time.
4.0,This is a great mask but a little small around the ears. I would suggest to add a strap that connects the 2 straps and can be tightened as needed.
4.0,The dress doesn't have the bodice look like it does in the photo.  Its a bit looser.  But overall I love the dress and got a lot of compliments!
4.0,Very pretty cover up and longer than I thought it would be.
4.0,I bought this as a gift for someone to use at home or on road trips.  A very nice wrap to snuggle in.
4.0,"The dress was new and exactly as pictured.  However, I do not recommend this dress for large chests."
4.0,"I have been searching for simple red earrings and these fit the bill. The color is as pictured. I've only worn the earrings twice, but they seem just fine, I was impressed with the box and the secure packaging, as well as the speedy delivery."
4.0,fits its purpose
4.0,"The 12 mm are not 12 mm, they were 11mm. Pretty annoying. But they are really well made and beautiful design"
4.0,I order for my son how 11 years old he didn't have a wallet. Put when I got this for him he love it he always put in his pocket every time he goes some where..
4.0,Great quality shirt but a bit small
4.0,I love the shirt but unfortunately it‚Äôs a little too small for me. I usually wear an extra large. The shirt said one size fit all but if you are a size large and smaller it would fit.
4.0,"Beautiful set of pajamas made nice but runs small. My daughter wears a 3T, I ordered a 4T and the top is still small. I wouldn't put these in the dryer."
4.0,Mask expands for people with bigger faces which is nice.  Very fluffy on outside. But the reindeer is not put on there really well.  Will probably fall off before end of Christmas this year..mask looks weird on face because it is big. ears were great though.
4.0,"The hook that holds the belt together at the front is a little shallow to seem very sturdy, but it hasn't popped open on me yet. A very nice, vibrant color like the images. Nice quality for the price - it seems like Allegra K's belts are the one thing they do consistently well."
4.0,"The skirt part fits fine on my 3yo the only ‚Äúbig‚Äù part is the straps that go around the shoulders, and the shirt itself is big, long sleeves and boxy type shirt. I‚Äôll have her wear it with thick leggings, and a snugger shirt, and fix the straps. Overall super cute. Got the green and the yellow for her, they both fit the same. Colors are cute and rich."
4.0,"It's a good case, but it pretty tight to put in and pull out the range finder. I wish the case could be half-inch bigger"
4.0,Nice so far. Using it for law school
4.0,This is beautiful and comfortable!<br />If you're size small you probably need to order the medium one. I am size small and ordered the small one but it's little bit tight. But other than that everything is perfect. I like how soft it is unlike other lace dress or lingirie some lace can be really spiky and makes me itchy. But this one is really good. I would recommend it to anyone. But make sure to get the right size! ‚ò∫
4.0,The belt is nice however I ordered it 2 sizes bigger thinking it would be the right size however there are not enough belt holes so I need to have some more holes put in or buy a hole punch. I can't wear it until then because it's too big. You definitely want to buy the same size belt as your pant size.
4.0,Very cute dress.  I'm looking forward to wearing it once the weather finally gets warmer.
4.0,I love how stylish these frames are. I have purchased frames in the past that have been way too big so I really like the size of the frames and how they fit on my face as well. I do find these helpful when I am working on my computer for long periods of time but they are too tight on my head and the metal temple arms make wearing them all day difficult. I am giving them 4 stars because I like how they look and I would definitely recommend them to a friend but I wish they had an option for a wide frame.
4.0,Soft and comfy and fits just right
4.0,Had to have the sleeves shortened
4.0,"The dress fits nice a tad bit large in the waist but I ordered a large. I normally wear a 10. The reason I rated it 4-stars I was a little disappointed in the material it's has a slight shine to it, the fabric is thin but not see through. I bought the red one and the color is a dark red more like a burgundy to me."
4.0,As described<br />Great value for the price
4.0,Adorable boots but tassels don't stay on
4.0,"Other than that, I like several things about this item.<br />I like the solid black look of the mask, no holes; no grill.<br />The mirror finish is very cool, and the goggles fit over both<br />of my glasses. I'm hoping the 4 pins will hold it on well.<br />It's been too warm lately to try it out, but I think I'll like it."
4.0,"I loved the first pair I got a couple of weeks ago so I ordered two more. One of them came with a pocket not sown completely closed. Still they feel nice and are nice and stretchy. I recommend the darker colors if you a are ""big"" person though."
4.0,"I wanted a comfortable bra for sleeping and these work great. A little support and no binding edges. I now have 8, and wear them every night. Wash and dryer or hang to dry and they are soft."
4.0,Great for cheaper sunglasses ..used on Sandia and ski Santa Fe for 2 years  now but don't like &#34;tortoise shell&#34; as mush as solid color.
4.0,This a good gsun glasses!<br />Looks good and durable.<br />lightweight.
4.0,Fits well and love the pockets. I am not pleased with the color. The picture makes it look light pink but it is a very bright pink.
4.0,Okay frame
4.0,The blue lapis is not as blue as pictured.
4.0,Very good for the price.  And I love pineapples.
4.0,Was a lil sketchy but it's actually nice...
4.0,"This is actually a really good mix of jewelry for different piercings, and you will most likely find what you need in a pinch in the collection. I would have liked to see a bigger size ring for a septum piercing as the rings included are on the smaller side. Otherwise this is a really good collection at a really decent price."
4.0,"Usually wear a small and this was a little snug, i wanted it to fit like the model picture- probably should‚Äôve ordered a medium to achieve that style. Hoping it doesn‚Äôt shrink more in the wash. If you‚Äôre thinking of buying order UP. Still nice, material thicker than It looks"
4.0,Good delivery time. Hat was a bit darker than I expected originally but lightened up after a round in the washing machine. Looks to be pretty durable.
4.0,I'm 5'5 around 145lbs the M fit great
4.0,"I was surprised how much I liked this dress. The red is a lot brighter than shown and the pockets are a nice touch, even though they do add some bulk. I took off one star because my dress is Polyester and not made out of Rayon, as is in the description."
4.0,"Nice graphics, but the pendant is a bit too large for my taste."
4.0,Love these go with just about anything !
4.0,"I like these shoes, will purchase again."
4.0,"I love these, but they are just a little tight.  Other then that, these are great.  I'm not 100% sure of these are polarize."
4.0,"love this bag - only drawback, strap is really long. had to take it to shoe repair shop to be shortened"
4.0,My wife like them...
4.0,Hubby liked it and preferable to purchase again
4.0,"Great strap, looks a bit cheaper then I thought but doing the job, I got it to workout with since the original silicone strap from Apple is not comfortable while sweating and stuff, recommended for those who need a workout strap"
4.0,Shorts material is much thinner then in the past. When you hold shorts up to the light you can see thru the weave pattern.  Seems like Carhartt is getting cheaper in making it's material.  I will really have to think har if I will buy another pair of shorts from them.
4.0,Absolutely unfailingly comfortable.<br />Length is short enough that I wear these to the beach. Just to the mid knee.
4.0,"The quality of the material feels great and smooth.  I have a large head (I‚Äôve been told) and while it easily stretched over it, it is a bit snug.  I also have a long beard.  The length is fine but would rather it was less restrictive."
4.0,"nice fabric soft and confy, sadly no pocket."
4.0,Very comfortable and feel so light and good for all day
4.0,"Worth the price, soft fabric and nice colors."
4.0,Belt is good quality. Doesn't seem to stay Below the pants line.
4.0,"Worked fine. Pretty simple, really."
4.0,"This is overall a pretty good purchase. The material was better than I expected. I'm really tall, so i didn't know if it would work or not, but it fits pretty decently. Just know that if you're curvy, it will stretch out the material a little more and make it a little sheer."
4.0,"I loved the fabric and it washed up very nicely. Hung it to dry. I just wish there was a little more fabric in the skirt. I purchased a Medium (8-10) which is what size I wear, and even though it fits I think I should have purchased a large."
4.0,I really like this Swimsuit it will be perfect for Spring break! I got the XL and I am a size 14 the only con was that it was very tight on my thighs and butt. I do have a bubble butt though so that was to be expected! I love that it holds in all of the extra love that i have around my belly as well! I have a somewhat smaller chest for my size 36C so the Top had some extra room but if I pull those babies up and tie it tight it was just fine!<br /><br />I would recommend but I would recommend size up if you have larger thighs and butt just so it is a little more comfortable! Otherwise I loved it!
4.0,The bag is cute pretty cheap quality but you get what you paid for and it‚Äôs cute for summer the chain is a bit larger.
4.0,"Overall the dress is good, I can wear it fairly. The only issue is, i don't know how the Allegra supervised their seamstress or factory or whatever you call it but the bias, tacking if it is whats it called with is not sewn. If you have a crack nails it will tangled bad. But since it is in the inside part, nobody will see the stuff...hope this would last long though, for the price it is too much considering it is a mini dress not a maxi. No time to return am gonna wear this coming Monday for a dedication."
4.0,material is thin the back is a little long but other than that it is okay
4.0,This is a beautiful shirt. It arrived exactly as advertised. It has a nice fitted fit. The material is a little thin for my liking. It is true to size and fits me well. Overall this is a decent top.
4.0,"Although this shirt was too large for my boyfriend who usually wears a large (I ordered a large). I can certainly attest, it does not shrink lol. It's a nice quality shirt, just larger than we expected."
4.0,"I want to tell you something. Ready? Here goes...<br /><br />I enjoy dressing up on weekends and creeping out anyone who may knock on my door. This Vampire Kigurumi does the job admirably. It is made by Sazac and as such, is high quality. It's warm and comfy and gives you an air of unbridled confidence when you wear it. You pretty much feel like the Count from Sesame Street as you lie motionless on your daybed, waiting until the midnight hour to slowly rise and eat Kraft Dinner leftovers. You also have the curious compulsion to enumerate things around the house in a vaguely Romanian accent. So that's a plus.<br /><br />Bonus: You definitely won't emit sparkles like those Twilight wieners."
4.0,Comfortable And professional
4.0,Couldn't wait to receive my dress ordered on Fri. received it Sun. Love this dress! I will be ordering another color.
4.0,Good fabric.<br />Runs small. Size up is ok.
4.0,"The earrings are cute enough, but I misunderstood and thought that the earring were rose gold-toned metal with clear rhinestones, The earrings were all rose colored (metal as well as rhinestones). Also I think they are a perfect size. They are a little on the large side but not too large that they look silly."
4.0,Very comfortable! Not to be used as anything but a lounge bra. It's loose but still holds me up. I'm a small and It's a one size fits all-
4.0,Nice fit.I just hope it holds up...
4.0,Great sunglasses! A little flimsy
4.0,"Bought it for my wife. She seems to really like it except divers license window pocket could be slightly larger to make for easier removal when paying by check at stores. Also, would be nice to have outside zippered compartment in addition to the inside one.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"Just bought and worn once so Sof satisfaction unknown. Hat is comfortable, lightweight, with a wide brim."
4.0,"I was pleased with myGarry shorts,hope to find them available in the future"
4.0,Love them. Good fabric. Bonus they have pockets
4.0,Decent quality. Perfect size for me (adult guy) 5'10
4.0,The T-shirt sure did surprise my dad for father's day;. It fit well and we were happy with the fabric! Nice product!
4.0,They do a great job of blocking up the sound but I find that 4 year old has a hard time pulling them apart to get them on his head.
4.0,The quality of the material used for this dress it is just like the one showed in Aooksmery advertisement. The size is a little small and the design of the dress is meant to be for someone thinner. I am a size large and just feel like if it provides no shape whatsoever.
4.0,So cute....very warm!  Just what I wanted.
4.0,"Really like the design of these frames. They were a little big for my face but I would have kept them had the ear hooks been better, They are at such a minor angle that they would fall off my face anytime I looked down,"
4.0,Shipping took awhile but happy with the product
4.0,"First, it‚Äôs super cute! I bought it for my 5 year old former foster daughter. The hat fit fine on her head. The apron was a good size for her (she wears a size 6 in pants and shirts). Because the strap is adjustable, it would easily fit an average size 6-7 year old, possibly 8 year old...but not sure about the hat.<br />Delivery was speedy. There is a free spatula offer after receiving it.<br />The ONLY thing I am slightly disappointed about is the thickness. It seems to be slightly see-through. This could thicken up after a trip through the washer and dryer. This is the ONLY reason I didn‚Äôt give it a full five stars. If half stars were an option I‚Äôd give it 4.5 stars.<br />*Although I had the one concern, I‚Äôd still recommend this apron and hat.  I‚Äôd also purchase it again."
4.0,This is a gift for baby shower in May. They look to be exactly as expected. Very nice quality..
4.0,"Doesn't expand much.  However overall like the size, style and color.  Will use until find another wallet that better suits my needs. Thank you"
4.0,"I love the pattern and the fabric is very silky. Enjoyed wearing them vastly in this past week. Unfortunately, when I wash them the strap broke. I am not aware of these being hand wash only. The straps on the top are very fragile and do not hold up well. The pants and the robe are wonderful."
4.0,From a guy with a big noggin....these glasses are big enough. I haven't ridden with them yet but expect better field of view and better protection from the elements when I do.
4.0,Wish the part of the scarf you tie on your head was made of silk also but it's cool I just wrap a silk scarf around my edges
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable material. you can see through the white a little so just keep that in mind if that matters to you. I bought this because I wanted something I can lounge in or cover up when receiving guests post partum. I really love the feel and it has a very classic look. As far as quality goes, it looks nice and it held up to one wash so far and my washer is kind of harsh. Not sure how long it will last, but hoping it will hold together. Seems good enough. If there is another color I like I may order another one."
4.0,Great little anklet! Great value! Thank you!
4.0,"They're comfy and made of a good material. My thighs were a bit thick so I couldn't pull them up for thigh highs, but they're cute as knees high socks."
4.0,Material is great and it is very wearable however the medium is more like a small. I would recommend going 1 size up from what you normally wear.
4.0,"The top is cute, looks just like it does on the website.  The top is relatively soft, it washes well.  In my opinion, the shirt runs small.  I normally wear a size 16 or XL.  Just to be safe (I like my tops loose), I ordered an XXL and the top is still snug across the bust.  I wouldn't order this top again."
4.0,"I like this dress, especially the pockets. Its a bit see through so I bought a slip for it. Its plenty long though, Im 5'10 an it looks great on."
4.0,A little bigger than expected but overall it is a great shirt
4.0,"Updated: wrong size initially received but the seller exchanged quickly and we are very happy with the item.  If correct item had been sent, or if exchange was a bit faster (this took a long time to sort and get), would have been a 5-star review.<br /><br />The shorts are great!"
4.0,My son love it thinking about buying another one for my other son
4.0,"The yukata has a beautiful print, but is very thin. The price is right for the set and it was very convenient to purchase. The colors are strong and bold. The quality of the fabric on the yukata isn't great, but the obi is very nice. For the price, it is very appropriate."
4.0,Most were pretty but four were missing crystals.
4.0,"I like it, it was everything I thought it would be. It really made a difference with my arms."
4.0,"Work well, but a bit too big."
4.0,is kind of small in the chest area
4.0,"I bought this choker because I thought it was cute. I have a petite neck but this fit just fine on the smallest setting. To note - the chain does not go through the side hoops. It's two separate chain pieces which I didn't expect. I had liked the idea of it being able to pull tight, but this is not at all the case. Otherwise, quality is perfectly fine. Looks really cute and I like wearing it."
4.0,These are pretty cute.
4.0,"BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE! I LOVE IT! The necklace arrived before 13th October, that is, 19th September so I'm thrilled and happy to receive it earlier! :)"
4.0,The fabric is comfortable
4.0,Great for wearing in cool or cold weather.  A little long for me but I am short and not surprised.
4.0,a little tight around the ankles
4.0,It was ripped when I got it but I needed it the next day so I couldn‚Äôt send it back. Other than that it was exactly what I needed.
4.0,Nothing.  Very pretty
4.0,The material is nice and comfortable
4.0,Thinner than I would like
4.0,"while this shoe was pretty, it was not true to size, it was a little to wide and the toes too cramped.  I had to send them back."
4.0,Bought this dress to wear to a family daytime wedding. Love the fit and the color. Got several compliments on the dress and it's colors.
4.0,These fit nice with the nose clasp and bottom chin flap but they‚Äôre a bit too thick. Good for a barrier to and from germs I guess which is the main point.
4.0,very good. it is fit as expected
4.0,I'm still on the fence with this dress because it is very large and flowy.  I feel very comfortable in it because it doesn't cling to problem areas and will be cool on hot days... I like the cut of the dress- I just can't decide if it is flattering or makes me look bigger than I am....
4.0,Sooo cute! Its perfect for a nice day out side and shipping is fast.
4.0,My son loves this hat. He wore everyday at Lego Land.
4.0,I love these kaftans. They are great while you are sitting around the pool after swimming. Or over a comfortable pair of pants. These are very attractive.
4.0,Go to the hardware store and buy extra o-rings. You‚Äôll need them
4.0,"I got this buckle with the hope of replacing another buckle. I am not disappointed with this buckle, the design looks good."
4.0,It could be a little better quality fabric craftmanship is good
4.0,"Like this dress, truly form fitting and the material is comfortable. Plan on wearing to a wedding, my husband even liked it, that‚Äôs always a win!!"
4.0,The outfit is really cute. I got the biggest size since the reviews said it ran small. The joggers fit really nice and I like the material it's not thick but it's not paper thin either. The jacket is like a cheap sweater like jacket but it's cute I don't think I'd be able to button it up if it go chilly or anything but it would be a nice outfit for a warmer day out
4.0,Order up a size or 2
4.0,"Very tiny horseshoe septum ring, if you‚Äôre looking for a visible horseshoe than this isn‚Äôt it"
4.0,"Super cute and perfect length. They‚Äôre not tight on me either which is nice. I‚Äôll probably have to wear a belt though, but that‚Äôs fine."
4.0,Nice shoes. I ordered on the larger size - I wear 7 1/2 or 8 so I ordered an 8 which fits perfectly. They are comfortable enough to wear all day at work with business attire.
4.0,"Good quality, nice pattern, nice fit"
4.0,"Very cute suit. The skirt fits fine but the top is a bit large on me. I wish there was an option to pick different sizes for each piece. I have a pear-shaped body (a bit of a butt, but no bust or tummy) and it makes finding the perfect suit difficult."
4.0,Love these work with all my boot and like the variety of colors
4.0,very pretty but a little smaller than I expected
4.0,Lots of room holds laptop and accessories. Like the interior zip pockets. The included shoulder strap is convenient. It looks appealing as well.
4.0,These look soooo real.  I was glad I found some that were 2k each ear.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I wish the backs were screw on or something that I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about losing one.
4.0,This robe is soft and comfortable!  It is a bit warm for this time of year however when cooler days arrive it would be perfect!  Please with purchase!
4.0,Really cute bag...love the rainbow zipper but it does mess up from time to time when zipping it.  It wasn't expensive and is perfect for what I use it for but I don't think it would last long if I used more than once every two week or so.  So cute though!
4.0,"I got a large top and bottom. I am a 32C and the top took about 5-6 minutes to get over my chest and I was out of breath with bright red skin afterwards. While wearing it though, it was really comfortable! Overall I love the swimsuit and I got sooo many compliments on it and the bottoms fit just fine and I'm a size 10. However, getting that too on and off was seriously such a work out that I would recommend that if you're not a B or less to go a size up in the top and get the bottoms altered."
4.0,"They're so pretty! I'm concerned about the clasp though...I had to bend one of the backs, because it was loose and wasn't locking. Very beautiful!"
4.0,"Love this group and the shirt fits well. It is very comfortable and breathable but I do see it wearing off the logo after time so I wouldnt wash it too much because the ink will start showing cracks like my 2 pac shirt I purchased awhile back did,"
4.0,"This hat is well-made and should last a while. It has more of a slouchy look than the pictures here display, but they're not too far off. It looks a little more casual, in other words.<br /><br />It runs a little on the small side, so if you have a big noggin, you might find this hat to be a squeeze. Not a bad price, but not a steal, either.<br /><br />Overall, a nice hat with a nice look for a reasonably nice price."
4.0,"I really like the look. It IS cute. But it's too close to my eyes that it bothers my real lashes sometimes, especially when I have false lashes on -- I'd have to bring the glasses lower to almost the tip of my nose =("
4.0,"It is pretty dress, but differs from the picture, made from cheaper materials, but worth to buy, get one size smaller"
4.0,An XXL fit a person who usually wears a large. But the shirt looked great on!
4.0,Good but is small
4.0,Ordered XL hoping they would fit over large calf and up to knee. They didn‚Äôt. They have very minimal elastic in the socks throughout almost like a sleeve. So they do not expand much. Barely reached calf and were extremely stretched when pulled up
4.0,"I gave the pocketbook shown (brown/gold scene to my daughter for Christmas. We loved it but since December two screws that hold the handle to the purse have come undone.  The pocketbook was $189 and I  really expected more. My daughter is a pocketbook junkie and has many expensive bags.  She does not wear the same bag every day. The screws are extremely small and she had to pay twice to have it repaired at a costly price.  Disappointed, but will certainly purchase another bag."
4.0,"Bought these as a gift for my father.  When he first put them on, he did the typical double-take-slide-off to see the difference.  What he described is the colors appear more vivid and he can now distinguish some dead patches in the yard.  One thing to note however, (and why I didn't give them a full 5-stars) is there are some &#34;Colorblind test&#34; images on Google that he still couldn't distinguish from a normal picture so I'm not sure if his color-blindness is completely treated.  Also, when I put the glasses on, they do appear to show certain red signs as more vivid (I have not been diagnosed as color blind) so I can't tell for certain if these glasses are more a gimmick than what they claim is behind the actual science.  Since it's only been a week that he's had them, I'll solicit some more feedback from him and will update the review as needed.  But for now, given the price and the fact that he still exhibits some colorblindness, I can't give them a full 5 stars."
4.0,"Good jacket but a bit small , very light an well built"
4.0,"Fairly easy to use, but I can see it behind the tie. Wish they had this in white."
4.0,Very lovely and was a good present
4.0,The back of the head did pop in the seams within my daughter wearing them but she loves them and thinks they are cute so I will sew them. I bought her a medium and she wears a shoe size 13. They look right to me but she swears they fit just right and that they are so comfy.
4.0,"Overall good price for a what seems to be a nice watch. Only thing that I find a little off is the locking mechanism , the clasp to keep it in place is very loose and the tool that cam with it to remove links has no instructions on how to use. I had to explore around internet to figure it out."
4.0,Gift to daughter....she really liked the style.
4.0,I ordered one size larger and shouldn‚Äôt have. True to size. Very cute and I bought a hat to match.
4.0,"Nothing really bad to say, just saw a slight snag after wearing only once. The fit is good and the waist height is perfect. Not too high or low."
4.0,Size as you discribed made little roomier
4.0,"Since I got 4 for the same price as I bought 1 & 2 arm bands before, I feel like I got a good deal.  These are a little thin, yet they work just fine.  The blue is pretty bright,but i like it. overall i'd buy them in another color again if i needed more."
4.0,Just worried about shrinking because it shrank 1st was alot
4.0,Looks good. Ordered as part of my son's Joker costume. The bow tie is a little big but does the job. Received quickly per Amazon Prime!
4.0,I wear a size 6 shoe and these socks fit fine.  They aren't very stretchy so I don't think someone who wears a size greater than 7 would be happy with them.  The writing on the tags on the socks was not in English.  I think they are made to sell in an Asian market.  They seem warm and they are not too bulky.  They seem well made and did well in the washer and dryer.
4.0,"I'm typically a size 6/8 in women's, 5'4"" and fairly busty (36DD). Overall the dress fit and was very cute, quality of fabric and assembly was great. I ended up returning it, however, because the skirt was too short for my taste and while it looked good, I would have been too worried about people seeing my bum to enjoy it."
4.0,I like that they are lightweight and so adorable. Very comfortable to wear.
4.0,"I have an oblong face shape anyways, and judging from the other reviews I knew it wasn't going to fit perfectly. But I had to cut it up a bit more for comfort reasons. I cut the chin strap off and trimmed the nose area up a bit and now it fits better :D I'm pretty happy with it :)"
4.0,"Has a bunch of nifty pockets for work.  Where you have to work with bolts, nuts, washers, mini wrenches and need to carry a close cap mini pen."
4.0,"Not really much to say, I use both of my durags very frequently and I love them."
4.0,"This is a really cute little robe. I bought these as Party favors for my daughter's spa theme birthday party.<br />The fabric is really nice, and although is a little pricey considering other sites that sell these for almost half, I think it's a fair price for not wanting to wait 8 weeks to get them.<br />That said, I find them a little shorter than the picture. I got the Small Medium and they fit a little below the knee on my 6 year old. It is a good fit though, just a little shorter than the picture."
4.0,I bought this for my granddaughter Taylor.  She loves it.  I think the chain quality is slightly off. SO I am not sure how long it will last.  But she is enjoying it for now.
4.0,Like the mask just got a wrong month.
4.0,Run a bit large
4.0,love it!  A little long but Love it!  Fabric just like you can see it in the picture!!
4.0,Just love the pattern. It‚Äôs looks better with a belt.
4.0,"fun track suit and it's easy to accessorize to up the style. The top ran a bit small, but overall works."
4.0,had to return for a larger size than other suits i purchased
4.0,It is very bright light weight and breathable
4.0,"160lbs 5‚Äô3‚Äù M - Super cute dress and long enough that I‚Äôm not worried when I bend over. It was kind of big, but after a round in the dryer, it shrank a bit and fit perfectly. The white is definitely see through, hence the 4 stars, but otherwise great quality and pockets, am I right?! Looks great with boots and a denim jacket."
4.0,"They're sweet. Nothing fancy, but fun. They need backs; they tend to fall out rather easily. I wore them a couple of times, but then gave them to my daughter to wear with an embroidered tunic she just bought."
4.0,"nice purse, and great price"
4.0,I really like the nose lipstick saver for your mask.  It is a little hard to keep in the mask if you do not have the stretchy kind that goes around your face and neck.  But over all they keep me from breathing my mask back into my mouth which is HUGE FOR ME! I love them!
4.0,Nice fancy little cover I love the way it looks and fits my phone. Not ideal for protection but 2 bucks for some style I'll take it.
4.0,"The design is great. Fits fine for me, definitely not just for kids, but not for adults or kids with big/fat wrists. Glow in dark looks very cool. Is made of rubber and has rubber smell - not noticeable unless you put it near your nose, but material may degrade quickly. Just got it so can't comment on durability yet. Besides the rubber nothing feels too cheap about it. If it becomes unsuitable to wear daily I will use it as a decoration in my room. So even if it doesn't fit your wrist, it's still a cool little thing to put up somewhere and glow in the dark."
4.0,Nice  compression socks.
4.0,"Needs to come with a little more descriptive instructions.  Other than that, it‚Äôs a good product."
4.0,"I was so happy to find this bag on amazon after hours of searching for something for a 15 inch laptop that was not huge, not a sleeve, and not black or navy.  This bag fits my new 15 inch Macbook pro perfectly.  The product I got is slightly different than this picture, so that is the only reason I give it a 4.  The fabric on the inside is not this paisley print as shown, but another similar style print that is more green and has some white and orange.  Actually, I like the print I have more than this picture.  Also, the strap is green on mine, not brown, but it is comfortable to carry on my shoulder.  I also want to mention that the handles have a leather part where you carry in your hand, which is really comfortable.<br /><br />It doesn't have a pocket for the power cord, but I got this laptop for teaching, where I generally need another bag of stuff anyway.  I just wanted something small with good handles to carry outside of my messenger bag.  This is perfect for me, and super cute.  Definitely check out Melissa Beth's website to see her other bag designs."
4.0,Really like the design and feel. The only thing I dont like is that there should be more slots for sizing. Other than that it's a good buy.
4.0,"I'm 5'8, approx. 137 lbs and ordered the medium. I felt these pants were just a tad to tight.  I may decide to order a larger size though."
4.0,"Purchased extra large. Fit is perfect for a stout 6‚Äô1‚Äù guy with 40 degree weather on. Able to move around, play disc golf, keep dry. Product is light weight but not flimsy."
4.0,I love the way the light weight material fits. I am normally a large in tops but went up 1 size and got an xl and I‚Äôm glad I did. The only issue is the pocket has some thread sticking out so I‚Äôm not sure how long that will last through the wash but all in all I love it!
4.0,It's very beautiful as you will see in my pics hopefully but it is a littler thinner than I'm use too so I'm worried it might not hold up long but if it does hold up then I will certainly try very hard to remember to update this review to say so & ease that worry. Also the package sticker said it was made in China which I'd be alright with if I at least knew that ahead of buying & even more so if I knew that the company treated their employees well too! As on July it did break but I must say it still lasted longer that the necklace which also really surprised me. I'd say if you didn't wear it all the time like I did then it would have probably last alot longer.
4.0,"These do run small, an XXL would be perfect but these are still cute and comfy all things considered."
4.0,Very good looking. Not much support at all. I would not use for anything over a B cup. I wear a 34 AA so works great for me. I like the pockets for pads
4.0,Product seems to be of high quality but the print looks a bit cheap.
4.0,Est√° bonita pero peque√±a para ser s parece xs
4.0,"I ordered this in a size 8 for the ring finger on my right hand.  It didn't fit my right ring finger at all, and fits a bit too snugly on my left hand, where I normally wear a 7.5.  I normally size up for wide bands, but it was still smaller than expected.<br /><br />It looks nice, it's comfortable, and it's pretty.  The wide band is an attention grabber.  Overall, I like it, just make sure to order a size up."
4.0,"Very nice, good quality. Very long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and i need to take 3‚Äù off as it literally drags the ground."
4.0,I liked that it hugs everything up so you don't have to keep lifting them up which is nice and the lace is beautiful definitely bought again
4.0,Fabulous for the price. Worth every dollar
4.0,One size does not fit all in a large top XL bottom and it‚Äôs fine size wise but length I‚Äôm an easy 5‚Äô10 and it was a tight squeeze over my shoulders I have not tried to sit down in it ü•∫ if it was longer I‚Äôd give it an easy 5 stars
4.0,Heel comes off quickly
4.0,The material and quality of the product is pretty good. I am 5'4 and about 140 pounds and ordered a size XL. It fit a bit loose. By tightening it on the last row it feels ok but not as tight as I would like. I have already requested to exchange it for an L. The company responded promptly and was very helpful.
4.0,Fabric is thin and hard but I liked it because it didn‚Äôt cling.
4.0,Ordered this suit for vacation and the cut and design are flattering. I went with the larger size because my chest is 38C-D. It comes with padding (one was creased) so I had to snip and remove those to make boobs look normal.<br /><br />This suit was perfect for scuba or days when you don't want to show your belly. The back has a round cut out so if you have a bra roll you are trying to hide...This is not the suit for you.
4.0,"I do love wearing this necklace!, and can't believe that I got something like this for such a good price.  Yet, given that the back of the part that the chain goes through, has tarnished, and I need to be careful it stays in the back so not noticeable, I gave it 4 stars,  Otherwise, it's PERFECT and so special to me!"
4.0,Beautiful watch. Clear crystal and a gorgeous teal blue color that just pops in the light. Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Smooth auto movement with hacking and 120 click ratcheting bezel. Nice bracelet with micro adjustments and diving extension. Pin and collar bracelet so if you don‚Äôt know what your doing get it sized by a jeweler. Only complaint I have is when you perfectly line up the bezel marker to 12 o‚Äôclock the knurled ‚Äúteeth‚Äù design on the sides of the watch do not line up. Other than that this is a 10. I deducted the one star for the alignment. It‚Äôs the little details that count. Love the mama penguin and babies on the dial. Nice touch. Seller shipped it out and I got the watch a day early to my surprise in excellent condition and packaged properly. Thank you Electronic Express!! And Amazon!
4.0,Fits perfect i actually order another
4.0,Love the colors and pattern it is a little thin you will have wear something under it
4.0,Buttons a little delicate but I won't be messing with them to much anyway. Overall cute and fits well
4.0,"This Blazer was nice for the low price. It‚Äôs made of polyester and, of course, is just for fun! My husband wore it to dinner Christmas Eve and to a family gathering on Christmas Day. He was a big hit with everyone!"
4.0,"This dress is well made, out of quality fabric. I found it to be very cute and flattering!!  It works well at keeping the 'girls' concealed (most wrap type blouses/dresses end up spilling my goods).  Best of all, IT HAS POCKETS!!"
4.0,Nice pants an fast shipping
4.0,"This is a nice suit, I just wish the top wasn‚Äôt so baggy. Bottoms for great!"
4.0,"I‚Äôm short, but the tall size works OK. because they all eventually shrink in length.  Just have to turn up sleeve cuffs."
4.0,"Very pretty. A little disappointed in the neck piece . It was plastic! I swapped it for a brown leather and it was perfect.  Beautiful colors,nice size without being too big. Nice amount of weight to the pendent."
4.0,"if you are short, you will have to hem"
4.0,Been looking for a fully fur lined hoodie for a while. Finally found one i liked.
4.0,"Great pin!!<br />Might have been better,<br />to be slightly larger.<br />Thank you!!"
4.0,The dress is sized correctly and is very comfortable.
4.0,I really like the Hunter green color. I ordered a small (wear a 6-9) as I prefer a bit of compression and have the 17&#34; version that fit just fine. In this case I should have gone Med for a better fit.
4.0,Perfect fitüëåüëå
4.0,"Super cute and affordable! I like the material these are made from. Feels smooth, and it is a thicker material. Not see through at all. Love the pockets. They do ride down a bit with activity, but I find that if you pull them up slightly more at the ankles, it helps. I've yet to find a pair of legging that don't ride down a bit. I'm 5'1"" and about 115 lbs, and I ordered a small."
4.0,"The earrings came quickly and as described. My only issue is that the backs seem to hold the posts loosely. I am constantly pressing the the earring backs together so they stay tight and hold the posts. Other than that I really like them. For the price, I really can't complain too much."
4.0,Nice fabric. Warm. I‚Äôm returning because it is too small across my shoulders and doesn‚Äôt come together in front.
4.0,Really nice dress - love the color and fit
4.0,Color is amazing. Definitely a different fabric then shown. Size way up for over sized fit. I got a M and it fits only slightly overaized. Still very cute. Color is exactly as shown (I got the red)
4.0,"has enough room for  wallet, phone, water bottle. Probably a bit large for stadium or concert, but just what i needed for work."
4.0,"Nice and soft, husband says they would fit well BUT ordered this pack WITH Fly and there are No openings in these briefs as listed, very disappointed as then they would be perfect"
4.0,"I ordered a small, I usually wear a small or a size 4.  It fits perfect.  Really cute with the pockets.  Nice rayon material."
4.0,Nice hat.  A little tight.
4.0,"The necklace is just like I expected. It looks great! Sadly the gem broke off the necklace, so I'm hoping I can get some gorilla glue to fix it."
4.0,It is cute and nice. My sons is 12 month old<br />I bought it 12-18month saiz I wish little bit bigger. I was nice for birthday but I do not think I can wear again. It just fits good for now.
4.0,Great quality.  Would buy again.
4.0,Es muy bonito solo necesita el broche sea m√°s fuerte
4.0,Husband loves it as he is in the space industry. I was hoping for more details on the pin though. It was pricey for a little pin.
4.0,I purchased this dress for an adult prom and it was perfect. I look forward to wearing it again
4.0,I have a 42 inch bust and was apprehensive to attempt the XL but it fit. It was a snug fit and really accentuated the hips a little more than I was comfortable with. I returned it
4.0,I believe I may have received the incorrect size.  May try to order again.  But the belt itself is very nice.
4.0,"This purse is very stiff, very pretty color but not as roomy as I would have liked"
4.0,I bought these as a gift. Shipping came fast. He had been wanting them. It was exactly what he was looking for.
4.0,"The skirt fits great and it actually arrived early. My only disappointment was the color, I was expecting a bright white color. However the skirt is still nice and I'll find a matching top soon."
4.0,This is a Christmas gift. I believe my grandson will be very pleased.
4.0,"Pretty, airy, forgiving to body imperfections, but really should be qualified as plus sizes. I got the smallest available, medium, and it is about a size too large. I like this tunic, so I am keeping it, but will make some adjustments to the fit."
4.0,"I love cardigans, this item is good quality, well made. My only issue was the wrong color was sent, and the replacement for that one was again the wrong color"
4.0,"Box says designed by Petsmart, not sure what that means.  Anyway, inside are six pair of socks with various color schemes.  They fit well, and like most dress socks make my feet sweat.  The quality is as good as most socks, and the seams are well made.  My wife and daughter took them and left me with one pair."
4.0,"Like them they fit as expected and would of liked to have received completed order order, but after waiting 6 weeks for order completion, received notification from Fruit of the Loom that I would not be able to received the other 2 sets I ordered, as there were too many orders for the briefs."
4.0,The tie is of very good quality.  A little darker than it shows on the computer screen.  All the men on brides side of the family will be wearing a bow tie to match their wife's dress and the bow tie works out perfectly.
4.0,"I liked these, they're a little thin but I was using them for a Halloween costume so that didn't matter. If you know how the dress them up the right way they'd look cute."
4.0,"Great price - a little thin and light but the price was very low, so that was acceptable for me."
4.0,it works fine
4.0,This pajamas are really soft. The material isn't the best but what can you expect for the price. They are really cute. They run a little big but not too much. They are worth the price.
4.0,Great for kids.. and small adults.
4.0,The polarization is great on these. Fit my head perfectly. The only thing is the ABACO is in like 3 different spots and super prominent.
4.0,I broke all my silicone bands ever put on this is the first band that I haven't broke feels heavy and sturdy
4.0,I purchased the knit hat and gloves for my 6 yr grandson.  Material is good quality.  He loves the hat but  gloves are too small for a 6 year old. Fortunately he has a 2 yr brother who can grow into them.
4.0,"Wish the strap was longer or adjustable, but cute and as pictured."
4.0,I found these sunglasses at a gas station and loved the way they looked. My every day at work glasses for about 8 months. I have other more expensive glasses and my chick always asks where these are. Mine are now beat up found them on amazon just ordered 2 pair.  ITS 10 DOLLARS
4.0,Cute fit a little tight headband was to small and cheaper made but lasted for what I needed
4.0,They are fun to wear .<br /> The elastic  could be better tho
4.0,I was surprised at how it was actually reusable. It comes in nice packaging. Although it does not come with instructions it is easy to find the perfect placement.
4.0,"This dress looks just like the photos the seller provided.  It is a really nice dress but runs small.  I am usually a size medium in dresses and the top part was too tight.  The material does not stretch so I wish I ordered a large.  The dress is long.  I am 5'2 and even with heels I would need to get the dress hemmed.  The fit is flattering and the dress would be perfect for a wedding, prom, or other special occasion."
4.0,"the short are very nice but the print on them is not sharp from the crotch down. the short is a little too long you kind of notice it before wearing them im 6.3 foot tall and the shorts were just over my knees usually swim shorts are thigh high or just above the knee,the material doesn't feel cheap which is good, also another good thing is it has 2 pockets the not so good thing is the pockets dont have zippers so going for a swim with you keys is not such a good idea. some might ask why would you swim with your keys in your pocket.. well because you dont want to lose them in the sand. overall its pretty good but not great"
4.0,"Gorgeous lavender color. I would change is the neckline which is way too wide. I had trouble concealing my bra staps, and I could not conceal my Genie bra at all! It looks great with the item I got it to go with. One more thing I would change is the pockets which are only semi usfull because they are so short. You cannot put a fully extended hand in and have it concealed, only a fist."
4.0,very good I like and thanks
4.0,Nice dress &amp; material. I wear a small &amp; it fit right.
4.0,"Nice thick product. Got as a gift for my sister, she really enjoyed them."
4.0,I like the necklaces i received from you through Amazon and that is why i ordered them.<br />They are comfortable around my neck whether i have my glasses on or off.<br />I would buy them again.
4.0,"Love the colors.  Loved the style.  Loved the material.  Unfortunately,  I returned because it was too small. If I had time to exchange for a bigger size,  I definitely would have but I needed it for a certain date."
4.0,Size was small for a large. Loved<br />the color and style
4.0,"Very cute, classy. Pretty blue color. Comfortable fit. A bit thin, but does have 2 layers."
4.0,As expected. The latex smell is stronger that I would like.
4.0,"My kiddo lived it! Doesn't hold a bunch but I don't think that's the point. You do have to be able to reach inside to ""un pop it"" but no issues for them."
4.0,"Thank you! form fitting, color is pretty.."
4.0,"LOVE THIS DRESS....ok, so the embroidery is itchy.  BUT, the dress fabric doesn't wrinkle.  I travel often for work...and this dress is perfect for that.  I would absolutely buy again in a different color.  I received it yesterday, opened the mail, hung it up for about 10 minutes, got dressed, drove 2.5 hours for a dinner meeting and got several compliments.  Great purchase."
4.0,Comfortable and breathable with and without filter.  Just wish the ear bands were black instead of white.
4.0,Nice look. Excited to put them to use on vacation.
4.0,"I purchased this bathing suit at a discount in exchange for my honest review.... I read the reviews so I bought a size up! That was definitely a good call and I would also suggest that to others. The fit seemed to be right on except the torso, the chest part rides low and if you pull it up it will just give you a wedgy. The torso definitely needs to be made a bit longer. Im 5'6 with an average length torso and even with the upsizing, the suit still tugged down when pulled up enough to cover my chest. Im also not well endowed so it isn't even about large breasts being the issue here. It seems well made and elegant, I love the rutching at the thighs, the loops at the neck and the fringe, it's very flattering for a plus sized lady. Im not sure I can wear it though bc I would feel like I had to continuously pull it out of my bottom or walk hunched over so my chest was not exposed."
4.0,The beads are beautiful = made the perfect compliment with my child's Disney 'Dreams come true' bracelet !
4.0,Sunglasses are very nice for the price.
4.0,Nice stretchy spandex material. Colors are vivid and look just like the photo. The only thing I don't like is that it falls off the shoulders easily and I have to wear a strapless bra with it. I'm 5'5 and 110 pounds and ordered a small.
4.0,"Beautiful color,very bright.Expected them to be larger.Ordered these first to see what they look like so i can order the matching necklace too.I gave them four stars because expensive looking earrings like thees should come with stronger backs to support them to stay up."
4.0,Order a size up for a more baggy sweatpants feel.
4.0,I received SO many compliments while wearing this dress!
4.0,"Not quite as big as it looks in picture. It doesn't sit upright like in picture.  Overall, a very cool piece.  It was a great price and quick delivery."
4.0,"the glasses look good, my only downers are that they are not as dark as other sun glasses and the nose pads that come with it are a big to big. Thankfully they come with a small screwdriver so you can remove the nose pads if you don't like them, but that's it they don't give you or offer other size nose pads. In Overall good glasses."
4.0,"I ordered a Medium/Large. Size on the pants is &#34;L&#34;. The material is very thin, flowy & cool. Might be too casual for work, but I'm thinking of trying to dress them up anyway. The elastic waist measures 24&#34; without the stretch, waist sits 2&#34; above my navel, so I roll them down at the waist. Length is 31&#34; from the crotch. A good length for me at 5'5&#34; (and somewhat adjustable depending upon where I choose to have the waist) . The pants are very comfortable and on the big side if I were ordering a Medium for legs and on the Small side (for ordering a Medium) in the waist. As soft and compact as these are, the material itself is quite sturdy. Not much actual shape to these pants, aside from the waist being small, so unless your voluptuous, it won't reveal too much in the way of curves. Right side pocket is a giant bonus! I would have given the product an extra star for a being proportional in size with more shape.  I'm not disappointed. (I am thrilled that they aren't too small or too short.)"
4.0,"Lovely dresses, worth every penny."
4.0,Pretty scarf for reasonable price. Color is not as pictured
4.0,The dress is beautiful just kinda thick and loose in the breast area.
4.0,Dainty and cute!
4.0,This shirt is super comfortable and soft but just a little too big in the stomach area. It‚Äôs not too big under the arms though as some of these tanks can be. This one is fitted under the arms which is nice. It‚Äôs long as well. The black Is a nice deep Black.
4.0,Got these as a gift. Husband got a kick out of the pattern (the color is very vibrant) and they fit perfectly. This brand and style of boxers is excellent.
4.0,It was perfect for my Nana.  Shipped quickly right on time for Mother's day. I loved the pouch it came. Just praying it doesn't turn or tarnish.
4.0,"Very small, but cute. It‚Äôll work for quick trips to the store, or walks. I like it!"
4.0,"I love Snoopy.  Nice quality, nice color.  A bit stiff."
4.0,Not used to something that tight but really like them
4.0,I love the fit of this jacket. So warm and cozy. Took one star out because I didnt like how the material turned out after some washes.
4.0,larger than I thought
4.0,They definitely serve the purpose you need to when you need to wear a mask.
4.0,it was very pretty and my birth stone  and i got the matching chain. plus it was a great price.
4.0,Fun stuff but seasonal!
4.0,The boob area was a bit big but I adjusted it to fit my frame.
4.0,"I ordered the green, blue, red package in a medium. I love the length and shape. The colors are as vibrant as pictured. They are a lightweight material and great for layering. They are not quite as &#34;compressive&#34; as I expected but I am still pleased with them for working out or just being casual. I am 5'4 and 155 lbs. they are loose so perhaps a small next time."
4.0,Good clean jewelry.
4.0,They are lovely and very nice. A bit larger than I thought but look great with an up do
4.0,"They don't personally reflect my political views, but they are nice hats nonetheless. One of my hats broke at the strap but nothing a quick patch job didn't fix. Overall very nice, would buy again."
4.0,"I liked how it came with two extra buttons so I could replace them twice if they got ripped off. I did not like how it had a plastic zipper I can see that won't last that long the price was cheep enough I thought it would cost this much the fabric is too thin, but I guess its ok."
4.0,"I recently purchased this as a gift for my grand-daughter, who had strongly hinted that she wanted it, and she really loves them."
4.0,I like this shirt great color that has stood up to several washing the size does run a bit small
4.0,These are extremely lightweight  and comfortable. Received many compliments on their unique design.
4.0,It's a pretty nice piece. It has a little weight to it. The middle stone isn't perfertly centered but it's not too noticeable. It will make a nice Mother's Day gift.
4.0,Beautiful and Classy! Definitely buy you won't be disappointed!
4.0,"Pros: This is a very cute top. The material has some stretch to it. Fit as expected. (Xxl fit like a size 18/20)<br />Cons: The material is very thin, so thin I can see the print on my bra through it."
4.0,this is a fun item...everybody just loves the magnets
4.0,I went with other reviews and ordered up 2 sizes. I am a busty size 14 and the 3XL fits perfectly.
4.0,"Well made product, although in the description it doesn't say the maximum size of shoe it will fit.  I think that info would have help men with larger feet like me. That being said It does fit my size 14 although very tight."
4.0,"The buckle seems cheaply made, but its what you pay for.  I bought this for a cosplay.  It does the job."
4.0,"Arrived on time,  looks as shown in the picture"
4.0,A little big. But cute!
4.0,"Very soft and warm. Love the light blue color!  Runs a bit small & shrank a bit in the wash on top of that.  Has a wide opening at the neck that I'm not crazy about, but I'm happy with the purchase overall."
4.0,Very cute but the white ones are alittle see through
4.0,"Love the soft material! Usually between a medium or large but ordered an extra large due to reviews, and it's it's almost perfectly.. fits more like a medium I would say. Wouldn't mind it being a little roomier, but it'll do. So definitely go up two sizes! I am also very short, and only 5:2, so I can definitely see how it would be super short on a taller person, so be mindful of that."
4.0,I really like the shoes but they are really big. I got a size 2 (18m) for my daughters 1st birthday and they are still too big at 14m old but she is wearing them now.
4.0,"It was a beautiful shirt, lovely color, just ran too small for me, and I usually wear a small.  Will order from them again, but will order up a size."
4.0,"Look just like the photo. Small enough for a little girl but ok for adults too. I like the lever back feature because they are very comfortable, even when sleeping.  Less chance of one coming off, especially now with masks coming off and on behind ears.  Would be a cute gift, especially paired with a jar of honey and some biscuits or tea."
4.0,"These tops look beautiful, the fit on me is so-so. Not as flattering as I imagined. Probably my fault."
4.0,Cute and fit well. Looks great with boots
4.0,"I really love this ear cuff. It looks really good and fits on my ear relatively well. However, anytime I lean down the cuff falls and yanks roughly on my ear lob. And it hurts. It hurts a lot. I have to take it off sometimes if I know I'll be active or I'll cover my ear with my hand (first world problems). The stud is really short so the cuff is pinching your ear the whole time. If you are looking for something functional, I would go for a cuff that doesn't have a stud attached to it or that attaches to your ear better."
4.0,It is cute!!! But order larger I am 5 8 weigh 185 I wear a XL 14-16 I ordered a 5XL
4.0,"I really like it, everyone that has seen it really liked it."
4.0,"I bought medium waist was perfect for 33&#34; however length was a little short, should have bought large"
4.0,I liked the designs of these they but for me they were entirely way too big.. like huge!! I have a small head I guess.. these literally take up my entire torso. I guess I'm considered petite but I ordered kids ones and they fit just fine. Just not as many options unfortunately. Otherwise If these for your head than you're good to go lol
4.0,I liked the funny saying on the shirt.
4.0,I didn't like that there is too many of the same type of pieces. Wanted nose rings and shorter/wider eyebrow jewelry. Too many curved pieces. I enjoyed the colorful mixture of pieces For the most point I like the set.
4.0,"I wear this jacket all the time! It's adorable! Only downside is there is the outside fabric, the inner lining, and that is it; no insulation at all! So, it's an early fall/late spring jacket - mostly for looks and not much for keeping you warm. For the price, though, it's a very cute, good quality fashion jacket."
4.0,Add to take it in around the neck and hips but  overall love it was perfect for my event
4.0,"Really cute outfit, nice material."
4.0,"I wear a 0 - 2 in American women's and ordered a L-Asian. If my torso was short, the bathing suit would have fit; however, it is not. I have a long, thin torso and am 5'4 (not at all tall by American standards). The suit was baggy width-wise and too short-length wise. It would fit a person with a short torso or short frame well.<br /><br />I am not, however, disappointed with my purchase. My 11 year old niece, who is shorter than I (5'), tried on the suit and it fits/looks awesome! What's more--the quality of fabric is top notch and very well made. Very cute and appropriate for a child (or modest woman)."
4.0,they are comfortable and non slip.  Perfect for what I need
4.0,"Being such avid Revenge fans, my wife just had to have a double infinity necklace and we found this online. She does like it and it is pretty, but I think it is a little larger than we wanted. However, if you are a Revenge fan, you will like it."
4.0,Very pretty but I cannot adjust it very small so it is loose and the anchor side tends to hang down so you can't see it
4.0,"These were given as a gift and he was very pleased with them. I was not happy with the color.  It looked much lighter on line, but he was satisfied with them and that's what counts..."
4.0,Great quality. Perfect shoes for my son for school
4.0,"Larger than I thought, but good quality"
4.0,They were gifts so really dont know how they fit but they looked good!!!
4.0,A little on the large side. Cute dress and decent material. Reccomend hand washing
4.0,Just what I'd been looking for and very nice quality. I ordered 2 in this color and I'll be ordering more in purple bc my daughter has a lot of bows. We love being able to have a cute holder for all her bows that keeps them organized and out of a drawer for easy access since we can see her whole collection all at once.
4.0,Era muy grande por eso lo devolvi y mi reembolsaron mi dinero
4.0,Super soft and warm.  Very small.  I usually wear a L pj paint.  I ordered the XL because of the reviews and they could still be a bit bigger for comfort.
4.0,"This is a nice casual pull over hoodie sweatshirt. It's pretty in a nice laid back way and looks great with a good pair of jeans.<br />The two tone coloring is great. It comes in a variety of colors for the upper section of the shirt but the lower section is a grey color. It has draw strings at the top which are a good length and work well if you want to tighten the hood up on yourself and also look good hanging down. There is a zip at the top to make it easier to get over your head and it also has a nice big pocket/pouch in the front for your hands.<br />I found that it ran just a bit small, not by much but it seemed a tad short in the arms. Other than that it's a very nice hoodie sweatshirt."
4.0,"Amazingly soft but, because the neck has no stretch, they have made it HUGE (so as to fit over very large heads?) I bought a 16 for my 12-year-old, and the neck was a pretty deep scoop neck before I altered it.<br />That being said....she loves these pajamas, and everyone is the house wants to steal them."
4.0,Got it for my boyfriend and he loved it. It was a great addition to his collection. More sorty than dressy but it was still good.
4.0,Colorful. Many compliments. Goes with many things.
4.0,These are really great! I left one star off because the sleeves don't roll up easily- I had to cut slits to let them roll up. I love the knee pads and roominess of the coveralls. I use them for painting.
4.0,"I ordered the yellow socks (Antique Gold) in Medium.  The size guide says a Medium is 7-8.  I wear a size 7 shoe, and these socks were way too big in the actual foot area.  I thought they would be ok, but when you put the boot on, it pulls the sock up (the excess in the foot area), which made them end up being too long at the top.  It was too much extra to fold down.  Luckily I was easily able to exchange them and I got a Small.  They haven't come yet, but I'm sure they will be fine."
4.0,"This seems like a very good quality ring, the words are clear and it looks exactly like the picture.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the way the intertwined rings actually look on my finger.  They don't really settle nicely with each other.  The other thing I was worried about was them rubbing together and pinching me, but it didn't pinch at all! I'd rate the quality and transaction a 5, but I only like the actual ring a 3."
4.0,"I normally wear anywhere from a 7 to an 8 generally in a narrow.  These boots work in a 39 for me with thick socks and even better with 2 pairs of socks.  They are a bit on the big side, but I can make them work...especially since there are NO narrow snow boots available anywhere.  These boots are also extremely warm and really cute.  So, the down side is that I ordered these thinking I could snug the ties up to fit since my calves are slender also at 11.5 inches in diameter.  The ties are more or less faux as there is no tongue.  You can't really snug these up because there are no slits, the material is one continuous piece and by snugging the ties up, the fabric bunches up and is uncomfortable and looks stupid.  Also, for those people with wider calves, the zipper is also sort of faux.  The zipper does open and close, but again, there are no slits in fabric, just an inch extension once the zipper is open.  You will only gain about an inch of room by unzipping them.  I suppose this is all done to make the boots as warm as possible and water proof.  I do like them and am very glad I bought them."
4.0,"Had trouble at first screwing on the ball, seems to screw in a different direction and not stay in place at first. But once I figure it out all is well. Pretty product."
4.0,"Looks good. Construction feels a bit cheap--like the cups of the top overall fit as expected, but way their cut would only cover up only a small part of a woman's breast. And even with the straps tied taut, swimming in the pool caused the cups to flip down a little like I was going to fall out of the top."
4.0,I‚Äôd order this again. Fabric feels good. Washes great. Somewhat easy to put on (I have shattered shoulder and broken arm) and I have assistance with the snaps.
4.0,"The dress looks beautiful, got lots of compliment, fits really nice, sizing is pretty accurate. I gave only 4 stars because of the color, its not as vibrant as the picture, it's more of a dark navy blue."
4.0,So tiny.
4.0,"Comfy, good sweatshirt"
4.0,I bought this for my grandson who had severe (super nova) ADHD.  By the time his baseball games start in the evening his medicine is wearing off and he struggles to pay attention.  We were often afraid he would be looking somewhere else when the ball came his way.  He uses this to fiddle with while playing 2nd base. It gives him something to do with his hands so he can watch the game and be ready when the ball comes his way.
4.0,"Very baggy in legs, fit in waist"
4.0,I love this dress. Its comfortable. I get compliments all the time.
4.0,Exactly as described. Great product for the price
4.0,I love the fit. Looks great with high waisted bottoms. Material is cool and washes easy.
4.0,It's beautiful. The pendant is bigger than I expected. I'll give it to my mom.
4.0,"Had to return both, small and medium sizes, as it was too large in the chest. But the dress is pretty.<br />The service was great too. Arrived very quickly."
4.0,I got these as a gift for my friend and they seem to fall off easily but they are super cute and the variety is amazing!
4.0,Nice product- stays snug and is very absorbent. Have not washed yet so don‚Äôt know if any affect that will have on bands
4.0,NICE WATCH. LOOKS GOOD.
4.0,Me qued√≥ como esperaba. La tela es muy suave y con costuras muy bien hechas.
4.0,"Great sock, like the tab on the heel to prevent sliding down. Fit was a bit big (I wear a 7.5 or 8). Overall, good quality."
4.0,"I have a hard time finding a flattering dress and that hides my ‚Äúimperfections‚ÄùüòÅ since I‚Äôm 5.7 159 pounds. This dress doesn‚Äôt make the hips look bulging, no pockets! on the sides"
4.0,"Product is well made, but would better fit someone with a long torso, if I pull the straps tight to get the bottom to fit, the cups on the bra are too high. I'm 5ft 7 and usually find it easy to fit shapewear, very akward fit. Im sending it back."
4.0,Be warned that the tabs to the backs are separately attached.  I puled a foam background off the earring and the earring went flying everywhere.  I never did find one of the black earrings.  Other than that they look nice.
4.0,They don't like sun. You leave them out on sun and you can trash them.
4.0,"Loved this  unfortunate for me.  The sizing was not made for me.  I tried different sizes twice.  The top will be sized more like the next size bigger.  The bottom fits, but for a slimmer hip"
4.0,Great belt very very satisfied
4.0,Later over 2 years.
4.0,"These are perfect for snowmobiling or skiing. They are very thick and warm, while also fitting nice and snug. The come up to around my mid-calf. They aren't good for much else other than outdoor recreation, but they work super well for that."
4.0,"I bought this to start rebuilding my fall tops. This shirt was thinner than I expected it to be, but super soft material and comfortable!"
4.0,"This is a real nice belt.  Wasn't sure what to expect, never purchased a belt online before, but it is very nice, good material, fit well, and exactly as advertised.  I recommend this belt if you're looking for one."
4.0,"I was looking for tree charms and these worked great for my project. Wish they came in more variety of sizes, as most are pretty large. I have a ton left over, so it would be nice if they came in smaller packages, too. Other than that, happy with my purchase and the price paid."
4.0,Well I made mistake and ordered a size too big. I got XL and pants sit right under my boobs! I say order true to your size. I‚Äôm still keeping it regardless as it‚Äôs comfortable. Returning items are a headache anyway
4.0,"The fit was as expected and is comfortable.  However, I don't really see where there is tummy control is."
4.0,"i felt like my purse (MK leather shoulder type bag) was too heavy but the hanger never broke, gave 2 as gifts"
4.0,Good for a change of pace. Coordinate!
4.0,"Beautiful, exactly as I picured it, but the link between the two &#34;collar&#34; parts was very weak and broke very quickly. Once replaced, it will be good as new."
4.0,Super comfy and good for work but without wearing heels they are too long. Glad panties don‚Äôt shine through
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress.. Sadly I am short 5"" 3"" and don't like wearing high heals. so for me it was way to long... and I did not want to cut it and lose the pretty bottom.. So I did return it.. No issues there.. refunded right away.."
4.0,Great belt. One of my favorites.
4.0,I have been looking for one of these for a long time and can never find in the store.  This works perfectly as a wallet.  I don't always like to use a bag so this is great compact for those situations.
4.0,Great fit and look. I am in my 50ish and it didnt look juvenile on me.
4.0,Nice looking leather band matched well to the watch.<br />Fit my husbands wrist well. Was easy to attach<br />Fast delivery
4.0,I received the delivery of the pins and thought that the pins would be more pronounced glossy.  What you shipped me was coated with a less bright resin.  Product is ok though.
4.0,"These pajamas are so cozy ,comfortable, and soft  that you will want to wear them all day!  (well, at least a large part of the day if you need to stay at home) or work from home.<br />I had to order two pairs of these on different colors. !<br /><br />The only thing I found was the ties string frailed pn the pants. But the shirt and pants are fine and fit well. I got a medium for 5 ft 8"" I was concerned if that would be small but they run big."
4.0,Cute head or bag scarf!
4.0,it‚Äôs so cute
4.0,Makes as a great gift for corvette lovers!
4.0,"It is really light weight and ideal for an overnight trip. When carrying behing you too far, the wheels cover start getting scratched and getting in the way."
4.0,I‚Äôve had this dress for several years now. It‚Äôs still in perfect condition. I liked it so much when I got it I actually bought another in a different color. Still have both of them. The material is not picked and the colors are still just as vibrant as when I bought! True to color in picture and fits like a glove!!
4.0,Really disappointed. Most stones were chipped. Could have been a lot better.
4.0,"They were soft, but I didn't feel like they could stay on well enough for me. Other people may not have that problem."
4.0,"Nice beanie, great colors and fabric"
4.0,"Very nice earrings, I bought as a gift for my daughter-in-law!"
4.0,"The quality is very good, the high-end atmosphere. The style is very beautiful and very beautiful, I like it very much."
4.0,"Super comfortable. However, sole is pretty slippery (at least when new). And of course I scuffed the toe of one shoe on my first day wearing, and polish won't hide it very well."
4.0,I love my watch.
4.0,It is really nice but just not a fit for my style.
4.0,Shirts are cut small.
4.0,Arrived on Wednesday instead of Tuesday. It was shown as an eau cuff but there is also a piercing needle part o had to break off. But once I did that it fit like a charm! That's why I gave it 4 stars.
4.0,"Very thick, good quality material! Wording is much better engraved than pic suggests! Very nice and easy to read! Shiny silver!"
4.0,Work for my reading glasses.
4.0,"I loved the colors, very vibrant but the actual size runs a little large."
4.0,"I received this necklace last night and I do like it. I give 4 stars because this is a nice necklace. It seems to be made of good quality and looks as shown. I ordered it in the silver plated. The only 2 problems I have with it are the size and the length of the chain. I had read before purchasing that the length of the chain is only 16 inches so I figured I would just buy and extender piece which I intend to do. They really should make chains longer on all jewelry because in my opinion, 16 inches is the size for a child's neck. Or maybe I just have a fat neck, haha. I also was not aware that the actual charm on this was not much bigger than the width of my finger. It is well made as far as the charm but they really could improve the necklace part itself. I will buy and extender and will wear this necklace for sure. I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review."
4.0,I little big for my 4/5 year old. Quality as expected.
4.0,I dont have boobs so it was loose up top but its comfy so i love it.
4.0,"Tight fit for my feet.  Try ordering a size up.<br /><br />Well designed, well constructed.  Don't see any issues here.  Not as much cushioning as expected but to walk outside for a minute these are perfectly fine.  The rubber soles smudged some of the things I bumped up against so be aware of that.  The uppers feel like they'd last though.  Pretty warm and cozy honestly, would recommend for colder weather."
4.0,"Would have worked for what I was needing them for, but they were too big."
4.0,"I like the functionality of the wristlet, especially the inside pockets, but I'm not sure it is durable enough to hold up over time."
4.0,"Looks great on my daughter!  We had to take it in just a bit, but otherwise perfect!"
4.0,"They run a little small. I normally wear size large bottoms and these fit, but they fit snug and joggers are not supposed to fit snuggly. If you wear a size large and large is normally very loose on you than these will fit properly. I have a smaller waist, a big booty and larger thighs, so if you have thin legs these may fit better, but idk if the stomach area would be comfortable."
4.0,very nice but it was a little too tight to the front
4.0,"I bought this clip for my husband who is a huge Jaguar fan.  He never owned a clip before and he really liked this one.  Used it all the time.  It helped him keep his money and cards organized, thankfully!  My only negative comment is it could have been a bit more sturdy."
4.0,"Cute dress, thin material I defiantly suggest wearing something underneath. Length came down to Midcalf on me and I'm 5'8"
4.0,Love the shirt but size runns a little big
4.0,I give this produced 4 stars due to ordering my daughters each a pair and only 2 lighting up while walking. One pair lights up if you find the right spot of the clicker and push it. My daughter's must be not heavy enough to make this pair work while walking. The quality in the shoes are amazing. Not hard on the heels at all. No blisters. I ordered these for my daughters 2ed birthday and they are beautiful! I odreded a 4th pair in hopes they get here and work by September 2ed ü§û
4.0,a bit top heavy and seems to run a bit big (i bought another a size down for proper fit) but I love its boldness and receive many compliments.
4.0,"Very cute and flattering style, but as others stated it was on the snug side at the arm cuffs.  I also ordered one of the white prints, and it is VERY see-through.  Even nude undergarments were still pretty obvious.  For this reason I am returning.  Would recommend sizing up and/or ordering a darker color."
4.0,Gave it to my daughter as a gift....she loved it.
4.0,Arrived a little late due to some shipping errors however after contacting seller they sent another shirt right away. My husband loved his shirt and it fits him great thank you!
4.0,This would make a great gift for a loved one. My husband got this for me and i love it! Its a meaningful gift! I would definitely get this for friends and family. The Keychain has cute dainty charms and is a great reminder that your loved and cared for!
4.0,"It is a great piece and has some nice weight to it. However, about 5 minutes into wearing it at the party I was at, it broke. I wish I could say I was doing something cool and that's why it broke but I reached out to open a drawer and the small chain broke. It was loose on me too so it may have just been the one I got."
4.0,Good quality. It was a little too long.
4.0,Nice socks!!!
4.0,"These were pretty cute & well made! But if you are smaller chested (32b here, bought XS) the fit won‚Äôt be cute. I‚Äôm petite but not crazy small (32b-25-36) and the XS was all around too big & even with tying it tighter it still didn‚Äôt look right."
4.0,this was a gift for my mother. she love thing like this
4.0,Smaller than I expected but wonderful piece still.
4.0,"I've worn this hat on and off for two winters, and it is adorable. The fit is excellent, and I can wrap the long mitten trails around my neck as a scarf or tuck them in to my coat as an extra layer of warmth.<br /><br />I deducted one star because I am afraid the fur will get all messed up in the wash (or in really wet weather). It is definitely not dryer safe, but that is okay, just an FYI. Also the ears could have been constructed a little better, but it is still cute and cuddly all the way 'round."
4.0,"Love the print selection, very beautiful.  Only having ordered neck gaiters once before, these were not as snug as the first ones I ordered from another company.  I planned to use them to hold mask filters in place, which worked great with the snug ones.  I did discover though that these will hold a mask bracket in place with a filter sandwiched between.  Neck gaiters alone do not make a safe mask."
4.0,comfortable but you must have a very good body shape
4.0,"These are super cute, and I can't wait for my little one to arrive so she can wear them. The patterns are just as pictured, and super cute in person. The hats are really tall, compared to the other newborn hats that I have. I assume there will be lots of extra room on top of the hat. That being said, they will still be adorable. I would recommend."
4.0,It does the job when I take my son out for a walk in his stroller. It helps block the sun a bit! We'll made baby hat
4.0,"It's short but only because of the cutouts on the bottom. I always wear shorts under my dresses, so that was nothing new for me.<br />The chest was a bit tight, but I was expecting that from other reviews.<br />I typically wear a medium and ordered a medium. Perfect dress for graduation!"
4.0,This is a really nice band for the Apple Watch. I have gotten several compliments on it. The clasp feels nice and strong and the colors really pop. I much prefer this style to the ones that have to stretch over your hand since they never seem to fit right. This one you just adjust the inner clasp to the size you want and go. It has just a bit of stretch in it which helps make it more comfortable. You can‚Äôt go wrong at this price.
4.0,The material is a bit thick. Others than that it fits great. For a summer dress it should be a bit lighter.
4.0,"Ordered up with a large (I am s/m, 5'4 and B cup) and it fit just right. I like this shirt, however, the Ivory color is SHEER..making one's bra visible. I hate this and will not order more colors due to unknown sheerness in other colors. Good quality shirt but not a practical winter shirt."
4.0,"Love these. Only 1 pair doesn't fit as well as they should, but can't beat them for the price!"
4.0,Had several compliments on it.
4.0,It's SUPER cute and fits well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the material is very thin.
4.0,"Sleeve length, though great, is somewhat tight in the forearm."
4.0,2 sizes too small ugh looked at chart carefully hopefully i can return
4.0,Great basic capris for running or yoga.
4.0,"Honestly, it would have gotten 5 stars had I not recieved a damaged product.<br /><br />The great:<br />- 2 pack= 10ish bucks each! Yay!<br />-holy-sticky-cannoli! The adhesive is phenomenal! It's been so long since I've tried a sticky bra because they would come off or I would have a slin reaction to the adhesive. Which did not occur.<br /><br />The bad:<br /> -My black bra (the one I had planned to use next weekend!) Was stuck to the bag that it came in, as you see in the picture. When I pulled the bag off, the adhesive stayed stuck to the bag and pulled off of the bra."
4.0,"Glad I read the reviews on the fit. I am a size 10, bought the XL and they fit great."
4.0,"I like the color and style. However the chest part was a little too snug and the pleats on the waist part isn't appealing. Would've given 5 stars if the pleats were removed. Other than that, it is still gorgeous to wear."
4.0,Get a size higher than normal
4.0,Nice green color. Comfortable.
4.0,"comes with a case and wipes.  These glasses are pretty decent considering the price.  They are &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; quality but I feel that if you kept the glasses in the case and took care of them, they would last much longer.  If you are not rough on your glasses, you will love these."
4.0,It's cute a sturdy.
4.0,"Beautiful poster, just wish the sizing wasn't so weird. If you plan on framing this, DON'T buy a 9x12 frame! There is an uneven white border on this print, so in my 9x12 frame it looks a little off. You need to order a custom frame and trim the print, or have it matted."
4.0,"Pretty good quality at a good price. Fits like it should per sizing, but I bought multiples in a size up because I suspected they'd shrink, and they did shrink a bit. Warm sweatshirt hoody in an awesome electric blue color (carribean blue?)"
4.0,"Beautiful and good quality, it's a little bit too big but I can make it work."
4.0,as promised - good fit and nice and comfy
4.0,Thought the material would be lighter for summer.
4.0,Good beginner body shaper
4.0,Very nice shirt for the price.  I ordered the slim fit and it fit snugly.  I'm between medium and large.  Ordered both.  The medium fits but is tight.  The large is just right.  Material is thin.  No pocket on the front.  Exactly what I was after and a very good price.
4.0,"The coat is a gorgeous mauve pink color and I really do love it but it's a bit small so let me give you a better reference for size on here. I am 220lbs and a 40 d bra size. I wear size 16 pants and xl or xxl shirts depending on the brand.  I purchased the 3 xl and it's almost perfect but won't quite zip up over my boobs. So if there had been a 4xl it would have been perfect. I just bought a coat at Costco that is an xl in women's and fits me perfectly and zips etc. so I would consider myself and xl and three sizes up would have been perfect. I just had my baby so I hope my boobs and weight will go down as I keep working out so I will keep it since I love it. A great price for this coat, just go up three sizes not two."
4.0,I loved this outfit on me! I wore it to a dinner meet and greet with my future hubby! He loved the way it fits on me and that's all that matters! The only thing is I should have ordered a large because it runs bit big. I also didn't care for was the band on the dress was a bit thick but other than that I rocked this black dress all night!
4.0,Has a leotard feel.  Would be 5 star if it were cotton.
4.0,This Is a great product for the kids my daughter  loves the mask
4.0,I love this bracelet (once it's on my wrist) The beaks of the hummingbirds scratch my wrist when I put it on and remove it. But it's worth it because I really like it so much.
4.0,"Looks more yellow than orange but it is a great, sturdy headband. Easy to wash and wear again and again. This is pretty thick in height but can easily be folded over to an appropriate size."
4.0,Looks sharp for how  inexpensive it is.  Almost looks too fancy if that can be  viewed as a bad thing.  Metal is glossier than i expected.
4.0,"I ordered an XL from the size chart because I am normally size 14 in dresses. The top of the dress fits more like a boat neck on my frame with the straps of my bra visible and there is still some loose fabric at the bust. I'd rather it be slightly oversized than too small, so I can still make it work, but just a word of caution. I'm satisfied with the length of the skirt and the fullness of it. I'm 5'6&#34; and it hits me just below my knees but not quite midi length. Fabric feels like cheap silky/polyester with stretch. Color of the design fades out as the fabric is stretched."
4.0,"It fits properly, the fabric is nice.  It's a little thin however.  I'll need something under it."
4.0,"This fit well, but it creased in the front when I walked and it was unflattering."
4.0,Pretty for dressing up love them
4.0,"Just know that they may run a little small, so you may want to buy up a size. You know your kids will grow into them for sure if they are not a perfect fit right away. They are not as light weight as I had hoped, but still better than some heavy soled shoes. My six year old likes them and can put them on without my help."
4.0,Its like walking on a cloud love em
4.0,Kinda small but pretty
4.0,Really like this fits well
4.0,"It was a gift for someone, but all seemed fine to me."
4.0,"Priced appropriately, but really thin. My gf said she will probably wear them around the house rather than out."
4.0,The jacket is very nice the only thing is it was too large
4.0,"Material is very soft, I was surprised. The bottoms fit a little big, nothing a little hemming won't fix. The top is shorter than it was expected, fits like a sports bra more than a mini top. I bought it for a trip to Cabo San Lucas so it's a prefect outfit for showing off your body more than usual."
4.0,It is a gift for someone.
4.0,I read reviews and it expected it to be a little large but it isn't like a BF shirt. It's more like a long tunic or a dress. I still like it. Good over leggings.
4.0,"Beautiful, flowy and soft material. It looks great with everything!"
4.0,"Size is good, feels durable, good stretch, colors are bright, easy to use, nice looking, and comfortable. Solid color scarf is 2-sided, patterned ones just have pattern on one side. Unfortunately one of the scarves came in a different pattern than I ordered, and it was the one I was most excited for."
4.0,"They were good and they fit right, but bf ended up breaking his within a week so not very durable"
4.0,"Me and my lover love these necklaces they are awesome and fit nice however they don't connect so I have to give it 3 stars because of that feature...nah 4 stars its a good quality it just doesn't connect, great for the price."
4.0,Cute but a little cheap feeling. Did the job for a concert but not sure how often I‚Äôll use it.
4.0,Nice bathing suit.  I wear size 12 pants 36B bra so I ordered a XL.  Bottom fits nice. Top too big but I have small boobs.  Would order again.  Shipped faster than expected.
4.0,I ended up using this as a shirt with leggings cause it was definitely not long enough to be a dress.
4.0,Fast shipping and great seller but they do run a little LARGE!!! I'd say about a 1/2 a size!!!
4.0,"These boots are warm and comfortable. Unfortunately the material on top ripped within a week, but we‚Äôre stuck rocking them!"
4.0,The magnet itself was tarnished but otherwise  held up ok. The CZ was sparkly.
4.0,"5'2"" 140lbs, 36DDD.  After looking at other reviews, I decided to get a large.  It's lightweight and cozy.  Perfect over a tank on slightly cool days, the gym and breatfeeding... I hit all 3 in one sweater!  I nd a functioning hood bc I like to work out with it on.  I had wished there were more pics in the reviews with hoods, so that's why I attached a pic with the hood on.  It's a decent size hood which is great.  It hits a little lower than the bust on me, more like the narrowest part of my waist.  I bought the pink one ans the red (c'est la vie one).  The red one does have a raw hem line and the pink one does not.<br /><br />My reason for 4 stars is the price.  It's a little pricey for a thin cropped sweater, but the fit and comfortability is pretty good.  I hope this review helps others!!"
4.0,"This is a nice bracelet - hefty, quality, shiny, pretty. It was a gift-with-purchase so I have no complaints about the price. The bracelets I purchased which qualified me for this gift are what I have an issue with, but the one is nice."
4.0,"Nice and stylish for the money.  Received in a timely manner.  Wore it in Duluth, MN during a very cold weekend, and it kept me warm.  Received several compliments."
4.0,so this dress is for work i wear it once a week lots of compliments. I have short arms so i can never zip the dress myself i do with the shoulder straps were a little wider to completely catch bra strap slips other than that its great for the price.
4.0,They are average quality socks but a huge hit with my daughter.  I wanted to get her a little gift or International MCR Day as it was a big deal to her an her friends.  She loves these socks and wears them almost every day.  She has a size 9 foot and they fit just fine and are holding up well so far.
4.0,"‚Äò‚ÄòTis is such a cute dress. My daughter is 5‚Äô5‚Äù 120 lbs and it hits at her knee. We were slightly disappointed because the sides of the dress are shorter than the rest of the dress... like a women‚Äôs fitted button up shirt. It doesn‚Äôt really show that in the picture, but the sides are at least 2 inches shorter than the front and back. We had to buy some leggings to wear under it so she felt comfortable wearing it. She is short so for taller girls this would be something to consider before buying. Cute dress though and she loves it."
4.0,"This dress was pretty and nice material. However, It was much too large in all areas."
4.0,Very figure flattering. Material is lightweight too!
4.0,"Very cute slouchy sweatshirt, but a nice trendy vibe to the casual look."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for someone else.<br /><br />If the stock image is anything to base judgement on, then this is definitely a handmade item, as the one I received varied *significantly* from the provided image. It was still an owl, but the body shape and detail was completely different, and especially (most noticeably) the eyes -- I would go so far to judge the aesthetics of the one I received as being inferior to the one presented in the official image for this product posting. Hence I give 4 stars because of the failure to manage expectations and the significant variance in what I would call aesthetic quality. The one in the photo must have been carved by a pro, and the one I received looked either rushed or amateur by comparison.<br /><br />This is still a quality product and made a great gift for someone who hadn't seen the original image and had no such expectations."
4.0,This shirt is really cute and it fits perfectly but its made out of a weird swimsuit material.
4.0,"i love the look of a long duster with dresses and pants.  this one is a bit shorter, which is nice with a short dress."
4.0,"I like them, but I was disappointed that they ran wide for my foot. I don't wear them because I need a smaller size. The color, material, and style are great!"
4.0,Got this for our flower girls. The 3 year old lost the charm in a day. Probably more due to the 3 year old than the charm :)
4.0,"Parts of the band have some discoloration, but apart from that i like it, you are able to take links it to adjust the size. Color matches the rose gold Apple Watch. Fast shipping too. Will deff but again if need be."
4.0,Pretty short but nice
4.0,Love this dress! Light weight wore it to dinner with some friends would definitely recommend
4.0,"Bought these after having plantar fasciitis surgery and my podiatrist said I shouldn't go barefoot around the house anymore. That was almost 5 months ago. I use these slippers every day.  I have walked short distances without them, and end up looking for them. Only knock on them is that they are much bigger than I expected.<br />I like that the insole is removable. I can put my custom orthotic insoles in while I wash the originals."
4.0,Thanks for asking!
4.0,Returned.  But beautify
4.0,The quality on these is about what I expected. The fabric is nice and thick without being bulky. Love that there is great coverage in the crotch area. Not just a thin line of lined lace like my VS ones.  Some defects such as lace splitting on the hip and the bow in the front coming undone.  Both minor.<br />As far as sizing I normally  wear a VS large  (I've got about 40&#34; hip)  but went down a size per the suggestion of other reviews.  This turned out to be a mistake. The mediums were a tad small especially on my butt.  I think the large would have been perfect. Overall I'm happy with this purchase and would buy these again.
4.0,"Besides the terrible branding for this product, you can‚Äôt beat the price with or it‚Äôs wicking capability. I use it for cycling and running and it hugs the head without getting on the way of my helmet. And since they‚Äôre so fordable I buy a few of them every season."
4.0,It's a good case my over sunglasses fit in it .
4.0,love it  its beautiful
4.0,Godd quality sturdy shoe for an active child. Mine just isnt that excited to wear them unfortunately.
4.0,The Product work well. It was received well!
4.0,This is lovely. Just as pictured. I've only worn for a couple days. Let's see how it stands up.
4.0,"Fit well, my son loves them for sports"
4.0,It ran small but was loosing weight somit was fine..
4.0,"I am 5'6"", 150lbs, 36-30-39 and this dress fit me well (I am usually a medium and purchased a medium).  The fabric is thin but since it was such a dark color I didn't feel the need to wear a slip.  It is not stretchy, but the straps are adjustable, the waist portion is an appliqu√© of sorts that is slightly stretchy, and the skirt is flowing.  It has a racerback and one slit that came to my knee.  I was expecting this dress to be a nice navy color with white flowers per the online pictures but it is a much darker navy and there is brown in with the white.  I still think the pattern is pretty though.  My only qualms with this dress is that the zipper (on the side) is very hard to get up since it needs to go through the 'lacey' waist portion which overlaps the zipper almost since it is thicker than the dress material; the underarm area is a little loose but not too droopy; and the straps are so thin and delicate the adjusters slip along them easily so you have to readjust as the day goes on."
4.0,"Prints are great , handles are a bit shorter than l had wanted so it is a bit of a job to get onto shoulder. It slips off a bit also. Great for a small shopping trip. Have them in car and other places to grab on the go. Excellent for travel!?!?"
4.0,Fits fine! The font isn‚Äôt what was displayed on the image.
4.0,"WILL NOT FIT 4-5 year olds. Product is way too large. Very true to image and quality seems nice, but way to large. 4 stars due to sizing."
4.0,Loved the purse. Not to big and not to small.
4.0,"Fit great, and worked great for our wedding in the summertime. Sash didn't quite stay on as expected. Dress served its purpose for the price. Super light weight and easy to store/clean."
4.0,Great product and quality for the price. Long enough for waist and torso coverage.
4.0,Love the hoodie.. great material and well made.. the only thing is I have been buying 3xl in other hoodies and this 3xl fits bigger then most.. I could use a 2xl in this one..
4.0,"I have high arches, and these slippers have great arch support.  The are very comfy, and warm."
4.0,Runs a tad bit small but overall looks exactly as pictured and comfortable. Give it a wash first (you always should!) but it‚Äôs definitely a little stiff at first
4.0,The inside of this hoodie is so soft and comfortable!  I could wear it everyday.
4.0,"Kind of hard to stay on, but looks really good. Didn't take long to ship even though it said it'd take a month."
4.0,Super comfortable and super cute!  Doublju also makes this same dress in a midi-length with long sleeves and it is just as beautiful and flattering.  I wear a small and this fit was true to size.
4.0,"Gift for my mother inlaw, My wife really likes this and is excited to give this to her mom."
4.0,Fabric light weight and  fits well.
4.0,Cute and warm (top) for wife to wear.  Was somewhat stiff and rigid but a couple of washes later it is soft and comfortable as expected.  No signs of fade or bleeding so overall very happy.  The one star  lost is for the number of times it needed to be washed to be comfortable.<br /><br />**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review of the product.
4.0,"Nice quality and fits perfect for my Huawei watch, if you want to switch to a formal watch this is the band you should get. It is very comfortable and seems to be durable as well."
4.0,It was just a little smaller than expected
4.0,"While it fits well, feels nice, and even looks very nice I am having a considerable amount of trouble wearing anything else with it as it attracts other materials like a static magnet mixed with cockleburs. I can't wear it with coats or jackets because if I take them off it looks like I rolled in lint. This isn't a problem for other shirts I own."
4.0,like it should have order width smaller
4.0,"Doubles, maybe even triples the life of the heels on my boots."
4.0,"I have a small nose and it's very hard to find sunglasses that don't slide down my nose ruining my makeup. When I use these comfortable rubber pieces my glasses stay in place all day. The only reason I took off one star is because it can be a bit difficult to get the glasses on my ears, without the rubber pieces turning different ways. But once they're in place they make all my glasses fit perfectly! You get so many pairs, they're durable and well worth the price."
4.0,"It was smaller than I expected, but it was quite easy to take the side seams out & re-sew them on my machine.  They are straight seams right down the sides.  It's very comfortable.  Just be aware it's very shear!"
4.0,My big guy was very pleased with the length the waist tho was a bit too large.
4.0,The size was a lot big for me. Loved the color and texture of the fabric. Needed to purchase a size down. Choose to keep the product just the same.. can't wait for an exchange.
4.0,It had deeper purple's in the tie and handkerchief then showed in picture. It was even nicer than we thought it would be.
4.0,Love these slippers. Perfect fit and comfort!
4.0,Can't believe this product actually works.  I purchased this for my boys for Christmas and the love them!  Easy to sync their iPhones to listen to music or even talk.  Kool product for anyone!
4.0,but really cute still worth what little money they asked for it.
4.0,"Was hoping for a larger watch face, as most chronograph watches are, but still a nice time piece. Have recieved a few compliments."
4.0,I love this top.  I have one in black and one in white.  The design has a nice flowing look to it and is perfect for showing off strappy sports bras.
4.0,"Cute necklace, looks exactly as pictured."
4.0,I wore this with a pair of leggings for Thanksgiving and I just loved it! I got so many compliments. Everyone loved it!
4.0,It fits rights looks exactly like the picture
4.0,Everyone was amused.
4.0,"before I purchased the skirt I read the comments and a lot of ppl say it run small.. because of it I bought a size up. It was a mistake, it runs too large and I had to return it. I'll buy another size because I liked so much. If you want to buy just follow the measure chart. I'm 5.6"" 147 lbs and 26"" waist , I bought a Large size and it runs tooooo large."
4.0,"I'm pleasantly surprised. It's actually decent quality and a good fit. I would warm that if you have thick arms this may not be the best for you, but it's not see-through and the color is as pictured."
4.0,Easy use and cheaper compare to going to the shop to have one installed for you. My ring size is 6 but and am size 5.5  I didn‚Äôt want to resize my ring for future reasons so the ring guard came handy. With this ring guard keeps the ring from moving back and forth as I have my ring on 247. I will recommend this item if you don‚Äôt want to resize your ring.
4.0,Nice product I would buy it again
4.0,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. It is baggy. I would never have been able to pull this off since it's oversized.
4.0,"Loved this dress but it was too big.  I am 5'6&#34;, 38 chest, 32 waist, 38 hip and the XL was too big.  It has a stretch to the material so take that into consideration when ordering.  There's a lot of room in the front with the gathered material."
4.0,"Pretty dress but very large, I kept to wear as a beach coverup"
4.0,"Great look, but a little heavy."
4.0,Size is smaller for my daughter.
4.0,Good value & style
4.0,These are lovely and don't look cheap. I gave 4 stars because they tangle easy and I have to keep fixing them. But I've received compliments and am happy with them
4.0,"This dress is really pretty and I got a ton of compliments on it. The material is fairly thick, it kind of feels like a tablecloth but it's not something someone not actually wearing the dress would notice. I'm a size 4-6 and ordered my usual medium and it was way too big. I then ordered an XS (by accident, thinking it was a S) and it actually fit perfectly, so it runs a little large. I'm 5'5 ~130lbs."
4.0,The front bow fell off from the git go.  But it didn't take away from the overall look of the dress.
4.0,"I use it EVERY day.<br />You get used to the quirky-ness of opening and closing the glasses.<br />it does not have polarity in the sense right to left or upside down does not matter, the nose bridge is slightly small but it is okay for short time. anyways this is to be used only when you don't have the bulky readers handy<br />I which it came with a tube case as well. Leather or stainless steel or non-scuff aluminum."
4.0,Very different - got plenty of compliments on it.
4.0,"The green is more if a hunter green than what is pictured, but it's really comfy and fits great!"
4.0,"The dress was not exactly what I had expected, but still was nice. The fit was good. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'2 & 129lbs. The color looked to be more of a Kelley Green online and was more of a Jungle Green when I received it. Also, it wasn't as much &#34;off the shoulder&#34; as I thought it would be. Overall happy about it. Got lots of compliments! 4 stars for color."
4.0,This dress fits as expected - I paired mine with a belt to give it some shape and loved it!
4.0,Nice watch for price. The only criticism is the time-setting head is a little hard to grasp & keeps closing when you try to set the dial.
4.0,Cheap but works.  Love the colors.
4.0,"Love the ring. Metal is very bendable, constantly have to bend back in place."
4.0,Very light weight. I expect it to shrink and be a better fit.
4.0,This is a good gown.  It is standard cotton and I was hoping for something exceptionally soft but that is not the case with this product.  I am a size 8/10 up top and a size 12 below and the Medium fit perfect.
4.0,"These look so nice, and big and well-made, but they are a little heavier than i expected, so I don't wear them for long periods of time. My ears are sensitive, and they treat them very well. High quality!"
4.0,It's a good dress I recommend this dress
4.0,"130lb 5'3&#34;.. I got small.  It fits very well. Good to have pockets. The fabric is light. The color looks a bit dimmer than the picture, but I really like it. The reason I gave 4 starts instead of 5 is that the price was originally $8 + $3 shipping, then somehow it got changed to the amazon prime $16. So, I paid $16.  Then, a few days later, it got changed back to $8 + $3 shipping.  I could have saved $5.  I am not going to worry about $5 since I really like it.<br />Another complaint I found about this dress is that the fabric is not much absorbent.  Sweat does not get absorbed, but drops along my back."
4.0,Fit and the look of the dress
4.0,"These are the cheapest Sunglasses that I have found in a store or on the web, and I love them. They come in different styles and colors, and I hope to get a couple of the other kinds soon, I like the fact that they are mirrored and extremely dark. They even come with a bag to put them in when not in use. I love these sunglasses, very good for outside activities and driving."
4.0,"Quality is good really good, I was hesitant to order a snap back online especially since ones in the past has been crap material and not solid at all. But my friend received it and he was happy"
4.0,"My kiddo loves it but the tail portion, the Velcro wasn‚Äôt sewn super secure so it‚Äôs already failing and in need of some help which of course is the spot that has the most use stress. Otherwise, this is super fun!! My kiddo LOVES zebras!!"
4.0,"Next time will order a size up, but well made and warm."
4.0,These are adorable!  They stay on nicely and attract many compliments.
4.0,"Nice, stylish eyeglasses. Exactly as pictured. Good clear lenses. Look good on me, and on my husband. Wish they were even darker, but pretty pleased with them even as it is."
4.0,"They‚Äôre ok, they are not capri or ankle in me ha. The material is a bit weird, stretchy tho.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 160 ordered the large. Glad I didn‚Äôt go with the medium. I‚Äôll keep them but they are different then what I was expecting."
4.0,Incredibly cute but i have a small waist and my hips aren't i didn't want to get a larger size to accommodate them because then the waist would be too big
4.0,"I read multiple reviews that suggested letting the belt ""cure"" in sunlight before wearing and I took that advice.  Let it hang in a sun drenched window for two days (one day on each side of the belt).  On the first few wears it left a stain ring on my khakis.  No issues with my jeans.  Happy with the quality, sizing was accurate."
4.0,"Comfy, gets a bunch of compliments"
4.0,"I love the spandex material, it really holds your tummy in."
4.0,Need to order 1 size up than what you wrar
4.0,Son loved it !<br />Great look ..
4.0,This is cute and a good price.  Gets baggy after a little while of wearing though.
4.0,It‚Äôs super cute. My 2 year old loves it. Used it when we went to Disneyland.
4.0,"I am about a size 8/10 and ordered a large. The fit was great and it‚Äôs not too tight. My only complaint is that it is rather sheer, so you‚Äôll need to wear a tank under it."
4.0,"Looks great, true to size! Durable!"
4.0,The Gailife bra is pretty. The fabric is smooth and soft. The pink color is almost a nude for a fair complexion woman. The straps are elastic which should keep them from slipping. I wear a D cup. The bra didn't provide any support for me. My side boobs showed. The V plunge was too low for me. This would be a great bra for a woman with a smaller bust.
4.0,These are good quality braided leather bracelets that come in easy colors to work with
4.0,"Lovely earrings, was just a bit unimpressed with the debt that came on the biggest pair of earrings included in this set of 5. Luckily I am very thankful that when I called and spoke with an Amazon representative she resolved the issue by offering me a discounted price on the set in a courtesy coupon towards my next purchase."
4.0,Tal como lo describen
4.0,Good quality shoe but took so long to get here that my granddaughter outgrew them before they arrived.
4.0,"i tried several sports bra, and this la isla level 4 high impact beats the other ones. i even paid to try the the expensive $50 bra the verona? and my  boobs still bounced. this one holds it in place pretty well. highly recommend! it is even better than my champions 360 maximum support bra. i am a 32D/32DD cup size"
4.0,Lovely colorful dangling earrings. But very fragile. You must be very careful with them.
4.0,"Overall, good. True to size. Sleeves are a more fitter cut than I wanted."
4.0,"Part of the chain broke after a little while, but it's still a fairly strong and beautiful item."
4.0,"These fit nicely and the construction is decently well done.  I think they should last at least a year with weekly use and washing.  I would give these a good 4 star rating.<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
4.0,Beautiful color and expected fit. The shorts portion is a touch shorter than I was expecting but overall I like the look. I am a little concerned that there were a few stray threads when it arrived. I guess I'll see if they become a problem...
4.0,I love the way they feel and fit. Im a size L. 5foot6inches and weigh 165. The length of the arms reach my hands. (That never happens!) And the length of the shirt hit right below my belt. But they ride up really bad.
4.0,This bag is just as displayed. It appears sturdy and has a naturally  beautiful leather sheen
4.0,I purchased a orange color it's bright with lots of room!
4.0,My love it...
4.0,"Every time I wear these, I hear a compliment or two. They are little tight on my very wide feet, but I love them anyway!"
4.0,"These goggles feel great on my face and take the glare off the sun. They have a soft spongey edge so although they fit tight they don't feel bad. But they have a bar that goes through the front of the goggles that bothers my sight a little. It isn't terrible but because the glasses are set offfrom the face because of the soft edge, my eyes pick up that middle bar that most goggles don't have. It doesn't bother my husbands vision but does mine. They come with a cleaning cloth and soft carry bag which is nice."
4.0,Fit well. Got the swimsuit at a discounted price and for what I paid it fits pretty well. It comes with around the neck straps too. The material isn't cheap feeling either.
4.0,These fit true to size. Very comfortable. The only thing I would warn about is that they draw up significantly if dried and are slightly tight at the drawstring on the bottoms if you are curvy.
4.0,"Little too perky for my liking, and says 40 inch but it's not.  Very comfortable with bras extension."
4.0,"There‚Äôs an expensive big name company that has a similar style coat for a much bigger price so I was excited to find this one! It‚Äôs well made, and seems durable.<br /><br />But the sizing is off. I received a size large. I typically wear a large and sometimes a medium. I put it on immediately, excited about it, for it to be too small. My daughter who wears a small/medium put it on and it fit her perfectly. The picture is of her wearing it.<br /><br />I‚Äôd definitely recommend buying at least one size larger than you typically wear. Check your measurements, then use the chart provided above to confirm which size is best for you. If you get your size, this is a great value!"
4.0,"These are made for giants. If you have a smaller wrist the design is flawed unless they come out with a shorter length strap. To pull it thought so your HRM can work, you have to thread the excess band through and let it sit under the strap - which causes the strap to not be as tight as it should be to accommodate the excess band.<br /><br />I really like it I just wish they offered a shorter length and made it very clear this was for larger wrist sizes. I‚Äôm average height and build for a grown man and if I was any smaller or a woman or child this would be completely unuseable."
4.0,It is of excellent material..Jt is a little tight although I feel as you wear it it will loosen up a bit I really like it and I think you will too
4.0,I received this ring at a discount for my honest review.  The ring is very pretty and sparkly.  I thought the stones would be more channel set.  They protrude somewhat so they don't set smooth on the ring.  The stones are set evenly around the ring and each has a nice sparkle.  My concern is I hope the stones don't fall out or get knocked out.  It wouldn't be work getting it fixed and it is a pretty ring to have to throw away.  I have since received several compliments on this ring.  I wear it as a wedding band when I don't want to wear my real diamonds.  I am very glad I purchased it.
4.0,"Bought a medium for my husband who is 5""10 175-180lbs. It is bit loose but not prominently.Its warm, and can sustain dipping temperatures with a layer."
4.0,Fit well & very comfortable.
4.0,Nice socks. Longer than expected
4.0,"A tad slipperier(?) than I like my bowties, but good quality. The plastic length variant is sturdy and the tie itself bends nicely."
4.0,Very comfortable.  They're not too bulky to wear underneath bootcut jeans and look great over jeans too!  Compared to similar styled boots they're definitely a good buy.
4.0,"Very nice.. However, not snug against my 15in calf."
4.0,I bought this to wear on colder mornings under my full-face motorcycle helmet.  It takes me a couple of attempts to get it to sit right (the helmet pushes down the part that goes over my mouth so I  have to pull it back up.  I also wish the neck went down a little further so I had more coverage.  Since I am using it in a way that it wasn't really intended for I didn't knock any stars off.  I did remove one because it started to tear after only a few wears at one of the seams.  I did a quick little stitching and it has held up since but I was surprised that it would have torn so quickly.
4.0,Fits the watch face.<br />Smoother edges would be a plus.
4.0,The wind gets right through it.
4.0,"I like the red and white stitching near the buckle. I am not familiar with the brand, but I like how they very subtly incorporate their logo on the belt and the packaging. It‚Äôs done in a very classy way.<br /><br />The belt is a lighter shade of brown than what you see pictured. The buckle is a bit wider than I would have liked- measurements are pictured. The prong feels like it should be tightened. The material was cut in a way where the edges of the belt are frail.  All in all, it‚Äôs still a pretty nice looking belt. It looks good with a pair of dark denim jeans.<br /><br />As far as sizing, the belt is about 42 inches long. The buckle is 2 inches and the holes start at 4 inches. We have the belt in size 34. The belt is a bit on the larger side."
4.0,"Got this ring for my girlfriend and she loves it, only takes it off when she showers. Fits great and looks good too but skulls do seem to be really tiny, who cares for the price right?"
4.0,The dress was very cute and well made. The only problem I had was that it was a little shorter than expected so I just used it as Christmas pajama shirt.
4.0,"I bought this necklace for a great price.... about the same as a fast food combo meal. For the money I am very pleased with it. The chain is sparkly and I like how dainty it is. You could wear this with anything because it is not overly dressy. The chain can be clasped at 2 spots. (I wear it longer, around 18 inches or so.) It also comes in a velvet box. The negatives I noticed are that the arch is semi- flexible and not really perfectly shaped. Also one of the stones on my necklace is either a little bit smaller than the others or is not set 100% straight. But overall, at the price I paid, I am pleased."
4.0,"Pretty hat, smaller than it was said to be and di not give at all. For smaller heads."
4.0,"For reference I am 5'1 and 115lbs roughly, and I ordered an XS. I am always a bit nervous ordering clothing, especially leggings, online. But to my surprise they actually fit really well! I could have been okay with the small, but if you want a nice compression legging, sizing down helps. Being short I didn't have any issues with the length. They hit right above my ankle which is my preferred length! They make your legs look really nice and add a good lift to your booty without making it look to squished. They also hold in the tummy really well without being painful or uncomfortable. The only issue I had was if I tried to pull them up a little higher it outlined my lady area weird. Not exactly a camel toe since there is no seam right there, but it definitely showed an outline. I just wear a longer shirt when I workout in them, or I don't pull them up to be high waisted. Other than that, a great purchase!!"
4.0,It is thin material but soft. Love!
4.0,I ordered this dress last week and love it! It's a very crisp fabric and came folded neatly in cute packaging and was so crease free I didn't have to iron it before wearing it (ideal cause I hate ironing). It fit a bit larger than I expected (I'm a size 2 and ordered the small) but I like the classic &#34;roman holiday&#34; feel of the dress. Perfect for summer and love the pale pink color.
4.0,"The item is as expected.  This is not the most fashionable hat, but it worked well at keeping the sun off my face and my neck, and allowed me to have my hair up in a ponytail at the same time."
4.0,"Day one, genuinely impressed by the build quality. Especially for the price I got it at."
4.0,Colors don't go together but it is a good value for the price. I recieved a mix of plain and bright colors. Most likely would order again.
4.0,"I do like this stylish dress very much.  Had to take it to have it altered at waist.  Other than that, it looks really cute when you wear it."
4.0,"A fun tie to add to my small collection of jazz-themed neckties.  For my neck-size (66) and torso length (I'm short), much of the bell of the trumpet is lost in the knot, but anyone who knows musical instruments will appreciate the design.  The blend of colors is also very versatile.  It goes nicely on white, blue, or tan shirt paired with grey, blue, tan, or olive slacks.  It does sadden me, though, to think how many little polyesters gave their lives for my pleasure."
4.0,Nice chain with lobster claw clasp.  My only issue with the item is that the edges are &#34;stamped&#34; rather than rounded smooth.
4.0,"Pros: Easy to put on, don‚Äôt leave marks on foot, clean easily.<br /><br />Cons: sole insert moves around and is difficult to move back into place sometimes."
4.0,"Really love this! Perfect, brilliant red. I have very long arms and it fits wonderfully!"
4.0,Cute coverup
4.0,This is nice to just grab for a trip to the grocery store. I don't like bulky handbags so this is good for me.  The only thing I wished could be different is to make it a little shorter.
4.0,Loved it. Another friend ordered the same style and told me the suits ran small. I ordered one size larger when ordering and it fit perfect.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:beb97641d1687557bc910d89f1c908c]] It‚Äôs pretty tough not to smile when looking at this purse! This purse looks just like the advertised photo and is chicken lovers friendly.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not an especially large purse, but it could hold keys, a wallet, and a phone fine. It‚Äôs very lightweight and the strap adjusts to size. There‚Äôs also a little open side pocket that could fit something small too.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not the highest quality, but it‚Äôs an affordable price, so I think you‚Äôre getting what you pay for here. The zipper feels a little like it could break easily, so I‚Äôd try to be careful when opening and closing it.<br /><br />Otherwise, it‚Äôs a perfect purse for chicken fans!"
4.0,"looks a bit dressier in the picture, very pretty"
4.0,"Quality of material is good. Free flowing. Love it. I normally wear large or x large. However bought a large, it fits well"
4.0,"It is a very nice bag, but the color on the website was not as it appeared in the picture.  It was a darker shade of brown rather than how it appeared (maroon)."
4.0,"It's a tad snug, but overall fits nicely. Very very warm. Looks nice. Overall much better than I expected for the cost.  However, the fur pom pom is not attached well so fell off after wearing less than 10 times."
4.0,Came quickly. Fits well but needs something under it to layer as is thin. Had to iron
4.0,I really liked it but I am petite with large cups so almost didn't fit right.
4.0,Nice to cover wrists while waving. Textured palms make it easier to pick-up small items.
4.0,"Fit exactly as I wanted, no tightness or awkward walking needed to keep these shorts in place. Loose enough but not sloppy looking! Washed up pretty nicely for 100 % cotton."
4.0,"Nice summer material , style free , you can make it relaxed or more fitted. sleeves are too large as for me. But i still like it.  i m size 2, got S, but would be better xs ."
4.0,Got a large so that it was baggy and ended up being way too big. Fits my mom (a xxl) perfect. Is super soft though and has 2 decent sized pockets. Would get again in a smaller size.
4.0,The color wore off the chain and clasp quickly but other than that it's easy to put on with one hand and the main band of the watch still looks good
4.0,"Good deal. Comfy, go for it."
4.0,Very cute and pockets are really deep! They fit my large phablet phone well. Dress is durable with a good weight and flowy style. But... took off a star because it came dirty with a dusty footprint on the front.
4.0,"Look exactly as advertised. Good size, not too big not too small. Work well for blocking sun rays. And are super cute too! Will definitely buy again."
4.0,Attractive and comfortable for warm weather. Looks like linen.
4.0,Easy Halloween Costume.<br />Like: length<br />Dislike: Material (thought it would be cotton)
4.0,I do like these shoes and they are very cute. The only issue is they are a bit narrow at the toes for wide feet. I did the freezer/water trick to stretch them out a bit and they're much better now.  Good shoes for the price.
4.0,"Robe in size small is a good fit for me  (*5 feet about 110 lbs)  - Washed and dried delicate cool - no lit or fuzz!!<br />Sleeves are alittle too long and I will fix that as I hate to have my sleeves  drooling around.  This robe uses snaps for closures - all fine - none missing  or bent.  Stitching is good  and robe seems sturdy.  fabic is quite soft on the inside.  I chose dark blue and there is dark blue embroidery on the yoke.  This is my second MIss Elaine robe.  It is not ""cute"" or sexy but iit is easy to get in and out of - has good size pockets.  I have wasted money on prettier robes that were too long  - too big in the shoulders and  overall did not fit.  If yu are looking for a practical robe check Miss Elaine out."
4.0,I ordered a large & it definitely was on the small size. I'm guessing this is a size 10. Pretty denim skirt. Love the style.
4.0,"Very cute and comfy, got it for a party.  Easy to dress up and down.  I'm usually a size 8, got medium.  I bought the wine color, its honestly more pink (lighter) then wine red."
4.0,"A very nice costume piece. Sturdy, thick leather, nice snaps, and new looking. I am going to have to put some &#34;weather&#34; on it before I wear it at a pirate faire, but I look forward to the way my costume will look."
4.0,"Initially I thought I should have purchased a size larger, the longer I wore it and the more compliments I received, I realized it was meant to fit above my natural waist. Now I only wish it came in different colors!"
4.0,I liked it bought it didn't wear it because my daughter said it looks like clown shoes
4.0,"I really love how beautiful this skirt is, but it's just so big. I am a small person. I wear a US junior's size 5, and I'm about 5'2&quot;, and this skirt is about 6 inches too long for me. It's also loose on my waist. If it wasn't for the drawstring inside I don't think that I would have been able to wear this skirt. I had to roll the skirt up using the waistband in order to wear it and not trip on the skirt. I also had to wear a corset over it to prevent it from falling down.<br /><br />I really really love this skirt, and maybe I'll figure out some way to make it a little shorter, but it's hard to wear it as it is."
4.0,Seems to run small.  Nice fabric and pretty print.
4.0,"Something about this dress warned me to order up a size, so I did. It's still slightly snug, but more form-fitting than tight. The fabric is nice and thick, but there's not going to be any hiding!"
4.0,The fabric is that moisture wick shiny stuff and the black shirt was not a tank top but instead a t-shirt.  I wear them but they are not what I expected.  I am still on the hunt for the best not shiny running shirts.
4.0,"These sunglasses looked fabulous on,but for me they were to tight behind my ears. I so wished I could have worn them."
4.0,Really cute!! Was a little smaller than expected
4.0,"A nice shirt to hide arm flab, but accents the ‚Äúmom pooch‚Äù. Overall, I dig it."
4.0,"I'm so happy that I ordered the medium. These sizes definitely run a bit large and I wanted a loose, flowing top.  It hangs to mid thigh on my frame and will be forgiving of my weight fluctuations.<br /><br />The colors are true to the image and it appears well made.  The black pattern is slightly stiff, like an iron-on appliqu√©.  My only concern is that it will hold up to multiple washings.<br /><br />Overall pleased with fit and style.  Good for casual but easy to dress up, too."
4.0,The outfit was smaller than expected. I bought it as a gift for my fianc√©.
4.0,Nice look to this necklace - I ordered a second one in teal / navy blue.
4.0,I'm 6ft wear size 11M & 10W  and i have problem finding a comfortable fits in shoes ...So my only problem is that it a bit tight across my lil toe area and my feet is very narrow but other wise i love this boot.
4.0,My daughter loves these items and uses them often.
4.0,"I have this dress in blue, i love it so much i ordered it in white."
4.0,This is good looking watch at a great price.  Placing the minutes of the hour outside the hours of the day is inspired; more watch makers should offer this option.  Looks more expensive than it is.  Highly recommended.
4.0,Got this for my sister and she loved it. Quality is not perfect (definitely some scuffs and little scratches) but I'd say the quality matches the price.
4.0,I purchase the dark grey and it‚Äôs more of a light navy blue  other than that I‚Äôm happy with my purchase
4.0,"This hat and glove set was cute, soft and of good quality.  However, it was much too small for my 5 year old, so I had to send it back."
4.0,Could be a bit warmer.  The leather looks fabulous.
4.0,"really like it, but its a bit too short on the waist for me; it ends up rolling up a bit creating a &#34;bubbly look&#34; that i personally dont love; have to keep on pulling it down"
4.0,"I have longer arms than most so this isn‚Äôt quite kings enough which is my only complaint. I got the yellow and black but the yellow is nothing like the picture, but I still like it. It‚Äôs warm and cozy. 5‚Äù4 150ish lbs and I got a L"
4.0,I love it but it runs really small.
4.0,"I ordered the plus size Capri style 2 pack in size 0X. I guess that's just XL, since that's what I got. I wasn't really sure what size to get to be honest. I wear an XL in gap yoga pants, but those are far stretchier than these. I'm 5'3 and 190lbs, mostly in the stomach area.<br /><br />I was surprised that the material on these were sort of compression like. They weren't totally like Spanx or anything, but they weren't cotton either. They have that compression feel and I love that they didn't ride down while running or doing yoga. They took some getting used to because of the material but overall, I'm happy."
4.0,"This is a great shirt. My only complaint is the collar never stays in the position I want it to. Not sure if that is a characteristic of polyester, or if I'm too lazy to care for it correctly."
4.0,"Cute bracelet.  Overall, it is a nice bracelet to add the the arm candy.  The wax is a little messy and noticeable on the inside but barely noticeable on the outside of my black bracelet.  The bronze alloy looks is a little bit tacky if observed too closely.  I received this product at a discounted price for my fair and unbiased review."
4.0,"I really like it and wanted to give 5 stars but the main zipper will only work smoothly in one direction, not both directions.  Other than that it is a wonderful piece of luggage for carry on.<br />I would have returned for a different one to check the zipper but I didn't have time."
4.0,it is a still a little to big for my 3 year old but it is cute
4.0,"Gained a little weight to where my jeans and other pants/shorts are tight fitting where it's kinda hard to button them up. So I bought these because of the stretch quality. And I have to say they are some of the most comfortable shorts I've ever worn. They're just a little too loose. I actually need a belt to wear the pair I purchased. I'm definitely buying another pair, but in a smaller size (my tight fitting pants size). And I suggest if you want to purchase a pair of these you do the same. I'll update my review after I get the new pair if needed be. Hope this is helpful."
4.0,Doesn't fit my body good
4.0,"This does not run true to size. I had to return it and order the next size up. Overall for the price, it‚Äôs a good value and the color is AMAZING!"
4.0,Ordered this for my 7 year old son for Dr Seuss PJ day at school . He loved it .
4.0,The only downside to this mask was how big it was. I had to sew it so that it didn't look like a huge diaper on my face lol. But very nice and perfect for my wedding!
4.0,"I bought these to wear with &#34;low profile&#34; shoes, like my slip ons/loafer type deals. They go too far up the foot to work with ballet flats, but I have a few pairs of loafer/boat shoe type deals that I wear to work, and these work perfect.<br /><br />This fit about as I expected to- I wear a size 8.5. I can't tell if they run a little small, or if the material is really thin, because when I put them on, the fabric on top is pretty thin, and I can see my toes. I'm used to wearing stockings, so this doesn't bother me, but I can't say yet how quickly these may wear out. the heel has handy dandy silicone grippy things to hold them up on the back of your feet which is nice, since other low cut socks I've tried have a tendency to slip off.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for trying the product out and giving my honest and unbiased review. That said, I only accept promotional items that I would actually purchase for myself and my family, and that I believe to be a good, quality product. The discount in no way affect my opinion, rating, or review of a product in question. I am in no way a &#34;power reviewer&#34;- I am just a lady, with a family and sometimes I'm asked to give my opinion on stuff.<br /><br />Please note I have no relationship with this seller and I‚Äôm not compensated in any way for my review."
4.0,"Nice, it look well build. I gave 4 start because the internal pockets are smaller than I expected while the whole wallet is big, no espace for coins. My credit card fit but there are a little bigger cards that are not able to fit in the card spaces."
4.0,The bracelet came in super quickly! It was a little big on my wrist but I can adjust it. Very cute! I would recommend this to anyone!
4.0,Seem to be able to put on easier than other brands.
4.0,The fit was tighter than expedited.  It does it's job as far as sweating during your work out.  My husband wears it during his workout at the gym.  He is losing weight but can't say it all comes from this product.  But I can say that it makes you sweat.
4.0,Not as heavy as I thought but good sweatshirt
4.0,Nice top and love the color.
4.0,I really wished this dress fit. But it was too tight in all the wrong places. Not very becoming so I sent it back.
4.0,The only thing that I like about this band is the color otherwise I hate that it feels too thick in your wrist. Is not that comfortable to tell you the truth
4.0,"I got these for my six-month-old daughter and think they are just the cutest little pair of shoes.<br />I love the converse lookalike style; they look cute with just about any outfit and I just love the pretty light pink color.<br /><br />They are good quality and appear to be comfortable for my little one to wear.<br />They are pretty easy to take off and on, and most importantly, provide pretty good support for my baby's feet.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the sizing is off just a bit and will warn that they do run a little big.<br />This wasn't a deal breaker for me considering my daughter has been growing like a weed."
4.0,Weird chest stiffness. Returned
4.0,"A nice accent, but really small."
4.0,"Nice item, but runs very large, had to return.<br />Return was taken care of in a timely manner."
4.0,Makes my legs hot and warm. Stretchy.
4.0,Love the fabric and the fits well
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter(8) hoping that it would fit, it did.  It probably would not fit a large wrist.  The quality is fine, not great but not too cheap."
4.0,fun garden gadget
4.0,"They are lovely, but the magnets are so strong that I can't leave them on my ears very long.  They also stick to anything metal in sight.  You may want to consider using less intense magnets."
4.0,"While I love the print and the bag overall, it was NOT what I was expecting. I was willing to pay more ($17.99) for this pattern than some of the others because the description said it was ""extra large, 26 1/4 x 14 x 10."" I have a couple of other oversize Vera Bradley shopping bags and I love using them for large items. I actually debated between this one and another pattern in the ""standard"" market tote size and decided to pay the extra since I thought this was bigger based on the information provided. When this arrived, I was disappointed to discover that it is the same dimensions as the other Vera Bradley market totes available in other patterns (19 x 14 x 10) for a lower price. Current patterns directly from VB are only $10!! Bottom line - really like the bag but feel cheated by the inflated price and inaccurate description."
4.0,"Comfortable. Durable. Fits as expected. I wear them to play air soft and the hold up to running, falling, and all other things."
4.0,Great deal! Paint chipped on one piece. Over all great product
4.0,"For class plays and costume events this fits the inexpensive bill. My students love it, but the attachment of the feathers to the helmet needs sturdier improvement. It broke off and had to be glued on. However, years later and countless plays...it‚Äôs still hanging in there!"
4.0,"I purchased these for my son's Halloween mask so that he can have the whole shebang. The hand are cool, not very stiff and the price is pretty good. There are Velcro straps behind and the fingers are quite long. It was difficult to hold candy with them on and he needed my help to put the other glove on. I also tried to put them on myself and I also had to get help to put on the second one after I put the first one on myself and then I needed help getting them off. Other than that, I have no other complaints."
4.0,Love the design of the slipper and the colors are great! They dinrun very small. My son wears a size 4 sneaker and I had tonsize up to the XL slipper fornit to fit comfortably.
4.0,"These earrings are nice. Lightweight and not too large. They need to be packaged differently. They were so tightly wrapped with plastic wrap, I almost broke them trying to get them unwrapped."
4.0,"I love these rings (ordered 2 matching rings for my boyfriend and I).  The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star rating is because they do leave residue behind on the skin.  I tried soaking them in jewelry cleaner, which seemed to help."
4.0,Fits well and comfortable. I wear them all the time over my fleece tights.
4.0,"Very Very Very cute... If you are top heavy, expect to go with a different top or something.  The bottom fit nice, but the top is a no go over DD or DDD. I expected this so that's why I give it a good overall rating."
4.0,"Overall cute suit. I have a longer torso so the cup inserts sit a little weird for me, and it‚Äôs a bit too revealing for me without the cups. I am in between sizes so if you‚Äôre like me I would recommend sizing up if possible. Mine was a little more snug than I would like, but still it‚Äôs a cute suit and I plan to keep it!"
4.0,"It is really nice and soft. Squishy but strong. I wish it were a bit wider. I think it supports my high arches. It is very brightly colored. I choose to just wear at home due to the snugness for me, and I think it would get stained with dirt on the street."
4.0,Though I wish the legs was a little bit longer but I still love it.
4.0,Great vest for night running. Shows up well in headlights...
4.0,These are cute little shoes for the price. My daughter is in between sizes so they fit her just a little big but they were narrow enough. She loved them and said they were comfy.
4.0,"Excelente, tengo que decir que tanto las telas como las costuras son de muy buena calidad.. me encant√≥ la cobertura, y la protecci√≥n de este sport bra, el cierre es de gancho y zipper, as√≠que puedo estar tranquila a la hora de entrenar. Las medidas corren al size, usualmente soy talla M y la talla M me qued√≥ perfecto."
4.0,"I received a free item to review.<br /><br />I like the color a lot - kind of a gunmetal grey. There's plenty of stretch to fit comfortably.<br /><br />The material is on the thin side - and it's not Thinsulate, you don't have the extra warmth and it won't 'wick-away' sweat. I wouldn't trust this cap not to soak in heavy rain, but it'll work in moderate cold. It's nothing like the old heavy wool pullover caps from years ago - I'm always on the lookout for them but it seems they're gone forever.<br /><br />I keep a bunch of these caps in a drawer (or more often a jacket pocket): one I don't mind 'getting wet', another for 'exceptionally  cold', 'just chilly and don't want to sweat', 'don't mind getting dirty', etc.. I just accumulate them and  always seem to get more as gifts.<br /><br />I even like the brand patch - makes it easy to line the cap up on my head!"
4.0,"I love the color of these sunglasses. They fit nicely on my nose, and really work well in the sun. They were listed as being good for small faces. I would have given them a 5 rating, but they are actually too wide for my small face. The case for them is very classy."
4.0,"These are bigger lenses than I was expecting, and they are a bit darkly tinted but these will be great this summer"
4.0,"C√≥modos, modernos, el talle perfecto."
4.0,I loved this dress. But it was just too baggy and I didn't feel it was worth paying to alter given the low price to begin with. Also needed a fair bit of ironing. If I had an event to go to I would have considered keeping it.<br />I am about a 4-6 and the Small was too large.
4.0,"I buyed a diamond, but the certified does not match whith my selection.  even when the certified of Amazon is correct, the certified of GIA doesn't match.  I leave this as well, because the issue that does not match (cut), don't have relevance in the price.  I buyed an ""Ideal Cut"" and I recieved a ""Very Good Cut"".<br /><br />The ring, (18k gold), is excelent!"
4.0,"Only have it four stars because it‚Äôs bigger then expected. But hey, buying clothes online normally works out this way. Every brand makes their sizes different. I got a large because I own a large pullover hoodie which fits perfectly for a hoodie. This however is a tad too big. And what I mean is that the sleeves are like little wings lol. Other then that I love it. Sleeves are the right length just a bit flappy."
4.0,too narrow but good for florida summers
4.0,"The XL fits like a tight Large. Worked for me, and I wear a 34J bra. Some loose threads but nothing that effected functionality."
4.0,"UPDATE: I've already shipped back the broken pair and received a beautiful new pair! The company sent the replacement in a little more padded envelope so the posts were bent, but not broken. I was able to straighten them so I can wear them. Yay! Maybe they should write ""hand cancel"" on their next deliveries, so items don't get crushed.<br /><br />These would have been super cute if they hadn't arrived broken. The company decided to send them in a brown unpadded envelope, which took no consideration for the fact that they had posts on the back that could easily be bent. These were not only bent sideways (refer to pic) but one was complete off of the earring. I considered buying my own posts and replacing them, until I noticed that one of the raindrops was broken. This is because they should have put more thought into their packaging. I'm going to request a replacement, because they came super fast and are adorable. The quality of the earrings is great. Their choice of coloring/glitter is perfect for each part. I'll rewrite a follow-up once I've attempted to resolve the issue."
4.0,The product arrived too late & the color was not the deep emerald as shown.
4.0,"I bought this for my little girl's preschool prom. It looked amazing on her. Only thing was we needed to take it in a little bit on one side. The one with the spaghetti strap side needed to be taken up a tad bit. But other than that, it was gorgeous. Very good quality material. She felt like a princess. Amd it was exactky like the picture except the color. We chose the red one and it was more of a reddish pink color which was still gorgeous."
4.0,It's very warm and loop worthy but the pocket isn't that big.
4.0,Definitely check the companies sizing. Runs smaller and tight but it is stretchy. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 220 and ordered the 2Xl
4.0,"Flimsy but overall happy with purchase, will buy more in different colors. Not sure if they're uv glasses? Doesn't specify on package, (also packiging in which I received them was not good, it the only reason I'm taking a star off)"
4.0,Very very comfortable and such a great price for quality. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and ordered a large and it fits perfectly
4.0,Use as slip on boots for all the short runs you have to make during winter.
4.0,"mine fit as expected because i expected them to fit small so i ordered a size up and they fit. pretty much they are what they are, so i like them haha"
4.0,Not as supportive as I was hoping (I'm D cup) BUT it is incredibly comfortable! I don't wear it to run but I do wear it for most everything else
4.0,"Feel good, comfortable, but -1 star do shallow pockets."
4.0,Cool one.
4.0,This mask is very large
4.0,"This leopard long cardigan is on trend, stylish, and can be dressed up or down. It‚Äôs lighter weight and thinner than I expected, so I will mostly be wearing it when it‚Äôs a bit warmer. For Fall I could layer a long sleeve under it and add a scarf for some warmth."
4.0,Added a picture of our girls water polo team to the bad. Used it as a treat bag after one of their games.  Came out great.  The only complaint is that I had to cut some loose thread from the inside of the bad.  The girls loved them.  Will definitely order again.
4.0,"They were beautiful and quality earrings, however, I thought they'd be bigger in size."
4.0,"while these are not the single strap bands like the real apple bands, they are still lookalikes and do their function. 8/10, would recommend."
4.0,These socks look just like the pictures. They are smaller than I anticipated since they're unisex and there is no sizes to pick from.
4.0,"As shown in photo. Longer than other options. Order one size up. Not too tight for large chest. Straps are wide enough for thick arms, but still has a bit of tightness in the near underarm area. However, I am thicker than average in that area, so product is actually a good choice for that body type."
4.0,KEEPS YOUR HEELS FROM DIGGING INTO THE GRASS - WORKED WELL
4.0,"I like this bag, it has lots of handy pockets.  It is lightweight and the strap is adjustable.  The only drawback is the zippers are difficult to work.  They get stuck a lot."
4.0,"Quality and everything is good, but it does run a little big. The only complaint that I have is that it is NOT black. It''s a very dark green. I don't know if it is supposed to be like this."
4.0,"Nice bracelet, wish the inscription was etched in instead of printed on the pendant. Item is as shown. Worth the money."
4.0,It works pretty well. The alligator type clip is fairly strong and has held up thus far. I would recommend.
4.0,Really nice material and style but runs small would have gotten one larger size
4.0,I love these shoes.  It's like being barefoot with protection.  A little pricey and I had to get a size 12 to fit my size 10 foot.
4.0,"Diamonds are little small, otherwise it's awesome"
4.0,"very nice,i love it, thanks"
4.0,"I ordered the 6T. The shirt was too big and the pants and headband were too small. My daughter is the average size 6T in US sizing. She's 3'8&#34; and weighs 45lbs. It's a really cute outfit so order a size up to be safe! The headband and pants are a thin fabric, almost like your standard cotton pillowcase kind of material. I had to makeshift the headband into a hair tie because it was too tight on my daughter's head. You can tell by my photos that the shirt is a little loose with some room to grow, not too bad..and also that the pants are too short. It still looks really cute though. I would recommend, especially for the price--you get 3 pieces!"
4.0,Very nice color as shown
4.0,"Although it was too small for me, it was well constructed and quite flattering."
4.0,"Love this brand and this style of swim suit for girls.  Cute without being overly revealing.  Just that the size wasn't listed and it was 18months or something like that, and way too small for my 2yr old."
4.0,"I love this dress it is super cute, the only issue was that the strip across the chest/neck area was a bit loose. The dress itself fit pretty good."
4.0,More like jogging material spandex almost not cotton sweater
4.0,"The glasses definitely deliver what they promise. They are surprisingly heavy, not uncomfortably so, but enough to warrant their price a great bargain. I would have given the glasses a 5 star rating if not for the fact that after a few minutes my eyes feel strained. I noticed I forget to blink while I'm wearing them."
4.0,Just what I needed. I have heel spurs and need something to be able to work around my wooden floors at home. Highly recommend.
4.0,I just hate how high the thongs are
4.0,The material is nice and comfy. I got lots of compliments on the pattern and colors. I just wish it was a little bit longer but it fit otherwise than that
4.0,"Ran small, so I returned & reordered a size larger<br />The new dress is nice but the top portion of the dress still runs small"
4.0,Bought these for my husband and he is very happy with them.
4.0,"The skull mask is the real deal. Looks good, fits well. Should really make my costume stand out this year."
4.0,"Really nice earrings, if you dont mine the size."
4.0,"I suggest you size down a size when you buy these.  I usually wear somewhere between medium and large and ordered a size small in these because some reviews said they ran big.  The small size is pretty much perfect for me.  They aren't as slouchy as the pictures show; there's no way the top can be worn off the shoulder.  They are comfortable, though.  I like the material.  Some other reviews have mentioned that it isn't as soft as they would like, but I like it.  I wear these for pajamas and enjoy them.  I would not wear them outside of the house because they are fairly see-through.  I ordered them in blue, and the knit is definitely a bit see-through."
4.0,very pretty but smelled like formaldehyde.
4.0,"For the purpose of the flashy lights, they are cool, but like all electronic gadgets battery life could be improved or a way to add a removable battery."
4.0,"I lost the version I bough >5 years ago.  This replacement was not as thick.  However, it still keeps my ears warm on my bike commute to work.  I wear this on my rides when the temps are between 10-25 F.  It fits well and doesn't slide around.  I would give it 5 stars if it was as thick as the previous version"
4.0,"They are a little bigger in size than expected, but they are still beautiful. Also more comfortable than expected."
4.0,"For the price, it‚Äôs a great little hat!"
4.0,"While I like the design, the function and color I chose, but it broke soon after wearing it."
4.0,Just right for my granddaughter.
4.0,"A little smaller than expected and the fabric didn‚Äôt feel as thick and durable as I would expect from a canvas bag. It does look great and packs stuff on a back, so it does it‚Äôs job."
4.0,"Beautiful print, but the cut is not quite right, extra baggy on the back and snug at the hips"
4.0,These are wonderful. I have a 3 year old that is always ruining my sunglasses. These look great and they are not too expensive. Which is perfect for me.
4.0,Purchased as a gift and should be fine.
4.0,It's ok. It's kind of large in the torso.
4.0,Too big for me and I gave it away as a gift fits perfect for the person receiving the gift. Really liked it ordered an XL should have ordered a Large!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but the only thing was the arms were a bit snug on my niece‚Äôs arms."
4.0,The recipient of this gift pulled them on over her jeans immediately and seemed delighted with them.
4.0,The quality is good ...awesome material
4.0,Product was exactly as presented. Great price. Late arrival.
4.0,Great soft mask. Beautiful except for a piece of hair that is glued under the stones. Can't get it off.
4.0,üòç love it ! Got the blue because of the reviews and it is a bit see through but it‚Äôs that skirt That you want to wear in a nice summer day ‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,I love the fit and look of these shorts.
4.0,"I got this as a gift for my wife.  It is a very nice wallet, although not quite big enough for my wife to use on an every day basis."
4.0,"I like the coat well enough, it is warm and comfortable but the workmanship has a little bit to be desired. Has a small hole by the inside pocket where it was not sown properly"
4.0,It is a really nice shirt i like the little leather embelishments on it.  The sleeves were to short for my arms but the rest fit nice.  Luckily this shirt is made to be rolled up and slide up.
4.0,"Easy to put on, comfy for my daughter but they do come off a little too easy."
4.0,it was suitable for what i needed it for
4.0,Love the fit but material snags very easily.
4.0,"I want to say that every review on this bag is true.  Good first, the quality is excellent, it has no odor at all, beautifully crafted, lots of room, handles are solid, the strap is nice and overall I highly recommend this bag to anyone.  The ONLY reason this was not a five star, there is protective plastic that is put on the hardware and it is a beast to get off especially around the front hardware almost like it is baked on.  I used a tooth pick back and forth and finally got it off.  Also one of the snaps on the side was not working but the bag is so pretty I can overlook it and keep it. I have purchased some high end bags and this one rivals it in looks and a much better price for sure.  I don't think it would be as stunning in black, the brown is beautiful.  Fits a good amount of items as well.  I believe this is a great bag for fall."
4.0,The sleeves are to long and I wish the end of the sleeves had a elastic
4.0,Love it..got lots of compliments!
4.0,"I am 5'6"" and 135 lbs, I ordered a medium. It fits just right, but I definitely wouldn't be able to fit anything smaller. Comfortable and soft fabric, although slightly thinner than anticipated."
4.0,"This is a very cute dress! I got so many compliments, even from strangers. I ordered the XL, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, ddd chest and I weigh 212 lbs.  fit as expected and didn‚Äôt hug my fat rolls. üëèüèª"
4.0,"Fast shipping, fit as expected"
4.0,I like the look and quality of these watch straps the only thing I didnt like is that it grabs the hairs on my wrist. I'm not even hairy at all lol
4.0,This was a present and the person it was bought for likes it very much.
4.0,This dress was for my mother and she loved it and said it look just as it was pictured and fit her fine. Thanks
4.0,A little larger than anticipated. Beautiful
4.0,"Really, I'd give this bag 4.5 stars if I could. The only reason to dock it is because one of the shoulder straps' plastic latches broke on me. But it's roomy and well made, and the color really pops. I lived out of just this bag on a trip to the UK for ten days and it served me well."
4.0,only the left shoe was to big like someone streched it
4.0,and nice looking. Was comfortable.
4.0,"These readers look very nice - a great value for the money. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is their weight. They're a bit on the heavy side. When wearing them for more than an hour or two, indentations form on my nose due to the nose pads. It gets uncomfortable and I have to take them off."
4.0,"First off, I purchased these socks because they look cool, not because I was looking for performance. They look awesome, and I get a lot of complements about them. They are also pretty well made. However, they get hot pretty easily and aren't very oder-resistant, which is why I'm not giving 5 stars."
4.0,Decent quality. I usually wear a medium and ordered a large. Perfect fit.
4.0,Keeps the sun out of my eyes.  Nothing fancy.
4.0,Great item. Need to reorder- item was stolen.
4.0,Love this dress! So comfy and soft.
4.0,"Nice look and leather feel.  I like the subtle symbol on lower corner, however the extra flap inside the wallet makes it bulky. I wouldn't want it in my back pocket."
4.0,"I really like the material and the flexibility of the dress. With that said, I would definitely go with a size larger than normal because the dress does run small."
4.0,Adorable! ! Love if you don't have much on the top you may want to add chicken cutlets  ( 32 A) but other then that super cute and comfortable  I  am 4'11 107 I ordered a small fit great
4.0,They are great!  I love them.
4.0,good quality fast deliver
4.0,Lovely....very stretchy tho.. .
4.0,Beautiful chain. Just wish it would have been packaged a bit nicer.
4.0,It was cute and I liked it but it was too small for me.
4.0,Comfortable enough for daily wear. They have just enough stretch to flex with me. They fit well in all areas and they don't ride up my legs from the bottom. The elastic waist is wide and comfortable.
4.0,they fit my daughters glasses perfect
4.0,Good quality but not US sizing. It runs small so order with that in mind.
4.0,"Great fit and color... really like this.  Material is soft and thin, can‚Äôt wait to try it out this summer"
4.0,"I actually like this headband a lot. The color is really pretty, and it's the right width, in my opinion, for not only working out but also wearing out everyday. The problem is that it is just does not fit right on me. I have that problem with many headbands, so I don't fault the headband itself, but it seems to be partially an issue with being too big for my head and also being made of a somewhat &#34;slippery&#34; material. It just slips right off my head when I have it on, even without doing anything. If you don't normally have issues with headbands, then I completely recommend getting this one. If you normally have issues, it may not work for you."
4.0,"It's very cute! Came on time, kinda flimsy, but just sturdy enough for everyday wear!!!! Had some black stuff/paint or something on it in the creases of the design, nice brass tho."
4.0,"I‚Äôm a Covid nurse, and needed something to protect myself. This works great, and it‚Äôs very comfortable, but I wish it was just a little bit bigger. Even so, I‚Äôll be buying more!"
4.0,"Its a.little big for my wrist, but the weight of it, the look of it....I love it"
4.0,I love the look of these bracelets! They are small for 8&#34; though.
4.0,Easy to get on and gives great support.
4.0,"It's beautiful, really beautiful but not for petite woman."
4.0,I like it. The sleeves are a little snug but not too bad for me to return it. I wish there were more colors (other than those 3)!
4.0,Super cute and exactly what I wanted!
4.0,"DD is on the slender side & this skirt is a bit small on her. The adjustable waist is a plus, but still tight.."
4.0,"I love them. I bought two. I am five foot one, so I would need to get them cut, they're a bit long, but overall I like them a lot."
4.0,"Not sure I'm a crazy fan of the butterfly latch. It's a cool idea, and it definitely works, but can be uncomfortable at times. Still, the band looks great and has a good weight on the wrist. The tools that came with it made it VERY easy to take out some unneeded links and place it on the watch."
4.0,Little tight around my underarm but it's so nice!
4.0,"Cute pattern, good fabric. Not completely breathable, so not great for a hot climate. Good length. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because it‚Äôs a little too tight if you were a large  chested."
4.0,"Nice, but took forever to ship."
4.0,doesn't last very long - but a nice belt
4.0,It‚Äôs a little small in the shoulders but other than that super cute!
4.0,"They're cute, wish there was a larger size though."
4.0,Purchased directly from the company.<br /><br /> Super high quality fabric and bag for the price. The customer service was even better. Unfortunately the tote was too small for my needs. Better for urban environments .....IE. Books tablet sunglasses iPod Etc. Not for jackets or grocery shopping.<br /><br /> If they make the same bag in a larger size I will buy it without hesitation.
4.0,Holy crap this thing is creepy to look at but my daughter loves it. For the kind of thin plastic it's made of I honestly think it shouldn't be $8 but oh well. Otherwise it's what I was looking for and wasn't too expensive.
4.0,"The backs are very small.  So small I could not get the posts in.  It says 3 studs however, I was expecting 3 pair of studs.  If I manage to get the back on I may order 3 more so I will have 3 sets that match.  The quality looks great."
4.0,Worked for my tea party.
4.0,"Glad to have found a long flowing tank top,  with arm holes that aren't so big your showing off your side and bra. Nothing worse when arm holes are so big you feel like you need to where a tank under your tank. This one was perfect."
4.0,It's ok. Beautiful.
4.0,"My Ophthalmologist has told me on several occasions that I should 'try the amber filter' glasses for migraines and computer screens and things. I couldn't see paying a few hundred 'to try it' and find that it didn't help that much, so I got these.  I've been surprised that they were decent on a partially cloudy morning to use outside (like sun glasses when i left mine behind one day).  I usually need black/blue lenses for sunlight since I have light sensitivity.<br /><br />The primary concern when trying to read is these rest lower on the cheek so I'm always having to pull them up or adjust the bifocal position to use them for reading.  I put some moleskin on the edge to help lift them and it has made some difference but I think i'll put more maybe on the bridge of the nose this time because it's still hard to see that far down and you can't use bifocals for computer reading at all since that requires looking FORWARD.  (I can't use them that way unless i tilt my head back or just hold the glasses which defeats the purpose for being able to read the screen AND type.  I'm not using them to look at the keyboard I don't need them for that.)<br /><br />The filter does seem good with those bright lights which are sort of irritating like the SPOTS you see on book shelves etc. Even my darker glasses didn't help as much with those.<br /><br />One of my Dr's was like 'well I can see your eyes now and that's nice'!  So all in all for the price and the chance to 'try' the amber filter, a pretty good deal. I'd suggest they find a way to  keep the position of them higher on the face tho so anyone can use them for reading that's not JUST in your lap.  I tend to hold my phone, books and crochet etc higher up than that and extending your neck to adjust isn't a good idea either."
4.0,It is better quality than expected.it fits me well I‚Äôm about 190 5‚Äô5 pear shaped needed it to cover my cakes.can‚Äôt wait to wear it on my trip to The Maldives!
4.0,"Very well made bag, zippers are a little weak and sure can fit a variety of items!"
4.0,"Nice design. Runs a tad big, but still pretty."
4.0,Reviewing for my wife: Lovely. True to fit and straps are adjustable. My only issue is the way the patten is sewn in the front doesn't quite line up.  Other than that it's really a nice dress. Light and flowy. I'm going to order another.
4.0,im kinda annoyed that the skulls overlapped but it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable. i only noticed it after wearing it for a while. the glow feature works perfectly. the thickness is good as well.
4.0,"I really like this belt, I'm just a little hesitant to wear it because of the stretch band. I can't decide if it makes it look cheesy or not. It looks fantastic from the front though. I guess I could always wear it with something that covers the elastic.<br />On the up side it fits me, if not a little on the large side. I have a hard time finding cute belts that fit since I have wide hips and standard sizes typically don't fit me. My hips measure 39&#34; for reference.<br />It's looks absolutely badass from the front and I love the detail on the metal. I just wish that half the belt wasn't elastic. All in all I would recommend it to anyone that has a hard time finding belts that fit and is looking for a belt of this style."
4.0,"We love the robe, wish it were a bit bigger, he will outgrow it soon ;-(  it is warm and fuzzy and he (7 yrs) loves it!"
4.0,"It adds a romantic feel to sleeveless garments. Is lightweight, a plus for me in Florida. Looks good. Fits well. I bought large. 4038DD."
4.0,"This is a very flattering, cute dress! It is thin so you will have to wear a slip. Definitely size down as it runs large"
4.0,Nice watch without the hassle because of its bangle style
4.0,"Beautiful dress!  Can adjust the corset to your figure. I'm 5'7 and normally a size 14. This fit me well and the length was perfect. I wanted something full length for a gala, and I got alot of compliments on it."
4.0,Wife likes it so I'm golden. She was surprised by this a few days ago. It is a nice necklace to wear to casual events
4.0,Very nice. Holds color well. extremely adjustable. Bought two for different watches.
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful, but bigger than expected. I'll still wear it, I just wish it was a bit smaller/ more delicate."
4.0,"Seems to work great when you fold your wetsuit to hang.  I have 4 triathlon wetsuits, and when you just hang them you can still see an indention in the shoulders, so I would suggest folding them at the waist to hang.  For my sleeveless wetsuit, it's perfect to hang."
4.0,Was a hit- fits perfect .  Best dressed<br />Can‚Äôt wait to wear it again!<br />Ordered Large- 5-9 i usually wear a 46 Reg in sport coats or jackets and this required no alterations.
4.0,I'm 5f2' and weight 128 so the length fall below ankle and loose fit in size M but it's all perfect for me.
4.0,"the mask formed well to my face. it was only missing two small stones on it, and it took me a while to notice. the ribbon needed to be re-tied. . the stones were not aurora, but pink. aside from those minor issues I have no serious complaints I still like it a lot, and the price can't be beat for similar masks."
4.0,The holder works for both my phone and my gps.  It is a little tight.
4.0,Not as thick or fluffy as appears in picture.
4.0,These earrings are beautiful.  The green amber wasn't as green as I expected.  The back clasp was also a little loose and I had to adjust it to keep it clamped around the stud.  I hope it won't come loose and make my earrings fall off.  They were expensive but I guess that's to be expected with real silver and such gorgeous amber.  Overall I'm happy with my earrings.
4.0,I ordered a small (which is what I usually wear) and it's still a little big for me (5'3&#34; 130 lbs) but it's still a keeper. I love the shoulder details... sexy but not too sexy for work.
4.0,These pouches are well made with very good quality material. I needed them for frames that were slightly larger than normal. The microfiber material serves as a great lens cleaner.
4.0,I ordered a 3x due to reading the reviews to make sure the dress fit.  The dress is nice and as pictured but it was just a little too snug for me.  I also like my dresses to come a little below the knee and this dress was above my knees so I had to return.
4.0,This mask is really cute but the material is pretty stiff.
4.0,"Replaced old 14mm plastic band which broke on Casio Illuminator. For some reason, these replacement (generic) watchbands are virtually nonexistent in retail stores now. This band is fine, especially for the price. It doesn't make sense to pay $15-20 for a band when the watch costs under $30. It fits as advertised and was easy to install. The only thing I don't like, and this was not clear on the listing, is the entire length of the band is skinny, from 14mm at the pins down to 12mm for most of the band, so that it resembles what you'd typically find in a ladies' watchband, which is fine if you're a woman but looks sort of weird if your a man. There's no Men/Women designation, so I assume it's supposed to be unisex, but if you have a larger watch face (like most men's watches), it does look rather odd to pair it with a thinner band. It reminds me of a fluffy dog where everything but the head is shaved down. But this works for now. &lt;see pic>"
4.0,"One of the plastic covers from the zipper fell off immediately, but the mechanics of the zipper itself seem pretty strong. Fit over our suitcase perfectly and was so much easier to travel with than a traditional bag. I use a packing cube system with these. Its perfect for two of the large size with room to spare on top for a couple pairs of shoes. I do plan on getting another one soon."
4.0,I love this. I'm 5'9 and curvy and the Large fits pretty well - The color is bright and vibrant!
4.0,"Love these! Bought both packs of 3 colors. The price is amazing for 3 pairs. My only small complaint is that the red pair is more a pinky red which I already owned that color. The pics on listing make it look more of a true red. So now I own two pair of fringe earrings in the same color... But for the price, I'll survive. (The top row in the picture plus light pink in second row are ones bought from listing)"
4.0,THese goggles have a good price and will work perfectly for snowmobiling in the winter!
4.0,I ordered 2 sizes up which was a 2x and honestly the L or 1x would of fit... I'll say they are true to size. I took it to the seamstress to be taken in tho...
4.0,"Looks great,but the LED eyes aren't working."
4.0,"Very pretty ! The stones are darker than the picture which is fine with me  (darker blue) the posts are extra long too. So far, they havent made,my ears sore. I am very pleased!"
4.0,"Very beautiful, lots of complements on it."
4.0,"Just a little clunky looking but overall really nice. I wear it all the time. Also I really like that it came with an extra string of scrap turquoise beads, I was able to add a clasp and turn it into a simple bracelet."
4.0,Delivered on time and product arrived as advertised.
4.0,These are great. Having the polarized glasses is definitely easier on the eyes on sunny days.
4.0,Little loose in boob area but overall beautiful jumpsuit .
4.0,"Nice dress, looks like the pic and fits according to size chart. I just don't care for the material it's made of."
4.0,"These are really nice for the price, 30 assorted tongue rings for (at this time, $8) isn't bad at all. The only complaint from my fiancee was that they're metal barbells and not plastic (she doesn't like metal). Other then that, pretty good stuff and she loved the designs."
4.0,True to size. Wears a bit large
4.0,Such a great LSF dupe!! Only gave 4 stars because the skirt is so short! I am 5‚Äô9. No way I‚Äôd be able to wear this. Sadly returned.
4.0,Wife loved this dress. I plan to buy a few more for her
4.0,It‚Äôs an ok dress. Just not for my daughters body type. It looks as like she wrapped a cheap bed sheet around herself. It may look better on a different body type. Also one sleeve was longer than the other.
4.0,Love it!! Two friends already asked where I bought it. I'm 5'3&#34; and typically wear a size 8 dress. I bought a L but probably would have been fine in a M. 97% cotton so maybe it will shrink a bit.
4.0,My husband loves to have nice tie clips and accents to his formal wear. I love these tie clips because they are not something that is seen everyday. the colors are so bright and they look great. My only problem is that they are very short and the back of the clip is very large. My husband loves them and has worn the light blue more than any of the others. I am very happy with this purchase and hope to buy more that are a bit longer. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,"Very flattering on both chest and waist  I like that I can put the sleeves up or leave them off shoulder. Minus one star because when the wind blows there's nothing keeping the skirt from blowing apart, and I accidentally flashed passersby while waiting to cross the street on my way to work. Lesson learned; wear this with shorts underneath or on days when it's not very windy. Other than that, I love it!"
4.0,It's a pretty necklace but it's thinner than I expected.
4.0,"This is the third pair of these shoes that I have purchased.  I am normally a 7 wide and these are true to size for me.  Because they are adjustable, attractive, and comfortable, they work very well for me.  The orthotic soles feel stable and comfortable,  and the shoe is quite adequate for around-the-house and out-and-about shopping chores.  Due to several existing foot issues, including hammertoes, prior foot surgery and some neuropathy, I must wear adjustable shoes, and find I am wearing wear these shoes most.  The dark leather strap is not as attractive as the cloth straps as it does not look realistic.  There than that I recommend this shoe for people who need an adjustable, casual, stable sandal."
4.0,I bought this purse in purple and I really like it. I have other more expensive nylon purses and the quality is comparable. The shape is more hobo style which I love.
4.0,"Love love, beautiful as described."
4.0,Perfect for our themed party!
4.0,"Convenient, inexpensive, but not loud enough to use out on the street or in the car."
4.0,Excellent hold for a large bust for medium impact activity. Haven't tried it with high impact yet.
4.0,"This is a retro hoody for sure! The Zebra body and color scheme really scream 90's!!<br />It does run a bit small, for us with longer torsos...<br />Very cute, but you'll get the looks!"
4.0,"Got it as a gift,  it is nice for the price."
4.0,"This is so cute and light weight, if you buy this product, you will love it."
4.0,"The frames I received didn‚Äôt match the picture.  The lenses are not crystal clear, they are decent but not great.  They have a lot of occlusion and blurry spots.  However they are effective I. Blocking the blue light which helps me sleep better at night."
4.0,I liked these earrings.  They were really cute but very very small.  I thought these would be great for my twin nieces  who are 8 but they were super super tight.  Oh well.
4.0,"Im chunky, 30yrs old and small chested. Its beyond difficult to find a &#34;real&#34; bra that fits me. I think high school was the only time I have ever worn a real bra and even then, they didn't fit right. Its been sports bras ever since!! It was time again to find a new set of bras since I wear mine 7 days a week!! I noticed as soon as opening these they seem to be made a bit better than the ones I find in Walmart. The material is a little thicker and seems more durable. They are still soft and very comfortable! They also seem to cover more skin along the side and back. I LOVE that!! The reason for only giving 4 stars is that one of the bra straps broke during the first wear. Its a quick and easy sew job to reattach it and for the price I paid for a set of 4, I'm not complaining!! I LOVE these bras!! Best money spent on undergarments so far!!"
4.0,"Shipping: great, arrived sooner than expected<br />Product: I mean it's definitely not real joggers it's more like a thin dress pant so the ripped part will probably not look too great after a few washes but it fits great and great length for a short girl"
4.0,It looks like the straps may not hold up and they slipped off of my heel a few times during a 75 minute yoga class but they are really cute and comfortable.
4.0,It was for my daughter she said it fits as expected and I comfortable
4.0,Love it but just a little small to wrap around twice as infinity scarf
4.0,Runs a little small but still looks nice
4.0,Awesome chain and pendant but not sure if it's 965 sterling silver
4.0,"I wear size 14 or 16 pants and I ordered an XL and it fits great.  It has a wide waistband that doesn't roll down and is so comfortable.  I like that there is a pocket in the back waistband for money or other small items, but it would be the perfect golf skort for me if it had front pockets to hold tees and ball markers."
4.0,"My only issue was the battery was dead when we received this. That's okay, though because batteries can be replaced."
4.0,Got so many compliments from it at the Derby
4.0,"Overall it‚Äôs a nice top. I‚Äôd rate the material an 8-10, it fit well!"
4.0,useful and sturdy... just a little bit too heavy..
4.0,Chain is crap pendants nice
4.0,"Overall, very comfortable."
4.0,"The mask is good, but doesn't have nose holes to breath"
4.0,The were a perfect fit for my son!!
4.0,They came exactly as pictured. I used The size chart to figure out what size I needed and they are too big for me. I guess I can wear them still because I‚Äôm using them only in my own home and it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre loose since I will be sitting on them for biking.
4.0,I love how the product fit..it hugged my waist and flared out. Very vintage
4.0,Love these crawlers. They make a unique gift
4.0,Nice and soft and thick.  Great for the winter time.
4.0,We loved the material however my husband has a long torso so onesies to fit him are hard
4.0,"The bracelet was beautiful but the security chain was not secure on both sides Guess I'll have to take it to a jeweler  and get it put on correctly. It is of no use without the security chain working properly. Other than that, it is very pretty."
4.0,"I love these earrings. Very cute, very sturdy (they don't bend). A tad on the expensive side, however.<br />I've been wearing one on my right ear for about 2 weeks now (I don't ever take it out, shower with it etc), and it's becoming discolored. Bummer."
4.0,"good grip, enough padding only niggle is getting off, even with tabs on two fingers. Probably true of most of these type."
4.0,"I received this bag yesterday and I really like the design.  Strap length is GREAT, as the the previous customer commented.  I too am plus size and the straps fit comfortably under my arm without resting in my armpit.  The design and concept are unique, the problem is... the should straps look like they've become unstitched from the bag (above the grommets also used to fasten the straps to the bag).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I won't encounter a defect right away - but like the bag so much I'm willing to take my chances."
4.0,"I got the dress originally in the Purple and got a size Medium, because people were saying this dress ran high. It was a mistake lol. I'm 5 ft 8 inches tall, with a size 42D bust, and I admit I got a tummy. I wanted a dress that highlights my curves and takes the attention away from my belly. The medium was admittedly too small, it fit but didn't look very flattering at all so I mulled it over a few days and just ordered 2 sizes up (XL) to get it to maybe compliment my body better. I was really nervous that it wouldn't look very good, dresses are something that are very tricky to order online but it looks very lovely! Just how I hoped it would! This dress rests just above my knees, which I can never seem to get out of dresses. They're either too short or floor length, this dress is exactly the right length for my liking.<br /><br />On another note, I gave the medium purple dress to my sister. So I didn't need to return."
4.0,"They are very pretty, the only thing is I thought they would be a little bigger, regardless their very nice, thanks"
4.0,middle stone was too big to look believable
4.0,"Nice belt, but the sizing is way off.  It is supposed to be XL, but it is more like XXXL."
4.0,I ordered the pink but they sent me the blue. Other than that it is a good band. Soft and comfortable. I will order the pink again and hopefully I'll get it this time
4.0,"They are good for outside, just could be a little thicker fabric on the ears for more warmth."
4.0,The outfit is super cute and is true to size but the suspenders could be better quality. We didn't get to wear them because it broke right when we went to hook them on his pants.
4.0,"Very cute hat! For an inexpensive hat, it looks nice and arrived in great condition. I felt that the ribbon around the brim could have been fitted a bit better, but for a nice looking hat under $10.00 I really had no complaints. My daughter's 14 year-old friend, whom the hat was purchased for, loved it!!"
4.0,I love these and they feel good and the pockets are deep and a bonus!
4.0,"Loved this ring a lot. I wear it everyday, but unfortunately after around three months of wear a crystal fell out. I love this ring, though so I continue to wear it. The empty slot is covered by my finger so it is not noticeable. I would caution buyers to know that you get what you pay for."
4.0,"It's a nice skirt, though after washing, the hem curls up. Not the easiet thing to iron back into place. Still, I like the way the skirt hangs."
4.0,I'm 5'4'' 115lb 34D the small is ever so slightly too big. Beautiful and comfortable.  It is slightly see through at the legs. Stays off the shoulders well. The flowers aren't the best they are slightly blurry in the print.
4.0,I ordered this in a l for the reviews stated that its a little oversized. To be honest it fits like a normal l for me which is my usual size. I tried the off the shoulder but it just didn't look like the pic. I did reorder in an l but but returned it for it was way to big. Overall it's ok for the fall. With an undershirt it will be super cute
4.0,They were awesome and the team loved them!!
4.0,"I wasn't sure about this necklace when I order it. When I got it the box was so small that I just new nothing except a ring could fit in it. But to my surprise there was a bracelet in the box. Whoever put this bracelet in this tiny box was creative.<br /><br />The bracelet is leather with four different bracelets turned into one bracelet. One strand has cute golden stars on it. Another has earth tone beads on it. The next one has more beads with my zodiac sign, Capricorn. The last strand looks like it is some kind of braid. It is easy to get it on and off.<br /><br />I have worn this bracelet several times and it has held up good. Looks just like it did the day that I received it. I have also gotten it wet while washing my hands and the water did not effect it.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,I ordered them for my kid first swimming classes . it fits very well she liked it. it serves the purpose...
4.0,Product is great but sizing is off
4.0,I bought these to wear with dresses that I have and to help spruce up pictures for my business. They get the job done well but are cheaper looking up close.
4.0,Good product. Simply help with post op mobility and safety.
4.0,"I purchased the orange and mint multi-colored dress with orange at the top in a large. I was disappointed to see that the top orange part of the dress is not the same color as the bottom orange in the dress. The top part is like your standard orange and the pigmentation of the orange at the bottom of the dress is more burnt orange like the picture reflects. The other colors(mint, salmon pink and standard green) in the bottom are also lighter than the picture reflects but it doesn't make the dress look bad. Other than slight pigmentation differences on the dress vs picture the dress is gorgeous overall. I have this dress in basic navy blue and it is well made as well and fits great. I would recommend this dress."
4.0,"Love the simplicity of this bracelet. It makes for a great gift for a mom, a graduate, or a girl who has accomplished a certain goal to show support and acknowledgement of her achievement, as well as to let her know she can do anything she sets her mind to.  (Of course, it makes a great gift for the fan of the comic book heroine as well.) I personally like the bracelet, but have smaller hands and wrists and had not expected the Wonder Woman charm to be as big as it was in relation to my wrist, but it shouldn't matter to most others, and I still love it."
4.0,"More narrow than most sunglasses I have owned so it squeezes my head, but I love the design. It comes in a fabric case (not the hard case), which I didn't mind because I don't use case anyway. Seems sturdy overall as well (thick)."
4.0,"Very cute jump suit! But mine came with defective stitching as shown in the pictures, also ran a bit small, im 5'4, 135 pounds, C cup, i ordered the size 8 which says a medium,  i would say definitely size up if you dont want it to tight fitting. I will be returning and ordering a size up and im hoping the stitching is good on the next one!"
4.0,"I really like the look, I got the purple.  The only issue I have with them is the bifocal area is very small.  I've had several other kinds and prefer a little more viewing space in the bifocal area."
4.0,"This dress has a very elegant look and flow. The color is very classy and the fit is good. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and weigh 135 pounds. I purchased a small. The only complaint I have is if you are small chested, the top is a bit drapey. I push up bra helped, but not completely."
4.0,The rubber reinforce toe is a great feature that provides longer wearability
4.0,This shirt is really cute and seems well made. Haven't washed it yet so can't be sure. I do think its way over priced though. I would use this as a prototype for my box before I bought another at this price.
4.0,"I fully expected this dress to be big/baggy and it was...however, it was a bit too big for me. I was swimming in it. Nonetheless, it is very comfy!"
4.0,"I have purchased multiple pants from this company. They all fit the same around the waist and thighs. As I am only 5‚Äô tall, they are ankle pants on me. I‚Äôll probably end up purchasing more colors."
4.0,"This romper fabric is super soft and sheer, but not see-through. I bought it for my 15 month old and got the size 18-24 months, which she usually wears. Its about a whole size too big, and the straps are long - you will have to tie them up in the back or take them in to keep from falling.<br />However! The material and colors are beautiful, just as pictured. We are keeping ours to grow into."
4.0,"Exactly as in the pic, will buy again"
4.0,My hubby really liked it nice size and quality
4.0,these are the most soft and comfortable slippers I've had in a very long time and you can wash them.
4.0,For the man who only carries what he needs. Strong and thin.
4.0,It was a vey nice wallet. I didn‚Äôt care for the bulkiness the money clip added to it.
4.0,These sandals look right and fit correctly. I just would have liked them to be a bit more padded for a more comfortable walk.
4.0,Used these with my soft sided Rick Steves luggage back pack trip through Europe. They were perfect for keeping everything organized and tidy.
4.0,It's a great fit for her.
4.0,"This product arrived on time, as described by the seller, undamaged, and adequately packaged. This scrub set fits well and is a good deal for the price. It has a complimentary fit, especially the top, which is really cute, and the color is nice. I don't expect the fabric to last forever, but if you're wearing scrubs, chances are you're doing dirty work and something is going to happen to it sooner or later any way. For comparison, the seams in the pockets of my company provided scrubs wore out after about a year, and they cost much more than these (payroll deduction, yay), so I would rather spend my money on scrubs that I can chose the fit/style and pay a fraction of the price. I was offered this product at a generous discount from the seller for the purposes of an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Super comfy, fits well, not made for a vigorous workout support wise! But love them!"
4.0,"This fits perfectly,  my daughter wore it for Senior pictures and a few times after."
4.0,"I'm 6' with a long torso and normally take a size large in t-shirts.  In dress shirts I take around a 36"" sleeve to get things that fit but in this shirt I take a medium.  Seriously, at an athletic 200 lbs the shoulders on the large are hanging down my arms.<br /><br />Size down one and you'll be very, very pleased with this shirt.  Very comfortable and looks good."
4.0,"I bought these when they were a lighting deal for $10 and, for the price, I am very satisfied with them. The lenses are pretty big--a little bigger than I prefer, but that is my personal preference and not a fault with the product. The glasses fit comfortably on my average sized head and the huge lenses definitely do a good job of shielding my eyes from the intense Texas sun.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-very affordable<br />-metal hinges that should hold up much better than plastic ones<br />-are polarized as advertised<br />-look nice<br />-comfortable<br />-comes with a sturdy, zippered case that has a clip to attach to a bag or belt loop. The case is actually fairly compact and light. Also comes with cloth wipe and glasses screwdriver keychain.<br />-the bling on the frame does not have the metal claps holding them in (they use some sort of white adhesive instead) which means it does not get painfully caught in hair<br /><br />Cons:<br />-if you want a very lightweight pair of glasses, these are a little on the heavier side because of the metal on the frame<br />-if you have a small face, these lenses may overwhelm your face because they are very large.<br />- because they used a white adhesive, the bling looks a little sloppy up close (however, their listing images show the same thing, so it should not come as a surprise). Not a big issue, just something to be aware of if that would bother you."
4.0,"It is nothing wrong with this ring.  The color is beautiful, the fit is comfortable, but I just do not like the coating.  I wished it had been polished<br />So when I stack my bands, this goes in between 2 polished bands.  I like titanium because it is lighter (in weight) than stainless steel."
4.0,"Nice shape and cut. Fabric is a little cheap,  but for the price a good choice for wedding or funeral."
4.0,I really like the style and cut of this sweater.  It‚Äôs trendy and I can definitely see myself wearing this with jeans and my funky leopard print boots.<br /><br />While it fit I would have preferred a little bigger for more movement.
4.0,nice cover-up but wrinkles very easily
4.0,Does what it‚Äôs intended to do but I think it‚Äôs lil high price considering probably cost less than $2 to make
4.0,I love it. It's true to size. Wish I bought a size down. It stretches
4.0,"This product was incredibly soft when I first purchased it. After washing it two or three times, it has lost its softness and now has small pills on the fabric as shown in the photos. It‚Äôs still a beautiful robe and I love it, I just wish it was softer."
4.0,I didn‚Äôt get the exact color combination I ordered. I‚Äôm still satisfied though.
4.0,'Good'
4.0,"pants seem great but do not own pets around them, they were covered in hair the second I put them on"
4.0,"They're what they should be but 4 stars because one came with a missing ball. They were a gift, which is the only reason the ball is the issue."
4.0,"Other than the ties being a little short, no complaints"
4.0,The material is good and fits perfectly fine just it‚Äôs a little loose.
4.0,The socks are what I expected and were here on time also.
4.0,These are exactly what I was searching for.  Good quality for everyday kick around pants.  Product shipped from China and too way too long for delivery.  They are long for me and will require a small hem that I'll do myself but really comfortable pants.  Also may need a little pressing once washed.
4.0,"I ordered a size M and I am 125 lbs and have a fairly long torso. I really liked this, but ended up taking the chest padding out because it was weird. The front is not see through at all, but the back is. I am going to have to line it which won't be very hard. This was worth the purchase because I love it. Super cute!"
4.0,"I‚Äôm older and wanted summer-weight dresses with some coverage that I can throw on in the morning with a pair of sandals for errands with no need for shapewear or accessories, and still look put-together (I live in NYC). With a just a half-slip, these dresses fit the bill.<br /> At 5‚Äô5‚Äù/ 130 lbs. I bought 2 Smalls and a Medium in navy, grey, and brown, respectively. The material varied a lot between the smalls and the medium. The Smalls were rather thick, slightly itchy in the heat, the ‚Äúhotouch‚Äù tag sewn in with that scratchy thread and on 80+ degree days felt hot...they will be fine in fall and winter and with nice shoes and a little jewelry, dressy enough for work.<br />The brown Medium was a totally different fabric however...still heavy enough to drape nicely, but soft and smooth. No scratchy tag. I prefer the Medium fit for summer...still flatteringly fitted on upper half, but covered my knees without looking frumpy. The only drawback of the Medium was that the sleeves hung loose on my skinny forearms, so when I pushed them up they didn‚Äôt stay put... The Medium arrived crumpled up in a plastic bag with one sleeve inside out and a funny chemical-like smell. I machine washed it first, reg. cycle and hung dry.... no ironing was necessary. Time will tell if the fabric holds up, but for under $30, and some colors under $20, you can‚Äôt go wrong."
4.0,I loved the pendant the chain was broken but for the price -I just put it on another chain:)
4.0,Gives waist a definition. Thick material.
4.0,"It really is a good quality hat, it was just weird looking on me and a little big for my head!"
4.0,"My only proven with these sucks is that I still feel like I stretch them out. I usually wear an American women's size 10 and I have normal width. The heel keeps sliding forward and looks worn out. I still really like them, they stay up, and clean up nicely, but probably won't buy from this company again with the way the fit is for a sock that claims to fit a larger women's foot size."
4.0,"This product is made well, and it serves its purpose."
4.0,"Nice dress, it stretches so it can fit about anyone. Easy to move in."
4.0,"Wish I had realized that the sleeves are 3/4 sleeve and do not have a cuff. Luckily, I am short and the sleeves come to my wrists. I just wish they closed around my wrists instead of having such a large opening. The color is nice."
4.0,Nice for classic woman.
4.0,I knew that it was a compression shirt but it was too tight and uncomfortable
4.0,Nice material and looks good at a good price.
4.0,This was a dress I ordered for a cruise I just went on. It was perfect because the material doesn't wrinkle so I didn't have to worry about it folded in my suitcase. It was very very long. I'm 5'6 150lbs and I had to hem it up about 5 inches to get it to sweep the floor. I ordered a Medium and love the way it fits in the bust and waist. The grey color I ordered is definitely not grey but more of a blush pink and it has a pearly finish on the fabric.
4.0,Very cute rain boots! Our grandkids love them and the fit is perfect......just used their<br />regular size of current shoes for the sizing. Thank you.
4.0,"I got the Fortnite design with the glider.<br /><br />I thought it was ALITTLETHINCAP not like my baseball ones.<br /><br />I plan on showing this to the kids on my Discord and let them decide if this is worth buying, the price is great; It's about the cost of a V-BUCKS card they win in challenges :)"
4.0,"Very stretchy, clingy material, so if you don't want something tight, order a size largwe. Very nice flare, great quality."
4.0,It‚Äôs stylish and very easy to use.
4.0,"Love the detachable components. Bought this maiy for fishing when I do not want to bring entire tackle box with me. Zippers are a bit tricky, and takes some getting used to."
4.0,"This keepsake charm is adorable. So happy I found something like this. The only reason I gave 4out of 5 is because the chain itself didn‚Äôt last long, maybe a month? So glad I didn‚Äôt loose the urn part when it broke off of my neck, that would‚Äôve been devastating."
4.0,"These goggles are great. However, they fit my face perfectly, to a fault. They fit my face so well, that if I try to wear them over my helmet straps (which I prefer), the goggles are too tight, do not allow for proper air flow, fog up, and are uncomfortable. None-the-less, if I wear them under my helmet straps they fit like a glove, they have great ventilation and the photo-chromatic lens is great, especially when riding from the day into the night. These are great goggles that I would recommend to any motorcycle rider who needs to wear glasses."
4.0,"The lights that worked were bright and colorful. However, out of the 45 (they sent 5 extra ones), 14 did not work. When the company found out ----they sent out an additional 20 and all of those work."
4.0,"The font is big enough for me. It is fashion, accurate. I like this watch very much. It is worth buying."
4.0,"This insulation box is not as large as photo depicts nor as large as others offered by other retailers.  But, it is a good size for taking sodas to the beach or for taking to the grocery store. I was going to return it but have decided to keep it for reasons stated."
4.0,"It looks as it show in the picture, I like it!!!"
4.0,So cute but runs small.
4.0,It is ok I can use it for my purpose
4.0,"Super fun bracelet. I would give it 5 stars however, I feel like there should be a photo that depicts the true size of the lucky cat heads. There is nothing much to compare it to and due to the nature of taking close up product photographs, so the details can be well seen, this particular item caught me off guard.<br /><br />I often sit and look up cm information and what equivalent it is in inches to have a better notion of the sizes I'm going to get. I must have missed that on this one because I expected much larger beads. It is still a well made bracelet and I have no intention of returning it. Just be aware of the size information if you are expecting something large, as the heads are about the size of a large frozen pea.<br /><br />The detail is amazing and anyone who enjoyed lucky cats and could wear this size, would love this."
4.0,"For the price, it‚Äôs perfect. The fabric is not bad, and the dress does fit slight loose so it is appropriate for casual times.  If you look at the picture the sew line In the waist is not lined correctly,  not so much like the picture. See picture to find true accuracy of the dress."
4.0,"This NATO strap is bright royal blue with a comfortable blend to the nylon weave.  One issue I had was the inside tang buckle was finished off with a very sharp edge, which would eventually cause strap fraying.  I used a  fine file to smooth and round off the inner edge so that cinching / notching the strap was smooth.  This is a quality control detail that should be addressed.  Made in China, so doubtful this review will make a difference.  Other than that, it's 'OK'."
4.0,The material is very thick & it has stretch but not so much . Giving it a 4 store because the buttons won‚Äôt stay button. Keeps unbuttoning
4.0,It fits perfect! Just the design across the front is very thick and weird feeling
4.0,This are so cute on.  I have had compliments on them all the time when I wear them.  I like the shade they are also.  If you are fashionista then these are for you.  They are so stylish and you won't see this style in any local stores!  Love them.
4.0,Soft leather and a good size. Smaller than expected but that's ok!
4.0,This is a good size and I do like it but it doesn't really have a true leather look.
4.0,"I was really excited to get this necklace, mostly because of the price. I was not disappointed it looks exactly like the picture and it even came 2 weeks earlier than expected! My only concern is that the pearls smell like nail polish...? Has anyone else noticed the same thing? It just seems a little odd to me, it's not enough to bother me I only noticed when I was taking the necklace off after trying it on for the first time. Anyways I am still very pleased and other than the odd smell I have no complaints about the product it's really cute and I can't wait to wear it out."
4.0,"This is a nice little jacket but runs very small. The fabric is stretchy, so that helps. I usually wear a 18/20 and ordered a 3x and it is still snug. If it weren't stretchy, it would not fit. Quality and style are nice, just wish it ran a little larger."
4.0,"The color looks a little different and it took a while to come in the mail but it's a pretty good buy. Its cute and I like that it's not extreamely dangly. i wish the top ball wasn't solid silver, but that's my personal preference"
4.0,I was very happy with this bracelet
4.0,Absolutely stylish and cool case that match my glasses perrrrrrrrfect
4.0,"I may have run out of pithy comments as I've reviewed three other items of swim-wear for the bikini-challenged.<br />I do like this one but it does have its flaws. Love the dark top to print bottom. Very flattering on the curvy figure. I do NOT like the following:<br />1. the bow at the center, no matter how you tie it, will not hang correctly. It twists to one side or the other. I'm going to square not and sew mine in place.<br />2. the WHITE underlining is horrible. Please make it dark on your next batch. You know this skirt is going to end up floating, so why expose the not-bikini-ready figure underneath to the harsh scrutiny that a somewhat translucent, wet, white, sausage wrapping is going to get? Make it black to match, or blue if the dress has blue, or red or...just not white<br />3. the short underneath. I generally prefer the more between a bikini and a short cut, these are long shorts. How about options, give us a choice between shorts, boy-short shorts, and bikini.<br />4. not enough choices, Be creative. How 'bout a solid color? How about a print top and solid bottom? How about different prints?"
4.0,It continues to come unhinged from the rest of the necklace but I am able to repair.
4.0,"These earrings have great colors to accompany camouflage attire.  The two things I would change are maybe having a metal ring around the hole wear the wire fits on the earrings for reinforcement, and maybe having a more thicker fabric/material for the earrings because it's very thin."
4.0,Very cute. Shrank a little. Size up
4.0,"Believe the reviews: the ring runs big. I ordered a size 15, and though labeled a 15, it fits like a 16. I put it on and it practically swallows my wedding band, so I have to wear it on my index finger (where it‚Äôs fits snug, but ok)<br />Also, shipping took forever (to be fair, it was like two weeks and they were upfront about it, as it wasn‚Äôt Prime eligible)<br />But those two concerns aside, it‚Äôs a nice ring. It‚Äôs has the right weight and feel to it, and looks much better in person than the image online shows. Definitely a conversation starter. Overall, I‚Äôm pleased with this ring."
4.0,"Too dang complicated to enter and review. I'm already using the phone and have to check in and out to confirm. As to the product, it's a shame our disposable society don't value real leather. Can't find a cobbler or leather shop. Good stuff thanx."
4.0,Fun for a bachelorette party
4.0,"the quality is fair enough for the price that you are paying for them. The sizing seems about right to me. I don't know if this is a me problem or not, but they do make my butt look a little weird but oh well. The only thing I wish they had were back pockets, but overall, they are really cute, and I would recommend buying them."
4.0,"Bought one in black and love it so much, I came back and bought one in navy. These are very comfortable, soft, and the small fits me perfectly. They don‚Äôt bunch up when I sleep either. I took off one star because I can‚Äôt stand the itchy tag! The way it‚Äôs sewn on, you can‚Äôt just rip it off. It‚Äôs impossible to cut it off without leaving a little of the tag on, otherwise you‚Äôll end up with a hole. Make it tagless or removable and this would be perfect."
4.0,"This covers all the bags I bought. Colors, style and size is perfect for me."
4.0,This t-shirt would be a good one for layering or warm weather wear. The distressed logo gives it that &#34;I've had this t-shirt forever and I love it&#34; look.
4.0,"This is replacing my old Fossil wallet that I've had for years. The size is the same and I like the zipper on the back. The coin opening is very hard to get at the coins, maybe it will soften with time. I've used it 3 days and I'm hoping with use and time the cards will come out easier also. The quality of the leather is very good! My old wallet did not have the RFID and that was also why I chose this one."
4.0,"Not for an adult.<br />I love the quality and the loon !<br />The only problem is that is to small For  my husband hand  , I just going to give to my son<br />He is 14 so it will fith fine.<br />I wish they have other sizes :("
4.0,Decent made shoe but the sole is busting through atvthe heal after a month or 2
4.0,Comfy pajamas! I don‚Äôt expect these to stand the test of time but they are comfy and I feel nice in them. The top is a little bit low cut but not too bad
4.0,"Very nice, but a week or two after i got it the loop came undone the entire seam started undoing,from the looks of it they were weak stitches in the first place but a quick job with a needle and thread and it was fixed! Overall, a very good item tk ise for cosplays and such"
4.0,"I personally like this shirt a lot.<br /><br />The material is not cottony, but more firm and textured but it helps the shirt feel cool. The tag says dry clean only which I was disappointed in at first, but I washed it in my washer anyway then dried it flat and it turned out fine. I've worn it repeatedly because it is one of my new favorite shirts. It looks dressy but is very comfortable. I could wear to work or a casual event.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars though because my husband thinks it looks like a night share and multiple friends asked if it was a scrub top."
4.0,"If your xs go up to a small, if your small go medium, it is tight accross the bust and armpits"
4.0,"Very nice stockings, rolled down my thighs though. A little small, but super cute."
4.0,Great boots so far after a few weeks... Comfortable out the box. Possibly a half size smaller on the next pair would be perfect. Overall a very nice boot.
4.0,"I was so excited to receive my face shields. They came perfectly packaged. They were anti-fogging like described, however, I saw no warning about cleaning them with disinfectant. This is the result of doing so...blotchy spots. I've tried everything to return them to normal. In the midst of this pandemic, I use Lysol on everything and haven't had a problem. A warning should probably be added to the details...just saying. Other than that, I was very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"I have used them and they are ok. Of course they do what they are supposse to do. They fit my head, they are comfortable, they keep my ears warm but  they move from my head if i am doing any activity, the color i received is blue. i wanted them to be black."
4.0,They make my keys very easy to find. I also haven‚Äôt dropped them I. The parking lot since I started using this ring.
4.0,"I love these tank tops. I agree if you dry them in the dryer they will shrink. The label states, DO NOT TUMBLE DRY. If you do not have a clothes rack or line these are not for you. Two of mine shrunk, but I can still wear them around the house. I wish they were preshrunk but for the price you just have to be careful. I deducted a star because most of us have dryers and accidents will happen."
4.0,"I recieved mine earlier than expected. I found the necklace to be very pretty. My only complaint is that the photo makes it look like the stones are more of a rose color, but they're actually purple. Either way I still found it pretty. Definitely a great value for the price."
4.0,This is so cute. It could be worn as a swimsuit or a crop top. I can't wait for the nice warm weather!
4.0,"Amazon description says these are letter. They look like leather, but they have no tags or descriptions whatsoever. They look exactly as in the pictures and are very stylish and comfortable. To me these run half a number large, and I have thick feet, though not as thick to buy W shoes."
4.0,It's great but a little small..
4.0,"great quality, but are a little too big for me."
4.0,"Good belt, but the webbing is just barely smaller than the buckle making it a little cumbersome to buckle at times."
4.0,It very cute I buying for my daughter and she loved.
4.0,"I'm not a runner because ""it hurts my boobs"" but now I have no excuse. I searched high and low for a sports bra that wasn't racerback! I found this one, one from Good American, and later one from Aerie. This was the cheapest option. It's definitely a compression sports bra but doesn't dig in and passes the bounce test! Definitely not a lounge/yoga bra."
4.0,"I love all the credit card slots and many places to stash things.  Love the colors, zipper closure and outside coin pocket.  Would give it 5 stars but it‚Äôs a little larger than I‚Äôd like.  Doesn‚Äôt fit in a smaller purse."
4.0,"This set of a Multi Strand Layered Necklace and Earring is made of various colors of beading on clear line for the necklace and metal wire for the earrings. This is very attractive from a design and color standpoint, and would be a lovely addition to outfits for various occasions from casual to dressy. This set appears to be well made, with clean wiring and finishes. Overall, this is a very pretty look."
4.0,"I like the band, though adding the taking out links is a bit tricky. Instruction hard to follow. Also band can pinch as you get used to putting it on. Now all seems good."
4.0,very pretty it looks good with jeans
4.0,Great shirt great quality<br />It ran a bit bigger so I'll advise a skinny dude to get on size smaller for a tighter fit. (If u dont have long arms)
4.0,I would have given this item 5 stars except in the picture it does not show you that you actually have to lease the straps on one shoulder. The Straps are very long and I ended up having to cut them.
4.0,"The yellow beads are kind of cheap, but it will go well with my outfit."
4.0,cute dress....unfortunately came 2 days late even though i ordered prime
4.0,I really like Cooloo's return policy. It wasn't what I expected but they were great at the no cost refund. I would buy from them again.
4.0,Was a gift for granddaughter and she liked it.
4.0,"I love Swatches usually because of the watch bands (materials and colors). On this particular watch, however, the face for a little larger than what I had expected."
4.0,I would have liked it more if they had a size up.
4.0,This necklace is Very cute looking. Very good Quality and well polished. its shines in the light. The size of a stone is good but chain is very thin. Which makes it more sensitive. If little extra pressure is applied it might break. Other than that it‚Äôs perfect. It goes with all the dresses. Love it
4.0,A bit small for my hands...
4.0,"Although mine was too small I'll still give it 4 stars because it is very nice. Definitely great quality. I'd recommend ordering a size or 2 bigger if you're a bigger guy like myself. I normally wear a 4XL, as I've ordered plenty of times from KingSize, but with this shirt in particular it was much too small."
4.0,It looks very cute on my daughter. She loves the sparkles in it. Best part is that it does not rise up even when she is jumping around.
4.0,This is really cute wish the top was longer
4.0,Definitely keeps you dry.Mens large were a little snug. They're stretching out nice though.
4.0,These pj‚Äôs are just how I expected and are very comfortable! I ordered a small and the pants fit great although too long since I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù.  The shirt I wish was a little larger/longer since I like sleep shirts a little bigger and not 100% cotton.  It should be a cotton/poly blend like the pants.  I will hem the pants and will be careful not to dry the top so it won‚Äôt shrink.  I hope to wear these pjs for years to come.
4.0,Shorter than the ones I buy from stores which is nice since it makes it harder for me to bite the ball when eating. I switched the balls to plastic anyway since I wouldn't look good with chipped teeth. I'm allergic to many metals and so far I haven't had a reaction to the bar.
4.0,"Classic watch for a great price. Band is flimsy and will eventually corrode/break, but it's worth it nonetheless."
4.0,"This hat seems pretty well made, and it was a good price, but it ran a little larger than I was expecting. It had my hat size printed on the label, but it feels like it is about a quarter inch wider."
4.0,"Fit well, look sharp, great for hitting the dirt trails."
4.0,"Love love love this dress. It's cotton, very flattering."
4.0,Colors are vibrant and the shirt looks just like the one pictured on Amazon. It seems to run a little small though. I ordered a large but it seems to fit more like a medium.
4.0,Very satisfied with product.
4.0,"if you are between sizes, go up. they fit snug, but not skin tight. has a fold over waist."
4.0,"Good value, nice and warm. Color is more muted than picture"
4.0,"Overall, this is a really cute dress but it does run rather on the large side. I ordered a small but it definitely fits more like a medium or even a smaller large. I usually wear a small, and have to wear a belt over this to make it work. The material is quite nice and I really like the ruffle design."
4.0,Dress was cute however too short! But I loved it
4.0,"Very cute, very comfy. It has become one of my favorite lounging shirts, but is stylish enough it‚Äôs ok to wear out running errands as well. Fits as expected, good quality."
4.0,I thought they would be less plastic-like than they really are. I really should've looked at the materials it's made of because I thought there would be some medal on them.
4.0,great dress. got a lot of compliments from it.
4.0,"This is a nice bracelet.  It is comfortable to wear and looks nice.  However, I will say that I have a very small wrist, and it fits me well. It may not fit a larger wrist comfortably."
4.0,"Was worried they would be slippery, I wore them all over the camp and rocks and shower... No slip... Very comfortable..."
4.0,Material is light weight and good for wearing under a sweater during cool weather. Fits as expected and very comfortable.
4.0,Cute and comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and the length is just below my knee. Only problem that I personally have is I don‚Äôt have much of a torso so I can‚Äôt decide if I like it on me or not.
4.0,"The product fits very well, but they were the wrong color, i ordered the pack of multicolor breifs and got a pack of all black.<br />Now i am stuck with 5 black briefs"
4.0,"I love these for my job, they are soft & comfortable. Too bad they got delivered to the wrong address. Nice job Amazon Prime. Thank God for honest neighbors."
4.0,for the price it was perfect
4.0,Really like this vest ....fits well
4.0,"Seems like a great parka, but ZIPPER only opens 1-way --  can't open it from bottom for sitting more comfortably."
4.0,"If a women's chest is larger than a size A, or possibly a B, they need to order a size up. The top does not have any stretch. The bottoms are either true to size or may be a little large, but better than being too small. I like the quality, quick delivery time and ease of return. Two women in my family had to return for the next size up. We're all ready for Christmas!"
4.0,Good but Lighting phosphorous weak in the dark
4.0,"I'm 5'9&quot; and like 146lbs. 38A. Long torso.<br />I ordered a large.  I think if you've got small (post nursing two babies) boobies  you'll fit this just fine.  Bigger breasts would probably peep out the sides a tad.<br />Length wise,  it's a little higher in the front,  maybe a couple inches from ground.  As for the back -- You can tighten or loosen depending on preference,  and that determines how tight the waist is,  as well as how close to the ground the back part of the dress falls.<br />Stitching on the sides of the top front panel are pretty chunky but the dress has this while kinda boho/ hippie vibe,  so it's fitting to that style.  Excited to wear when weather warms up.<br /><br />Update. Super sheer in front. I took our pads from another bra and used those to cover nipples from showing. Maybe I'll sew a liner inside. Tried using those sticky nipple pads, but those also showed. Still love it. This is just an fyi."
4.0,Definitely tight for the size. My daughter is 5 and 40 pounds. She normally wear 5t or xs. The 6-8 size was tight
4.0,Nice product. I purchased them for my daughter who has toe sensitivity issues with her socks &#34;bunching up&#34; in her shoes.
4.0,"I bought this bag looking for a messenger bag or leather over the shoulder briefcase. The canvas and leather are really good quality, and sure to last for quite some time. The leather handles are thick, so you know they're going to last you. The only down side is the inside is nylon, which I haven't had the best of luck with in the backpacks I used to carry, but I've only had the bag for a little over a month, and they seem to be holding their own right now. The outside of this bag I suspect will last for a good time,if you're looking for something to hold you over until you can save up for a better quality setup or need added storage aside from a rolling briefcase, this bag can't do you wrong for the cost. I would buy it again if I had to."
4.0,Very good and comfortable!
4.0,"the only thing i dont like it is that u have zipper between legs only in the middle , the opening is very small  so you have to put it over your head.plus every time you change diaper you have to take out babys feet.out."
4.0,"Pokey back that lays on your chest, but once I put a piece of felt to line the back, it made all the difference in the world."
4.0,"This is a very high quality product - the chiffon draping on the shirt is quite attractive.  I am overall super pleased with the product, but I would note that the picture makes it look like a halter top - a style I like best - and the actual shirt is more of a spaghetti strap style."
4.0,"This is not see through and has good coverage. It is plenty wide and flowy, but short in the front - especially of you stand up straight or raise your arms."
4.0,"got it as a gift for my GF and she loves it. When ever she puts it on, everyone knows its drinking time"
4.0,So stiff to get open and closed.
4.0,"It's a nice, well made product, and my son loves it. It's nice having an option to wear pants or shorts."
4.0,"Great product, nice fabric but as expected not knee high for me because of my larger calves. I do still enjoy the product."
4.0,The dress was great until I washed it. It shrunk basically into a long shirt. I ended up giving it to my niece. It fit her perfect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I would size up especially if you‚Äôre kind of between sizes
4.0,Bought it for just the pink one - for Breast Cancer Awareness. It kept us dry and warm during the game but because we had multiple layers it didn't stay closed as well as anticipated.
4.0,The zipper is broke so I‚Äôll be returning it. But I give it 4 stars cos it‚Äôs a beautiful purse. Just as it‚Äôs described.  I‚Äôm disappointed that the zipper is broken.
4.0,Nice bingo prizes for my residents!
4.0,"Love the Ganesh pendant. Can't remove or put on necklace without a lot of patience... Old fumble fingers. Next time I'll opt for a 22 "" length for the chain. A good investment."
4.0,"Pretty and goes well with gold and silver earrings.  No problems, but I gave it four stars because I can see where you would have to be careful that this did not pick fabrics with which it may come in contact.  Would order again."
4.0,"Nice sweatshirt, blue hues rather than tan, only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Arrived quickly."
4.0,Top came back like picture fit as expected I really liked it
4.0,I really like these leggings. They fit snug but not too snug and they stay in place. Plus I love how high waisted they are and the color options are great! The only downside is that they are not super long and don't hit my ankles. I'm still very happy with these.
4.0,"I ordered this bag and received it. As the description suggests, it is stylish and appears to be well-made. It claims to &#34;fit at most a 14&#34; laptop. My 14&#34; dell does not even come close to fitting, and thus I will return the bag. I like it and even considered keeping due to what otherwise appears to be a quality product. I can fit my laptop in the zippered section designed to fit papers, but the padded laptop holder inside the zipper looks like it would fit a 13&#34; laptop perfectly, and not larger than that."
4.0,"Comfortable and cozy! Not too warm either, but not super thin. Ordered a size up just to have a looser effect, but the large seems fairly big for a large. My only complaint is that mine was obviously previously returned- covered in dog hair and dust, which I guess isn't a big deal since I wash everything anyways before wearing."
4.0,The stone color is very good and the screw on backs are a quality feature. Only negative is the style of the mount does not show much gold for some this might be a plus.
4.0,"I would have LOOOOOVED this if it fit. It was advertised as &#34;one size&#34; and given how huge mordenmiss usually is, I was sure it would fit When it came, the label said &#34;M&#34; and it was way too tight. I am about a size 10 normally and I would have needed a L or XL in this. For someone smaller than me, crazy cute top."
4.0,These stockings are comfortable and easy to put on.
4.0,Quality and fit was great.
4.0,"I had already read that this leotard runs small so I ordered a size bigger for my 5yr old daughter. Glad I did, fits perfect."
4.0,"So far...so good... they've provided enough length to my necklaces... not flimsy, so I'm confident they should last a while..."
4.0,I love this clutch. A great statement bag.  The quality is great. It has a strap that can be tucked inside. It has plenty of interior space. Color is perfect.
4.0,Cute costume. The hood with the voodoo pins didn't look great. I just left the hood down and put voodoo pins in my hair instead.  Received compliments on the costume for Halloween.
4.0,"love the color, guess I should have noticed how the models boobs pop out, because mine does too, another camisole purchase"
4.0,This dress is cute as it can be.  Only reason I give it a 4 is .....I am 5‚Äô tall.  This dress is extremely short . Barely covered Butt.  Needs tights & bloomers.  Yes that short.  But loved it
4.0,Nice and toasty on those cold days
4.0,CUTE! Plastic - but CUTE.
4.0,"Very cute but long. I'm 5'7&#34; and felt that it was at a weird length. Very cute, comfortable and soft otherwise."
4.0,love the rim and the ability to store or carry around.
4.0,"Nicely made, fits as expected.  Seemingly a great value"
4.0,"These are great for the pool to protect little toes and keep her from slipping.  They seemed to run slightly small but are soft enough it has not been a problem.  We have noticed that the black rim does leave a little color around my daughters ankle overtime, we double checked to make sure it wasn't because they were too tight.  Easy to get on and off her feet."
4.0,The colors were great but the sarong is smaller than expected... it will have to serve as a scarf.
4.0,"Nice blouse. Cheap material, but it passes. Worth the price."
4.0,Love all of them beautiful! The pink one was broken ball fell off in my hand excellent customer service! They sent me a replacement.
4.0,"I looked and looked for a Bracelet exactly like this, I only wish the Pearl was a little smaller, but having said that my wife loved it as a 30th Anniversary Gift. Simple yet, met the expectation.<br />The Pictures are the Bracelet as well as mine next to hers. (Mine was bought at a different time, and wanted something to 'match')<br /><br />Thank you"
4.0,"Runs a hair small but not bad. Very comfy  , soft material."
4.0,Not what I thought but still ok
4.0,"I shoot video for a living and I am always taking my glasses off or putting them on top of my head to look through the lens of the camera.  Got to be a pain to do that all the time, so I bought this strap and it works great.  Plus it looks great."
4.0,"Shirt fits small (as previous reviews stated) so I ordered a xxl. Fits like a large, which is how I expected it to fit. Material is soft and cozy. Wording is screen printed so it won't crack and peel off. Very happy with my purchase. Customer service is outstanding"
4.0,"These are even sexier on than I thought they would be. I can't believe I needed to buy a 6x when I wear a 20, but oh well. I did need to return the matching bra for a smaller size (I wear a 44L and a 44K was too big)."
4.0,"I like these, but I didn't notice they come as an individual anklet. I thought I was buying a pair.<br />I do like it, and plan towear this summer to certain casual events."
4.0,Comfortable but the material is thinner than I expected.  Out of the two pairs I bought one of them had a broken zipper within 20 minutes of putting them on had nothing in the pocket at the time.  Other pair I've had no problems after wearing them a couple times.
4.0,I didn't research what type of material it was and it didn't flatter my body type but it was a very pretty dress
4.0,"An excellent value for the price. A nice weighty piece with a lovely appearance. There appeared to be only two minor issues. The first is that there is no way to adjust the chain more than a couple of inches in length. The second is that the pendant covering the magnifying glass must be held out of the way while one is using the magnifier. This can be awkward if one is holding a menu or book with one hand. Otherwise, it is a lovely gift for an older person or someone who needs a discreet way to have a little boost for reading fine print."
4.0,"My purpose in wearing this EVA one-piece coverall is to protect my clothing during an outdoor project that involves handling undiluted chlorine bleach.  I detected no flaws in the material or in the garment‚Äôs construction.  The material is moderately thick, so I expect it to be reasonably durable. The zipper runs smoothly.  Liquids do not penetrate it.  The plastic fabric is not breathable and there is no venting in the garment‚Äôs construction, so it I expect I will swelter in it in hot weather.  The sizing of this garment is strange.  I am a slender 5‚Äô5‚Äù inch woman and size large barely fits me.  The torso is long and roomy enough that I can wear a light jacket under it.  However, both the arms and legs are quite short.  The sleeves are raglan style, so I measured from the underam to the cuff.  This measured only 16‚Äù long.  The inseam on the legs is only 24‚Äù.  On a taller person, both sleeves and legs would be much too short to offer full coverage.  As priced at the time of this review, this rainsuit is a good value even taking its sizing peculiarities into consideration."
4.0,At little smaller than I hoped
4.0,not the best taken care of but overall still good cant complain for getting it online so still happy with it
4.0,"The only issue with these shorts, is that there is an unfortunate seam in the front."
4.0,"Good socks for the money!  They‚Äôre thin so definitely a summer sock, or for snug shoes.  Comfortable and wicks moisture well.  Only small complaint is the ankle does slip marginally.  No fuzz, or piling."
4.0,"The material is very very soft and it's very comfortable. The purple is very pretty and the color did not bleed in the wash.  I got this in a 3x, I usually wear a 1x but wanted something big and loose.  This is loose but it clings to my &#34;curves&#34; just by how it lays on you which is the only thing I don't like about it.<br /><br />The fabric is breathable, the length is nice as it goes half way down my hips comfortably but will reach all the way down them.  The stitching is very good and the washing instructions are included.  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"***Update: The first time I washed these they balled up and are ruined!?!?! ***<br />It‚Äôs a shame because the were so nice. I just can‚Äôt believe how bad they washed up.<br /><br />As you can see all my fat is in my belly. I ordered a medium (after reading all reviews).  I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and I weigh 154 lbs today. They feel so silky and soft, not see-through. I have had a few times the top rolled a little bit, that is because I have a bigger belly. I recommend these, just read the reviews to get the correct size. Don‚Äôt be afraid of the white, you can‚Äôt see through them."
4.0,"Does what it should.  not the prettiest one, but functional for a photo shoot."
4.0,A little more white that what's pictured. Thought it would be more of a cream color.y wrist is about 6.25&#34; and this wraps 5 times around comfortably. If wrapped 4 it will sit higher on my arm. LOVE the various sizes of beads used to give it some depth and design.
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and about 135 pods. Bought a medium to be safe, definitely could have gotten the small. Expected it to be a little longer as well but it‚Äôs fine. The material is a bit heavy not light and airy like I thought it would be."
4.0,These are great quality boots. I'd normally be a size 9 in a boot but these were too big when I got them. I think I could order a size 8 and be just fine. I have large athletic but not humongous calves - I was happy to find there is ample space. I'd like to return for a smaller size but I don't think the return shipping from the US is worth it. So I'll probably try a shoe insert and if that doesn't work I'll give them away to my cousin and probably reorder a size down.
4.0,The hat while super adjustable has a slightly off fit for my head.  However it is a nice lightweight hat.  Washes very well.
4.0,"Very mice earrings, but they are not ""dainty"".  They are much bigger than expected,  but I still like them."
4.0,"I was looking for a phone grip similar to a Popsocket and most similar grips disappoint but this one seemed to be a good replacement.  I like the moon design, love that it has a magnet and it has stayed sturdily attached to my phone.  One day however when I went to close it, the outer ring cracked, and now the grip doesn't stay all the way down anymore - it just keeps popping partially back up :(  That is the only downside, I wish that didn't happen as it still works but now is kind of inconvenient that it won't stay down."
4.0,"I like to run and  it's hard to find shorts than fit me perfect, they really do it,  they are high in the waist and not so short, the quality of the fabric is good, they do not look transparent when you put them on."
4.0,"It‚Äôs just wonderful if you wear glasses, no fog at all, the air comes out from below, they are big, really big, I guess ideally it would not have to be lose from below to have full protection?????"
4.0,"Calf compression sleeves delivered quickly, nice packaging, and I like the fact that it did not have any tags inside the product.<br />Cons I got a Medium according to the size chart, but it is extremely tight on the top right below the knee and really baggy around the calf area. Took them for a 4 mile run and it was extremely to tight on the top.<br />Pro I used it instead around my arm and it works great.<br />Received the product at a discount, in exchange for a fair and honest review. I was not compensated to leave a positive review."
4.0,"I wanted to love these SO BADLY. The fabric was perfect and so was the style and cut. HOWEVER- they gave me the worst camel toe any legging has everrrrr given me. I tried a S and XS just to see if a bigger size would fix the issue but nope. If you have no problem with seams giving your vagina a wedgie, then you'll adore these!"
4.0,"love them, perfect for everyday wear, or in your second hole, smaller then an eraser head. BUT LOVE!!!"
4.0,"The vent could be more powerful, not enough power. Overall an ok product"
4.0,I bought this top for a Melanie Martinez concert because it went so well with the theme. It fits a bit tighter than expected but from reading the reviews I knew it might. I'm a 36c 5'4 180lb woman and it fits great for what I need it for.
4.0,3 X was waaaay too large but I had my mom cut it down to fit me. I'm a large. The lace is lovely though and the quality is great.
4.0,I thought the entire blouse was chiffon but it will work under a jacket
4.0,Fun casual everyday inex finger ring.
4.0,"Im happy I ordered two sizes up, because few pictures in reviews I didnt like how it fits. So I decided to order it large when Im normally small. Im sure medium could fit me too but little shorter than I wanted (I wanted to be like a oversized sweater). Im 5‚Äô4‚Äù 152lbs 32/34DDDcup<br /><br />What I did not like is that each time I have my hand in the pockets they can be seen and I dont like it (see my picture)"
4.0,Decent everyday slipper
4.0,Stitch medallion fell off first week after I got it but easy enough to  put back on and it‚Äôs stayed so far but beautiful and thoughtful
4.0,I got this to replace the plain leather band on my Gear watch. The original band was a little too bulky & masculine. I love this one. It looks like a pretty bracelet & I get compliments all the time. The beads even glow in the dark which was an adorable surprise! My only complaint is that the heart clasp is very difficult to connect even for my husband to put on. I bought a magnetic locking clasp to replace it & now I'm prefectly happy.
4.0,Takes a really long time to come in
4.0,Guess I‚Äôm just to short for it to not look like a night gown
4.0,I am a US 16/18. I purchased this dress in a xxl. It fits as expected.
4.0,"I brought this as a gift for my step sister that's a hair dresser and she absolutely loved it! Like most fashion jewelry, it dulls after a few wear but the charms didnt fall off and the design was sleek and nice. It was also very comfortable to wear. She still has them after 4 years"
4.0,"Fits good, lovely colors,  love the pockets too"
4.0,I liked it used it on my Pandora braclet lasted me a while till the red circle came off<br />But I enjoyed having it for a while
4.0,Love the bag.  Took it to Colorado for a week of skiing and carried everything.  The only thing I do not like is that it does not stand upright when using it vertically.  If falls forward which was a pain when going to/from airport.  Still recommend.
4.0,"These are no Lululemon's but they are of good quality.  Soft, stretchy, good coverage, and have lasted a long time. They just don't have the support that Lululemon is able to provide, but for the price you can't beat it. Fits true to size, I may purchase again. 26 inch waist 5'1&#34; ordered an xs."
4.0,"It was a lot more cut in the back than the picture previewed. I like the tank okay, it just doesn‚Äôt hang how it does on the model, so I would size up if you are looking for that sort of fit."
4.0,Beautiful green color!
4.0,Nice top but had to return. Material is soft and breathable. White color was too sheer. Top was a little boxy on me but may work well for others.
4.0,Nice material - shape is kinda boxy - wouldn‚Äôt size up - maybe even size down - length is nice - not too short
4.0,Looks very nice but seller kept changing date of delivery
4.0,"The shirt looked nice, however, it was not what I was expecting material wise.  I ended up sending it back for something different."
4.0,This dress is pretty well made and good for the price.  My biggest issue was the way it fell on me - the waste was just too high to be flattering.  It might work better on someone of a different shape.
4.0,Pretty but blarger than portrayed
4.0,It was too high waisted even for a short person. It rides to my chest. Bought a cute red belt to go with it though. Looked OK.
4.0,"Love the material and design, just a little too long vs your average lanyard."
4.0,This fit as expected. Great for control top.
4.0,I like the dress but I didn't give it 5 stars because the waistband sits above the waist so the print top looks too short.
4.0,"Thought the watch was going to be larger, however, the watch seems durable for the price. It looks pretty nice and I am pretty happy with this watch."
4.0,"I loved the quality of the shirt, but it fit a size too small so it had to be returned!"
4.0,"Was looking for a gift for my mother ...who is a great grandma....this necklace is perfect.  it says granny,  it is plain enough that she can wear to the grocery store and yet nice enough that she can wear to church...to SHOW OFF her necklace to her friends.  Chain is smooth so it wont get tangled in hair or clothes.  You can adjust the length from the back a little bit too."
4.0,"Great price for such a cute wallet.<br />It holds a ton of stuff,  my only issue is with the card slots. Heaven forbid one of your cards slides into the deepest darkest dephs of the wallet,  becuse the slots arnt sewed shut.  Wish has happened on multiple occasions. One time I thought I lost my debit, vnope turns out they slide into the wallet."
4.0,I usually use this for dance classes(i take them at a studio) and seem to have hold up well. (been 2 years since purchase)  I also have worn it for everyday wear but always wear with some sort of shorts as others have said it is quite sheer. They fit somewhat tight but quite loose as i stretched them out quite quickly due to rigorous movement and my thighs are somewhat thick. It has done ita job nicely for me as workout to fashion wear and would recommend to others.<br /><br />For reference im about 5'0 and weigh about 120 pounds.
4.0,I bought this watch to replace a Timex Expedition watch that I was wearing instead of my beloved Bulova Hack watch while I work overseas. The Timex developed problems and I threw it away and replaced it with this classic watch. It will be the second time in my life that I have owned this model of watch. The weakness is the band. The first one ended up being a pocket watch after the band ripped. It doesn't sit quite right on my wrist but it is so light that it doesn't bother me. It is an amazingly modest and honest watch. I was happy to see all of the positive reviews of this watch. There is something wonderful indeed about it and it will be a sad day when production ceases.
4.0,Good product if you are looking for a minimalist wallet. I'd like a stronger magnet to hold the cash in place or maybe a different kind of clip that the money could wrap around the wallet and then be fastened on with a completely removable clip. Over all a good piece though if you don't carry too many paper money
4.0,I live in a small town where a lot of people don't know what what these colors mean. Most people just tell me it's a very pretty necklace.
4.0,Was perfect for 3 year olds birthday
4.0,Easy to use and fun to wear.
4.0,Size of the glasses is big
4.0,"This ring is really nice! I get compliments on it all of the time. I wear a size 8 ring size  but on this ring is a bit snug, so I wear it on my left hand, and it fits just right. My right hand it gets stuck, so I recommend a size 1/3 -1/2 larger when measuring for ring size."
4.0,My son loves these and fit his vervnartow foot.
4.0,"Loved this dress on the picture and loved it on me! So beautifully design. Material is comfortable, stretchy and thick."
4.0,"I love them. My only issue is is that they're a little large around the waist, but that could just be my body. They're light enough to use in the summer if i want to work out outside and they're great for yoga. Will definitely order more."
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot. It looks to be well made and I like its more sculpted fit. However, be warned - the shirt runs very small. I am 5'6"", 165 lbs, athletic fit, but don't have weight lifter's bulging muscles. Medium is tight on me (in chest and arms; perfect in length). It is right at the edge of acceptable, so I chose not to exchange, but if I order another one, I would definitely go for MT or large."
4.0,4 Stars because I expected it to have more fluff but it‚Äôs a beautiful skirt. I chose it specifically to use for my daughters ballet practice classes. She loves it and it‚Äôs not a distraction at all. ( the one in the middle with the puffy skirt)
4.0,"I bought the black in a medium but it came in a S/M, it is not true to its size so order a size larger. It fits a little too tight for me and it is somewhat see through when squatting. I do however like the mesh and the fabric. It is a nice pair of yoga pants and I would‚Äôve given 5 stars but due to the size issue, only 4 stars from me."
4.0,I ordered an XL and it fits like a large. I was not going for the skin tight look.
4.0,"It is a very good wig! I am very happy with it. I just wanted the base wig part, but the clip is really nice to. I got a lot of compliments. Just be warned, it is really heavy on your head if you are not used to thicker wigs."
4.0,A little on the small side but its freaking awesome otherwise. Love it
4.0,"A perfect fit and excellent quality, got several compliments on it!"
4.0,They are tough. I don't like that one of the pockets was not stitched correctly so some of my pocket items ended up rolling around in between the fabrics at the bottom of the shorts...
4.0,Got these for my wife and she loves them.<br />Happy with the size of the pearls. Would recommend.
4.0,Love these lightweight quick drying board shorts. But I think they run a bit small.
4.0,The dress is beautiful but the fit was too small even though I order the right size and my dauther is super skinny.
4.0,"Wish they were longer, but they keep a great attachment on my glasses."
4.0,Wish I could pick size!
4.0,Got a large she wears an 8 they were snug
4.0,Not as absorbent as I would have hoped. It will still be great for my daughter in college.
4.0,Easy to use and roll.
4.0,"I love the Watch Designed, but when I ware the Watch the Crystal fogg up too a point that it hard too see the dial.<br /><br />Also this watch stop running, and I would like too know who to contact for info too return this watch for repairs or replace."
4.0,It was a bit longer than I wanted - but I cut it off to above the knee and hemmed it!
4.0,"Would be 5 stars but the denim is a bit less ""denimy"" than I was expecting, beyond that, everything is just fine. A good solid affordable wallet. Next time I might try the full leather wallets instead"
4.0,"Soooooooo gorgeous. Ran a little small, so she didn‚Äôt wear it."
4.0,Stretchy. Didn't expect that. Pretty.
4.0,"Nice fabric, cozy style, cut a bit slim so that torso is a bit too snug."
4.0,Nice color. Great for summer. I ordered my size but It lost 1 star coz its small in the shoulder area. Returned it.
4.0,Daughter LOVES them but they get 4 stars for the high tag :(
4.0,Like this cover up a lot. The color is so pretty.  Had to order 1 size up and glad I did.
4.0,Very nice chain it's small but perfect to where to work nice touch to any outfit
4.0,Very good quality and cute too!
4.0,"The product itself is very well made and true to how it‚Äôs pictured, however I am returning the item and ordering a size up because of its tight fitting around the bust area. If you are a bit on the bustier end I would suggest you to order one size bigger than your normal size. Otherwise, a very well-crafted product that I‚Äôm looking forward wear."
4.0,"Great price, a little small fits tight."
4.0,"I needed new pants. I gained weight and all my pants were uncomfortable. I love these because even though they are cheaper material, they stretch and fit great. I am around a 14 so I got a 16 to be safe since they were not leggings but they are just as stretchy as leggings but do not feel like them. For the price, the quality wont be great but they are very comfortable."
4.0,"Soft fabric, comfortable and very cute top. The red buffalo check is not a true red though, it‚Äôs more of a dark coral."
4.0,"A little small for my package, but I like the snugness overall.  Don't get too excited, or you'll want a size up"
4.0,Wish they were longer but all in all my girlfriend love them
4.0,"Cute shoe, just a little big around the ankle! My daughter likes them."
4.0,I like these horns a lot but they are sort of heavy and the thick headband takes away from any realistic look. In the same token I don't know how they would stay on your head any other way. For the most part they are a pretty good buy.
4.0,Used these as part of a flight attendant costume.  Fit well.  Good value.
4.0,Very nice Comfortable with pocket  to carry your phone love it
4.0,"A pretty nice band for a modest price,looks good on my Casio."
4.0,"I like this shirt, but the material is very thin. The color is lighter than picture,  but that doesn't bother me. It is very soft and comfortable. It will make a great summer shirt. It fits a little large on me, if that helps you decide what size to get."
4.0,No need to spend more. I buy these for my employees every year and they work great and are simple.
4.0,"A birthday present for my mother and she's pleased with them. A warning if you have longer or thicker ear lobes they may be hard to get in or a tight fit, not in a hurting way but the lobe area is on the smaller side."
4.0,We were disappointed that the outfit was not delivered in time for Easter as it was ordered March 1.  The outfit is cute and well made.  The size 3 fits like a 2T.  It looks cute on.
4.0,I like the fact that is large enough to fit around my wrist.. it's made of sturdy material.
4.0,"Good size, sleeves are a bit narrow, so if you have larger arms, it might be a bit tight."
4.0,"I am a 16-18 with big curves, and often end up ordering XXL or even 3XL in some of the mysterious tiny-sized Asian brands on Amazon, but based on other reviews I went with an XL and it is plenty big. I probably could wear a L with no problem. This hangs nicely, doesn't cling, has an open neckline but isn't too low.<br /><br />For me, it will be a tunic. I am 5'9&#34; and it doesn't come even to mid-thigh. If you wear super short dresses, it would work, but I don't. It's cute over wide legged cropped jeans and would work with leggings."
4.0,This is a beautiful dress however it is very form fitting and see through.  Would only recommend if you have a slimmer build. Quality is very good and it is very pretty.
4.0,This necklace is lovely. The heart pendant is gorgeous. Encircled with sparkly crystals it has a number dangling in the center. In my case the number wad eight. It looked pretty. The chain is a coordinating gold-tone with a lobster claw clasp . Comes in a branded box with a small polishing cloth.
4.0,very nice sports bras - well made and great design but just too small under the bustlineVery nic
4.0,"I did get the small size, but even those are a little big for me. They are easy to use. I doubt that I will find something like this that will fit me perfectly. I am just going to adjust the ones I got."
4.0,It is bigger but looks fine
4.0,"This is my 4th jewelry product from this company, and I must say I'm very satisfied. I just love the earrings, the cz studs look very much real almost to the real diamond look. I would highly recommend their jewelry!!"
4.0,"I gave my 4 year old grand daughter the pink pair, for her birthday and she loves them. All the colors are awesome , she says."
4.0,Came before time and was very nice.
4.0,"So far this bra has been comfortable to wear. I am a size 40DD and ordered my correct size. It is a good fit in the cup area, no bubbling but I could have gone a band size up, so a 42D next time. The size 40 band isn't too bad, but I'm having to wear it on the first set of hooks so that it's not too tight.<br /><br />The fabric is nice. There's a medium mold thickness to the cup and the lace is soft and you can feel the texture of the pattern when you touch the lace. Thus bra gives you great lift! Which makes for a sexy fit. Because I have large breasts, this isn't an everyday look I would want to have. But I will say it looks nice under clothes and gives the illusion of great posture."
4.0,"Love the material and finish look, it's beautiful but it's bigger than I expected but that's fine, it was the only color like that leftüòÅ"
4.0,Good product. Fast shipping.
4.0,"It's really pretty. It's silky, soft, and the fabric is good. You have to make sure you order 1 SIZE UP! It's Asian sizes. It shows in the picture that the top and bottoms are different colors but I didn't look that close when I bought it, so I expected them to be the same color. Took a little time to get here. But I'm happy."
4.0,I was very happy with th pendant. It is a gift for my daughter and I think she‚Äôs going to love it. It looks  just Ike the picture
4.0,"Overall, I‚Äôm happy with the bag, but I wish I had read the other reviews more carefully ‚Äî I‚Äôm disappointed that the 23‚Äù bag does not include the separate zippered compartment that‚Äôs shown in the photos (I assume that‚Äôs the 30‚Äù bag in the pictures).<br /><br />Other than that, the bag is very sturdy and the shoulder strap can be adjusted to be very long, and it is comfortably padded.<br /><br />23‚Äù bag has no exterior pockets at all, but there is a small zippered compartment inside that would fit a wallet and a phone."
4.0,Great shift but a bit see through.
4.0,"Initially had a really strong chemical smell that took about a week to go away (hence -1 star). So far loving it. I like the little metal feet at the bottom that keeps it from getting worn out. Have gotten compliments from people who notice it's a kitty. Pretty roomy- I can fit a plastic water bottle, phone, wallet and some other items. Seems well made so far."
4.0,"I didn't think I would like it when it arrived but I tried it on and it was surprisingly nice on. Simple dress, with a sexy sudlete."
4.0,"Sizing is as expected and seems to be holding up well. It has stretched a bit more than I expected, but still fits and works just find."
4.0,Great dress -accentuates the good hides the bad -according to the chart a medium would fit me -5‚Äô5 145 lbs -got the LARGE -fits really nice -love it ! Might get another color -so my opinion size up
4.0,I ended up cutting out the shoulder pads and the shirt was more flattering on me afterwards.
4.0,If you are someone with more muscular arms or don‚Äôt have a super skinny bicep then this shirt will feel small in the sleeves
4.0,I ordered this top in medium size. I am 132 lb and height 5'6&#34; and wears medium/large. This top has its sleeves loose and the top reaches the thighs. The top is a little tight towards bust . If I ordered Large it would be too loose.This top is long than expected and sleeves are three fourth. I love the yellow color and also the floral pattern. This can be used as a casual top.
4.0,Very cute little dress. Perfect fit.
4.0,i always buy my scrub caps from this brand. never disappoint!
4.0,"I bought these to wear just around the house, and they are comfy! But I was hoping they‚Äôd be a tad bit longer. Light and soft material and the colors are true."
4.0,Legs roll up but comfortable and good fit
4.0,"The ring turned very orange after wearing it, and,are my finger turn different colors because it was cheaply made. The necklace is pretty jagged as well, like it was made in a mold or something and it had weird edges. The pocket watch was very nice however."
4.0,Love these! Work great for me until I can get my custom compressions
4.0,Love the look but the optics are not great.
4.0,Pretty dress. Nice amount of stretch to the fabric. Cute. Good price.
4.0,"Very good sunglasses at a great price, but rather wide frames. I was hoping for a frame size that was smaller than ""unisex"". I am not petite at 5'7"", 135 lbs, and a larger than average hat size. However as far as clarity of vision goes, and sturdiness of frame, these are excellent."
4.0,"Just as advertised. Works, good quality."
4.0,Me gusto mucho era lo q esperaba s√≥lo q es totalmente pl√°stico
4.0,Material sticks to you so they won't ride down or too far up.
4.0,I gave this four stars because I don't like the clasp on the necklace. I have a hard time putting the necklace on. I love the earrings too. I love the pearls but the next time I would like a longer length.
4.0,Very cute! Fit my 7yo great for end of school assembly
4.0,I bought these for my 11-year-old niece because she wanted knee high boots.  She is tall for her age.  They are perfect and she loves them.
4.0,these are perfect for putting in your purse when you need to read a lable or price tag while shopping.  Each pair comes with a lense cloth and a soft case so you can leave a pair in each room.  I did lol
4.0,Beautiful item.  Bought for my granddaughter...
4.0,The stool is a perfect height with the adjustment. I wish the back was metal and not plastic. Looks very nice in the shop.
4.0,Cute but made for skinny arms. Not really adjustable. Also snags on materials.
4.0,The first one we received didn‚Äôt work at all so I was worried the replacement would be the same.  Second one works just fine and the kids love it.  The music doesn‚Äôt play long but that doesn‚Äôt seem to bother them.  They just play it again :)
4.0,"I bought one black dress, tan dress and a black dress with sunflowers. Both the tan and black dress fit perfect. The sunflower dress is extremely tight on my chest."
4.0,The dress was beautiful.  The only problem was where the sleeves were attached to dress it was sewn too tightly or something and I could not get the sleeves on my shoulders.  Had to have them removed and reattached to the dress.
4.0,"I thought it was a mask lanyard as it states but it‚Äôs a regular badge lanyard. Which is fine, I could still use it."
4.0,Great shades for the price and surprisingly the don't appear to look cheap!
4.0,"Just a tad fuzzy but still works i can see hearts!<br />Theh are so cute, making great stocking stuffers!"
4.0,It was cute however the material kinda ripped a lil bit ü§£ü§£I guess I was a little rough adjusting it .
4.0,"looks good, but the top button came separate, and does not connect. otherwise i like it"
4.0,They are made of very comfortable material and fit my size 18/20 pant size but are like the reviews say are a little long.
4.0,It's cute but definitely not what I expected. It's very structured.
4.0,Works great with my oakleys
4.0,"The fit is great, however the material is way different than the picture. Tank top is still good though, it's comfy just don't expect it to have the flowy drapey look at the bottom. Also after one wash mine started pilling."
4.0,The look very nice!
4.0,"It's a nice cap, well constructed.  But has the camo underneath, not what I really wanted but still a great hat.  I find myself not wearing this in my area because of this.  The orange color plus the camo would be good for hunters or dog training, it's not blaze orange but still gets some attention."
4.0,Beautiful necklace. I bought it to go with a ring and bracelet I bought at a gem show. Nice quality. I couldn‚Äôt have made it myself for this price or paid a better price at this gem show. Nice jewelry. Good buy.
4.0,"I like it but the fabric was that gets static-y in the winter and sticks to you fabric.  Not what I want with leggings that are already skin tight.<br /><br />It was a good weight fabric, not super thin like many of these style tunics, but a bit snugger than I wanted in the style.  The L was snug around the bust and I'm a 36B/C but too snug for me to feel comfortable in.  I'm returning mine and not ordering the next size up in hopes of finding something I love vs just like."
4.0,Good quality materials.. good fit.
4.0,So I have mixed feelings on this suit. I will say that it is very good quality for the price. It arrived on time and does look just like the photo shows. You should know that this is definitely a full coverage bottom so if you like ones that show off a little something this is not the right bottom for you. The top and bottoms would both be very nice if there were to fit right. I am 5'1 145lbs with a 36DD cup so i ordered the x large based on the measurement chart. I am well endowed in the booty area and these were even a little loose on the butt for me. The top would have fit maybe a C cup at the most. Needless to say there is no size in this that would fit me because if i went up for the top and the bottom is already too big it just wouldn't work. I think this bikini would work best for someone who is smaller on top  with a full bottom or small all around and if those are your body type great then buy this because it is super cute but if you are hourglass shaped and bigger than a C cup i would say its a no go. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,the material slides down your arms but it fit
4.0,Cute little wallet. Perfect for what I need it for. Took off 1 star because the grey is more brown/khaki than grey.
4.0,Very cute dress! Really comfortable.  It does run fairly true to size. I did however return the dress because it was too large & I liked the other dress I bought better. I ordered a large.
4.0,Its crappy material but I can't complain. I got what I payed for.
4.0,"This is our 2nd pair due to herfeet juat keep getting bigger! We still love these Peppa light up shoes. They fit nicely even for a little wider foot. The quality is great, never had any issues!!"
4.0,"I purchased these for my grandchildren. They fit 2 boys great ages 2 & 4, but were big on the girls 3 & 4. Hmmmmm. The boys love them and they've held up to little boy wear and tear."
4.0,The army green dress is so cute. It arrived very wrinkled and was a challenge to iron. The fabric isn‚Äôt breathable. Overall I do love the dress and will probably wear it again when the Florida heat subsides.
4.0,I used this for a simple Trunkn treat costume. It was ok. Not made well. I had to do some altering. It didn't look like wings as much as just a strand of cloth hanging down from the biceps.  I feel to much was cut from the back. I used double sided iron-on tape to close the gap from the bicep the back to look more like wings. It worked perfectly! It was not alot of work so it was worth it. It also comes with big clip on bat earrings I was not aware of. I did not wear them though as they are very big for my liking.
4.0,Beautiful band if you want to keep your smartwatch and look fancy. A little frustrating putting together.
4.0,I like the fabric and pattern.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 38C.  So the top button is a little snug and the back length is a bit too long but over all I am pleased with the top.  I will have to wear a tank top underneath to cover the button gap but that's okay.
4.0,"The athletic shorts seem to be made of good quality material, they are lightweight, and very breathable, and are made with good stitching.  When purchasing the shorts, I did not pay very much attention to the fitting guide that was provided.  I assumed the medium size would fit like a standard Medium.  Instead it fits like a typical Small.  The waist fits much smaller than you might expect.  It's still wearable, but a bit tight.  And this is totally my fault, as they do have a size guide available.  As a side note, aside from the waist, the shorts have a bit of a ‚Äòbaggy‚Äô feel too them.  Overall, the product is good and I would likely buy it again, but in a size bigger."
4.0,Very comfortable and easy to wear. I had to bring up the should seams to close arm gap.
4.0,I ordered a large and am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 180lbs. It fit perfectly with plenty of room to be comfortable. I love the length and the color is rich. The lace is really good quality. Effect for a Christmas party. I almost wish I would have gotten one with sleeves to compare beacuse I always run into the issue of what to wear over a sleeveless dress to a party in the winter when it‚Äôs cold. All and all an amazing value. I ordered a few dresses off amazon and this red was the best of all
4.0,"So I write this for Dragoncon.  The only part if the whole costume I wore was the coat.  I changed everything else out.  The coat is well made fits great. I ordered a size up. The pants were HUGE. The shirey wad fine except it's made out of legging material and I was going to be in Atlanta in September.  So too hot for something not breathable. The ears and tail are okay,  I made my own and used those.  As for the cuff and collar they are cheaply made of vinyl.  I bought other ones to wear. You're honestly paying for the coat which is well made and lined."
4.0,"These appear to be legitimate. Didn't receive a temple cord, though, which is actually pictured in the photos."
4.0,I have the matching earrings
4.0,"They‚Äôre awesome, however they are uncomfortably tight on my face."
4.0,Looks expensive does the trick for my purse
4.0,"It's probably true to size, but most of the things I buy online run small so I ordered accordingly and this came a little big.  It's flattering to my shape but the black one shows dust easily."
4.0,The feel the same as the original Batwolf lenses except they seem to smudge on the inside a bit easier. Recommended.
4.0,The pins are nice they look like the photo although they do not stay still when you pin them to your clothing it moves around
4.0,"What I expected because I have another pair, just different color like them.  However, I did not realize they were so glitzy, would have preferred less bling.  Picture did not show this that much.  Arch support does not meet arches as well as my other pair, but is fine"
4.0,"They fit just fine. I am wearing them under a white Halloween costume, thus the white color."
4.0,"Cute dress. Only returned because it was longer than what I was looking for. It's definitely a cover dress as the split goes all the way down the front, minus the tiny part where it's sewn together near the tie. The pockets were too baggy for my liking though."
4.0,I wanted other options for winter hats when its cold enough to need a hat but not cold enough for thick winter hats. My kids are notorious for pulling off their hats because they get hot and itchy. These are thick cotton but breathe a little so the kids don't get too hot when out playing.  I started with this 3 pack to see if I liked these and will buy more if I need them.<br />I washed them first on warm and put them in the dryer and had minimal shrinking. The seams on top are a little different so you just have to turn the beanie a little but most people probably wouldn't notice. I would recommend for the price and quality.
4.0,Bought it for a gift for my daughter and she loves it... it is sturdy leather and seems to be made of good quality.
4.0,Very comfortable and reactive on dry turf. The shallow tread works well but I would prefer a more aggressive tread like the Adidas Turf Hog if the field was wet. It's hard to find a good mid/high top turf shoe for football.
4.0,Headband came apart first day I tried to put on my daughter.
4.0,Having trouble getting used to it. It is definitely more solid than what I had. The money strap is worthless otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,"Fits a little loose, but I am keeping it anyway.  I love the style and pattern."
4.0,"I usually wear a small but I upsized to a medium after reading the reviews. A medium is a bit loose on me, a small would have been fine. Fits as expected.<br /><br />-1 star because the fabric is rough."
4.0,"Four stars because in the photo, it appeared like a red plaid, but is actually pink."
4.0,Good quality but very tight. I don't have very big calves (about 16&#34; around) and these were snug for me. Might be fine for others
4.0,"Wish it would‚Äôve come stuffed in the correct shape, but for the price it more than did the job"
4.0,"I ordered these in a size 8M.  When they came in it said 8.5M on the shoes and box.<br />I tried them on to see how they would fit and they fit great.<br />Either they run 1/2 size smaller or they were labeled wrong.<br />Either way, they are comfy, cute and can‚Äôt beat the price."
4.0,"Fits nice, bust area a bit tight if your busty. Can dress up or down."
4.0,Very cute not to big not to small I put it on the zipper of a purse. Its big enough and nice enough to use as a charm.
4.0,Cute and the length/fullness is nice. 5/5 would buy again.
4.0,Love the dress but I got a smaller size than what I ordered so it's not long as how i wanted it and the arm part is small. Now i have to pay to adjust it. Cant send it back cause I'm from Jamaica and its definitely gone take long and cost a lot.
4.0,"I really liked this sweatshirt:  it was beautifully soft and warm.  The cut was cool, but didn't look good on me, but I would recommend it to others."
4.0,"This is a super Cute outfit! Overall a good purchase. There were a couple of loose threads, but for the price it was a good purchase."
4.0,Second pair!
4.0,Very cute and one of my new favs to wear with Jean's and tees. Worth it .
4.0,"I wore this to a wedding and got a lot of compliments. I'm 5'7"" 145 and athletically built. I could've gotten the next size down but I was worried about it being too small. The material is stretchy so you have room to work with. I ended up having to tie the straps together like a halter top with fishing wire because it was too loose on the top for me (I'm a B). I should've gotten the next size down. But other than that I loved the dress!"
4.0,Size up one and watch the stitching. I returned due to runs small and stitching on right thigh was messed up!!
4.0,The quality of the hat is good.  I have a big head and I do not like the fact that it‚Äôs sits higher on my head than I anticipated.  Fits my wife great!
4.0,"This is a great handheld. Light and with good storage. The major issues is that it can be tricky at aid stations. The cloth handle can get trapped under the lid and the bottle will leak. If you are careful this will not happen, but it is very easy to do. It became enough of an issue that I no long use these bottles on race day."
4.0,"Granddaughters love them.  Once small challenge was if they are beginner walkers, the bottoms are slippery."
4.0,Very pretty dress and worth the money.  I'm a US 6/8 and normally wear a medium. It's not stretchy or has any give to it so make sure to order a larger size so you can sit. Also I'm 5'10 and it's very short but nothing hangs out.
4.0,The first product that is EXACTLY as advertised. In reality it looks pretty much exactly as the photos and description.
4.0,We purchased these for a trip to Disney. We didn‚Äôt use them but they were thin. Are good for what they are needed for but had a hard time for some deciding if it was a child‚Äôs or adult size
4.0,"I think this dress runs bigger, so it's not very flattering, especially around the waist area. I wish I had sized down. Other than that, it's very pretty and the material is very soft and good quality. The softness of the material means the dress is super comfortable. The length is perfect for me, goes all the way down to my knees (I am 5'2"" and ordered a large.)"
4.0,This is a good high impact sports bra for a good price.  I jog in this & it really minimizes the bounce.  It‚Äôs very supportive & flattering.  The construction seems solid & I don‚Äôt think it will breakdown anytime soon.  The band ran a little large for me & I exchanged it for the next smallest size.
4.0,"it came in 2 pieces, the circle piece fell off, glad i found it in the bag so i got my tools and put it back together, other wise its cute...looks like picture"
4.0,I like it but I have to return because there was a cut on the left handle (factory defect).  I hope I get my money back or replace it with a good one.
4.0,"This is a really cute piece of jewelry.  My wife loves it. It's not high quality, but for the price it's much better than expected."
4.0,"This dress is really cute. I love the pockets. It's very comfortable. But... I don't like the material. It is polyester, which isn't very breathable. I think it would be hard to wear this in the summer unless it was a very cool day. Also it runs very big. I'm a size 10. I usually order a large. But reviews told me to order a med so I did. It was still quite large. I should have gotten a small. I'm keeping it because it is cute and returns are a hassle."
4.0,This should Be a $20 hat.  Great value! I now have three.
4.0,Somewhat difficult to get onto tie but once they are on there they look great!
4.0,"This set of fall earrings is very pretty, stylish, and better quality than I expected. I specifically got it for the leaf styled ones and the metal turkeys. The majority were prettier in person. A great variety of colors. Although the sizes of them were shown in the product images, some looked bigger in person but still very nice. I was sad that I received only one squirrel and one acorn like the other reviewer had. There was also an 'extra' pair of pumpkins studs that were not shown in the product images; which were not as nice or good quality as the ones pictured. I believe those are there to make up for the missing squirrel and acorn. So don't buy this specifically for the pair of squirrels and acorns because it will be just one asymmetrical set. Still very pretty and wearable though. The seller was very nice and prompt with helping me with this issue. Would still recommend these fall earrings sets. Hopefully I can find a friend who loves cooked turkey as those earrings are the only ones I do not wish to wear or keep. 14/16 is still a B+. Sorry for the low quality pictures! My camera didn't want focus. üôÉ"
4.0,Exceeded expectations. Just wish it would not release on its own at times.
4.0,"I have been all about comfort lately, I mean, these days we are staying home more, so why not be comfortable.  These pants do the trick.  they are warm, and comfy.  they fit OK, they are a little on the big side, but I love my comfy pants being a tad baggy.  I know joggers aren't the most flattering, but there are times when comfort and warmth wins over.  Made well.  will last a long time."
4.0,"These are definitely big on our 2.5 year old's hands. I don't even bother getting her thumb in the thumb hole, just cover her hole hand with them. The velcro cinch helps them stay on. Due to their bulky size and lack of thumb use, she can't grab anything too easily, though she did manage to pick of a rock using both hands. On the plus side, they do keep her hands warm and dry when she decides she wants to stick her hands into a snow pile."
4.0,cute but too see thru
4.0,Perfect size for my head. Good quantity and quality!
4.0,Four stars only because they are very tight across the front part of my foot across that big toe bone . Otherwise fine quality nice leather and very cute . Definitely not for walking long distance .
4.0,Works like they say it does. We put it up exactly like in the pix and it works very well to prevent light and cold/heat from passing through. Looks good too.
4.0,Isn‚Äôt a horrible dress but kinda looks like something mini mouse would wear
4.0,"Love this blanket scarf! It's coloring is beautiful and it's a soft scarf. However, it seems to shed quite a bit. I've only washed it once so far, but didn't dry it. So maybe that's why it leaves fuzzies on other things? Good buy!"
4.0,These were not difficult to pull on and gave a comfortable light support. I'm short so had to roll down just a little. Wore for hours and didn't leave a big indents around my legs.
4.0,Needs to be hung dried would rather put it in the dryer do it‚Äôs not all wrinkled hate ironing wish it said that in the discription
4.0,"This is my second pair of these sandals, they are very comfortable. I would have given them 5 stars but the Velcro wears out before the sandal does and it is not easy to replace the Velcro. Also the straps curl up at the ends and there is no Velcro to prevent this from happening."
4.0,"Pretty shoe, but definitely runs too big. I am usually a 6.5-7, so I bought a 6.5 and I ended up needing a 6."
4.0,Purchased these for my wife. She loves them and they run a half size small. Quick delivery too!
4.0,"It s beautiful. It runs a little smaller, size up! If you do that it fit perfect!!!"
4.0,Colors are hard to judge online and this was brighter than expected. But it‚Äôs great quality and very cute!
4.0,"Walking, great for the price"
4.0,"These pants are comfortable, but very long!"
4.0,"Easy to set up, Good quality for a smaller speaker."
4.0,These are a useful product for what they are advertised to be<br />except.........when they send product two sizes off. Will go into donation bag
4.0,"Love these pants but they were that tight around my knees so I sewed them to be more form fitting and they turned out awesome. The side zipper is a pain but as long as you don‚Äôt buy a size too small, it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue"
4.0,They were okay.  A little on the large size for me.
4.0,I really like this one. Was so cute in the photo and also in person. Liked it a lot.
4.0,Love it. It's very colorful
4.0,"I ordered 1 size large than in a store. I should have ordered 2 sizes bigger, but a little more healthy eating should help it fit a little more loose in the middle."
4.0,"For a lower price, this necklace does the trick. Im a bigger size and i had no problem with fit, and the sharp edges were not an issue. I did have to bend it a little for an exact fit."
4.0,"Wish there was something better out there. This is the best you can probably get but not 5 stars since it feels cheap. I got another one that was heavier and much more solid, but the aesthetics were terrible with chrome and black."
4.0,Its a nice bag with lots of room. The only reason i didn't give it five stars is because the strap that came with it has thread pulling out of it when i opened it. Not a good look.
4.0,Jacket is way too big and will cost $100 to alter.  Can I exchange the jacket size to 12H? Quality material.
4.0,"Well made. Runs a little small, but they are stretchy. Also run on the long side, had to hem them, but now they look good. Love the pockets."
4.0,"I like this bottom. It's frustrating that it's one size fits all, as this is a bit loose on me but a small clothespin helps keep it in place."
4.0,"Very cute and cozy, fits well, wish the neck hole was a little bigger but I still like it."
4.0,"This bra is pretty good when compared to other nursing bras, but is does flatten your breasts, so it's not very flattering."
4.0,"My neighbor is a runner. He has problems with his legs and I gave him these so that he can run a little bit more comfortably. They are nice and bright, so he should not have any issues being seen by drivers  and he likes that they don't go on the bottom of his feet. If this little gesture helps him, then that is fantastic."
4.0,"I am 5'1"" and 140 lbs. I bought an extra large. The cut of the dress was surprisingly flattering on my ""apple"" shape. It is one of the rare solid colored items I own. My only ""complaint"" is that the pockets are really low, so if you're short, keep that in mind. It washed well and was true to size. Happy with this purchase."
4.0,Was purchased as a gift for a friend who really seemed to like it.
4.0,Worked well in adding additional and comfortable wear.
4.0,I great substitute for your wedding band
4.0,"I like the style of this  necklace,  I wanted to give 5 star but it has a minor damage, I fixed it. I bought this to match my orange shoes and bag, but The bead in the middle Is very light orange, but still look nice"
4.0,Ligera con buen acabado
4.0,The bottom was perfect. (12-14=L) the top was small but doable (36B=XL apparently) do love the style though
4.0,Very small but fantastic quality
4.0,"I bought the royal blue color, and I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it! Fits great and is very flattering, even on a curvy woman such a short myself. Only thing is the material is a little thin, but other than that, I love it!"
4.0,"Quality is excellent. Leather is very thick and the leather used for the lacing is plenty strong to tie the sword in as tight as you'd ever need. The area to lace the scabbard in was narrower than I expected, a quick reordering of the lacing fixed this issue. I will say I'm to blame though as I tried to use it for my Damascus Marshall sword."
4.0,These earrings are much more beautiful than the pictures displays. I'm in the medical field and this is just the size I need to wear to work. They are very light and I love how they sparkle. Depending on how they wear I may rush to purchase another pair just as a back up pair..
4.0,[[VIDEOID:3e5a7b07caff5f40b308687b26df3a99]] It doesn‚Äôt look EXACTLY like the picture but it‚Äôs still really cute! True to size I got a large cause I thought it would run big but it doesn‚Äôt I should have got a medium
4.0,"Fan of Casio retro watches, have a few but loved this blue one. Watch is perfect, Feels slightly heavier than Casio ones. Great deal."
4.0,I bought this as a mother‚Äôs day gift for my mom and sister and they both loved it but it was a little small but cute
4.0,"Color was exactly as pictured and the size was accurate. Love the overall look and feel/texture of the purse and all of the separated spaces/pockets. But I do wish at least one of the easy access pockets on the outside was bigger......a more realistic size for holding a smartphone. There's not really anywhere to store your phone besides one of the zippered sections. But then you can't quickly grab it or hear your phone very well when it rings unless you leave that pocket unzipped. Which means stuff stored in there is more visible and falls out easier. Also only 1 week after I started to use the purse, the silver bead/button at the top where the body connects to the shorter handles, fell off. So now there's a visible hole. It's more of a decoration so the handle is still intact. It just looks ugly. Then about 2 weeks later the one on the other side fell off. So I'm disappointed about that. I've owned several cheaper purses from Wal-Mart that I've had for years that never gave me issues like this purse, that I paid double for, and have used for less than a month. The cell phone issue is more of a personal preference issue and the buttons may have just been a bad batch. So if you don't care about the cell phone thing, then I'd recommend this purse. I really like it and would buy it again as long as the button issue was a fluke and not just poor quality."
4.0,"Pretty, but small stone"
4.0,"Fits great, just a tad loose on the top. Comfortable!"
4.0,"I was trying to upload a picture but it did not let me, however the bracelet is beautiful. I just wish it was welded as stated because I know I will loose the charmsü•∫. That's the reason I bought it ü§ûüèΩ"
4.0,I bought a small and it fits like a small. Love it but if you are looking for a sweatshirt this is not one. It is light and more like a long sleeve shirt.
4.0,Bought it for my wife but was too large top to bottom of the mask for her face
4.0,These clips keep the gloves attached to the coat so the kids don‚Äôt loose their gloves at school when the take them off.
4.0,Would have been better if image was ink and not plastic.  Have gotten lots of compliments
4.0,Very nice material. Beautiful color. Little bigger than expected but it flows nicely. Overall I‚Äôm impressed.
4.0,I ordered this shirt and got a grey one instead of the blue. I'm still happy with the shirt but preferred the blue shirt because it's the one that is advertised and the only color to choose from.
4.0,Nice hat that has a lot of coverage to protect me from the sun. It fits me snug but I might have a large head. It wold be nice if they either had an option to chose different sizes or if the material was stretchy.
4.0,"Decent shirt for the price. The material is definitely more of a polyester cloth and I would have liked a more cotton feel to it BUT on the upside, it will be easy to dry.  The buttons will need reinforcements but that isn't much of an issue to me.  I ordered a size medium and it fit comfortably ( I'm 5ft 3in, 125 lbs). I would recommend washing in cold water and hanging it up to dry, iron on low or steam it to get any wrinkles out."
4.0,Beautiful dirndl great quality but runs large go a size down!
4.0,I ordered this for my son and he likes it very much.  he loves th o wear it. the material is also good  and it fits as expected.  Nice purchase.
4.0,"Cute for family photos! My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt hide my flaws underneath as well as I had hoped, but it was still a super cute fit."
4.0,I like the dog head and the functionality.
4.0,Cute for the price. Chipped off in the shower.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it.  She gets a lot of comments on it (positive, heh heh) when we are out.  The puppy paw prints on it are the things most folks comment on.  Overall a nice hoodie at a nice price."
4.0,Great dress. Lots of compliments. Neckline drops more than I'd like but we just stitched it shut.
4.0,The pendent is brightly colored. It is about 1 1/2‚Äù tall and heavy. The 16‚Äù chain is too short for such a large and heavy pendent. If you have a longer chain it will be a nice accessory.
4.0,"Arrived ahead of schedule, Trying it out on a LEO challenge coin, its a little snug but its works for me."
4.0,"Nice and comfortable outfit, wife likes it. Says its really comfy."
4.0,"The band is melded into the case. I expected it to be a little more flexible. With the watch snapped into place it straps to your wrist just fine but there are no hinge points where you would expect them to be and if your wrist isn‚Äôt the right size, it might overhang on your wrist even whilst tight.<br /><br />Besides that, it is of a really good construction, light-weight, and comfortable.<br />I would definitely recommend this if you don‚Äôt have small wrists."
4.0,Good grip socks for Pilates. I'm a shoe size 7 & the socks are a bit big.
4.0,"Pros/reasons for buying<br />1. Needed a choker with a unique style<br />2. Perfect thickness, not too thin or thick<br />3. Stretchy and very comfortable<br />4. Has adjustability<br /><br />The price is decent for the quality. Chokers made out of fabric should go for less than chokers with beadwork in my opinion. Besides this, I LOVE IT!"
4.0,The clasp is very hard to use.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute but the fit is a little big with the way it‚Äôs tied in the back. You really have to tie it tight since it comes loose easily.
4.0,"A word of caution, this was so low cut on me I started to question my own morals (jk). It is very low cut though, so I safety pinned it together a little higher, otherwise my bra would have been hanging out for the world to see. The waist sizing was great using their size chart, but this was pretty short. I have a disproportionately short torso and it was a little tight in the crotch even on me. It's not a great fabric but you get what you pay for and I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't see through (I got the white one). It does look like the picture and my husband loved how it looked."
4.0,Nice inexpensive watch... looks can be deceiving.
4.0,Really long but beautiful! I wanted to keep it if only I was taller!
4.0,It was a great product. I just ordered the wrong size
4.0,"Perfect addition to my sons creepy Halloween clown costume. Hair is a bit stiff, but for the price I could not complain."
4.0,"It is not exactly a fancy wear, but perfect casual wear and is very comfortable."
4.0,The item was bought as a gift for my son's girlfriend. It appeared to be of good quality and was reasonably priced as well. She loved it so all were happy!
4.0,"Overall nice bag. The edges on the loop for storing the rolled up board aren't finished. The size is well larger than needed for standard size pieces, clock. You'll need to roll the board fairly tightly to make it fit. Would've liked corner D rings for a shoulder strap. The zipper is average quality"
4.0,It was wider where the pins fit in watch than the original band. I had to trim which was difficult and took great effort to get it installed in place.
4.0,"For 16-year-old. nice. Fun, statement jewelry."
4.0,BI FOCALS ARE GOOD BUT LENS EASILY POPS OUT OF FRAME
4.0,"This item sounds great when you spank with it.  I, and she, will not say it doesn't hurt; but it does not hurt as much as you'd think.  Good beginners whip."
4.0,I like the style. It could have more leg space.
4.0,We got 2 of the same pointers but they work well.
4.0,"They ran a bit large, the material was stretchy and nice. Good, comfy pants"
4.0,"These Yoga pants, look good..Although the seam over the top of my rear-end looks weird, and cuts off the look of<br /> my butt, which I have a good looking rear my hubby says lol..<br />I wear a size 10, and this large says its a size 12.<br />That said this fits good, and the waist is high, No Bulges, not tight at waist, comfortable.<br />Pretty easy to get on, I would not buy a larger size for me.<br /><br />There is a Zipper in the back of waist band, and another opening in the waist band..I have No idea what its for!<br />Does anyone know? Unless its to put money in, or ID ?, As there very shallow .<br />Has some type of flat pockets on both legs, or there for a give in these pants! I would not use them for pockets.<br />The calf has a kind of see threw material to keep you cool while exercising , jogging, walking etc.<br /><br />I‚Äôm happy with this exercising  pants."
4.0,"They are only medium in quality and a little rough on the face, but well made, adjustable, and they work fine."
4.0,"buy them, they are totally worth it."
4.0,"I purchased these socks because I felt 10 pairs for 15 bucks was a great deal. I have been wearing &#34;peds&#34; or ones made by Steve Madden for years. I seem to have a sock fairy in my house that steals socks and they disappear so I wanted to buy some socks that didn't cost as much.<br /><br />If you have larger feet, these fit sizes 6-8.5 in women's. I wear a 7 1/2 and certain colors/sets are more tight than others. The good part is they're colorful so I can keep track of them a bit easier. If your feet run on the larger size of this range, you may find another brand that will feel more comfortable for you. There is a little gel pad on the back heel that helps to keep the socks from falling. I love when socks have that feature.<br /><br />Overall, they work for me. They're not my cute (but expensive) pairs, but they suffice and are usually comfortable and keep my shoes from stinking up from bare feet."
4.0,My girl absolutely loved it. Looks great and came with a nice package.
4.0,"I love this dress! I just got it in the mail today. The bust area is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but the rest of the dress was amazing and the chest area wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable just a bit tight. The sleeves fit perfectly. The skirt of the dress is a little sheer because there is only one layer of fabric. I‚Äôd recommend a skip or something of that nature underneath. All in all I would recommend this dress. It looks absolutely stunning on. The rose gold sequins are the perfect accent!"
4.0,Love the suit good fit- one complaint it's not a quick drying material. Good for the money spent.
4.0,"It is very nicely made and the color is beautiful. One thing, the set feels mismatched size-wise, the top is rather Med size and the shorts are true to XS, and actually the waist elastic band is too tight, so I had to replace it."
4.0,"My go-to necklace for work, it adds just enough of my personality to my required wardrobe. Wish there was a silver option for these."
4.0,"its a good hat, just a little small"
4.0,"Its a bit thin but very cute. The material is stretchy, and breathable. Perfect for the summer month. Over all I would definitely recommend this item, it arrived pretty quickly."
4.0,"I love the color and materials.A little awkward at first with how wide it opens, but after awhile you get used to it. I like a lot the two large sections for coins and cash."
4.0,Works well bumped a few times and hasnt fallen off
4.0,The glasses look and fit great. I like mine to be a little large but I find 90% of the sunglasses I buy are too small. These are very dark and its true that traffic lights can be hard to distinguish. I got use to them being dark so it doesn't bother me.
4.0,I received wonderful colors expect for one. Which isn't awful because that color was too small and was a challenge to roll on.  Actually all the sizes kind of varied but they all still rolled on and fit fine.  Totally worth it for the price.
4.0,"I first bought a pair of the EVO WP Boots.  I expected the Air boots to fit the same with the same degree of comfortability.  They don't .  As for air flow, I haven't noticed any.  The are more comfortable than other boots I have bought but can't be worn all day like the WP's."
4.0,"I like this shower curtain, it‚Äôs on the darker side of color in all areas, not a lot of lightness as in the photo. Still a good purchase."
4.0,Look good. Great price! Color more light gray. No tan in the color.
4.0,"While these are pretty, they run small.  The XX-Large is about a 12 if your're looking for baggy PJs."
4.0,"These babies were awesome when I first received them. It is definitely polarized because no glare anywhere, super duper clear! They are really wide so fit bigger heads/faces better, like mine, haha. The shade is a little darker though, so I could not wear them when driving through a garage because you literally cannot see. I loved these until I accidentally dropped on the floor. It wasn't a harsh smack down kind of drop, but, the front of the lenses got scratch pretty badly.  I guess I will have to invest in another pair soon!"
4.0,Wife likes it and so do I.
4.0,smaller than I thought but not too shabby
4.0,Clearly a knock off... the color and lace are totally different than pictured
4.0,The bag is really nice matched my phone case but the middle bag already ripped on me but it was mainly my fault cuz I sort try to fit to many things on it but so far the purse I liked it I like how it also tells you how to take care of from not keeping heavy things on it to how to clean it and maintain it.
4.0,Very small for a 3X
4.0,"It's very cute, but I listened to reviews of people whose measurements sounded like my own and ordered a medium, but its huge on me. Tent like. I'm 5'3&#34; and I weigh 115 and have a 32 c cup bra, and I could never in a million years wear this. I don't even think I can modify it to fit me! Should have ordered a small. It's cute, though."
4.0,"This is not visible over 1 mile.  It's still a good little light, though, and I'm happy with it."
4.0,"Good pants for jogging and tread milling. Makes your body shape looks good. However, the pants sewing lines are faulty sometimes. There are many places that the strings keep loosing out"
4.0,My kids love these. They are great for traveling and are very durable. They are a perfect size for air travel and the included back pack is a nice bonus.
4.0,"This cloth works great but if you are cleaning more than one piece of jewelry at a time and using it for more than just a quick polish it gives off &#34;rouge dust&#34;. For me it irritates my eyes and nose and causes my face, nose, and arms to itch. I sat down and polished about 15 silver coins and after about 5 minutes I was miserable. It also happened a second time so I am sure the cloth was to blame. I would recommend using this cloth in a well ventilated area upwind of the dust.  Maybe even outside if you are using it for an extended period of time."
4.0,Lindo pero corre grande
4.0,pretty earring.
4.0,It seems like a great wallet. I was a little surprised to see the bright gold zipper. It holds my I phone 6 just perfectly.  The added bonus is that it blocks theft of my credit cards.
4.0,"This case is really big, which I needed for a huge pair of sunglasses I have.  It is what you'd expect."
4.0,The quality is great but length for a 10years old doesn't seems like instead it's like a 5years old length
4.0,Simple black watch band for my first generation Apple Watch. Can‚Äôt beat the price for only $2.99. I needed a simple black band for work! It‚Äôs comfortable and jelly like material.
4.0,Love these little socks. They don‚Äôt slip off. The non-skid bottoms keep her from falling.
4.0,This boot is great. It can go with casual or a bit more dressy clothes. Everytime I wear them I receive compliments.
4.0,I love the arch support of these shoes. The only drawback is you will get blisters until you break them in.
4.0,"I love this dress, the fit, the style, the color, I bought the green, has good stretch, beautiful"
4.0,Perfect for Chicago in January! I just wish it was an inch or two more longer!
4.0,"LOVE IT! Fits great, like the material, super cute. Will probably buy several more in different colors this summer."
4.0,"This is a pretty jacket. I wore it these past few days since the temperatures here dropped quite a bit. I found it warm. I ordered the size I did based on the seller's/maker's size chart. it fits with room to put a sweater under it if I needed to. The hood and pockets are lined with a wonderfully soft, plush lining. Why I gave it four stars instead of five: the hood does not detach, nor does the faux fur, but washing instructions tell you to detach the hood before putting the coat in the dryer because the faux fur cannot go in the dryer. I will see what happens when it's time to wash it. The zipper is opposite from the zippers on all my other jackets too, but overall, a nice jacket."
4.0,Material isn't what I expected. Feels kinda cheap. All in all there pretty comfortable.
4.0,"Love these, fit great, a little long, but still doable."
4.0,"Love em! I usually fit into a size 7, sometimes a 7 1/2. These would be the time  7 1/2 would have been a better size, but they still fit and I like them a lot!"
4.0,"Got this for my daughter, she loves it. Fits snug and stays in place. Not a bad price point for the product.Absolutely love the color and the fact that it came with the weights."
4.0,I have quite a few of these type shirts from Urban coco and I love all of them and all I can say is keep coming with the color.
4.0,"These ties came to me in great condition and I thought since I got them so cheap, they'd be cheap fabric. But they are nicely made, normal ties. Nice Silver color and will do great for any occasion!"
4.0,These are really nice.  They are light colored so they don't obscure your vision and come in a case with a cleaning cloth and tiny screwdriver.  I didn't know they were imported and would have to be shipped clear across the world increasing pollution.  If not for that I'd give it a 5.
4.0,Works. But wears off faster that I would like
4.0,Nice for running but still a bit dark in the evenings
4.0,the suit runs small.  i usually wear a 10/12 and ordered a XL and it was too tight.  the suit is super cute though and I am exchanging for the XXL...hoping that one fits.
4.0,I like it and there is nothing I don‚Äôt like.
4.0,Shorts are comfortable to wear. The length is just above the knee for me.
4.0,Too small in sleeves
4.0,"I love these beautiful Earrings. Exactly as described.  Quick shipping, however I didn't like how they were packaged.  They arrived, loose in a little plastic bag.  I would have given 5 stars if they would have been packaged in a little box or something better than just a little bag."
4.0,I love this septum ring . A little big but it‚Äôs wprth the price! The tip is pretty short so if you have a big nose don‚Äôt get it it won‚Äôt fit . Like it tho very cute .
4.0,"it is kind of see-through, but other than that it's perfect."
4.0,"Great sunglasses, but I dropped them once in the grass, and the lens popped out and refused to go back in. Barely had them 2 weeks."
4.0,This is a nice light weight vest perfect for early fall weather. The zipper side pockets are a nice bonus. Although a little pricey at 50.00.
4.0,"These leggings fit me nicely - I am a size 6, 5'3&#34; 135 lb and I ordered a medium. They are comfy and seem to be well made as far as basic yoga leggings go. I did some yoga while wearing these and they served their purpose. However, when I went on a walk wearing them, I found myself pulling them up a lot. I guess that's what I should have expected with the foldover style - not a tight or strong waistband."
4.0,"They fit just as compression shorts should, tight and you can actually feel the compression.  I bought these to use under my running shorts to avoid chafing and I'm absolutely positive that they'll do the job perfectly.  The length is just right above the knee."
4.0,"The chain is cheaper material. It tarnishes fast but not to worry, you can always just take the pendant and put it on another chain as you see fit. I swapped it and haven't had any issues."
4.0,looks good and seems to be made very well only gave it 4 stars because the pins don't work on a 23mm watch they are for 24mm.
4.0,"It was bought as a stacking bracelet for my girlfriend for Christmas, she loved it. It works great being stacked with other bracelets and looks great."
4.0,"Cute and very sexy dress but it's short. I'm 5'4 and 130 lbs and when I bend over, people can definitely see my butt. I wish it's a little longer in the back. I can't order a large because the medium is loose on me already. Still debating if I should keep it."
4.0,"Well supportive for kickboxing (which is hard to find), I normally wear a 36D but as long as you check the size chart and order accordingly you will not be disappointed. Very hard to find a decent sports bra that's supportive and cute and this is both"
4.0,The red depicted in the seller's pictures is quite a bit brighter than the actual red. I adjusted the brightness of the red in the provided picture which shows a more accurate hue of the product. Otherwise great riding pants.
4.0,good for the price paid
4.0,"This is a beautiful &#34;Tree of Life&#34; pendant with an owl, in shades of lavender, purple and amber with a small owl charm. The moon is a small white &#34;stone&#34;. I am unable to tell if these are actual small gemstone beads/gemstones or plastic replicas, but either way it's beautiful, albeit large. The tree itself is twisted wire and may well have been handmade/twisted. The necklace is a leather strap with a well made clasp. The only issue I had with it personally was the fact that the pendant part is so large - much larger than a quarter, maybe 2 or so inches across, which seems larger because the leather strap (necklace) is shorter. Despite that it's still a beautiful piece."
4.0,"Cute dress, for tighter than expecting. I ordered both the medium and the large and returned both. It's very cute but just want what I was looking for."
4.0,Pretty but fits small had to send it back. I would suggest ordering a 2 size 2 bigger
4.0,Quality is OK.
4.0,I'm 5'2&#34; and 145lb. I found the Grey dress (size L) a bit tight around the shoulders and the front pulled open a bit at the buttons (not a look I prefer).<br />The description says the Grey doesn't have the stretch (spandex) but I guess I missed that when i ordered.<br />I sent it back and ordered a yellow one in a XL.<br />I really like the small percent spandex in the cotton fabric.<br />Such a cute and comfy dress overall for a good price.<br />Simple to return and reorder. :)
4.0,"Good for one time use. Product literally fell apart as bag opened. Excellent transaction with seller, just not very good quality."
4.0,Nice looking wallet. It‚Äôs super stiff though. My fianc√© has had it for about a year and he still has a hard time getting his cards out.
4.0,"I bought these and another pair from the same seller. These ones are polarized as well (which I like). I wear them when riding my motorcycle. They seem a bit small on me, I do have a big head. The arms seem to curve a bit before my ear. I heated them with a hair dryer to resolve that (and bent them a tiny bit). I do like the style and do not fault them for my extremely big head.<br />I go these at at a discount offer to try out their products."
4.0,"So comfy,got them to lounge in!! Fits awesome! I like the men sizes,they give you room!"
4.0,"IT'S JUST OK...HAVEN'T WORN YET, BUT TRIED ON."
4.0,"I'm 5'4''/ 115 lbs and I bought S.<br />Overall it's ok, but the neck hole is too small so it starts strangling a bit.<br />Color is nice and material is very soft and comfortable.<br />I will use it but I would not buy again."
4.0,I ordered a 2T for my LO who at the time was in 18m clothes and she was only able to wear this hoodie a handful of times before passing it on as a hand me down to my niece.
4.0,"Really nice top, it did come witha small hole in the armpit but besides that its a good nursing top."
4.0,"Adorable, just runs too small"
4.0,Love the weight of this dress.  Very comfortable and fits well.  Very comfortable summer dress
4.0,Beautiful ring the stones are of great quality!!! The setting is a bit lighter than expected. But overall a beautiful ring!
4.0,"Beautiful quality, shipped as promised, beautiful packaging and even a bonus gift. My only issue is that I didn't see an option to select a a size so it was a little small."
4.0,Thick material and very comfortable but could use more room in the crotch I only wear with baggier shirts or hoodies a it leaves nothing to the imagination.
4.0,"I needed leggings for a costume. The color was perfect and thanks to other reviewers, I got the correct size. You couldn't see through them and they were comfortable. I would buy them in other colors too."
4.0,My son loves the design.
4.0,"Had a friend send me one...didn't realize they came in sizes, ordered one for a friend myself and was dissapointed it wasn't bigger. But none of that is Amazons' fault...got it very quickly."
4.0,"good quality material, but a little pricey.  This was a Christmas present for our grandson who likes all kind of Beyblade stuff."
4.0,"Very nice cuff links. The little chain between the knots is a nice idea and better than the bar.<br />One improvement would make it a 5 instead of a 4. That is, if one of the knots was a little smaller and the other a little larger (same overall weight). I had a pair like these (which I lost and these replaced) , and it was that way, making it easier to put on. As they are now, I need help to put them on."
4.0,These are cute earrings & I look forward to waring them.
4.0,This is my first pair of padded shorts for biking.  They are cushy but I wish I had ordered a size smaller.
4.0,Very nice. The pendant is large.
4.0,Glad you sent extra battery for the one that came with it did not work---- but I love the watch
4.0,I like that I can see in them still they are nice but they are not the same on both sides and they are not good for dark things
4.0,Good price and look nice.  Sand is functional
4.0,LIKED that I was able to find compatible watch bands and in other colors beyond basic black/blue/navy/gray. Better to buy as multi pack than single one. Not fond of (not a Dislike)...these particular brand/type of bands tend to feel loose even when on last notch. Ordered Small.<br />Other than that they were exactly as described and delivery was as stated.
4.0,This item.was a gift and the recipient was very pleased. She told me they are warm.and comfortable.
4.0,Where have these been all my life?
4.0,"I'm 5'2'' 120 lbs. It fits perfectly. The material is thin, so underwear lining will show. It is not thin to where you can see through it. I wear tights underneath during the wintertime, so this dress is fine for me."
4.0,"I'm 5'6'' and I weigh about 117. I ordered the small. It says the waist is 29 inches and it fits quite roomy with my 23 inches waist. But that's exactly what I wanted. I usually wear belts anyways.<br /><br />I've been looking for really bulky/boxy-like high waisted white shorts for my 80s aesthetic fashion. These were the cheapest and similar pair I can find. The fabric is denim but it's very thin and cheap. Not the stablest quality. Take of that what you will.<br /><br />I was very happy with the way it looked on me. Its baggy and doesn't hug too much, which I like. The pockets are nice too, I can actually fit my phone. All in all, an affordable pair of shorts."
4.0,The hair clip was not glued to  the bow but other than that my Daughter loves it.
4.0,"Super comfortable, flattering, and soft. I bought this dress to travel in. It can be casual or dressy with accessories. One issue is the turtle neck is a little too big, so I pin it in the back. When traveling, it's nice to have a dress that isn't form fitting and tight around your middle."
4.0,"I love these glasses for driving on cloudy, rainy, or very overcast days when regular sunglasses would be too dark. They also help cut the glare at night.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the handles snag my hair at the temples. A minor annoyance but I don't think these were designed or tested on anyone with hair below the ears!"
4.0,"I normally wear a L or XL in sports bras. I ordered the XL and sadly it did not fit at all. For size reference I am 5‚Äô2, 174 lbs and a 36-38 D-DD depending on the bra. The bra itself it sooooo cute and nicely made - just order up ladies!"
4.0,Fits perfectly and is nice but NOT comfortable because of bones in the armpit and plastic clasp moves a lot.
4.0,I like that its fitted and I use them for the gym.
4.0,"Nice fit and finish for the price. Was shipped promptly. Tried to order other colors and after 11 days with no shipment in site, cancelled and bought other ones from elsewhere. Decent enough goggles."
4.0,"These dice are amazing, They fit in my car very nicely. But they can also be used for whatever you want. They also weigh the perfect amount making them feel authentic."
4.0,Super cute & keeps baby's head and ears warm. It still fits my baby a little too big but it will last her a long time because it's stretchy.
4.0,Very comfortable I would highly recommend to anyone.
4.0,"Very cute earrings, a stocking stuffer for my daughter. The problem was the cellophane on the top of the earring was so tall, it would have looked ridiculous on her ear. I had to cut it down, which was no problem with scissors. Other than that, they were fine."
4.0,"This dress is really cute! It‚Äôs good for a couple of wears, but i‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt do much good after that. The bottom is see through when bent over, so I suggest wearing some spanx underneath. The fit was good though!"
4.0,"Fun shoes, enjoy while you can."
4.0,"Only had it a few days, but fits like I wanted it too and it feels it will be cozy and warm when the weather gets colder. Iam 5'9"" 145 lbs and I ordered a medium"
4.0,It was a good gift!
4.0,Fits a bit small but pretty
4.0,"Feel soo sexy in this dress and super confident!! Got a ton of compliments!!! Only reason I gave it 4 stars i on me it gaps a little in the armpits, though I don‚Äôt think anyone else noticed"
4.0,Good quality and as advertised.
4.0,"I Was trying to match a pair of shoes with the bag and even thought the color is a bit darker, I was happy.  overall the bag is cute, and big enough to put the essentials(phone, lipstick ,keys)"
4.0,It‚Äôs great other than its really hard to get on and off.
4.0,Nice floppy hat for the beach. It folds well without wrinkling and fits great. It helped keep the sunburn at bay on the beach.
4.0,Nice shape wear. High quality. It does run slightly small. Make sure to order up a size
4.0,"The plastic is very lightweight, I'm not sure how well this would do in heavy weather. However, the high dome should make it less susceptible to wind. Stylish and fun! I also really appreciate the visibility (safer as a pedestrian in the rain), and, since the ends are turned down, I'm less likely to accidentally hurt someone with the edges (never happened, but taller people are always complaining about this...)"
4.0,Just wish the top would have stayed in place. I had to adjust the cleavage area several times while wearing this dress. All in all worth the $12 I paid.
4.0,"I Love this boot. The size is as good as expected. In addition, Its arch support is also perfect. Most importantly, It is very comfortable but fashionable shoes."
4.0,"I thought I was ordering something pink or at least pinkish - the description said ""blush"" . This is rust color. I already have a rust color one. I workout in them, and they are very comfortable, but kind of bummed about the color..."
4.0,"i was looking for a pair of winter boots for my pup‚Äôs first winter but they came a bit big and slip off when she runs. i would recommend you follow the sizing chart as closely as possible, even size down depending on the size of your pups paws."
4.0,Super cute! Love the colors! Just wish it had better stitching. Super fast delivery!
4.0,Wright now mix feeling still trying them out I like them how they are real cool on the hot days on the other hand I can't keep my pants up
4.0,"These fairly opaque tights matched my skin tone pretty well and were fairly comfortable for what they are. I will say, for some strange reason, they were not opaque at all in the top half. You definitely can‚Äôt count on them not being see-through where are you especially don‚Äôt want them to be see-through, so I‚Äôm not sure why they designed it this way. If you‚Äôre planning on using these with something short, don‚Äôt. One little breeze, and people definitely see your underwear."
4.0,Love these simple rain boots. Run a size or 2 small though. Worth the price for sure
4.0,This dress runs a little small. My daughter loves it. I was disappointed with how it arrived.  Very wrinkle in plastic bag. Daughter was happy with it. It is a little tight on her. She said the gym will get it to be looser.
4.0,"Very cute and fits well, Little small/squared. I bought a size up- which I highly recommend! Otherwise cute and I‚Äôm happy with it considering the price."
4.0,Simple and cute earrings. The disc is pretty thin.
4.0,"I originally bought this for a girls night out. Being a nursing mom, I need the ability to place my pump in my bra without the shirt being too tight or exposing myself. I personally didn‚Äôt like the way the shirt sat on me. I have a smaller chest and it didn‚Äôt compliment my body type. I also couldn‚Äôt get the excess fabric to lay properly. I felt it looked odd on me so I returned. I think it would fit better on someone with a larger chest. The fabric isn‚Äôt stretchy, but it did feel true to size. There was also a zipper that helped with getting it on and off with ease."
4.0,Nice looking ring. Purchased it to replace another chakra ring that the stones fell out.
4.0,Love the look and feel of the shoe despite it being slightly tighter on my feet (but I do have wider and fatter feet hehehe)
4.0,"It suited my needs for sure, but I didn't realize it was knit/jersey fabric until I received it. A little bit big on me, I'm a usual size 10-12. Was well made and good quality though. Also a little bit too long but I just cut it and didn't even need to hem it."
4.0,"I love them but they are royal blue instead of the blue they appear to be, but I like them and will find another top than the one I have.  I really like the fit."
4.0,Makes a great gift for any woman with a purse.
4.0,"It was a nice dress but it was way too big. I ordered an XL and I am 36DD, 5'5, 150LBS.  I could have done a medium or large."
4.0,I like the look and feel of the material.
4.0,"The lettering is clear, easy to read, which is good for parades. I think they will work for a variety of heights of adults. Good price, glad to be able to get them for delayed celebration of the centennial of suffrage."
4.0,"Loved the color and fabric was literally amazing.  Also,  neck line was perfect (hard to find) I just found it ran small and wish I got a larger size,  even though I'm usually a medium.  So I can only wear it with a cardigan.  Would buy again in a larger size. The fabric was incredibly soft and comfortable."
4.0,"I'm a huge fan of chokers and I've been searching for the perfect denim choker and these are a hit. They are so adorable, and I feel they can be dressed down with jeans or paired with a pencil skirt worn along with a blazer for that special edgy look. The items were package with care as well. I would recommend."
4.0,This was purchased as a gift. The recipient loved it
4.0,Minimized black skull has a sleek modern look and<br />the black finish makes for a subtle presentation that can be worn anywhere.
4.0,"the best thing about this watch is the weight.  I sometimes forget it's on my wrist.  it's also really durable.  that said, I've never loved the two large numbers and I really hate how hard the date is to read.  but for a knock-around watch, the price is right and I do love the eco-drive movement. never have to think about the thing."
4.0,great product!! it came wayyy earlier than i expected lmao. it's in very nice packaging and is really vibrant in colors and cute!! recommend this. it came with the plastic slot to make it a stand and a circle metal thingy to make it as a key chain
4.0,"very nice purse. Bright color. Large size. Was shipped quickly. I just love mine, it was very roomy inside it."
4.0,"I love how the loops go under your feet and prevent too many points of clamping on clothes. It prevents the snaps from coming undone and hitting you when you're not expecting it. Great design. The snaps that connect to your shirt don't damage the material of your shirt.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I've had these for a while now and I wear them to work 6 days a week. They're holding up pretty good and certainly do the job. I hadn't any previous experience with keepers before but you get used to them fast. My only complaint is that there is a &#34;connector&#34; near the adjustment area that doesn't hold in place very well, but it doesn't do anything negatively to the function and will not likely end up making them wear out fast. Great product... still."
4.0,Love that they have functioning pockets!!<br />Women have keys and stuff we carry at the gym!!!<br />Thank you for the great sweats with pockets.
4.0,Really thin but cute
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter and she loved them.  Would buy them again
4.0,"I use this stuff on my Italian leather sofa. I bought the sofa so it would be easier to clean when my dog slobbers all over it. A good cleaning with this saddle soap keeps the couch looking new, which is no easy feat considering the dog."
4.0,"Just received my necklace and it's a beautiful stone, nice with a good weight to it"
4.0,"Ordered a size 4, but received a size 4.5.  My son threw the box away before he realized.  He'll eventually grow into the shoes so I didn't contact the seller.  Besides, I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning"
4.0,"It's a lovely dress, something a bit wonky round the bust area though...I'm 5'9&#34; and ordered a small so it was ankle length as opposed to floor-length, other than that it's a beautiful dress."
4.0,Love the pants but length is extremely long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and with 4 in heels they are still too long. I will try using hemming tape.
4.0,"For the price and quality, you really can't go wrong with this product. No more moving around my automatic watches manually to wind up my watch. This keeps my automatic watches well powered and going and the box has a nice wood looking finish and gives it an expensive look.<br />My only gripe is that the watch holders on the bottom are pretty small and don't fit my bigger watches."
4.0,I loved this faux fur shawl. It was very soft and the color were so vibrant. The only reason I took away a star was bc I thought it would be a bit longer. But other than that I would purchase in other colors and I would recommend to others. It also arrived on time.
4.0,"They were ok.  Not really any matching pairs to speak of so if you need doubles, order two sets.  They had a metal smell."
4.0,"It was different fabric then I was expecting but still super cute, a tad bit on the short size so Im a medium I maybe should of got a large instead, unless you do not care for your belly showing a little if you raise your arms."
4.0,Nice shorts. My only criticism is that they could be a little bit longer in the larger size. I ordered large and they are quite short.
4.0,"Hi--I am changing this to a better rating.  I originally complained because I waited over 2 months, but perhaps it was during the ""Covid rush.""  The mask, once it arrived, is as promised, a comfortable, breathable polyester, and I have just ordered another one... I am hoping this one arrives in a timely manner!"
4.0,"I really like this tie, because it gives my different knots an interesting look, since it has a different pattern (the black edge) than anything you can find in most stores. The material is slightly thicker than I would have liked, but thats my personal preference and nothing negative about the tie itself. I wear a vest any time I wear a tie, so the skull image on the bottom isnt an issue if I decide to wear this to a formal event.<br /><br />Overall, i really like this tie and will be purchasing others in the future!"
4.0,The material seems a bit thin so you have to be careful with washing it and putting it on and dont put it on forcefully. I would like it to have some stretch to it but once I put it on it felt great to wear and move in
4.0,The shirt started falling apart and ripping. I liked the shirt very much but it started getting holes in it maybe it was stored way tooooo long.
4.0,"I loved the logo but it did run slightly smaller than expected , I still wore it I had to stretch it out I would definitely order a size bigger"
4.0,I ordered for me and risked order true to size which was XL and the top fit snug in the chest but there was no chance on the bottoms. It worked good for my daughter who is a size 6 bottom and likes size L top
4.0,I purchased this for a close friend and I<br />We don‚Äôt wear it but enjoy having it
4.0,"Good shirts, fit well. The red shirt is more ""vibrant"" than it appears to be on a computer screen--much more bright red than blood red. Regardless, very comfortable and well-sized."
4.0,Our son is between a 7-8 for most shoes but these are pretty big on him and slip part way off occasionally. On the bright side they will probably fit through the whole winter and he is very proud of them. They are also one of the few pairs that had quality nonskid bottoms. So that is still a win in my book.
4.0,It's not the best quality but I had no major problems with the product.
4.0,"5'9"" 175lbs I ordered a lg. I always order a size up unfortunately this one only came in lrg. Good stretch in material."
4.0,This product is a good value for the price.
4.0,"These are great, but I've had a few that the balls broke off the end."
4.0,Is perfect for layering underneath with this changing weather. Love the length.  I ordered small abs it fits perfectly.
4.0,"I've bought these in 2 other colors. All have run small, but the material is soft and I have a trick to resize them. I soak them in warm water for a few minutes and then wear them around the house, letting them stretch. I actually really like the end fit. I might try sizing up next time, but the fit is so good when I get them formed to my own feet, like taylor made, it's really not an issue for me. They wind up being my favorite flats, compared to some I have that I paid exorbitant amounts for."
4.0,Not a flowy tank at all and somewhat see through just cause of the material but still love it the colors are bright and it covers well. Wore this in Vegas and received a lot of compliments.
4.0,This top can be worn off-the-shoulder or on the shoulder.  It also comes with built-in bra pads and the seam under the bust is tight enough to stay in place and add a bit more support to your chest.
4.0,"This is an eye popper if you have the bod for it. Its a little see through, but with the right slip its a knock out."
4.0,"Very lightweight, size larger than expected, based on reviews. Will catch on velcro and tarnish quickly. Good value for the price."
4.0,This dress fits a bit small in the arms and chest area. I ordered my normal size and it just fit tight and uncomfortable around the top and arms. It is a cute dress and may fit others better. I would not order it again. The fabric and print are a decent quality for the price. Just not for me.
4.0,"A little snug around the waist, but long enough to make it work. Received a lot of compliments on the design"
4.0,"True. Fit ,I like how light The material was, i will enjoy working out in these"
4.0,Item as described. Used it for my shawl/scarf at my son's wedding when it got cool outside.
4.0,Product fits good. I ordered one size down this time and I like the fit better than the size I measured at.
4.0,"Cool material, great fit and style.  A+  Lost a star for price, a bit much."
4.0,"Works great but I do wish the light was adjustable, the light is aimed straight ahead so if you are with someone they are blinded by it.  Definitely a kids size but luckily I can wear a kids size."
4.0,The chain was small and it was difficult to see the pearl !
4.0,"The pressure is great!  They are a little more difficult to put on because of this.  In Wintertime they are warm but this is not good for warmer times.  I cannot use them in Florida, my legs get way too hot."
4.0,Nicely crafted. I looked at caps twice the price that did not compare in quality.
4.0,"Would of given a 5 star but this just seemed to be on the thin side. I know sometimes that is the style but this one was just a bit odd. The stars were actual thread sewn into the shirt which was a cute touch but I would have preferred the material itself to be a bit thicker. It fit as expected and had a cute stretch to it, just recommend wearing an under shirt with this top."
4.0,Extremely fast shipping. The short is nice but I wish I have ordered a larger size. I usually wear a med/ large and I ordered XL since I like to wear bigger sizes but this is a little tight. I hope that it will stretch a bit more.
4.0,"I bought this for a Cas cosplay to wear to Comic Con, and it was the perfect material- light and airy, however, the wrinkles were super stubborn. I'm 5'7&#34; and the sleeves were just above my wrist even though I bought a size up to try to compensate for that. Overall it worked and will be great for the cooler weather!"
4.0,"Good value, fast delivery"
4.0,Bought these for work were cute blue light was great but did scratch up and cracked
4.0,Beautiful and my daughter loved it for a couple of days. It broke after a little while because she has mean older brothers that stretched it too far. Other than that it was a good necklace while it lasted.
4.0,nice stylish
4.0,I dont like that it's not allergy proof so if allergic to fake metal not good for you it's really cute tho and I like how it spins so good to fidget with
4.0,Seems to run a little small but nice design.
4.0,It's soo cute just like the picture but I got a XL and it is the mesurments of a medium or large. Defiantly cheep material too but the price is so cheep it's worth it. They need a size chart on here. The XL is a size 30 waist if that helps any one.
4.0,"I bought these as gifts last Christmas. My friend just called me to let me know she was using them for the first time. She really liked them.<br />If you have not tried any packing cubes before, give them a try. They really keep your suitcase organized on trips.<br /><br />The only reason for 4 stars is because I do not know how they will last."
4.0,"I bought a double lot (got 20), to save on shipping cost.  I contacted the seller first to make sure they would no duplicates.  As promised, there were 20 different pins and shipping was fast.  Although the pins are cute, they are thinner than the real pins.  My daughter does not trade them so it doesn't matter.  If you are a big pin trading fan, you may be disappointed in the quality.<br />I would buy again since they are cheaper than the ones in Disney and serves our purpose."
4.0,Very nice fit. Beautiful color and style.
4.0,"Love this dress, got a lot of compliments! Docking a star because I wish it had pockets! I am 5'7 (5'8 on a good day) and come in around 175lbs. I bought a large and feel really comfortable in it. Has good coverage in the chest area (36DD) and the length is good for work."
4.0,Was a little worried when I took it out of the pkg as it had a very strong odor but I washed it and it's fine! Fits as expected. Love the color blue!
4.0,"I like this hoodie although I wish you came in different styles. I ended up cutting mine to make a crop hoodie out of it and I like it a lot more now. (I didn‚Äôt hem it and it doesn‚Äôt unravel) i‚Äôm 53 and it was too long to wear as a normal style anyway and it‚Äôs super cute as a crop. The fabric is not what I expected. It is soft and has a little bit of stretch to it but I thought it had a cooling effect and it does not. I had some compression a while back that had a great cooling affect and was looking for a hoodie that offered the same. I‚Äôve looked and looked but maybe they don‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶? I thought that was the type of fabric that Coolibar uses and wasted some money there. Coolibar fabrics are actually quite warm ironically. This one is light and comfortable, definitely blocks the sun which was my main concern. Overall I am happy with it and will probably buy another one"
4.0,"I've purchased these before in other colors and liked them enough to buy them in the red/burgundy color.  My only complaint is the back pockets are not as deep as most jeans to if you have a larger wallet, it tends to protrude a bit which is not totally secure."
4.0,"Such a lovely design and unique style. From about 6inches away it looks legitimate, expensive, cultured and quite stunning. Up close, it's cheap. I like the look and wear often. As with most aspects of fashion and beauty, it's an illusion of sophistication and luxury.<br /><br /> But I worry abt durability. The metal is literally flexible like a bread bag twist tie. I always check on it when I wear it to make sure the stones have not dislodged.<br /><br />The design is my main attraction: delicate, simple, elegant. For me it's not a big deal that it's cheap and flimsy bc nobody can tell unless u let them try it on.<br /><br />Good price so I won't be too bummed if it breaks."
4.0,Shirt is more of a yellow in color. I would definitely size up and thematerial is good.
4.0,Love the color and can dress it up or dress it down!
4.0,"These are better than the average cheap yoga pant but if you want a lifted, firm looking butt I am firmly an &#34;Alki'i Luxurious Cotton Lycra Fold over Yoga Pants&#34; believer. These are more lounging pants than yoga, as they have less elasticity and feel more like a lazy day pant than an activity pant.<br /><br />These fit well and are maybe a smidgeon long. I'm 5'9 (a longer torso than legs) and 150lbs."
4.0,Order 2-3 sized 2 larger
4.0,"Sharp looking watch, good weight.  Looks more expensive then it is.  Great gift idea."
4.0,These are extremely cute!  I just didn't realize they were short I thought they could be unrolled... But that's my fault for not noticing.  But I still love them!
4.0,"Per the heading of this, it really isn't the worst thing I've bought. I got this for my bachelorette party so its most likely a one time wear and i'm okay with that, for the price it works perfectly.<br /><br />I'd size up one, material isn't stretchy at all. I'm 5'2, 118 and wearing a medium.<br /><br />The bottom is see-thru (for the white) but to its defense, its hard to find white clothing that isn't. I bought a skirt slip and it hides everything you want. The top is double layer so it isn't see-thru but I am wearing nipple covers to be safe. since the back ties you can make it as loose or tight as you want. The other thing that bothers me, which can be fixed with a stitch, the longer ""flap"" on the skirt isn't attached to the rest of the skirt so when you're walking it moves. but like i said it is an easy fix and isn't that big of a deal.<br />It came very wrinkled, so we will see how it does with an iron, will update if the material cannot manage the heat. I might buy the green for next summer because I like the style so much."
4.0,"This is a very nice bag, but the zippers on the outside compartments get stuck all the time."
4.0,"This is a very Gold, gold.. i think i can darken it a little. but it is cumphy"
4.0,I love how well it fit everyone in my family. And we all still had room in it.
4.0,"Not quite what she thought she was getting, but it turned out even better than she thought. Lovely."
4.0,"I love the jackets for warmth and water absorption. I just wish the zipper was a little easier to use. When the jacket is wet, I find myself fussing with the zipper for longer than I should. I‚Äôm worried the zipper will get stuck. Also, I think it‚Äôs worth the $65 I paid for this one in link. I‚Äôd like to get a blue one for my son, but $85 seems steep for a growing boy even if I size up."
4.0,My daughter liked it too !
4.0,Shorter than expected but good quality
4.0,"I would have liked this scarf with a more light blue area , as shown  in the photo ."
4.0,I needed a pair of glasses that my bike glasses mirror would fit on the temple.  I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money for glasses I only use on my bike so I opted for these.  I couldn‚Äôt give them 5 stars because I‚Äôm sure there are much nicer glasses but for the money I‚Äôm pleased and I also have the option to change lenses for the conditions.
4.0,Good qualoty for the price  Band is a little thick.
4.0,"I got the size 12-18 month initially for my 1 year old, thinking they might be a little big but he could grow into them. They looked like clown shoes on him. Returned for the 6-12 month and they're still a little big, but not so much that he can't wear them. For reference, he wears a size 2c. Cute, seem well made, although they are crib shoes so they have minimal traction."
4.0,They are gorgeous. Two broke very quickly and easily which is the reason for not giving it 5 stars.
4.0,I received compliments on this top.  It was good to wear to my active job.  But sleeves were long I had to roll them
4.0,My son really liked this . Great price and very cute .
4.0,"Very comfortable, simple, yet stylish."
4.0,"Lovely dress, fits great!!!!"
4.0,"I'm 1.61, 125 lbs. I ordered S, and they are perfect fit for me because I dont like to use too big leggings, the fabric is thin but its soft and confortable."
4.0,"I purchased this for a grandchild that doesn‚Äôt like tight-fitting clothes. She was awestruck when she saw it, but I was chagrined when I saw that it was almost to her ankles, unlike the photo shows. (She is above average height.) She loves the dress but I‚Äôll be hemming several inches off the length."
4.0,"It is super cute and a great size. I can‚Äôt comment on its durability yet but it seems like it will hold up and fit under the seat on a plane, which is what I bought it for."
4.0,Used it for Halloween. It‚Äôs almost like swimsuit material so it‚Äôs kind of heavy and the white was almost see through. The waist line is very stretchy. Worked good for a cheap price.
4.0,The color is so bright and pretty. I got the sapphire blue. The swim suit is nice. The shorts are the boy short type. I ordered 1 size up. It still felt a little snug. I would recommend getting at least one size up.
4.0,"nice quality, beware of sizing.  I am 5'4&#34; 120 lbs usually wear 4-6 misses.  I had to get a XXXL in order for it to fit.  Really like the fur!"
4.0,I love this dress!  Very high quality.  I am 5'7&#34; and weigh 145 and fits perfectly.  I ordered size 8/10 and it just fits.  I also have a small bust.  If you don't want it to be too tight go up a size. I did have a problem with one of the holes on the belt tearing from just unsnapping the belt almost like it was made from cardboard. That would be the only reason I am giving it 4 stars.  The belt is very cute though and luckily it was not the hole that I would normally snap to when wearing so I can still wear it.  Just be careful when taking the belt off.
4.0,Bought this for an Ace Ventura themed pub crawl and it worked perfectly. I'm a average-plus sized adult woman and it fit fine. It's nothing fancy or special but it did the job and I had a blast.
4.0,Love this boot. They only last a year then you have to buy another pair. Perfect fit and style.
4.0,"The color as described. Overall a nice scarf, but minus one star for not being stretchy - to make the scarf fit snug you have to choke yourself."
4.0,"I really love this dress, which I bought in two different colors. However, I wear it with leggings and it clings to them and rides up in the back so I have to be constantly pulling it down. I plan to buy a slip to wear under the dress to see if that helps.  I will update the review if it resolves the problem."
4.0,Velcro wears out quickly. Otherwise quality shoe!
4.0,En la zona de la frente trae una zona m√°s gruesa que ayuda con la sudoraci√≥n
4.0,Shoes are super nice but really smaller than I imagined!
4.0,"Not quite tight enough for me, but otherwise good quality!"
4.0,"Amazing deal! Good watch for 19.99...thin design with basic face features, nice dress watch for cheap, nothing over the top but a steal for the price!"
4.0,Comfy and cute looking but I have issues with the build quality with several loose threads.  Especially on the sleeves and belt that have to be tied or sewn back in which is frustrating.
4.0,"Although this is a typical Casio watch, however the size of the watch and band are small and would better fit smaller wrists, probably kids.  Definitely not for big boned wrists. At less than $20, you shouldn't be surprised."
4.0,Just the right size for my kids. They are much smaller than adult ones but fit my kids 10 and under.
4.0,I like the weight of these and I like that you know when the ball is in the right place. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they are really noisy when you move your head back and forth and leave kind of a ringing sound.
4.0,"Great looking, classic shoe, on my 16 month son.  He has gotten many compliments.  Just a bit time consuming putting it on and off."
4.0,Fun island üå¥ vacation dress for the üí∞.
4.0,"Love it,  the only thing is the top part is feels unsafe"
4.0,Great dress for summer. Comfy and not too short
4.0,I‚Äôve reordered this zip-up Made Of great material Comfy when I tried it on However the zipper would open once zipped up. Hoping it‚Äôs just a flawed zipper & the new one will have a good zipper
4.0,They're a little bigger than I anticipated but they're totally cute. The colors also aren't as bright as I thought they'd be but they're warm and fuzzy and my sister absolutely LOVES them.
4.0,It was larger than I really wanted.  But super cute bag.
4.0,"If you want weights to make your hole BIGGER, try buying a version of these made out of STONE. These are lightweight and great, they don‚Äôt sit oddly in my ear because I can rotate them to where I need them and they stay that way (all day if size is snug, in my case it is), all day long.<br />They don‚Äôt come coated, if you arent experienced with these yet: it helps to have antibacterial essential oils on deck for wooden jewelry. I apply it to these every few weeks, gives them luster and keeps them clean and smelling faaaantastic.<br /><br />Gifted a pair to my sister, she brushed a thin layer of epoxy around the height where she wants hers to sit (open side facing back, not down).<br />We love our wooden hoops!<br />Wood is porous, knowing this, don‚Äôt be a downer and be resourceful or just stay away from wooden jewelry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4.0,"Soft leather, bag sits nicely on neck and shoulders due to wide straps, lots of different size pockets... I only wish the pockets could be zipped opened/closed from either end.<br />Yes, I would recommend this product!"
4.0,"these were everything you'd expect from an affordable wayfarer modeled sunglasses. Although made from plastic, the construction is pretty durable. I found the tint to be even across each eye. The glasses to fit a little snug, but I have a wider head than most. I would say that you'd want to try to keep these from scratchy surfaces as the reflective layer can be easily scratched. I typically wear these when I play evening softball as the sun is going down and the lights come on. Worth the price."
4.0,"I was nervous to buy this tshirt because it looks like a belly shirt! I can assure you it's not. It's a regular print tank. The only complaint I have is that you must follow the size guide! I normally wear a large but when I followed the size guide, it told me I'd be a 3xl. Okkk.. I bought 2 pairs of shirts in that size! Tried them on, fit almost perfect other then under my arms its loose enough you see my bra! Seriously my only disappointment. Still worth what I paid!! I will wear them with a cardigans & look nice for an interview for a job."
4.0,Nice watch. Looks great on either dressed up or casual. The quality is good the strap is thin so it is light weight and very comfortable. The coloring is great and it is easy to read. My son loves this watch. It is also easy to adjust the time. It was shipped quickly and packaging was good. This came in a nice box great for gift giving. I would recomend this to others my son is very happy with this. I recieved this product free/ discounted in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Very cute! Top runs a little big imo but overall nice outfit.
4.0,Super cute -
4.0,Will stretch over time.
4.0,"**Update: bottoms are too tight, don't wear it anymore. One less star because you can't choose different sizes from top to bottoms.**<br />I'm a small top and medium bottoms unfortunately I couldn't pick different sizes but it worked out great. The top is actually comfortable.  Im 5'5"" 138lb"
4.0,cute accent to any outfit
4.0,I got this as a gift for my husband and he loved it!
4.0,This was a Christmas present that came the day after. It went with another gift but it came and it's perfect!
4.0,"I like this better than I expected to, honestly. The fabric is thick enough you wouldn't have to wear anything under it (unusual for white). It is flowy without looking like a muumuu, and is flattering. It's not quite as long as the model in the picture shows, and the sleeves aren't that long either as they hit me right at my elbows, not below. I did order a size up as some other reviews suggested. The best part is how versatile it is, with colored skinnies and flats, or with jeans and Birks this shirt looks great. I would buy more if they had other color options."
4.0,The garter is beautiful but I didn't realize the garter with the lace was so long in length. The garter fits fine but I really don't like the buttons because I'm very skinny and will have to leave a lot extra fabric hanging.
4.0,"I'm a tiny bit disappointed with this as it's not quite as shiny as I was expecting. Other than that, it's very dramatic and looks good on my hands.  I'm pretty sure one needs long fingers for this ring to suit well."
4.0,"Does not fit loose as the model shows. I am 5'2&#34;, 165lbs, 36C.  A large which usually is my size, was really tight in the waist area, shows all the bulges.  Shrinks a little, not much, after washed.  I like the top a lot, cotton, soft, covers the arm pit area well, but would order a size larger due to it's tightness for sure."
4.0,"Nice feel, well made but I somehow thought it would be black and white, it was purple. Sorry it had to go back"
4.0,"I love this hat, I should have bought more. I have braids and the hat is still keeping my head warm. It my go to hat."
4.0,"I really like, but I don't totally love, these earrings. Although they are lightweight for the size, the post seemed to irritate my skin after prolonged wear, which hardly ever happens for me, even with the cheapest of earrings! That being said, they are definitely cute earrings for the price and perfect for a few hours of wear at a special occasion! The colors are gorgeous and I find myself still reaching for these earrings in my jewelry box often!"
4.0,These are exactly what you see here.
4.0,"This little watch did its job:<br /><br />1.) Told me the time in a 24 hour format.<br />2.) Told me the time without me having to check a cell phone.<br />3.) In conjunction with (2), great for quickly knowing the time while taking a test.<br /><br />After a little while the plastic wrist band broke (-1 star), but cloth replacements are cheap."
4.0,"these took a long time to receive, but I did like them when I did get them.  They look nice and show up well on my ear."
4.0,really works ! no glare and no eye aches ! thanks
4.0,"I got these for my boyfriend. I ordered his size, and they are huge! So I recommend sizing down! He still wears them, but I‚Äôll probably get him something else, and donate these."
4.0,"Nice and comfy light weight jacket with hood perfect for fall nights. Ordered an XL fits my medium sized teenage daughter. Vibrant colors my daughter loves it. Washed and dried without shrinking. Sturdy zipper, no loose strings, manufactured very well. Would make a great addition to any wardrobe."
4.0,"I bought these for my son and he loves them. They went great with his power ranger costume. He is 4 years old and they went pretty far up his arm, but it was okay they went under the costume anyways. He still plays with these all the time."
4.0,"I love the color, I love the dress.<br />However its torn!!! I'm in a panic. Father daughter dance is this weekend...."
4.0,The only thing missing is a Velcro fly lol
4.0,"This dress is cute and not too big, just a touch on the side of larger than I expected."
4.0,"Comfy, flattering, and made of a nice thick material. It does have a tendency to ride up, but that might be because my thighs are thicker in proportion to the rest of my body. Aside from that, it's great! Been working out in them and they hold up nicely üòå"
4.0,"I usually wear 4-6 sizes. I ordered small (wish that was an extra small now). the jacket is very well made and i love it even though it looks like i stole my big brothers clothes. I tried shrinking it with hot water and dryer without any success, which should tell you the quality of it. Its a very sturdy material and the design on the back is gorgeous. I did read the reviews that it runs big but didn't expect this big. I don't have wide shoulders so the shoulder embroidery looks goofy dropping down on my shoulders. I wanted one so bad that i still went for it. I really wish the have women size ones."
4.0,"It took a few times to understand how to open and close, but finally got it. Nice!"
4.0,I'm 5'10 and the dress hit me lower mid thigh. Seems to be decent quality.<br />My husband loved it. Hides all the lumpy spots.<br />Came quickly and just as described.
4.0,Was exactly what was pictured
4.0,"Looks good and it‚Äôs comfortable. I took one star away because the color description says violet but the picture image shows more of a rosy color. I was hoping for the rosy color, so I found it misleading. Other than that I like the band."
4.0,"It's a cute ,simple ring that my daughter is going to love."
4.0,"I measured my chest at 39&#34; got a large, still tight but that's ok there like man spanx"
4.0,Pros: Nice design and low profile. Very sturdy. The key ring doesn't deform when putting on larger keys.<br />Cons: Finish could be smoother and edges could be rounded a bit. Nothing that can't be fixed with a bit of work and a scotch brite pad.<br />May have to order another one for my work keys.
4.0,I like how they fix but material is a bit thin for winter use
4.0,Good fit and love the words so much!
4.0,"Very nice, comfortable fit.  The design is just right and tag-less. I was almost shocked at how well they washed and dried -  they kept their shape and are colorfast.  They are  pretty much classic boxers which fit close to you with the stretch."
4.0,"Surprised to get such a good bag.  Well lined with compartments, just not what I was needing for summer."
4.0,"Just received, and so far, so good. Nice big automatic watch. Not oversized. Winds with crown and wrist movement. Pull the crown halfway out to set date, fully out to set time. Top button advances month (top dial) indicator. Bottom button advances day-of-week (left dial) indicator. Bottom dial is seconds, but it doesn't necessarily match the second hand. UPDATE: it was stopping at random times, a tap on the glass would start it again. I ordered another and returned the first one. So far the second one is great. UPDATE: so the second one was great, but the little emblem was peeling off of the face, so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement is good so far."
4.0,feels very odd on my ear. and i wish i had gotten 2 because i do not know what to wear on the other ear.....?&#34;??
4.0,"I like, but they run about one to two sizes small. Purchased a medium and fits like a small on. The stretch is good but it definitely sags down when I walk (mainly in the waistband & crotch area). Cute and comfy but order at least a size bigger than your norm."
4.0,Great value for the quality of material and stylish
4.0,Today I returned two shoes but not employee there said only need one return labels!
4.0,"I recommend these studs for design, looks and style.  They came promptly, and I have used them on several occasions."
4.0,"Fast response, On time delivery, highly recommended. Althought the size is somewhat large a bit, its OK with me, cause my size is in between Medium and Large!"
4.0,"I only just received this watch, but the band feels firm and is keeping the watch in place. The only thing that bothers me is the jewel that is supposed to be at the 12 mark isn't set and is tumbling around the watch face. It's not a big deal as long as the jewel doesn't get stuck under one of the hands somehow and stops the watch from working."
4.0,Super cute! So many different colors.
4.0,"Narrower than I'd hoped, but they're cool."
4.0,I own a couple of pattyboutik shirts and I love most of their clothing as long as they are using quality fabric for the amount they charge for each item. This sweater is very pretty and the quality is great. It is a thicker sweater which is what I like and the cut does well with women with curves. In fact I'd say my posted picture does not do the shirt justice.
4.0,"I purchased the simulated sapphire earrings.  The 6mm size is perfect.  The central stone is another simulated sapphire, not a clear stone as pictured.  The stones and silver give a nice amount of sparkle."
4.0,"I like the style of the shirt! Very Cute :) It's a little on the thin side (not too thin though) and sizes run a bit small. I'm scared to wash it, because it won't fit if it shrinks at all. I am trying to decide if I should exchange it for a bigger size or just order a second one. It's great for the price!! I think I will just buy a second shirt and get the Medium. Btw I am 5'3&#34; approx. 130 lbs. If same you should get the Medium"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ed7d61f010f8777fbaeea9b7323618aa]] I received this tote from the manufacturer at no cost for evaluation, and here are my thoughts.<br /><br />This small size wine red  leather tote has a clean professional appearance that looks good enough to carry for everyday use or to work. It's large enough to fit everything I need on a daily basis without being overly big, and the handles are long enough to fit comfortably over my shoulder. It also comes with a detachable shoulder strap that adjusts long enough to carry it across a shoulder or cross body as well. It has a mild aroma when it first arrives, but that goes away in a day or two.<br /><br />This is definitely made of leather, but it's not thick full grain leather like you would get with an expensive bag like Coach. Of course, this doesn't cost what those purses do either. This tote is made of split leather that's polished to a smooth finish then bonded to a thicker substrate material and given a protective coating to make it soft and pliable while also being scratch and water resistant. It won't last as long as a full grain leather purse would, but it's well made and should last more than long enough to get your money's worth from it at this price point.<br /><br />The leather is soft, and the stitching is straight and tight. The tote has a reinforced bottom (without feet protectors), but it isn't a stiffly structured bag so it is sort of floppy when empty.  It has a zippered top to secure the contents, and the interior is fully lined in a dark brown fabric that won't show ink stains or grime.<br /><br />The inside is basically two large open compartments divided by a zippered center compartment with a zippered compartment on the rear wall and two sleeves for cell phone or other gadget on the other wall. I don't think this small bag could fit a laptop, but I was able to fit a full size iPad along with books and some spiral notebooks inside it and still zip it shut. The opening of the center zippered compartment was a little too small to be able to get a full size iPad in though, but you could fit an iPad mini or 7&quot; Kindle into it without a problem.<br /><br />The tote is well made with neatly done stitching, and zippers that open and close smoothly. The brass-tone hardware is lightweight and feels like plastic however, so while it's most likely adequate for everyday use, I'm not sure it could hold up to supporting a heavily loaded bag. All in all, this is a nice bag for the price, and it delivers the look of high end leather without the high price tag."
4.0,"This is a good quality suit with soft material and colors that are true to picture.  I am 135 lbs and 34B and ordered the medium which fits perfectly.  It is my go-to suit if I'm feeling insecure about my weight or don't want to worry about sucking in my stomach at the beach or wherever all day.  Due to the high-waisted style and the polka dots, it is definitely the most conspicuous swimsuit I have as I tend toward normal bikinis in solid, muted colors and/or very low-key patterns.  This suit is a nice change and something more fun to show off, so I save it for when I'm going to do more lounging around poolside/lakeside/seaside/etc and use other standard bikinis if I'm going to be swimming more."
4.0,"These are good enough to wear and are quite cheap. So if you lose one pair, you have another one on standby. Especially for me because I live in the Sunshine State."
4.0,"I am 5'9"" 170lb and i ordered a Large. Because the dress is stretchy you can probably order a size down. the quality of material was nice, I got the green one and it looked true to picture. i just felt like the shoulder area was a little to large. with it being an off the shoulder look i would like it to stay in place and not slide down more. Also as seen in the picture the sleeves are puffy  and on me it gave a renaissance look. the over all vibe just didn't look good on me.  But again I think it is still a great dress for the right person"
4.0,These are a little bit low cut for me.  Otherwise they are nice looking.  I like mine. I did have trouble buttoning it. I had to do it or it would've been really low cut.
4.0,Love product however middle piece fits loose
4.0,HOW CUTE IT WAS!! LOL!!
4.0,xmas gifts
4.0,Cute for swimming or wearing with a tank. So comfortable.
4.0,"I wanted to love these, and I do, but they did not fit my face. Maybe a darker wood (but not black). They looked too goofy on my narrow face. The lenses are absolutely fabulous- I wish they were available in more styles, I could've worn them all day. The sides were a bit tight as well- returning."
4.0,cute but fits small
4.0,This is my sons favorite jersey!  He wears it to the rink all the time.  Runs big.
4.0,"A little too big in the shoulders. Otherwise, good quality."
4.0,"If you don't have a tall nose bridge, I don't recommend these. They will slide off and you would constantly have to adjust. Otherwise, very cute pair of specs."
4.0,Great protect from the sun. only downfall is the way it was folded when i received it.
4.0,Fits ok but was surprised there isn't a draw string
4.0,No issues with the product. It serves its purpose.
4.0,Just wish I had chosen a colored band.
4.0,walking and yardwork in hot weather
4.0,Great for work when working on the computer for a long period.
4.0,"I really really like these! The fit as expected, yet as expected they get bigger/loser in the water. My toes slip back and out of my smaller foot when I swim sometimes. But they are perfect for walking around in the water and around the lake house!"
4.0,Very happy with this hat. I'm female with a large head and very thick hair. Been wanting a fedora for quite some time and the regular one size fit all women fedoras do not fit. Thought why not try a man's hat as they come in sizes. Ordered an XXL and fit is perfect. Receive so many compliments each time I wear it. Wear casually with jeans or when you want to dress up. Would like to order in another color combo.
4.0,"Just got this dress and it's cute, but def not midi length.  I am 5'5 and it comes down to my ankles.  It's also a veryyyyy lightweight material, so it wouldn't offer a lot of warmth if you're anticipating wearing it in cooler weather.  That said, the print is adorable and I love the silhouette of the dress, but was hoping for something shorter to wear to work."
4.0,"I really like these tops. I read the previous reviews and wasn‚Äôt sure I should get them. I‚Äôm glad I did.  Now, if you are expecting high quality such as Victoria‚Äôs Secret, your not going to find it. It‚Äôs three camis for twenty some dollars. I expected them to be thinner and the lace to be not as high end. Most of the camis I wear run at least twenty a piece. I am very happy with my purchase, the lace is good and the cami is comfortable. They are a bit longer than I expected, but that‚Äôs ok too. I bought an extra large because I am 5‚Äô2 and around 145 with toned muscle but some padding around the middle. I‚Äôm also a 34 D. These are labeled as Jr. and I know as a vertically challenged woman you need to go up to accommodate the god given bust and hips. I was recommended the lg. But experience with jr. clothing I generally go up.<br />I recommend trying them. They go great under slouchy sweaters and as an undershirt. I don‚Äôt wear them as a top on their own. I have always had great service with Amazon even if I‚Äôve had to exchange or refund issues. It‚Äôs twenty some dollars. It‚Äôs worth the risk."
4.0,"I love the design but they were light yellow, not topaz. I purchased them for myself."
4.0,First athletic skirt I own. I usually take a size 0-2 and ordered a small-  it seemed tight at first but it seems to have loosened up.  I love the skirt and use it for golf.  The only drawbacks are no outside pocket and the under shorts ride up<br />I would probably order another if it came in another color
4.0,I received this item at no charge by using a promo code and I was asked to provide honest feedback about it. It's light weight and looks good with both dressy and casual outfits! Love it!
4.0,Summer 19 fave!
4.0,Unfortunately this item was purchased for a family member who passed away .. this was for her funeral. The children wanted a lavender outfit and they could not find one .. this one was just what they were Looking for .. so it served the purpose of what hey needed it for ..looked nice and was the right color . Thank you so
4.0,"Somewhat larger than expected, but pretty."
4.0,Cute for little girls!
4.0,"Really like the shoes, but they do run small."
4.0,"I am taking away one star because the black pairs for some reason are slightly smaller than the others. They still fit, but make my toes hurt by the end of the day. I would still buy more of these socks, and plan to whenever these wear out."
4.0,"I like the quality of the product, i only wish the branding could be more visiable"
4.0,"I like these glasses for the weight and appearance, and for the gradient lenses, which are great for driving on an average sunny day. They are not terribly dark, however, which means you can wear them even in lower light conditions like dusk or dawn, or when there is just a glary thin cloud layer, but if I was doing anything around snow or water or was going to be out in bright sun for an extended period, I would want something darker.<br /><br />The thing that didn't work for me was the long earpieces. They were too long for me, bending down a good half-inch or more behind my ears and thus did not hold them in place, allowing them to slide down on me. My fault for not realizing the 150mm arms would be too long - I guess I'm more in the 140 to 145 range - but they don't work.<br /><br />Beyond that, the price is a bit high, I think. If I was buying these at a Walgreens or Walmart and trying them on, any price tag above about $25 would have had me taking a pass. They just don't feel any better in quality or construction that sunglasses in that lower range - certainly not of the caliber of other sunglasses I've bought in the $40 - $60 price range."
4.0,Surprisingly this dress covers my belly imperfection. Very nice modest dress for work or night out event.
4.0,"Great, super long to cover your bum, adjustable straps."
4.0,"This (and many other) doll trunk is very nice. I purchased this for one of my granddaughters. However, I could not buy one for the other because<br />the basic structure of the trunk is only heavy cardboard, and I'm not sure she's old enough to take care of it."
4.0,It was a gift for my mother and she liked the bag
4.0,The tulle around the midsection is very full and doesn‚Äôt lay flat. Kind of awkward. I pulled a layer off to try to flatten it out some.
4.0,Love 'em; feels great! Worth the money
4.0,Haven‚Äôt turned green so far.
4.0,Thick & little bit bigger for my size 6 but I love it.
4.0,Cute but thin fabric. Poor quality
4.0,"Very cute! Flattering cut~ this material is VERY VERY plasticky feeling to me, and doesn't breathe at all. But it's short and the cut makes it flowy so you can get some air flow. I like it, overall, but it's not my first choice on particularly hot days."
4.0,Looking forward to wearing.  Fits nice and the fabric is high quality.  Very cute.  Thank you.
4.0,"Decent, though not a compression shirt like stated. They run a bit too short for my comfort. However, it's a good deal for a 3 pack if you're looking for some cheap gym tanks. Wouldn't buy again, but I do like them enough to keep them."
4.0,Gift.  Item was as described
4.0,"Great looking watch, cool style. Only thing is every now and then it stops for no reason while wearing it, a quick shake of it fixed it but it can be a nuisance."
4.0,Very pretty and flattering dress but the picture doesn‚Äôt show that the arm on one side of the dress is basically just a big slit. I was looking for something with sleeves.
4.0,"I love these because they actually do their job, but I must say it‚Äôs really painful the first maybe 2 weeks. During that time you have to be removing constantly your eyeglasses because they pressed really hard behind your ears. It‚Äôs like the pain you feel when you use braces, but it goes away with time. The only disadvantage is for people with long hair, when you want to take off your glasses, it grabs some hair to the front of your face lol, but not a big deal."
4.0,"Great fit. I'm 5'2 so it was too long, had to get it cut"
4.0,"These are nice and cool. The fabric is light. I had an abdominal surgery. The front zipper made it easy do my dressing changes and clip my drains on the dress. Be careful when washing. Wash in cold water because the dots fade. Learned the hard way on the orange dress. But I still love wearing them. No, regrets."
4.0,Very cute watch for a great price!
4.0,"Amulet is fine, but the necklace is to hard to fasten easily, and it is too short (doesn't hang low enough as does Dean Winchester's)."
4.0,Loved the dress but I am short and fit was too long for me.  Wish it came in petite so I didn't have to return it.
4.0,"These are really cute, but the ones I ordered have the maps facing the side instead of the front, so people do not recognize the earrings right away."
4.0,"They are really cute and for the price, you can't go wrong, I don't own any non - leather shoes  and this ones are excellent, so similar to the OBTB brand and so much cheaper... pretty satisfied with them, just be aware that the elastic band on the top can be tight for wider/chubby feet."
4.0,"needed elastic laces for hiking shoes, these work fine."
4.0,I'm glad they fit but too high in price but this price was a bit cheap not expensive.
4.0,"I like these and thought I'd put a review up for those not sure (as I was, as there were no reviews).<br /><br />I am a size 11 and these fit fine.  I got them for hiking and indoor climbing, and I'll probably use them as housesocks (which will no doubt wear them out much faster).  The image colors are pretty accurate.<br /><br />They seem well made and are comfortable; though I've only worn and washed two of them.  So time will tell (I'll update if they fall apart).<br /><br />Apparently, they are hand made and from Japan (label).<br /><br />Update: have washed them a few more times, and no more shrinkage (than the initial wash, which was minimal)."
4.0,This was a Christmas  gift.
4.0,the fit of the pullover was just as they stated. I would have given 5 stars but it is thinner than the others I have ordered.
4.0,"I normally wear a l/xl and bought a xx because i know things from Amazon run small. However, this was a bit too small. I do love the style, fabric, etc. though."
4.0,"I‚Äôm really glad that these are on the market because they are something I can afford to buy! Although I don‚Äôt recommend them for sleeping in, for wetness protection overnight, they‚Äôre great for during the day with no leaks!"
4.0,My item came apart
4.0,Cute gift that I gave to my sister for graduation. It appeared to be made of a decent metal (alloy?) and looks like it will stand up to being subjected to the desolate and dangerous obstacles inside of a woman's purse without sustaining scratches or damage.  The inside is also pretty spacious too.
4.0,I bought it as a gift for my mother. She lives in assisted living . It's on the east coast so I wanted something she could wear comfortably. It had to be warm and attractive. My Mom is a fashionable lady. She loves it! I would buy again only in a different color.
4.0,Thin material but perfect for a night walk on the beach. Taking to Barbados.
4.0,Fits and looks good. The Kryptek Camo is a good touch
4.0,"I was looking for a pair of women's pants with deep pockets that would hold (and hide) an Apple iPhone and these pants do the job. They could be worn as ""work"" pants but a shirt would need to be long enough to cover up the small logo so the pants don't appear to be too casual. They're not super flattering but not unflattering. But most importantly, they have deep pockets!!"
4.0,"This camisole / corset top runs pretty true to size and is a bit snug. Material is on the thin size, but not see-thru and quite soft. There's no built in structure, just the material so it seems more like a top to wear under another blouse or could be sexy under a suit jacket. Very simple design. I like it, but would have given it a 5 if it had some boning or structure."
4.0,"I have this purse in a light gray color. I ordered the Charcoal but it was very dark (looked almost black) so I returned it. The color wasn't what I was expecting but the design of the purse continues to be perfect for travel. Its big enough to hold a larger camera, your wallet and many other items. I also like the water bottle holder that is built into the design."
4.0,"Really well made, very very comfortable and fits really nice.  The logo is so cool but you really can't see it, I have to point it out to people if I want them to notice. I sort of knew that when I was buying it tho.  My orange beanie with the rebel alliance logo on the other hand, I often have strangers complimenting it."
4.0,Little large. Grips are only on 2/3 foot bottom surface area.
4.0,"The package said 2XL, but the pants said 3XL. They are a bit big but comfy regardless."
4.0,Great socks when without shoes on hardwood floors. They definitely prevent slipping. The only downside is that  they make putting on athletic shoes a little tricky since your feet don't slide into the shoes. I recommended them to a friend and she loved them.
4.0,Best gift for coaches and mentors.
4.0,"I got this for my wife along with a few other cute things as an anniversary present. Looks nice out of the box and easy to adjust the band. The first time she wore it the glass cracked so she handed it back to me to return. Unfortunately its past 30 days, and amazon wont take it back. Sad to waste money on a broken watch that we can't use. I would not recommend.<br /><br />Update: The seller contacted me and offered a refund! What a nice thing for them to do! I did not expect that, and I have updated my star rating from 1 to 4. I still took off one star because it is broken, but I very much appreciate the refund, and would consider buying from Valbuy as an Amazon seller in the future."
4.0,"I love to wear things that show off my zodiac sign, so this was a perfect piece to add to my collection. Quality was decent. Looks as pictured."
4.0,"Perfect size for holding a passport while also staying small enough to place in my front pocket. I was still able to place cash and cards in it. However, be aware of how much pressure you place on it as it will still bend some with other items like cards in it. By the time I got home from my vacation my passport was slightly bent to the shape of my leg but not so much that I believe it would hamper the RFID on the passport. Also, this does supposedly block RFID in passports but I did not test that theory."
4.0,I really like these but I also have small wrists so I found I preferred the clip over the wristband. These are great quality and comfortable though!
4.0,Great stocking stuffer . Nice for the price.
4.0,"Cute chokers for the price. They look nice, and more expensive than they are. I've gotten several compliments,  and it let me try the trend without breaking the bank!"
4.0,It was a present for my husband. Two things I didn't like - the instruction for this thing was on a simple sheet of paper with not very nice typing. And the winder itself was not packed at all!
4.0,"Last winter a blizzard woke me up in the middle of the night. My neighbor, Major Alan &#34;Dutch&#34; Schaefer was out shoveling his driveway at two a.m. He speaks with a thick Austrian accent, married a Kennedy and then had a few kids with their South American nanny. His wife eventually left him, now he lives alone across the street from me. Jesse lives across the street from Dutch. These guys are best friends, but never thought much of me. That's okay always up to some weird activity, usually involving water machine guns, stink bombs and vintage army jackets. I never joined their reindeer games. I prefer staying in my bedroom watching vintage movies from the 80s.<br /><br />On this strange night, Jesse came out of his house and looked weirdly up at the sky.<br /><br />&#34;Hey Dutch.&#34;<br />&#34;Vat?&#34; replies Dutch in his strong Germanic accent.<br />&#34;Dude...did you see that? A bright bright object entered the atmosphere. I think it crashed on the other side of that hill!&#34;<br />&#34;Don't be skerrd,&#34; responds Dutch. &#34;I call CIA for helpf.&#34;<br /><br />Jesse jumps in his car chasing the light. Dutch contacted some old army friends now working at the CIA. They found an alien unisex barbarian knit beanie monster with amazing skills: like nunchuck skills, bo hunting skills, computer hacking skills. Chicks love aliens with skills.<br /><br />Dutch jumped in front of the beanie hat screaming, &#34;come on... Come on! Do it! Do it! Come on. Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Come on! Do it now! Kill me!&#34; Before the beanie creature struck, it tripped on a log, bumped it's head and died.<br /><br />While all this was going on, I went back to sleep and didn't think about it until the next morning. Dutch and Jesse came home looking completely bedraggled, like something the cat dragged in.<br /><br />Dutch told Jesse, &#34;You betta listen to me next time when I tell you, if it bleeds ve can kill it!&#34;<br />Jesse, &#34;I know, I know, that was one... *ugly* motherf-er! Who would have thought it was a unisex barbarian green mask.&#34;<br />Dutch, &#34;I tell you, I am za best. Za CIA pushing too many pencils.Ve did zis, we killed it.&#34;<br />Jesse, &#34;All is well that ends well. Now, lets go back to my place, crack a couple beers and watch 'to catch a predator' starring Chris Hanson.&#34;<br />Dutch, &#34;Great eye-dea Jesse.&#34;"
4.0,I love Homeyee This is the 5th dress that I have received from this line. Not my favorite.
4.0,"I bought this in gunmetal. It‚Äôs a great color, nice leather, perfect sized wristlet. Carries money, cards, keys, phone, and a couple of lipsticks. Unfortunately, the gold tone hardware ruins it. I might buy it in every color if it had silver hardware. It looks cheap."
4.0,"It was not an expensive item, but this is also reflected in the quality....<br /><br />Update 05.24.18 - I can say the chain clasp broke soon after purchase, but the company offered to replace or refund the item, which was very nice. Therefore, moving up a star!"
4.0,Unfortunately it runs small and didn't fit so I returned it
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  The sweatshirt is good quality and the print will last a long time.
4.0,Very cute but little big for my 6mo
4.0,Super cute and good quality.  They are a bit heavy
4.0,Great maxi dress. I typically don't like maxis because I don't like the way they look on me. This one is so flattering and looks so good. I have long legs and this is plenty long enough to cover. The white parts seem to be a little see through but there are enough flowers that it distracts from it if you wear light enough items underneath.
4.0,"Just an fyi, I haven't purchased this mask but a Starlord mask, same material, took my kids flat soccer ball pushed it inside and pumped it up to slowly stretch the mask, left it in overnight, it worked for me.  Depending on how much you want to stretch it out you may want to try leaving the ball in for an hour or two, and work your way longer if it needs more work. Personally for the price the quality of these masks are awesome but snug.  Snug is more authentic, less comfortable, give and take.  I can't speak for this mask specifically so the four star rating is based on my other experience minus a star only because I can't speak for the finish, I'm gna buy one soon but maybe I'll update soon.  I give mine five stars all day.  Just trying to help someone out if it's too tight."
4.0,Ordered size 7 for normal 5T child. Fits well with bigger sizing and to allow for a bit of shrinkage. Very soft compared to my assumption that cheap pricing usually = scratchy material. Just order a size (or two) up and you should be pleased.
4.0,Colors are nice. Fabric is very cheap polyester but I didn't expect much more for the price. Covers the mom belly nicely and fits true to size
4.0,"Super cute and they look comfy, however they run rather small. I bought these for my daughter who wears a toddler 11. Thinking since these fit 11-12.5, they should be roomy. But they were super tight on her. Returning for a larger size."
4.0,"Such a cute dress! I loved wearing it. I would give it five stars except for it wrinkles very easily and when I went to iron it,  everything was going great up until near the end and the material melted. I  was at a hotel so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because the iron was crappy or if it‚Äôs just because the dress  material"
4.0,"While I haven't used it as yet, this cushy neck and hood combination will make the long flight a little more tolerable."
4.0,"Always looking for something new to add to my almost-daily salads, I decided to give this vinegar a try. It's definitely more gourmet and different than the typical red-wine vinegars I use. That said, it's a good quality with an interesting taste.<br /><br />This is bottled nicely. It has a plastic cork-like seal, nothing to twist. The glass bottle is short and stout, with very minimalist white text. The amber color of the vinegar shows through nicely. This is appropriate to keep on a counter or on a shelf, it's quite pretty.<br /><br />This is bottled in Italy. The bottle I received expires March 31, 2022, so it has a good shelf life and the batch is fairly recent. The ingredients are simply listed as ""white cooked grape must, white wine vinegar"". It does indicate that it contains sulfites. One tablespoon contains 40 calories. Otherwise, it contains no nutritional value of significance.<br /><br />The taste of this is bright and crisp, almost ""sparkling fruity"". It certainly has a sweetness to it. This is definitely best-suited for a spring or summer salad, and would accompany fruits and nuts perfectly. At this time of year, I reach for it about once a week, adding it to a little olive oil as an alternative dressing for my salad.<br /><br />It's well-packed, tastes great, and definitely feels like a gourmet quality product."
4.0,"Very comfortable, but not warm enough for extreme cold (20¬∞ F or less).  Fit fine."
4.0,I was happy with the quality of the product
4.0,"5'7"" @ 140 dress fits fine hem is about 1"" below knee. it's cute, like the material.  But no belt.  I don't think it needs it, but I like options."
4.0,Really pretty but not as comfortable The the wrap bracelets I‚Äôve had for sure!
4.0,"The fabric is super soft and the pants themselves are super comfy but if I had to re-order I would have to get a smaller size for sure. Another issue is the cinching tie comes out of the pants easily, so after I washed them initially I had to re-thread the cinching tie through the pants and then knot them up so hopefully it will come out again."
4.0,So so. Brown is a little light. Easy to use.
4.0,Very nice cross-body purse.  Interior pockets not as good as other Kate Spade ones I own.  There is one zippered interior and one non-zipper one that is not deep enough to put phones in standing up as the other purse has.
4.0,"Loved the stone and the setting as well as the silver chain. The chain however should have options regarding how long you want it to be. It was just a little long on her, not a big deal but in the future perhaps you could offer several different lengths for the chain. Just a suggestion."
4.0,Nice but quality cheap looking in person but it'll have to do
4.0,"Really like these shorts, went by other reviews and ordered extra large, usually a med or lg, got good, cute, comfy only drawback is that they snag very easily, getting the red and grey now"
4.0,"I can tell the jems will fall out with wear, and the elastic has a high chance of snapping after a few hours but the real reason I only gave it 4 stars is only because the prongs get stuck in my hair. W.T.F.  so annoying."
4.0,"Sizing was a bit too small for me, returned due to sizing and didn't really like the way it looked on me...just due to personal style preference. Otherwise it was well-made and nice material, I just recommend sizing up."
4.0,Sleeves are shorter than they should be.
4.0,"I'm 5'3, 130 lbs, ordered a small. Fit is good, except it's a few inches too long (like most dresses/skirts I've bought). I debated on returning it but it's past the time to return and I did like it otherwise! So I'm going to try to hem it."
4.0,"I ordered this necklace  as a gift for someone,she love red, and it's her kind of style, so this is a perfect gift for her!"
4.0,They are lightweight and comfortable. Had issues with one of the bands in a bundle attaching properly to Fitbit. But seller willing to rectify situation and send out replacement which was really nice.
4.0,"Runs about one size too small. I'm normally a XL, but ordered up because I wanted it very loose. It fit just right, but definitely not like a XXL should fit. The colors are as pictured. Long and flowy."
4.0,Very good material. I bought the medium and large and they fit my 22 and 22 in hard side luggage perfectly. Will hopefully test with airline use soon.
4.0,"The fit is very nice & flattering, just be aware the material is a little heavier like a knit. Not really a summer shirt, more like a fall shirt."
4.0,I like this product but was disappointed that one of the 30 items received was damaged. The clamp/closure over the tassel is made of plastic not metal.
4.0,"Nothing bad to say about this piece of clothing, fits great"
4.0,I use these type of belts golfing.  This belt is Okay.  The sizing available put me with a belt a little to big but it works and I see no complaint.<br /><br />Overall the belt seems to be made well.  Certainly made well for the pricing.
4.0,"I bought these for my grandmother last year and she absolutely loved them. Within a month, the clasp for one of the earrings just snapped off. I want to replace them for her this year with the hope of better quality. If you do order these, I would be cautious and if needed buy a backer for the earrings. Overall they are gorgeous earrings!"
4.0,"We bought this as a gift for my daughter, who loves Once Upon a Time. She seems to like it. It should be noted that the charm that was described as a &#34;book of fairytales&#34; was instead a Holy Bible charm. It wasn't an issue with us (we read the Bible at home), but it could potentially be an issue with a non-Christian buyer."
4.0,Returned the item as it was not as warm as I wanted for the winter monts.
4.0,Es suave
4.0,"I'm usually a medium/large and I'm very used to ordering a size up online because everything runs so small or is too short but this skirt is much larger than expected. I ordered a large and I have to roll it over to wear without tripping myself! So the product runs pretty true to size probably, possibly a little big. But it's super comfy and soft and exactly what I expected based on the photos."
4.0,It really  warm . A little  big but I am fine with that.
4.0,"Cute, waiting for st patricks day to wear it. A cheap, cute way to wear green, and not get pinched."
4.0,I like it!!! Glad it has arrived finally!!!
4.0,Nice length. Did not cause rashes which was my concern. Can be paired nicely with a number of earrings.
4.0,Fit great expect back was too high and rolled for me.
4.0,it's cute and fits well. my 12 year old likes it a lot.
4.0,Got this for my amine loving teen. She thought it was the coolest thing ever.
4.0,Good for extra fun and movement in a colorful way!
4.0,"I don't know what it is about handcrafted jewelry, but I really like them. These earrings are quite nice looking and they are also such a neutral pallet. They will go with many outfits. I like how they have movement and that they are long."
4.0,My son's 4th grade class loved them.  The bands break easy and need to be properly inserted.  All the lights worked.
4.0,Bought it for my wife. She likes it a lot.
4.0,Just as it was pictured.
4.0,"Great looking shades!  Metal frame feels like it will hold it shape within normal use.  Brown lens are gradient, so tops are darker... mid ( eyes level ) medium dark and bottoms are lightly tinted.  The brow area above the nosebridge is solid and block sun and wind well.  Optics are polarized and decent for the price point.  Lens are seated well in the frame and have no gaps, unlike cheaper glasses that will  pop their lenses from merely putting them on or taking them off.  Only personal desire would be that the lenses were a smidge tall and wider,  and/or that they had a small side sun blocker built into the frame to keep out wind and sun bleeding in from the sides."
4.0,I have been very pleased with this band.  I use it on my LG G smartwatch.  It is much better than the silicone band the watch came with.  It classes it up a bit and has a nice feel on my wrist. It is also pretty adjustable so you can get the fit just how you want it.  Even if the release catch can be difficult to open.
4.0,Comfy but runs very big. I would reccommend sizing down at least one size
4.0,Fine for warm weather
4.0,Good fit.  Thin in material but still nice.
4.0,This is a pretty dress that fits great.  I‚Äôm a size 6 and bought a small.  It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwow‚Äù dress but it feels really good on.  A belt or cute jacket would dress it up a bit.
4.0,"it looks like a rust color, not red"
4.0,"Love this suit for my daughter it's appropriate top makes it look appropriate!!! We ordered a small because she is 13 but very slim/fit, bottom fit perfect but I do wish the bum was a bit wider she seems to pull out a wedgie every now and then, top part was a bit loose so I was afraid that it would slip up when she caught a wave or jumped in a pool but she said it didn't, only reason I gave it a 4 is because it wasn't prime so it took a few weeks to get here but besides that it's nice and inexpensive and she gets lots of compliments on it!"
4.0,"Not a bad product for the price, quality is low. Zippers are rough and the verco at the waist could become an issue. All in all they will work for knock around shorts."
4.0,"I've rather wondered for a long while what's so special about these waist trimmer belts. After wearing this one regularly for the last week and a half, I don't know that it's trimming anything, but I can say it definitely works to improve posture and helps work up a bit of extra sweat when exercising. The belt is pretty long though, as others have mentioned, and wraps a time and a half around my waist. Not a huge deal for me, but if you have a small waist, this might wrap around you twice. The excess doesn't bother me though and I feel like it further helps support my back. The height of the belt is perfect and covers a good section of my torso.<br /><br />The velcro tab portion feels a little cheap as it's a large vinyl-like tab and not fabric as I might have expected. (See advertised pic that shows just two belts in a photo as the others look to be photoshops. Notice the shiny tab on the bottom belt - it looks more like that in person.) It seems to be stitched pretty well, so I think it'll hold up after repeated uses.<br /><br />Despite the overlapping sections of the belt, it still lays close against my torso and is not visable under most clothing that I've worn with it. Overall, I can say that if you are looking for an ab belt to help you improve posture and work up a little extra sweat, this is a great item to add to your shopping cart!<br /><br />Note that this product was received at a discount in return for an honest review."
4.0,"I already have three pairs of these shoes that I have worn out.  They are comfy with wool socks in the winter, and look good with any kind of pants."
4.0,Fits true to size. The fabric is a little thinner than expected but not see through.
4.0,"Pretty, but very small. I‚Äôm a 36DD, can usually wear any size of shirt. Lucky that this one worked out! But it does ride up quite a bit, so proceed w caution if you got tig ol bitties"
4.0,very necessary but very hard to put on.need to order more.
4.0,"Thin material, but cute."
4.0,This was my wedding dress. We had to make a few alterations. But it was gorgeous and I don‚Äôt regret purchasing it. The only reason it was 5* is because it didn‚Äôt fit as expected. The middle band as no give to it and is smaller than the rest of the dress.
4.0,watch for length of these. Some are more kid sized length wise. Hard to find pairs that don't leave your skin visible when you are seated and pants leg rides up. Really fun to wear though!
4.0,beautiful but bigger than expected
4.0,Thinner than I thought. Also no picture continuing on back.
4.0,lovely color
4.0,These light up really well. They are a bit cheap so some of them fall apart after a while. But they worked great for a one time glow in the dark party.
4.0,It is a nice flannel nightgown. I ordered 2 sizes larger and in one drying it shrank to fit me. I have not dried it again.
4.0,"These are so fluffy, soft and comfy!<br />Downside is they are so fluffy you look 10 pounds heavier. I'm 5'3"" and they are long on me. The cuff helps some."
4.0,Nice so far. The quality seems fine to me. The print is a little hard to read in low lighting
4.0,"I bought this costume for my wife. She looked AMAZING in it. However, the shirt was EXTREMELY thin. You kind of expect that with Halloween costumes, but I mean it was so thin you could clearly see her skin and bra underneath. It made her uncomfortable. All in all, very sexy - but wear an undershirt!"
4.0,"It's a nice bag, bought as a gift however the recipient hasn't received it as yet. Hope they will like it."
4.0,"The price of the disposable underwear/ package  is very inexpensive, 30 in each package! Compared to the other brand, I've purchased from another company which only contains 5 ( cost about $2.00 ea.)<br />Of course the other brands' material is 100% pure thin cotton, made in the USA and this brand is made from 100% polypropylene made in China The polypropylene fits well, feels good on the skin, Looking forward to using them on my next vacation."
4.0,The boots arrived on time the fit was good and our little girl loved the style!
4.0,"Great product, turned my favorite shoes into slip-ons and looks great! Will be ordering more for my kids!"
4.0,I like it. I got this for my septum and it fit just snug. Now I know to go a bigger size if I want it to hang a little. That probably has to do with the location of my piercing. My piercing is up high so it's different for everyone.
4.0,These are pretty heavy duty but are also comfortable.  The fit is tight enough for support  For my short legs they are really too long... but that seems to be true of all compression sleeves I've tried.
4.0,"Read the description carefully!  The short is described as 43&#34; long.  I expected a full-length gown, but it is 43&#34; long, so it hits me mid-calf.  I am short (4'10&#34;), so I will keep the gown.  The flannel is what I wanted."
4.0,"First of all, I LOVE Vivobarefoot for my whole family And have multiple pairs for each of us. My almost three year old is about to outgrow his size 7 shoes and I wanted to get him some vivos for every day. I bought the 8s and should have gotten 9s. They were difficult to put on, and my son hates wearing shoes, so that‚Äôs a no-go, and he barely had any room between his toes and the edge. I decided to return them. Sadly the larger sizes here sold out. Hoping to try another set some time in the near future depending on what vivo releases."
4.0,I like these socks - they are cute and come in nice colors. I like to match my socks to my scrubs.
4.0,"Super cute, but they are see through"
4.0,Worked great for homecoming!
4.0,It runs small but it's nice
4.0,Cute variety
4.0,You get what you pay for. It‚Äôs somewhat see thru but not a big deal for me since I only use them to be around the house or workout at home.
4.0,Over all I love it fit was good just wish it was a little longer. I'm 5'8 shirt come to the top of my thigh would have liked it to come mid thigh
4.0,Socks were the same socks I ordered from a ‚Äúboutique‚Äù off Etsy...for more than half the price!! I am pleased and will always check amazon prior to ordering elsewhere.
4.0,"Looks absolutely fantastic! Better than the photo. When they said lightweight, I wasn't expecting this. Though I would prefer a kenetic version of this, it still makes a wonderfully unique conversation piece. Delivery was exceptional too. I would, however, like the ability to converse with you throughout the ordering process; accessibility is key in my shipping experience."
4.0,Really comfy and fit as expected! Gave it four stars because the ankle cuff has a tendency to roll.
4.0,"I really like the style color and material.  Great value for the price. However, it is sized very small and the sleeves are too snug.  I would recommend going up 2 sizes from your normal size."
4.0,"Very comfy but they give off a very weird smell, i have washed twice and its still there."
4.0,Well made. Worthy buy. No real complaints. The main black part is made out of a sort of knitted fabric.
4.0,A little sexier than I had anticipated. But it looks like the picture! The reviews were right about the back elastic being a little tight
4.0,It is exactly as the picture shows but you definitely have to put something underneath or you won‚Äôt be able to raise your arms
4.0,Too small around chest and shoulders.  Material not at all stretchy so it has to fit right
4.0,"Got these today and love the fit and the look.  Material seems to be slimming and lightweight, perfect for exercising."
4.0,Bought this watch for my wife.  Like the two tone and bracelet style.  Also the numbersAre easy to read.  She will open it in July so can only give 4 stars.
4.0,It fits a little big. I wish they had half sizes. Very pretty and have gotten compliments on!
4.0,I love this dress and it just got here! It is so cute on. Only downside is my shoulders are wide and it makes the neck collar a bit tight. But I'm short and round and the size ten fits great
4.0,"Nice , would be better with a stronger strap"
4.0,These are cute shorts. I just wish the pockets layed flat.
4.0,Comfortable but do make your feet sweat.
4.0,Nice quality belt and heavy quality buckle
4.0,"Bought this for the girlfriend. She loved it. I liked it a lot too. The chain is a bit cheap, but it's held up so far and hasn't caused her any rash or anything so guess it's all good."
4.0,"Cute, comfortable. Plus he loves it"
4.0,"I love these glasses, they're cool and delicate. Maybe add a hardcase..."
4.0,"Fit was as expected. Got these for my son so as the weather gets warm, he can have something like this to wear to school with shorts. He's not allowed open-toed sandals, but these are acceptable. He likes the color and pattern. Would recommend!"
4.0,"Had issue with product, customer service took care of with out a request from me"
4.0,Liked the price for the quality<br />Don‚Äôt. We‚Äôd to wear often so wanted an inexpensive purse but not a cheap looking one
4.0,"This ring guard is very pretty, and it looks like it should work for a variety of solitaire shapes and sizes.  However, to fit the shank of your solitaire correctly in between the 2 layers, the guard likely needs to be a full size larger, so you can actually wear - and remove! - both.  The little connectors between the halves will shift how the solitaire sits on the finger.  I could barely put the rings on, but it took a lot of slippery soap to remove them later.  This just might be an item better suited to trying out in a brick and mortar store, rather than an internet purchase.  The company Two Birch does offer custom fitting kits, which in hindsight would have helped me determine in advance that my solitaire won't work with this particular ring guard."
4.0,Great price. Fabric is okay but the bust fits very odd on me (I am busty).
4.0,I bought this mask a few years back and the glue for the piece is falling off? What glue did you use so I can get more. An answer would be appreciated
4.0,"It hangs a little different than expected but it's really pretty and for this price, you can't beat that."
4.0,These socks are awesome. I used them for the susan G Komen race that I entered. They run a little smaller than you would think. but still fit ok.
4.0,My only issue is this piece how to get the pearls inside
4.0,"This was a very attractive dress, but didn't fit around my waist."
4.0,Have only had it a couple of months.  So cute.  But material is &#34;pilling&#34; ... best to have one of those snazzy de-pilling contractions.  Those work well.
4.0,"Good quality, fits comfortably."
4.0,The quality is good and the design is cute. It‚Äôs not heavy like some other brands. My son likes it.
4.0,"I really like these and they fit my daughter well, but when she takes them off, the insole comes out every.single.time."
4.0,Material is a little too thin but the look is great!
4.0,"These glasses look amazing! I've wanted them for so long and glad I was finally able to get my hands on them. They feel good - solid and seemingly well constructed. For the price I paid, I hope they are truly authentic which is the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 star rating."
4.0,"This turned out to be a great hat for my pirate costume. The edging was a little crumpled in delivery, but nothing that had good steaming couldn't fix.. I steamed it a little more to help hold the sides up, but the Velcro seem to do a good job."
4.0,"fast and good shipping, but according to the sizing chart these are on the small side"
4.0,I wish there was a setting for no lights and sound.  I'm debating on opening it up and disconnecting the light wire so my photosensitive roommate can use this too.
4.0,The jeans were really cute but just a little small I usually wear a 16/18 and the 2x was just a little too tight I will re order one size bigger.
4.0,"Really cute dress, flowy and comfortable. Fits better than expected. The white one is just a little bit see-through."
4.0,Daughter loves bracelet
4.0,"bought these for my sister & she likes them, said they r comfortable leverbacks"
4.0,This is a lovely bracelet.  The color is bright and the stones are uniform in size.<br /><br />This order was delivered quickly and packaged in a gorgeous red box that would make this a gorgeous gift for any occasion.<br /><br />The only drawback is that it is a bit small.  I have a medium sized wrist and it is quite tight.  I prefer a bracelet that has a bit of slack so that it hangs on my wrist rather than gripping it tightly.  I would definitely recommend this as well as give it as a gift.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this bracelet at a deep discount for my fair and honest review.
4.0,So many compliments. Very cute
4.0,"It's lose very much and can even use it as a gown and slop around the house in it.  It's not sexy on me.  On the model, it shows shorter and more sexy but it is not short and the thin shear gown like feels cool and nice."
4.0,"These work great for quick uses then throwing them away. I haven't tested them for long wear yet but I bought them knowing I wouldn't need that. While the powdered inside is nice for ease of putting on, it does get troublesome when I remove the gloves and touch any dark clothing before rinsing my hands. I have had many a white handprint on my dark pants/shirt."
4.0,Mising thw word STAFF on the back
4.0,"These are comfortable, but I'm afraid that they probably won't hold for the long haul. The soles on them are a little thinner than I would like."
4.0,"I read lots of reviews before deciding to order 2 colors/designs of this dress. I'm 5'4"" and 135 lbs. and ordered a size small. For the rose/navy dress, it fits great! I love the length (hits above the knee) and the fit (it's loose at the waist, but not too big). However, for the same small size but in rose/white, the dress is a few inches shorter which brings the waist line up higher and closer to the bust line...makes for a slightly awkward fit. The description did mention that there could be variations in the size, so I wasn't completely surprised, but just a little disappointed since the navy one fits so much better. I do love how these dresses are super comfy, lightweight, and have pockets so I'll wear them both pretty often this summer."
4.0,Bright color! A little small for my head and it rides up in back unless I have a ponytail. Fabric is soft.
4.0,"great looking, but hard to keep on the ear if you're doing anything active"
4.0,I love the bag. Its kinda small but holds a lot. Beautiful patterns. Great for every day use or vacation trips as long as you dont use it to pack clothing. Not big enough for that. I got it quickly (2days) after ordering. Very satisfied with it.
4.0,"This Mil-Tec thermal boot system consists of a pair of black rubber-and-leather &#34;duck&#34; boots, so called because the waterproof toes resemble duck bills, plus a pair of removable thermal booties made of 3M Thinsulate material.  You wear liner socks on your feet, then put these on -- I usually leave the booties inside the boots and then put my feet inside, but you could put the booties on first and then put on the boots.  The duck boots already run large (for Mil-Tec boots) in order to accommodate the insulated booties, so if you remove the booties you have plenty of room to add thick socks or multiple layers.<br /><br />You get three items in one:  (1)  a pair of black duck boots which are waterproof up to the ankles and water resistant the rest of the way up, (2) a pair of insulated snow boots, when the booties are inserted, and (3) a pair of insulated slippers, when the booties are worn by themselves.  The booties are sized same as the boots, and Mil-Tec sells them separately, so you can replace them as needed, keep spares, or even buy them on their own without the duck boots.<br /><br />I recommend these hybrid rubber-and-leather insulated boots for keeping your feet warm and dry outdoors when it's cold and wet.  Their design prevents frostbite caused when foot moisture freezes to ice, because your sock liners absorb the moisture while the Thinsulate booties keep your feet warm and the duck boots keep them dry.  You can wear the duck boots separately for when you need waterproof boots, and the insulated booties separately for when you need to keep your feet warm.  Just be careful with sizing:  usually I wear size 13 US, but in Mil-Tec I always order size 14 US.  You too may well need to order the next up from your usual size when you buy Mil-Tec.  For that I took off one star.  Peace!"
4.0,Dress is great if you‚Äôre going out on a date.
4.0,just like the pic and true to size
4.0,Just what I was looking for. It holds all my cards plus. Just received them so we will see how they last
4.0,"Made of nice fabric. The outside feels stiff at first and has a strong chemical smell (the black especially), but after a few washes it softens up and the inside also gets fluffier. I machine wash sweats on normal cycles because I think they should be easy to care for and I don't have the space to line dry. This does shrink about 1/2"" in width and 1"" in length. I'm 5' 6"" and 130 lbs. and the large works well on me for a slightly relaxed fit. The neck opening is very wide allowing lots of cold air in so scarves or turtlenecks are still welcome for lower temperatures. The hood could be bigger. I have a small head and this hood barely covers my hair line so it does not shield my face from any snow. Overall a great sweatshirt that is soft and keeps you very warm when inside or outside."
4.0,They are very comfy and not the cheap legging material that you can see through when you bend over. My only complaint is the length of them.
4.0,"I am usually a medium (8-10), but I ordered this bikini in large (12-14) because I've found that a lot of clothing sold on Amazon runs small. However, the large was still too small for me. The size descriptions are not accurate. Unfortunately, I missed the return/exchange window; I would have definitely exchanged it if I could. Aside from the size issue, I liked the bikini very much."
4.0,"Really pretty in person however it moves on my wrist , and flips to the bottom side of my wrist , otherwise it‚Äôs a good product , it is a tad large for someone who is more petite ."
4.0,Have been using it about 2 months and it does the job. Low price and reasonable quality.
4.0,Fits a little snug but warm and the colors are great.
4.0,"This is a nice set of rings for the price. They're well-made and look good, though they're a bit on the tight side in terms of fit."
4.0,"only qualm with it is I wish it were water proof - when I wash my hands, even though the watch is not under the focet, the face will get condensation inside only from a splash of water - now I am scared of ruining it"
4.0,"I wore this to a wedding and received SO MANY compliments. I have never received that many before. Everyone loved it and I loved it! My husband picked it out (not something I normally would like as I‚Äôm a bit conservative) but this dress was so classy and tasteful with just a enough of a hint of sexiness. I am 5‚Äô10 and around 135-140 pounds and the Small was perfect and the length was awesome for me which is usually a problem due to my height! It came just above the knee but not every short. Really loved this dress. There is a side zipper to help get it on and two buttons to do the top. Docked a star because when I went to put it on for the wedding a button popped off and I didn‚Äôt have time to see it back on, but maybe that‚Äôs why they did two buttons in case one broke off lol. I recommend a clam shell style bra like Ariel, because a regular strapless bra for me poked out the side chest area and armpit area because of how the dress is cut. I ordered many dresses for this wedding from amazon and this was the favorite and the price was AWESOME! really beautiful and fit me so well. The material was nice and thick and not cheap feeling at all. Give this one a shot!"
4.0,"Stay up pretty well.  Pattern is embroidered on, so it leaves imprints on my legs when removed.  Very warm."
4.0,I love the butterfly wings however it's missing one of the finger loops that hold it onto your hand. Love the mask. The butterfly headband is very poorly constructed & started falling apart as soon as I tried putting it on.
4.0,Great shoes and I love the design. I would definitely purchase other ones just 1/2 a size smaller.
4.0,I love this dress.  Colors are vibrant and I received so many compliments on it.
4.0,Arrived later than expected but really satisfied with the product.
4.0,"Very nice product,the design is superb,started using it strataway,only thing is the casing doesn‚Äôt wrap fully around the phone,not a defect,just how the design is,wish it could cover that inch or so around the screen,not a big deal though,still very well made and i might just get another design in the very near future"
4.0,"This is everything I was looking for in a sling bag. There's more pockets than you'll know what to do with. It's big enough to store an outfit for overnights or to use on a day to day basis. I use it for my Nintendo switch and it's the perfect size with plenty of room to spare. I fit my switch console, pro controller and gaming headset in the main compartment and the smaller ones hold my accessories and games. Only complaint is the zipper teeth are a plastic that will break with time so you must take care. Other than that it's exactly what I needed."
4.0,"These seem like okay quality, though they‚Äôre thinner than typical tights; more of a sheer black than a solid. They‚Äôre described as being for girls or women, but it would have to be for a very short woman, as they‚Äôre just slightly too small for my 10 year old. They seem like they‚Äôll hold up reasonably well without snagging, and they look nice on."
4.0,"These shoeslocker Womens Ankle Boots are very trendy!  These have an aged brown leather look and the material is soft not uncomfortably stiff. These have stitching around the front and back of the shoe. There is a cut out in the side of the shoe near the V that makes it easy to pull off and on the shoe. These have a chunky low heel , rubble sole and a padded insert in the shoe. These are very comfortable to walk in. These booties are super cute to wear with jeans!  Overall, I recommend these boots! See my pictures for details."
4.0,dress ran small
4.0,"It fits, but it is a bit long and bunches up near the ankles."
4.0,Bands are comfortable and fit well. Will order more colors
4.0,Product is good and durable butmultiple size were sent.
4.0,"Seems fairly strong. I am using it for my glasses by my bedside, so much easier than having to put them in a case.<br />Would recommend."
4.0,Nice lightweight material. Looks great on.
4.0,Great product baught for my son and husband for Xmas they love them
4.0,I love the color. Material not as soft as my other hoodies. But still a nice buy.
4.0,"The wallet is unique,  and very elegant."
4.0,"For my husband...we will  see, they are good value for the money..to fit over glasses.....looked just like photo"
4.0,"Really like the variety of sizes. They are what I expected for the price, and light weight enough to wear all day without hurting."
4.0,"Overall impression is great.<br />Blue burst dial looks awesome. Lighter than my PADI turtle. Color scheme is distinctive but not loud and excessively flashy.<br />Angular case is different compared to the usual roundish designs.<br />Solid and hefty feel. Not too heavy or too big.<br />Bracelet is a pin-and-collar design. Anyone trying to adjust this at home has to keep this in mind.<br /><br />The issues:<br />Notorious Seiko chapter ring misalignment. Very slight in this case<br />Bezel misalignment. Really noticeable.<br />I'm just considering these as quirks that are like a fingerprint of sorts that identifies my watch as mine.<br />(Trying to add a pic of the misalignment, but the app won't let me at this time)"
4.0,This is a great dress and perfect for a spring day!! It fits well and feels light/cool across my skin. I highly recommend it!
4.0,"The &#34;bow&#34; thing is only attached by a spot of glue. Otherwise, this is pretty much as described. Thank you!"
4.0,"While these gloves fit nicely and work on electronics, they do not keep your hands warm like North face usually does."
4.0,"The shirt is beautiful and nice quality, but I took everyone's advice on here and ordered a size up from my usual size,(ordered a medium instead of a small) and it was waayy too big! Other than that, very nice product."
4.0,"This is very good quality.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there were no directions.  Even after finding a video online by another cosplayer, it took us almost an hour to figure out how to get it on!  Directions and/or some sort of discreet labeling of the pieces would have been helpful."
4.0,Get a darker color so it won‚Äôt be see through
4.0,The black background faded when I washed it. Still super cute though
4.0,Not incredibly solid but they feel well made and are very comfortable.  Much flimsier and lighter than my last pair of JP's but at $20 vs $70 I can live with that. I like the style of these better too.  No doubts in recommending them.
4.0,Very nice ring. Quality is very good
4.0,Came withou washing instructions in English.  But it did wash ok in cold water.
4.0,"Nice  color,light weight and fit but length is not as shown on model. It is shorter than expected."
4.0,Nice & thick links/charm. Polish it well with clear before wearing. I ordered one for me & one of my daughters. Will order two more for other daughters.
4.0,"It's a little longer than I expected, but it's a perfectly good blazer vest. The color is just as vibrant and as royal blue as it is seen on the photo, and the quality is very good too."
4.0,"When I fist got it, it smelled bad. But a day or two out of the package and the smell gets better. My dogs have enjoyed it. It seems very durable and keeps them entertained as treats don't easily come out of it (depending on size of treat). I haven't noticed any concerning damage or wear and the dogs have chewed on it quite a bit. I would like to see a few more holes for the dogs to access treats from, thus 4 stars."
4.0,A little bulky but it works. Convenient for carrying glasses and contacts in one case
4.0,"This belt looks just like the picture, I so far can say that I really like  it for the price you can't beat it."
4.0,"I just had the right size click belt for my dad for Father‚Äôs Day. Hopefully, it will suit him well"
4.0,"This book is full of excellent technical information, however, it is a bit difficult to read as it has been translated from another language and the sentence structure is often awkward.  It is still the most detailed kart chassis setup guide I have found.  If you are serious about karting, this book should be in your tool box!"
4.0,Prompt delivery. Like it.
4.0,Cute for a costume dress up day at work. It fits well and is quite stretchy. I wore leggings underneath this. I imagine it would be very itchy sans leggings.
4.0,wife likes them but the fit is somewhat small
4.0,"I had seen girls wearing this type of dress before and thought it was an interesting style, but they were always long sleeve (which I hate!). When I saw this sleeveless version, I decided to try it. I love that the liner inside is not very stretchy, because sometimes in stretchy things my 47"" bust gets out of control. The liner in this dress kept everything nicely in place, and gave me a bit smoother figure than some other dresses.<br />I love the look of this dress! One thing I thought might be interesting, would be to have a contrasting color of liner inside the dress. I would love to have this dress in black, but with a bright Fuschia liner showing through. (Fuschia is my signature color!) I have to say I was disappointed in the color of the dress they call Fuschia, it looks more like dark dark pink to me, where fuschia should be shocking pink! I wonder if the fabric of the liner would take fabric dye differently than the lace would? That could be an interesting effect...<br />Wearing this dress make me feel a bit more elegant, and yet it's still soft and a bit casual too. I got the purple, but I may buy another in a different color in future. It's been comfortable to wear for the couple short times I wore it. I look forward to wearing this more in the future. It pairs well with my basic black pumps, but I may try it with the over-the-knee stiletto boots in my profile pic for an entirely different look! :-D"
4.0,i got them today and i LOVE them they are SO PRETTY ...
4.0,Nice sandals but they do run bigger than a normal size.
4.0,"Needed a ""face mask"" for work and skiing and this is great at keeping your face warm while acting as a face shield so it's perfect for winter use and winter sports. It's breathable as long as its not pressing right up against your face so it needs to be worn a little loosely. My only other gripe is that theres a little too much material as in the product is a little too long could use a trim in future models unless you're buying this for your horse"
4.0,"The material is like a synthetic fleece, thin, but warm. I usually wear smalls, but got nervous about sizing, so I got an XL. I'm about 5'5&#34; and the sleeves are a bit too long, and it isn't as fitted as I'd like, but better too big than too small! I think I'd have been fine with a medium, but this way I could wear a sweatshirt under it if I wanted to."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful cardigan dress
4.0,"I am a size 9 shoe. I got the size large and it fit well on my ankle but ended up covering too much of my shoe so i had to cut and inch off the top toe area and sew it back just to get the right look. Its a nice product, you just might have to alter it a bit."
4.0,"I expected it to be a little longer than it was... and I am fairly petite. I would order a size up if you really want it to drape you and go over the shoulder, otherwise it won't."
4.0,El brazalete es hermoso y se asegura bien me cost√≥ un poco encontrarle el seguro para que no se caiga el √∫nico problema es que me enviaron el que es para serie 4/5 entonces el case no le queda a mi reloj usare solo el brazalete para la pr√≥xima tienen que checar bien lo que env√≠an lo bueno que yo tenia un case que convino con el brazalete ojal√° puedan ver este msj porque no tengo idea donde debo quejarme y tener una respuesta ü§ß por esa √∫nica raz√≥n no le doy cinco estrellas .
4.0,Not as sheer as I‚Äôd hoped but still very pretty. Generous size. Love animal prints
4.0,Love the shoe but just a little tighter than expected
4.0,"I'm a 33&#34; waist and these are just a little bit tight. They may loosen up a bit after some washing. Very comfortable, though but I won't be wearing these in the summer as they're a bit on the warm side due to the amount of skin they cover vs. briefs."
4.0,Cute but sheer.... you‚Äôll have to wear a slip or something underneath
4.0,I really like the design I feel the material is a little too thing but overall I like the shirt ver much
4.0,"The material is really breathable and very comfortable. Wide elastic that doesn't slide about or twist is used in the waist, which makes the pants very nice to wear. I thought the jacket was a little on the large side for being a medium, but overall it is well constructed and comfortable."
4.0,A girl may as well wear a skirt bc the center crotch is down to the knees Maybe not for a plus size girl
4.0,"Nice, clean gem.  Nice size.  My only complaint is that it doesn't lie flat against your chest when you wear it as a necklace, because of the way that it's cut.  But it's perfect for a charm bracelet."
4.0,"I'm 5'2, ~105 pounds, A cup with a longer torso and ordered a medium size after reading other reviews.  This fit perfectly and I'm glad I ordered one size up.  It feels well-made and stylish.  Good value for the price."
4.0,"Very nice and i like the carbon filter. The only thing i didnt like was i receivev 4, not five."
4.0,Really cute but a little on the small side. I bought it for my daughter who is getting married. It came right away and I didn't have any issues.
4.0,I was surprised that such a low priced pants would fit and feel so comfortable.
4.0,The material started to fall apart a little after I had worn them 3 times. But they're still nice and stretchy and fit as expected.
4.0,Very light and fits perfectly
4.0,"very pretty, fits  true to size"
4.0,I loved it but I was to fat but the material was nice and soft I should have ordered a extra large! My fault
4.0,The pockets were akward
4.0,The threading started to rip after just one day of wear. Overall tho I recieved many compliments
4.0,These are a little darker than I thought (I bought the forest green) but they fit well and are comfortable.
4.0,"I am 5'3 - 127lb. I ordered small size.  I like them , they fit perfectly.  The reason I gave them 4 stars because they leave black color all over my legs specialy after workout eventhough I washed them."
4.0,"Cute, runs a bit small, I would size up if you are in between sizes or are thicker around hips/lower abs. Provides the coverage I was looking for."
4.0,"The shoes I got were the pink glitter ones.  They were true to fit, perfect for my Halloween costume and very comfortable.  I gave only 4 stars because they were a little stiff and the glitter caused some snags in my knee high stockings.  Overall, highly recommended."
4.0,Ok so other reviewers were right it does run small and it is a thicker material. But I still liked the brightness of the color and it was comfortable. I wish it had been more stretchy. It had no give. So it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone. I wanted to love it!
4.0,I am still trying to break them in.  They are a bit stiff. Hopefully they will loosen up more.  Nice looking and I hope they will keep the moisture out.
4.0,It's a great color to go with any outfit and if you have the purse you must have the wallet came very fast also but I just adore it
4.0,"This necklace is awesome.  I wanted a pendant that was something other than a cross (which most men's pendants are).  This is a nice quality stainless steel pendant.  The only downside to it was that the part that holds the 2 pieces together and lets it hang from the necklace was not properly closed.  The pendant would fall off.  I was able to fix this by using pliers and forcing the clasp part closed.  It scratched a bit when I did this, but at least now I can wear it.  It is better than some of the other Albanian pendants I have seen.  They just need to make sure that the piece that holds the pendant to the necklace is properly closed so the pendant does not fall off.  That is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.  If that part was properly closed this would easily get a 5 star."
4.0,Beautiful earrings with a nice sparkle. The pictures displayed the earrings curving slightly buy they hang down straight. A bit larger than expected but my hair hangs below my ears so they show up nicely.
4.0,hopefully I can fit them soon
4.0,My only real complaint is that velcro pocket on the strap for your purse does NOT STAY CLOSE. Please do not trust it to stay close. Otherwise it is GORGEOUS and the pocket on both the inside and the outside are just long enough for my two-pack of epi-pens (the whole point of me getting a purse).
4.0,"very nice, but not the best fit"
4.0,"I really likes the watch. It was nice and glossy. great with professional wear and nothing too flashy, but great with casual stuff. I am a woman and I love guy's watches. It also seems to be fairly sturdy. I really recommend it."
4.0,Ordered this for when we travel so i wouldn't have to keep up with 2 different cases.  The only thing I don't like about it is the contact case.  I have found that I am only able to use this case that came with it.  I wish it was where any generic contact case would fit in the slot.  But overall I am happy with the purchase
4.0,"I have been looking for workout pants with pockets so I can keep my phone with me at all times. These were a great price for a three-pack, and the reviews were good. I ordered size Large because some people said they ran small. I would say they run pretty true to size; I probably could have gotten away with size Medium. (I am 5'3"" and around 145-150 lb) The crotch bunches up a little and the waist sometimes travels down, which I think is because I should have gone down a size. Otherwise I am pretty pleased with them; they are a good fabric but don't feel too hot."
4.0,These were very cute but if you have a skinny wrist these are not for you. They were too big. I gave it 4 stars because there was nothing wrong with bracelets I just have skinny wrists.
4.0,"Needed a hat for summer trips and took a chance on this hat. I have sun hats but they're too large to fit in my carryon or purse.  This one is light and folds nicely.  I took it to Chicago and it was perfect - the brim isn't too wide, and the removable cord kept it secure when I was on a boat tour.  A keeper!  I'll get another in a bright color."
4.0,It wasn't fit as expected
4.0,Smaller than expected I guess I'll keep
4.0,I like it been a steamfitter is hard to fine fit jeans I am skinny this Jean do the job but one little problem the packets broke on my second day wearing it no good
4.0,The boots you want to be caught in when snow and Mr. Cold arrive!!!  Just like walking around in nice and comfy warm sleepers.
4.0,"Nice necklace, especially for the price.  The necklace is attached so it has to be worn together.  The length is adjustable to make it more choker style or longer for lower necklines.<br />The color is a little bit more yellow than I personally prefer but I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs 18K gold plated.<br />Overall, it‚Äôs a nice necklace and a very good value!"
4.0,I‚Äôve bought these a few times now for work. For the price they work better than comparable gloves. And the price is better.üëç
4.0,Nice fit.<br />Nice fabric.<br />Fast delivery.<br />A bit on the steep side on the price but still worth it.
4.0,True to size. Very comfortable and flattering to my apple shape. The fabric is just a little bit thin but not too bad.
4.0,it wasnt exactly what i was expecting but it looks good on me
4.0,Great fitting hat. materials a little thin though.
4.0,My son liked the boots but said the padding could be better. They did keep his feet dry.
4.0,"I really wanted to love this jacket but unfortunately it wasn't as flattering on me as I hoped it would be. It appeared to be good quality and did fit me. I am typically a 2x in tops, size 18 pants. I ordered this in two sizes and they both fit (one was too big and the other was just right) it just wasn't flattering enough. I did return both."
4.0,The color is vibrant and the dress looks nice on.
4.0,"I was hoping for better quality material, but it'll be fine for the summer."
4.0,Love this purse! I bought it in 2016 and has held up great to rough every day use.
4.0,The handkerchiefs were for my 100 yr old mother she loved them so much she asked me to buy her 6 more
4.0,Was a little short and will have to be warn with pants or leggings. Other than that it looks really cute.
4.0,"Good shirt, but the Freedonian flag is not quite what was used in Duck Soup. It is supposed to have an Fr instead of just the F. Still a nice shirt."
4.0,Love these! They were a little bigger than I expected and one of the birds was placed on the clip a little crooked but they are adorable!
4.0,I do like this bag. I want other colors.
4.0,True to size. Bright red color.
4.0,"This is my new favorite Industrial bar! However, both ends are removable and the &#34;feathered&#34; end won;t really screw back on straight but it's still secure."
4.0,"Absolutely love them. Only reason I give a 4 instead of 5 is because I wish they had a little more support. I like my workout pants to fit a little more snug. Soft and beautiful colors But! No sweat marks at all. VERY VERY comfortable. But overall, I am not disappointed. Can't beat the price and quality!"
4.0,I get so many complements on these.  They are really well made cuff links.
4.0,nice watch............hands are a little hard to see sometimes.  have to hold it at an angle.  but it keeps time
4.0,"Pants are extremely comfortable! I work in an office and these are my favorite pants. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and normally a sized 16 jeans and these are slightly large in size XL. I do wish these pants had a belt loop so I could wear a belt to have a tighter fit to keep my undershirts tucked in, but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. These pants are shorter and snow my full ankles, but I prefer that look. Again I‚Äôm not very tall, but it‚Äôs something to consider if you‚Äôre 5‚Äô8 and up. Overall, great purchase! I‚Äôll be buying more in the future for work.<br /><br />Update: loved these so much I purchased a second pair. The second pair was very underwhelming. After a few washes, they shrunk a ton and the pants are falling apart. The seam that attaches the waist band it completely falling apart, mind you I treat these exactly as I did my first pair. I have no idea why, but they are much poorer quality than the pair I fell in love with. Very disappointed, as these were my favorite pants for work."
4.0,"Mine didn't quite look like the picture. The antlers are very close together, a paper's length away from touching. And the antlers look a little bit thicker. Overall it is comfortable<br /><br />Measurements taken from clasp to clasp:<br />  The top chain is the shortest measuring at 7 inches (17.8 centimeters)<br />  The chains get longer as they go down creating a cascading effect over your hand the longest being 9 inches (22.8 centimeters) long<br /><br />Measurement of dear head: 1.8 inches (4.7 centimeters) in length. 1.2 inches (3.1 centimeters) at widest part (bottom of antlers)<br /><br />My wrist is just under 6 inches around so the bracelet hangs a little low for my personal taste, but that is nothing that can't be changed with some if you move the clasps down the chains evenly with jewelry pliers<br /><br />I'm curious to see if this will break on me given some of the other reviews, but so far I am pleased. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star review was because the antlers look totally different than in the picture. However it is still cute and wearable."
4.0,Chain much thicker than expected. Good weight. If you think you want a longer length then go for it that‚Äôs the only thing I would change.
4.0,HUGE ring. Very pretty. Too much for me.
4.0,"Exactly what you expect from inexpensive fashion sunglasses! Super cute but not the best for actual sun blocking. They‚Äôre definitely better than nothing though! I bought them for fashion though so they‚Äôre great or my purpose :)<br /><br />This is an unbiased, unpaid review. If you found this helpful, please give it a thumbs up :) Feel free to comment if you think I could improve my reviews in anyway!"
4.0,"Pretty dress, but I'm kind of curvy and this dress has zero stretch to it. Didn't work out on me."
4.0,"Giving 4 stars because they work for the most part, but occasionally I have a few issues.  I really like them though, and you can‚Äôt beat the price."
4.0,Little big for grandson he's 3
4.0,"The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the size/weight, which were a bit more than I'd expected. The purple is a little darker than in the photo, too, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. They hang pretty low, but they're still great earrings!"
4.0,These are comfy and light weight. Exactly what I was looking for. However make sure you go a size up from your normal foot size. I take a size 11 sneaker and ordered a 12. My foot just fit.
4.0,"Overall, this is a nice wallet with plenty of card slots and space for paper money, receipts, etc.  I was able to fit in everything that I needed to, but I found it to be a bit bulky for my tastes.  I do like the RFID blocking feature, it just took up too much space in my handbag."
4.0,"This is a nice shirt but it‚Äôs not going to be for everyone.<br /><br />First, it‚Äôs 100% cotton.  I‚Äôve washed it and it comes out of the dryer okay if you grab it and hand smooth it right away.  (I noticed no color leaking in the wash). Without ironing it‚Äôs good to wear for casual occasions.<br /><br />The stiching/sewing is good.  And the material is a nice medium weight.<br /><br />The cut tough is a little of this and a little of that.  The X-Large that my husband is wearing looks to have the sort of long sleeves that you would expect with a BIG & TALL shirt.<br /><br />And while it doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone, this XL is a tad tight for men with a manly paunch.<br /><br />In general, this is a nice shirt, but it‚Äôs going to fit a thinner tall physique best."
4.0,Looks good on My Wife.
4.0,"UPDATE : I received the small pair which like the medium they are very comfortable. They are not tight like I expected but the waistband is a bit smaller, the medium waistband needs a tug on the drawstrings the small does not.<br /><br />I ordered these because of the reviews so I figured I would write one of my own.  Lots of ladies wrote about how soft and comfortable these joggers are and I couldn't agree more.  I live in Florida so a thick cotton material does not work so well down here... EVER (not for me anyway) so I look for light weight breathable cotten sweats and these are perfect. I wear a size 2 in pants sometimes a 0 depends on the brand but I ordered a medium because I wanted the loose fit look and I think these work well for that. I'm 5'4&#34; so these are a little bit long on me but I'm okay with that. I will be ordering more... next pair I will try the small so if your interested in checking out the different be on the lookout for a review on those üëçüèºüòÉ"
4.0,Its pretty good.  Wish there were bigger pieces size-wise.
4.0,"My daughter loved these when she first got them. I really liked how easy they are to lace into your shoes. All you do is insert an end of each piece into one side of the light box. Then you lace up your shoes with them like any other shoe lace. You can change the mode, way the laces light up, by pushing the button on the light box.<br />They look really cool & I wish they were long enough to wear in my shoes. Which is my only con to these laces. The laces are too short to fit shoes larger than a 4, maybe 5 at best. My daughter doesn't like to lace up her shores all the time. She just likes to slip her shoes on & go, but with these laces she can't do that... Or they would be too loose & fall off while she is playing. Other than that they are pretty cool."
4.0,"Super cute dress! I bought a LG because I know things I've ordered from China almost always run quite small in the chest. I'm a 34 DDD and to my amazement, there is extra room (around the side boob area), nothing a quick dart and single stitch won't fix!"
4.0,a little tight around wrist
4.0,"My son wears a size 6 shoe, and the 5/6 slippers are not large enough.... they‚Äôre more like a 4/5.<br />The slippers are cheaply made (think WalMart quality), but are fairly priced and so cute. Too bad they are so small!"
4.0,I thought I had ordered a larger size.
4.0,"A little tight but I have a large brain crate :) Soft, comfy and cute!"
4.0,"Material is nice and thick, so as to prevent it becoming see-through when you bend over (which is nice for some folks, disappointing for others). Quality seems nice so far, and it's got a decent look to it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Nice, sturdy-feeling material.<br />- Snug, and decent with the belly control.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Runs a little smaller than expected.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />- Pockets. Neat."
4.0,Really cute! Not much else to say.
4.0,"I'm a female with a rather large head, after reading the reviews and description i decided that this hat might work for me. I'll tell ya, i have to keep it on the largest adjustment for it to fit (barely any velcro) but it stays put and doesn't come loose. It doesn't cause me to sweat anymore than normal, it's easy to pack or keep in my back pocket. If it were just a little bigger it would be perfect."
4.0,"nice, great price"
4.0,"Very nice shirt, got lots of compliments. Material is light and small fits well for 5‚Äô3 122lb frame."
4.0,I received the brown tweed cap with flaps for review.  The tweed material is very good quality and the cap looks like something grandpa would have worn - very well made back in the day.  Hubs has a big head and this cap fits it perfectly.  The only thing he's not real fond of is how the flaps are attached to the cap.  He doesn't like the zipper because he says if you decided to fold the flaps under instead of taking them off you can see the zipper pull.  He has another cap with flaps that you just fold under when you don't want the flaps.  I think it looks fine with the zipper pull still on it but he's a little picky about his caps.  When the flaps are taken off 1/2 the zipper is still there but it is so thin that it's really hard to see and I seriously doubt anyone would notice it.  I like this cap a lot and it looks great on his head and it looks exactly as pictured on the product page.
4.0,The bust area was slightly too large but the rest of the dress fit perfectly.
4.0,I had recent surgery in the groin area and the UFM underwear kept everything in place and secure.  This was my third purchase so I tried a brief and it was a little snug.  I like the six inch better.
4.0,As a bracelet it is to small for my wrist
4.0,"Real wool, adds a sense of warmth and comfort to this hat. Ear flaps are functional, can be folded down to cover your ears and neck for warmth, or, folded up if you prefer not to cover the ears/neck region. Color is a brown tweed, it‚Äôs really classic, sophisticated, yet traditional, something anyone can easily wear. Could be an everyday hat or for a special occasion ‚Äì it is versatile!"
4.0,Some of the bands with printed design wore off.  But otherwise a good buy.
4.0,Nice! Wish it have the other piece of earing included too though.
4.0,How this works is one of life's greatest mysteries. (Just kidding.) It works well and comes in a nice zip lock bag to keep it neat and clean when stored. Buy two!
4.0,Shirt is a little tight; it's also very warm
4.0,"The waist band didn't fit right and rolled up, and it didn't hang off of the shoulder too well. The material was scratchy and not too soft, even after washing."
4.0,"Great print!!  Being a winter jogger they should be heavier for colder days & Cozier Ladies!  Thank you, Happy Holidays!!"
4.0,Quick return.. liked the pant but the sizing chart is a little small
4.0,"They're sturdy metal collar stays--they work well enough to keep my collars in check.  That said, I wish that the sizing was a little different--I have no shirts that fit the long stays, and the short ones are really, really short.  The mediums work for most of my shirts, and the short ones work for my spread collar shirts."
4.0,"These fit great! Not too snug, the top doesn‚Äôt roll down and just thick enough to not show my panties when I bend over"
4.0,The print isn't as vibrant in person as it is online but still very.nice and very happy with it
4.0,Cute but not as long as I thought they were. Pretty Purple. Really like them.
4.0,Bride liked it
4.0,"I'm not a jeweled, bedazzled type person so I like the classic simplicity of the leather strap. The adjustable loop fits the larger earpiece of my RayBan sunglasses. My prescription sunglasses are a little loose and I bought the Mudder eyewear straps so I wouldn't worried about losing my glasses while on vacation. Worked so well I have kept them on since returning home."
4.0,I wear 36‚Äù shorts. The large fit as expected. The belt is every bit as poorly made as other reviewers have mentioned and the zippers are as difficult to use as well. This I knew prior to my purchase so I won‚Äôt detract any for those reasons.<br />I will say however that the zippers will set off metal detectors as I found out at my local ER.<br />Comfy and cool and fit pretty well all things considered.
4.0,"Relatively cheap, convenient, strong.  The elastic however breaks easily."
4.0,Well made shirt that you don't see for sale ever where else.I would recommend this shirt to all fans.
4.0,"Doesn't fit, too small and I didn't have time to get a new one so I went to my first day on the job in a shirt that didn't fit. I'm a large/XL in any other shirt and so I ordered an XL to be ""safe."" Um, no. Should've gotten an XXL. Buyer beware. Aside from the sizing issue, I find it to be a high quality shirt and it does indeed stay wrinkle free."
4.0,"Bought this sweatshirt for my son who's 6' about 160 lbs. we purchased an extra large so it could be worn over a tshirt. The fit is long and skinny. The material is more a polyester feel than a cotton feel. We haven't washed it yet, we're worried it might be too tight after washing it but we don't know yet. I would pick a different brand next time because of the fit and feel.<br />UPDATE - 3/15/2017. Since writing my first review we have washed the sweatshirt and am glad to say it didn't shrink much. It still fits my son and he says he likes wearing it. Also we were contacted by the manufacturer who truly seemed interested in our complaints they offered us a full refund or replacement (we didn't take either one) and they said they have changed manufacturing to help rectify the complaints we had with the shirt. Don't know exactly what they did I haven't ordered another shirt. So I am raising my 3 star to a 4 because I'm very impressed on how the company seemed to care about what we had to say and were willing to work with us on a fix. I don't feel I can change it to a 5 star because of our first issues but I would now be willing to try their shirts again with the knowledge that I would order a big larger than normal."
4.0,The only thing that i didnt like is the material that was used for the the tying strips because they look cheap and they make my skin itch. So if your carefull enough you can just cut them and add some buttons insteadüòâ
4.0,"I like it! The material is a bit thin, but the overall cut is nice. It was a little hard to iron on my own but looks good on the hanger. I plan to wear it to work and hopefully it won‚Äôt get crushed during my commute."
4.0,"These are great for a me. I'm a mom who needs sunglasses in smaller sizes. My kids  often want to borrow and possible break/lose my sun glasses. This has happened several times. These are not top of the line sunglasses but at 3 dollars a pair, they're perfect for me and my kids. You actually get 4 pair and 3 cloth pouches that double as lens cleaners."
4.0,"Shoes were super cute, I use them for a diaper cake I was making for someone. I gave it four stars because, as I was velcroing the shoes together one of the purple flowers came off which I had to hot glue back on. At least it happened before I gave it as a gift."
4.0,I like this style of scrub cap because it has a sweat band across the forehead; and has elastic in the back with a drawstring mechanism. I have medium length hair and it fits without hurting my head after 12 hour shifts.
4.0,"I ordered this shirt because it is moisture wicking and looked nicer than most of the other ones I've seen, or own.<br /><br />The materials are decent.  They are on par with just about every other shirt like this.  There is nothing that sets it apart there.<br /><br />It does run a little tighter than I'd like and it's a little shorter than I'd like.  You'll want to buy a size that is a solid one size larger than what you normally would buy.<br /><br />It seems well put together.  I have no concerns about it holding up over the long run.<br /><br />Overall it's a decent value.  I'd consider buying another in a size larger."
4.0,We love this leotard.  It is a little large but my daughter has gotten a ton of compliments on it and it stretches well.
4.0,"great dress. fits perfectly. but I'm removing one star because I didn't expect the dress to bleed green on the first wash. Disappointed. fortunately, the white didn't turn green"
4.0,It fits very well. The reason I didn't give it 5 rating is because it was long for me and I had to get it shortened.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 190lbs, 38DDD and I‚Äôm 16 weeks pregnant and since my midsection is widening and my breasts have grown. I was hoping for a good wrap dress that could expand with my growing belly. I think the size XL would have fit my pre-pregnancy body (180lb, 36D) but I think there still wouldn‚Äôt have been enough coverage for ‚Äúthe ladies‚Äù but for pregnant me it‚Äôs just way too tight, the front wrap isn‚Äôt long enough to grow with my stomach and if my breasts grew any more they wouldn‚Äôt be covered at all. I‚Äôll probably either return this or gift to one of my sisters. The dress is nice though, it‚Äôs not the nicest fabric in the world and is slightly see through if it‚Äôs tight on your boobs, also the color red is darker than the image shows."
4.0,Nice suit but just not for me. Quality seemed very good. The pink and black look good together!
4.0,"i was satisfied, the clips could be a little better but overall they held well and didn‚Äôt look cheap"
4.0,love them but expected a bit better quality
4.0,"This jacket is very well made! I wore it in 20¬∞F weather and felt plenty warm, with just a long sleeve shirt underneath. But it definitely is at least a size too big. I usually wear XXL, but I probably could've gotten an L with this. The only other thing is that the sleeves are a couple inches too short, and this is coming from someone with already short arms. Unless I hold my arms completely still, the sleeves end up riding up to about 1¬Ωin. above my wrists. Kind of annoying, but not a deal breaker for me. It would be worse if I were tall and thus had long arms, though."
4.0,Cute and very soft! Good fit but a little high on top.
4.0,"Good value. I took the earrings to a jeweler to see how a pair I had already bought compared to these. The posts are 18K, was told the pearls are excellent quality & these earrings would retail for about $800."
4.0,I was just looking for a new bag. mine was old and needed to be replaced.  I'm always on Amazon.  I saw this bag and loved it. I didn't order it right away. it thought about it for a few weeks but I couldn't find another that I liked as much. so I ordered it. was not that expensive.  I got it in two days and loved it. may get another for an xmas present for my sister in law
4.0,"Great product and fit, but I could wear it as a dress LOL will have to alter it"
4.0,"Super cute, but not made for babies!!! The titles states this is for &#34;Kids Babies Children Toddler&#34;, that's false. I bought this for my son's first birthday photo shoot, he measures average on the height and weight scale, and these were too big for him even on the smallest setting! The smallest setting however was perfect for my almost 3 year old nephew (who is slightly small for his age).  Overall, they are super cute and looked very nice, and will definitely use next year, but the bowtie and suspenders are just too big for babies!"
4.0,This was a beginners watch for our seven year old. He loves it. Alarms work and helps him keep on track with school work and chores.
4.0,"While I am not a floral person, I loved the design when I saw this outfit, the concept is very nice, the upper body runs small.  It is a sassy number, I wish it came in color bold colors with a more loosely designed upper body."
4.0,"I love the pendant but the necklace was so short I could not clasp it around my neck, had to put it on another necklace. Other than that it's awesome."
4.0,Very comfortable but a little long for my legs. Kept swelling down during a long train trip sitting down a lot
4.0,"I've bought several rosaries from different places. This is a nice rosary, the beads are beautiful. It isn't up to par to the rosaries I got from Nazarene store however. It's much lower quality all around. Only reason I got this one from a different store was  that I needed a yellow one, and it's harder to find. My daughter was pleased, she loved it."
4.0,Fit well and had a nice pocket by the side of the waist and a nice high waist too. XS fit well as I normally buy XS. Reasonably priced . I used it for the bottom half of an Incredibiles Costume.
4.0,I have two granddaughters with birthdays in October and I should have bought two.  The ring is just beautiful
4.0,I feel the material could be softer and they are a bit warm for a summer night. But they fit nice and great to lounge in.
4.0,I would of gave this purse 5 stars but it came cracked‚Ä¶ really upset
4.0,"A bit large in the neck, so we had to sew it tighter."
4.0,I wish it were a little bigger. Very nice for what it is.
4.0,I just wish cut in the neck was a little lower.
4.0,Very good material. Fit as expected. My only complaint is that the cut out areas are a little stiff and itchy but will try washing before wearing and see if that makes a difference
4.0,It worked for what I needed and looked nice. Received lots of compliments.
4.0,"Very comfortable and well made, but medium felt like a large. I was swimming in the medium. I am 5'7"", 160lbs."
4.0,"Cute, Well Made"
4.0,"Color was pretty, band was sewn on wrong so had to seam rip and fix it.  once pressed it was a pretty dress. It was a little on the large side."
4.0,"Beautiful peace, fits perfectly, but a little be heavy."
4.0,"great bag...but a little &#34;big&#34;.  I put smaller organizing bags inside of this one so that I can more easily find stuff....otherwise, eveything goes to the bottom.  The outside is beautiful.  I would purchase again."
4.0,"Good price. Great for a shorty. I got purple - it looked more royal and brighter in the pic. It is darker in real life. Not incredible room in the hips. I got a Large. I am 5' 2&quot; almost and usually about a size 12. about 39 upper hip, 42 lower, and this fits like a glove. Nice, but no room for shrinking in the dryer, let's say."
4.0,Very comfy dress. Good quality.
4.0,"Loved the color, length and quality of this dress, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the awkward look of my chest and sleeves of the dress. It‚Äôs like the sleeves came over the chest area and it didn‚Äôt look right. I wanted to love this dress, but I‚Äôll be returning it."
4.0,"I bought this for my Niece for her 7th birthday and I am not exaggerating when I say that she wears it EVERY DAY! It is the perfect size for her and the stones are shiny and bright. She loves it!<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars, except that the chain it comes with is very flimsy and broke after only a couple weeks of wear. You may want to also purchase a thicker chain, especially if it is a gift for a child, since they can be a bit rough on things."
4.0,I am well pleased so far...I have not had any disappointment. The size of the ring was a little bit small...
4.0,Great product just runs small
4.0,It was a beautiful little chain but very dainty. It was for a 7 year old that is very active. Not heavy enough for her.
4.0,"cut small, but very cute shoe. Order a size up,"
4.0,A little too big but my grand son loves the jacket
4.0,Really great quality‚Ä¶
4.0,Very happy with finish but should come in a larger size for those with bigger hands. Couldn't get over hand to wrist.
4.0,"I am a larger man, but athletic by nature. I wear a 38 waist and this is VERY tight, too tight to be comfortable on a run, which was the intended purpose. My intention is to get back down to a 36 so i will hang on to it because the price point and quality is very nice. Slim design & good materials im very happy with the bag, i just wish the band was longer"
4.0,I enjoy wearing this maxi dress but it's a little to full for the size. I notice after several washings its gotten a wee bit shorter.
4.0,Exactly like the pic
4.0,I bought this robe as a bridal gift and got it monogrammed.  I was worried about the size since it is one size fits all but it was a great fit and it went great with the monogram I chose.
4.0,Very nice.  Living it. Just a little too big. Do you have a little smaller size of the same shape.
4.0,"love the earrings, a little difficult to be on if you have long finger nails, but I have received several compliments"
4.0,I had to exchange the medium for a large. They run small. Material is thinner then I expected but I still like it. I would not use to workout in it..
4.0,finished the outfit just right
4.0,I love the fact it has pockets. Fits great. Color and design are nice.
4.0,These looked more like real feathers online.
4.0,"I needed something to hold my snowmobile key. The tiny keychain I am using, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until I lose it. I am very comfortable wearing a lanyard that is the right length. I am 5‚Äô8 and the clip hits me about 2 inches above my belly button, just above my hoodie pocket. Thats the correct length for me. The clasp is tight which is great. I will only have one key on it for the most part, but I like that they include a couple extra rings in case I add other keys. There is a phone holder?? But I have no clue how to use it. I am not a phone person, hate carrying one, so stuff like that is of no use to me because most of the time I forget my phone when I leave the house. My husband told me the phone holder was for people just like me, whatever.  The print is cute, sort of girly. I got the brown and silver giraffe print. It is a bit stiff initially, but I suspect it will soften with use. Overall, happy with it, would buy it again."
4.0,"Just the right fit, stretchy."
4.0,"These run small, go up a half size for thick socks or insoles. These boots give a boost in height but not much to make my feet slide forward. I wish they had Sherpa inside and out."
4.0,After a few transitions with the lenses they start not to change out so well from the ware and tare.
4.0,"I'm kind of a pear shape and the top fits perfect and the bottoms are a little too tight. I plan on wearing bottoms I already have. Might even buy a bigger 2nd set I really like the style, and quality seems nice."
4.0,"I like this watch. It looks exactly like the picture and works the way it's supposed to. It would be a little big on a kid (3-12 years) wrist. Also if you have photo sensitive epilepsy, this watch is not for you(unless you don't use the light button). The watch flashes colors when you press the light button(top right). It is what I was looking for and it works fine.<br /><br />Update- I've been wearing this watch since I got it a couple months ago. After a few weeks the watch got worn down. The pictures of the swimming people on the buttons on the side quickly disappeared. Soon the gold thing at the top fell off and when I tried to push it back on it went on but quickly fell off again and then got lost. A couple months later, the lights didn't flash anymore and just stayed at a bluish color. when you look at the watch that still has its gold then you can see the date of the watch when I first got it the other picture also tells the date and time. The last picture of the watch is a picture I took today. You can tell how much the watch has been  throughout more than half a year. Also you're probably going to want to take off the watch when you shower and go to bed because it will leave dents in your wrist and might irritate your skin otherwise."
4.0,"I ordered a size large & I am a size small, but I wanted it to be roomy and somewhat long. It fits exactly like I wanted it to. Just know- if you order your true size it will not have a room.<br />I love this sweatshirt and get compliments every time I wear it! It‚Äôs comfy & casual, but doesn‚Äôt look slobby like a regular sweatshirt."
4.0,"Would give 5 stars, but hat is a little large."
4.0,"This arrived very quickly. The material is very soft and it's so comfortable. I ordered the yellow and the color is soft and pretty. More of a butter yellow than a bright yellow. This fit me a bit large in the waist area, but the arms fit perfectly. It doesn't bother me enough to return it.<br /><br />I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"PERFECT!!! A little long on the body but, sleeves and everyging else is perfect. A little tight at the neck also!"
4.0,"The first one I got, despite following sizing, was very snug at the hips, so I returned it for a larger size. That's still more snug on the bottom than I like, while the top portion is now too big. The issue is the dark blue band at the bottom, which has almost no stretch to it. It's fine standing, but gets uncomfortable when sitting. Note that I normally take a size larger in shirts than in pants, as my hips are narrower than the, um, chestal region.<br /><br />That said, the material is decently heavy, so nice for cooler weather. For those who are concerned about these things, it's neither thin nor see-through. The color combination in the picture is accurate. So cute top, but I'm thinking about removing the bottom band and sewing it back on differently; it seems to be the same material as the blue sleeve, which is stretchy, so I think it's something about how the material is used or sewn on that bottom band."
4.0,I like this band better. It stays in place and doesn't unhook. So far it is working out better than the last band I purchased.
4.0,"An excellent, adjustable mask. It's important to know, however, that this is an unsanctioned, unlicensed product. Bill Watterson has never licensed Calvin and Hobbes merch."
4.0,"Mine broke in exactly the same spot as the other reviewer. However, this thing has held up for a long time several 100 times of being dropped. Overall solid quality given the price point definitely recommend."
4.0,"Good watch, good value. I've been looking for something from Edifice series for a while now but nothing quite hit the spot till I came across this one. Very accurate and easy to set. And fact that is solar is a big plus. Wish it had alarm option but it's something I can live without. Only reason for knocking down a star is because original band is very rough. Kinda ""plasticy"". More like something you'd find on a cheap $15 watch. Which makes it bit uncomfortable unless you want to wear it very loose. It is however easily remedied by getting soft silicone band ($15-20 here on Amazon) and swapping it out. Overall, it is a good buy and I do highly recommend it."
4.0,Great for working in the sun.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It‚Äôs very cute. It didn‚Äôt shrink and has held its shape very well after multiple washes. It isn‚Äôt as soft as I had hoped it would be. This is a polyester blend rather then cotton and doesn‚Äôt fit the comfy and cozy category as I had hoped it would.
4.0,I like the fact they came in a case so they won't get scratched in my purse.
4.0,I find these very nice. Soft and fairly sturdy for a silk shirt. The color was as I wanted the size was good (maybe just a little longer. I found nothing to complain about.
4.0,"I am a long-time runner in my early 50's.  As I've gotten older, I've had problems with my calves cramping while running.  Running in 2XU's Performance compression socks have alleviated this problem for the most part.  As a change of pace, I decided to try their Hyoptik style this time with the reflective elements.  These are really high quality socks, but I don't feel as though they're quite as tight as the Performance socks in medium size.  Accordingly, I don't think the Hyoptik socks work quite as well as the Performance model at keeping my calf problems at bay.  The Hyoptik style also is a bit shorter.  I have to folder the top of the Performance sock over, but not the Hyoptik."
4.0,Is beautifull but the poem should be writing in a better material's quality.
4.0,"These are stunning! The stones are well secured and these earrings shine brilliantly. These are probably best for very dressy occasions or for costume balls etc because they are kinda large and at least for me, would be a challenge to wear for more common occasions since they're as large as they are. I wish they were a little smaller, but I am happy with these and excited to wear them!"
4.0,"Cute super lightweight shoes. These shoes look great on and look more expensive than they are. The only reason I took a star away because they are a little snug, but I still find them comfortable...that may be because my feet are narrow. A plus to these shoes is that they are Vegan ‚Äúbeast free‚Äù"
4.0,"These are very cute, well made earrings. They are the perfect size. The only issue I have is that they're a bit heavy which causes them to sort of sag on my ears. But still adorable. I wear them all the time."
4.0,"Washes nicely, doesn‚Äôt shrink.  Bought a size larger than I usually wear to be sure it had plenty of overlap."
4.0,REALLY WISH THE NAMES WERE IN BLACK AS THEY ARE VERY SMALL AND HARD TO READ.
4.0,"Nice Piece. Glad I got it, especially for the price."
4.0,"These are NOT a one size fits all! If you are bigger than an 8<br />The material is comfy, color is pretty. Nice and warm, but very tight.<br />I have Us size 4, for my its ok."
4.0,Nice watch wouldn‚Äôt wear it when working but for casual use it‚Äôs fine I shortened the band no issues and case looks great .
4.0,Good for casual occasions
4.0,"super cute tee. A little small, otherwise, just as pictured."
4.0,Great protection but a bit tight
4.0,"Ilike this item, it looks so cute and does not have a cheap feel."
4.0,I expected this dress to fit at about the knee and I suppose when I ordered this I forgot I'm 5' tall. This hits a few inches past my knees and it's a little baggier than I expected. I will have to get it hemmed but otherwise it's very soft and the color is a very vibrant blue. I would say it's closer to cobalt.
4.0,Size was spot on. Only thing is that the zipper doesn't stay up very well and it's hard to zip up on your own
4.0,"Colors in the photo are accurate, very vibrant looking. It's a bit larger and heavier than expected. Sure to be noticed."
4.0,Comfy but runs big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 and 135lbs. I‚Äôd normally take S-M. I ordered a S and they were still too big. I had to fold over waist. I‚Äôd get XS but S is smallest size. S fits more like a M+. Will keep though. Good lounge or casual sweatpants. Good medium thickness.
4.0,Color is what I wanted
4.0,"Normally I wear a size medium ( 5'5 150) I bought a large after reading the reviews, it fit great. Also, it is a little longer in the back than any other romper I have ever purchased, it covered a little more which I liked."
4.0,"Read the other reviews, it is very big. :) Also, leaving it in the sun does help soften the bag to make it easier to use."
4.0,"it's good i like it , it's the same like my color of my car that's why i like it"
4.0,"Beautiful dress but bigger than expected. I‚Äôm 5.1, weight 140 lb and the medium looks huge on me. I will return it and get a small.  Hopefully that one will fit."
4.0,We ordered the green shirt but a grey one came instead.  My son was disappointed but we needed it that same day so we kept the grey.  The shirt itself it great padding for goalies. We live in Florida so it is still a hot shirt.
4.0,"I loved the material and the style of this dress. Where the fabric switches directions it was difficult to zip. I had many compliments of the dress. Wouldn't recommend wearing a bra, had to wear a sticky bra."
4.0,Too big for my 6 year old.  Actually fits me as an adult.
4.0,Great material however it was a bit small I recommend getting a size or two bigger. I will return for a larger size.
4.0,"Will buy more. Comfortable. Lightweight. I have tried several other similar shirts listed on Amazon and this is my favorite. 5'6&#34;/155/8-10/34D. Usually wear M in women's tops....L if fitted/non stretchy material. Ordered a L and very happy. I think M would've been too small. Looks great with leggings. Covered my backside without looking maternity. Material seems like it will pick easily with an active lifestyle so I'm glad it's not an expensive shirt. If you are looking for a comfortable basic tunic, this is a good one."
4.0,Cute hat. fits well. Happy with this purchase.
4.0,"Shirt fits well, looks good and is comfy. I bought this in volcanic plum without knowing that it is much closer to a brown than plum. My bad but it is still a nice shirt."
4.0,The only negative I can find with the watch is the length of the band. Needs to be about an inch or so longer. Otherwise it's perfect.
4.0,Thoroughly happy with this purse.  Just the right size as it can carry essentials but not weigh you down.  To be clear though it is small enough that you will not be able to have a wallet in it.  It is not a butter soft leather but that I did not expect for the price.  Plenty of zippered pockets though to store what you need.  Tassels give it some class.  Received a number of compliments on it and questioned where I found it.  Better then I expected and I love it!
4.0,"I recently bought my mom a Pandora Bracelet with a snap clasp. My sister, niece, and my daughter all have one. I wanted my mom to have one as well to be able to join in on the fun of collecting and making memories. The beads and charms are something that she will collect over time. Which is a part of the fun. You can get charms for just about everything it seems which is really cool. However, I wanted her to be able to wear her bracelet right away. It would look a little goofy without any charms. I found this set of charms on amazon. They were really reasonably priced. A lot of the charms I've bought for my daughter were around $70 a piece. This set came with enough charms to fill her bracelet. The clasps did open a bit hard on some of the charms. We had to get a small screwdriver that I'd used for eye glass repair to pry them open. They didn't appear damaged or anything, just a little tough to get open with a fingernail. If it weren't for that I'd rated them a 5 Star instead of a 4 Star. There are not real silver but they look nice and as a way to fill a charm bracelet with nice looking charms, these set did the trick. They arrived on time. They were packaged well with no damage. If you are looking for a starter set of charms, I would recommend these. Keep in mind that you may have some difficulty in getting the clasps to open but a small screwdriver will do the trick. It worked great for me and my mom."
4.0,The material is very light and soft which is perfect for Florida.  I sized up one size and the elastic waist is a little tight but otherwise great.
4.0,Blue is on only front half of the earrings; back part is silver.
4.0,sized for an Oriental... order at least a half size bigger
4.0,It is a beautiful design but an odd fit. I am size 6 in womans and a large fit good with plenty of room however it is more crop top style which i cant decide if I like or not for my body type. If you have a flat torso this would be no issue but I'm curvy. It feels good on silky and comfy. The color is vibrant and I will be pairing with my new lucky black jeans and boots! hope this helps i would say go for it unless you have a muffin top then don't it will not cover it.
4.0,A bit bulky but it ok
4.0,Great for attaching regular watch bands to my smart band
4.0,Like that they have pockets and are so soft.  Wish they were a little longer.
4.0,"wish it had a better clip to put it on,fits really good and every one loves it. Will be getting one for a cancer friend"
4.0,This is really nice.
4.0,I wear an American size 10/12. I purchased an XL and it is not an American XL. It would be about an American size 6 maybe 8. The material is nice for a cool spring or summer day. It does not have inside pockets.  I gave this first stars as the construction of the jacket is nice.
4.0,"My son is 5 and loves these.  He gets lots of compliments on how cute they are too.  He's had them 6 months and the velcro on one strap is starting not to stick as much, but he wears them almost everyday and for $12, I think that's pretty good.  Even expensive name brand shoes wear out after months of wear and tear.  I will definitely buy another pair in a few months!"
4.0,"So so comfortable! It even has decent support for something with no wire. I may not wear it out all day personally, but for relaxing it's 100 times better than a sports bra."
4.0,"Bought these at the end of July for my 4 yr old. She absolutely loved the cute designs and the holes are big enough to fit crocs charms in them. My only issue is that it‚Äôs only been two months with her wearing them 3-4 times a week, and the blue side design strip is peeling off almost completely on one shoe. It‚Äôs nothing a little super glue can‚Äôt fix, but annoying none the less. I‚Äôd say for the price it‚Äôs great, they seem to be comfortable to her, and they are cute."
4.0,"Well constructed, and roomy enough for a travel bag, or for carrying large tools.  Same Carhartt quality that goes into the clothing items."
4.0,"great, I bought for cycling..but I will buy another pair for general use"
4.0,"It came cracked. I'm sure it happened during shippig, but the case was cute."
4.0,[[ASIN:B00JXB9A3K Vintage Style Blue and White Leather Rope Elephant Tree Branch Infinity Love Bracelet]]It looks great but it broke easily. But overall I really liked it.
4.0,"Like how soft they are, wish they were a bit longer since I‚Äôm so tall!!"
4.0,"Nice, but not the same quality Revos were in the past."
4.0,Nice but not super high quality<br /> Great for the price. Fits snug.
4.0,They replaced my broken wallet and it works great!
4.0,Would recommend that you get your size or one step up and do not get any tighter thinking that it would help if stay on better.
4.0,"Didn‚Äôt want to jump in and buy the expensive moissanite, so picked these up first. Can‚Äôt beat that sparkle for the price, slight blue tint but she loves them. Amazing how similar they are to real diamonds."
4.0,"Since I was flying so much, my doctor recommended that I start wearing compression socks and the next day, I find these at the airport gift shop. They also make great boot socks but the last order of these socks I received, the tops were not as tall as before and I did not have the same sense of comfort. I have tried other brands but they were too tight. I will have to order another pair and hope they are back to their old standards."
4.0,I bought it for teaching and singing. I really like that it keeps me from inhaling my mask. It muffles the sound a bit but I can deal with that.
4.0,"This dress is problematic.  It's adorable.  It's flirty. And it runs WAY small in the bust.<br /><br />PROS<br />1) Cute, well-cut swing dress for summer.<br />2) Not too short but flirty.<br />3) Empire waist is flattering to many body types.<br />4) Machine wash gentle; drip dry. And it washes beautifully!<br />5) Perfect for summer.<br /><br />CON<br />1) It's cut VERY small in the bust; and it's VERY, VERY short from shoulder to bust.  I normally wear a size 10 and got a L(arge) and it's still just too short in the ""draw"" for me.  If you are a Curvy Girl or long-bodied, consider ordering a size up.<br /><br />I'm still giving this dress 4 Stars.  It's cute; it's flirty without being naughty. It washes well.  However, it loses a Star for its problematic short cut."
4.0,"I am 5'10&#34; at around 140 lbs and they are definitely long enough but not as fitted as I expected. They are very comfortable and great to wear around the house or under other garments. The shiny spandex looking material makes them a little too casual to wear by themselves and without lining, they aren't very warm by themselves. I'm not disappointed with my purchase."
4.0,"I purchased these briefs trying to get the same fit and comfort I had with Stafford low rise combed cotton briefs from JCP.  These are soft, too, but the cut is just a bit wrong for me so they are not quite as comfortable as what I'm used to wearing. Therefore, I can only give them 4 stars."
4.0,"I ordered up a size to a large. I am 5'3"" and I feel that this dress fit me almost like a maxi but I still love it. it was sooo comfortable but I would recommend if you have larger hips/thighs to go up a size. where it is pleated is a little snug  there."
4.0,"Its cute, light and fits good.  The hearts are thin and one sided.  Looks just as pictured."
4.0,"For the price, these are great!  Frames are a bit flimsy but lenses are awesome"
4.0,Returned due to being too large.  Quality seemed good.  No trouble with returning
4.0,"I like the scarfs. They are soft and keep my neck warm in our freezing office. My only complaint is I wanted a soft pink color, but it is really a little too bright for the shirt I wanted to wear it with. The grey is a nice color, but remember this color grey has a hint of blue, which it is supposed too."
4.0,Great for everyday wear.
4.0,It only fits certain size faces. Too large for my 17 year old
4.0,"I really liked the quality of these tanks, but boy did they shrink in the wash! I don't baby my laundry so I sized up to medium from usually wearing a small for tank tops. These ended up being way too tight, I'd recommend sizing up two sizes, maybe even three if you want a looser fit! I liked them enough that I might order another size up but even then I don't know how they will fit. A bit too unpredictable for my liking, but I hope you luck out and find the right size!"
4.0,Really like the shirt but it is a bit short.
4.0,"A bit shorter than I expected. I'm 5'7 and it fits nicely but becomes a bit too short for my comfort level when I raise my arms above my head. Otherwise, it's cute and looks just like the picture."
4.0,"Nice shoes, comfortable"
4.0,they fit nicely but have a weird smell to them at first
4.0,Got any more colors ??? Great fit.
4.0,4‚≠êÔ∏è
4.0,Kind of cheep rope but the T-Rex chard is so cute!! I just changed the chain and now the necklace is perfect
4.0,I like how large it is! I also like the mirror effect on the shades! The shades do feel thin and wish a case was provided since they can be easily damaged in the velvet cover.
4.0,"You get two belts.  One gold and the other silver.  They are stretchy and fit me well and I'm not exactly a skinnie minnie.  I was afraid that stretching it would detract from the looks of the belt, but it doesn't.<br /><br />They just have a simple clasp that clips the leaves together.  I put the belt on and sat down, bent over,  and moved around to see if it would come  undone but it stayed closed.  The leaves aren't overly big so it's not like  you'll get stabbed in the belly which is another thing I was concerned about.  They're nice and the price was decent."
4.0,I had to shorten this dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and the dress was too long for me. But the dress is cute and I‚Äôve received many compliments!
4.0,"The fit is wayyy too small, but since looking at other reviews I ordered a bigger size than I truly am. I'm a L /XL I had to order a 2XL and it's a little snug. But fits okay, but I like the quality of this product."
4.0,"Upgrade washers to metal between keys, needs screws with deeper grove so easier to tighten, loosen."
4.0,Worked out perfectly for my Halloween costume. It came vacuum sealed so I had to fix the crease In the nose. Only thing is that very hard to see out of. You look out of the nose holes
4.0,This is beautiful but more<br />Green than the photo.
4.0,"Love color, fit and fabric"
4.0,"This bag is really nice seems durable, first use. Holds lots of items easily organized for convenience. Only problem when flight in Houston was delayed and connection in London required us to go through security again I was informed all liquids had to be repackaged in plastic bags. I almost lost connection due to delay. My first international flight so maybe I should of known but I went through security to board the first flight. Just saying you should still double bag fluids. I mean all of them don‚Äôt overlook your eye drops ? Airports"
4.0,"These leggings are comfy and the pockets are big. They're a little longer on me but I'm only 5' 1"" but I'd buy them again. They're squat proof"
4.0,"This dress is flattering and pretty. The fabric is thin, yet not see-through. The fabric is not stretchy; it's slippery and doesn't cling.<br /><br />Here's what keeps me from leaving 5 stars:<br /><br />1. The pattern does not line up anywhere close to how it appears in the image. It's still pretty, but the image on which I based my purchase is prettier.<br /><br />2. The armpit holes are tight. My arms aren't tiny, but this is not an issue I have with other clothing. I also have this dress in the light pink paisley pattern. The armpit holes are good on that dress. That one gets 5 stars.<br /><br />Note: I also bought this dress in black and charcoal. The fabric is very different. It's stretchy. The charcoal dress is tighter and less stretchy than the black one (which I'm returning because it's too big). I'm including this in case you already own the dress in another color or pattern and are expecting it to fit the same. I have it in 4 colors and there are 4 different fits."
4.0,I purchased this for my friends for his huawei gt watch and he loved the bands.
4.0,I love it I'm 38 DD with 35 waists and this me great even the thong fit well loved how the flowers tied on. the only thing I did not like was the fact this two man job to put on or you have put on like a bra. then fight to turn it around the right down but after I got it on it was worth it I loved it. My boyfriend loved it too he couldn't wait when he saw i order it . i sent him picture while he at work .. he started counting till he got out
4.0,Perfect for Hospitl with the buttons on the side so your masks doesn‚Äôt hurt your ears
4.0,Got a large to be safe....way too big!  I am average size.
4.0,The dress Is just as it appears in photo. It looks very pretty on my 4 year old daughter. It is well worth the very reasonable price that it was.  I would do business with them again
4.0,"4 Stars because the front part which goes in between the big toe and index toe is tough. I use this only in the gym locker, I couldn't wear this all day. But it is comfortable."
4.0,"One of the nose cushions fell off, other than that it's great!"
4.0,"This is pretty skirt, very full and nice for summer. The fabric is see through but there is a solid color straight skirt underneath made from the same material. You can see the silhouette of your legs through it. The description says, ""Dry clean only. Hang in shade to dry."" Which is kinda confusing but there was no tag anywhere on my skirt for cleaning instructions, could have been an oversight. I'm almost 5'5 and the skirt drags the ground quite a bit.üòû A shame, I was looking forward to wearing it. I wear 16-18 and the waistband is stretchy enough for me to be comfortable in. When I first pulled it out I thought I'd be in trouble because the elastic waistband looked very small. So it should be fine for someone smaller but taller. My skirt was listed as ""Red"" but it is definitely not red. It is  a salmon color  and is embellished at the bottom with shiny gold trim."
4.0,It's good material and fits great
4.0,Good product. Fits well. Color lighter than I expected and than the picture.
4.0,Like it. I still have it
4.0,I bought this t-Rex head to use in a Halloween party. It comes with a head only and I like that because it leaves the lower body free to wear other things. I am going to be creative with my costume and use the dinosaur head to go along with something else
4.0,it was a wonderful gift for a friend who loves Doctor Who.
4.0,"Lightweight when dry, quality looks good. Haven't used in water yet, armholes fit, no gaps.  I'm 5'2 115lbs and ordered a small. Snug fit."
4.0,"I really do love this bracelet. It's so cute to wear with a summer outfit. When I purchased this, the estimated delivery date was a month and a half away, which was a huge letdown. I received the bracelet after 2 weeks of purchase, so I was really surprised when I opened my mailbox to see it sitting in there.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me, the bracelet is too big for my wrist, so it turns around, I even have it on the bracelet clasp and it's still too big.<br /><br />Ever all, it's such a cute bracelet and I'm very pleased."
4.0,"I think school bus driver must be a good test and, after 5 months, these are still in great shape. No tears, holes, wearing or staining. Ready for next school year."
4.0,"I really liked the scalloped hem, very pretty.  Thin fabric but i enjoyed wearing it and i do get compliments."
4.0,Smaller than I expected. I‚Äôd say to size up.
4.0,Nicer than expected. Very satisfied with appearance/quality of this inexpensive necklace. Recommend to others.
4.0,Okay. Not made very well
4.0,"Nice fabric, lightweight, and good quality."
4.0,"Love it! Just the size I need. Fits in the overhead bin in smaller regional jet planes. I really dislike side checked bags. They sometimes cause delays and missed flights. So if I can get both my hand luggage to fit in the overhead bin, that would be ideal. And this one did! Thank you!"
4.0,"I ordered a size 0-2 but the dress is a bit big for me and is more like a size 2. It is very cute but very revealing with the deep V-neck design that hangs well below my bust. Therefore, I had to pair it with a camisole and a small pin to make it fit me, since I don't have the boobs to fill it out either. It's tough to find beautiful dresses when you are built so small. After all, I am only 4' 11&#34; and 93 pound.  I love the floral pattern and the way the skirt-portion flows when I'm walking. The zipper in the back is nicely hidden within the material. The fabric is very soft and airy. You should definitely wear light undergarments with this dress."
4.0,"Very nice neckless, seems to be made well and the green of the center really pops nicely. Gave it as a gift and it was well received. Giving it a 4 star for now because its only a week old at this point"
4.0,I like how they fit. Stitching looks odd.
4.0,Great gown for my elderly Mom. Pretty and soft for her. Functional and easy on/off and to move out of the way for caregiver.  We got  a small which is still too big for her. If it came in XS it would be even better! Will buy another.
4.0,"Fits as expected, fall beautifully. Will buy again."
4.0,It was nice<br />Making a lamp
4.0,Wasn't the one I ordered but the one that came instead was just as nice
4.0,"I did not care for the way this dress looked on. The length was a little short, and I ended up looking like a little girl in it. I am 5'10', 180, with a small chest. It just did not look good on me. The quality was fine."
4.0,Nice hat and seems well made.  Easily folds up almost pocket sized.  You must use the measurements however because the hat has to fit exactly as there is no adjustment.  (And no easy way to make one due to the construction).  The hat is slightly too big on me and the weight of the bill causes it to slide forward.  That gets tiresome after awhile.
4.0,"Really cute. It's been too cold to wear as an outdoor jacket, but I look forward to wearing it more this spring and next fall."
4.0,"Husband loves,this is his 3rd watch from this company! He gets a lot of compliments when he wears it."
4.0,"Very soft shirt, stretchy material. Pretty true to size but maybe a tad bit on the small side.  Seems to be a women‚Äôs sized t-shirt rather than unisex sizing.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and it was a good length."
4.0,Great deal. Looks great and fits well. A great alternative to buying expensive prescriptions.
4.0,"The case is more burgundy/maroon than the purple, but it is still a cute case."
4.0,"Set the time one month ago and the watch is still right on to the second.  The rubber band that came on the watch wasn't much, so I changed it out with a nylon/Velcro one, $8 at Walmart.  The pins for the band on this watch are just solid wire pins, not spring-loaded, so I had to carefully bend the original ones with needlenose pliers to get the band off.  Replaced these with some spring-loaded pins, and everything fits great.  Good cheap watch, just wish the light was more even across the display and brighter."
4.0,"Purchased for my girlfriend and she really enjoyed it. We'll post an updated review few months from now to see how the shirt holds up but the feel, quality and design is good so far. Surprise from buying a random shirt from a company I've never heard of"
4.0,Like the style and the material...cut is kind of small but it will doüòä
4.0,Order a bigger size than usual.
4.0,Great for my daughters dance recital
4.0,I love the style and fit but the17 inch high shaft was not becoming on me. I am barely 5ft 3in. This style is for a much taller person so unfortunately I had to return them other wise a 5 star rating.
4.0,Its cute but I'm not crazy about the ruffled arms. Looks funny with a sweater over it because the ruffles stick out. And I have chubby arms I feel this shirt really accentuates. Not my fav but will wear to work.
4.0,"I bought this for church on Easter Sunday. The first thing I noticed was the texture of the material - it's 100% polyester, so sorta smooth and plastic-ish, but once I tried it on, I found that it hangs sort of nicely and is good for twirling haha. It will make a bit of noise as you move around. The wrinkles were easy to steam out - and the color was more vibrant and lovely that I expected, and it was also a flattering fit. I'm 5'10"". and it came to my knees. The waist met my natural waist, which was a pleasant surprise, since I don't look great in the empire style that's so popular right now. It's slightly tight at my bust, but I was wearing a bra with a bit of padding, so that wasn't an issue either. I didn't use the tie that came with it, because it looked fine without it. Overall, I'm glad I bought it - good for the price."
4.0,Quality is higher than expected.  Provides reduction of glare at night and during the day.  I recommend this as a good pair of driving glasses.
4.0,"Pendant nice, but chain not strong enogh"
4.0,Love it.  I work in the hospital and this works well with putting on and taking off gloves. Only downfall is that I have such a small wrist I'm on the last hole. Still love it though.
4.0,"It's good, but the chain is a llittle thinner than expected. But it arrived just fine and is great for the price."
4.0,"Was pleasantly surprised at quality of fabric, the beautiful sexy style and the rose pink color. However it does run very small. I usually wear a 14 and an XL was too small. re-ordered in XXL. Asian sizes run a lot smaller than US. Buy a size (at least) larger for smooth fit. Cant wait to get larger size, hoping it fits. Dont have special occasion - just wanted this piece to have when I want to put my sexy diva on. dinner, dancing, a nice event. I def recommend it - for a great price - under $30"
4.0,very very lighweight and cute and soft but overpriced shall we say
4.0,Cute for a very inexpensive set of trendy earings for spring and summer.
4.0,I usually wear a size 8 but I ordered an 8 1/2 and wore thick socks because I planned to be on my feet all day walking around at a festival. I danced all day  and felt like there was enough cushion to support balls of my feet. Stylish and comfortable. Great buy!
4.0,Havent worn these yet but arrived on time and they look great in the package.  These are for a theme party and was pleasantly surprised to know they come with the bottom grill as well! Boom!
4.0,Was not excited that shirt was not cotton. Kind of big fit but its wearable for my size.
4.0,"Great price, comfortable and quick delivery."
4.0,"My knuckles are dry and the bottoms of my feet cut up the sheets. So, this is just what I needed! I have other lotions but I absolutely hate when they‚Äôre greasy or cause me to pause and wait for them to dry. THESE creams however, dry very quickly! On my hands, it gives them a nice soft feel without interfering with my day to day activities. And on my feet, I can put my socks back on in less than 60 seconds, which is so important to someone who hates to wait around for lotion to dry. And, there‚Äôs no greasy feel, which is fabulous! The scent of the lotions is supposed to be lavender and coconut and I do like that it‚Äôs a light scent, however there is a slight menthol or maybe Off type smell in there too. It‚Äôs not bothersome to me, and maybe other people who like lavender are used to that sort of smell. Either way, it still smells lovely and isn‚Äôt an overpowering scent.<br /><br />Plus, it comes in a nice box with both lotions inside so that you can give it as a gift if you so choose."
4.0,"I used these on our recent Florida trip and they worked well.  They are very lightweight and easy to pack.  My kids liked the colors and it made it more fun for them to wear.  They kept us dry, don‚Äôt take up much room and were easy to pack/carry."
4.0,It's a good product for low cost. Goes great with a variety of outfit styles. I have already picked out a few more to buy just so I can have a variety in my wardrobe.
4.0,"The fabric is more shiny and thin than I thought it would be. Despite being a little loose around the belly-to-thigh area, it still clings and shows every lump and bump. When worn with a long shirt it looks fine though.<br /><br />I'm 5'6&#34;, and they're a bit long. I have to wear shoes with at least a 2&#34; heel for them not to touch the ground.<br /><br />If you don't mind them touching the ground, they're fun and swishy. Very comfy for lounging around the house or running to the store."
4.0,"It's a cute dress! I got the all black one and the material seems to attract lint etc. I probably won't be able to wear it more than a few times because of it. I haven't tried a lint roller on it yet, so maybe that will help.<br />I'm 5'9"" and the dress comes to a couple inches above my knees"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a tiny bit small in the arms, but I just like my hoodies big I guess. Otherwise it‚Äôs super cute."
4.0,The shirt is made well but the LEDs tend to fall out of position. Overall a great Christmas sweater. The kids loved it!
4.0,This is a very nice shirt/dress. I bought it to wear over leggings. It is exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased with my purchase. It is actually nicer than I thought it would be. Good deal too!
4.0,It was nice but I didn't like how it looked on me.
4.0,"Cute suit, but looks better without the padding... the padding kinda doesn't really fit into the top very well and makes the seams get a little wonky, I took it out, but just make sure that you're ok with having a swimsuit sans padding before attempting to buy this one."
4.0,"Cute, fun masks that fit properly, however, they are way too thick, even without the filters."
4.0,"I have to say that I really liked this thing well made, was a little on the big side when I got I should have paid more attention on the size description so that is on me, descent price for what I got I was able to put everything in my old wallet and some, just was to big for my average pants size pocket.  but my wife loved it now she uses it now she just walks around with that thing doesn't even carry a Perce any more so it was just a little bit to big for me but just right for my wife."
4.0,"This fit as I thought it would. I was hoping maybe it'd fit smaller, but it's just a little big on me. I'm 5'1&#34; and about 113 lbs, so a medium is gonna fit a little big. I'll just take it in some.<br /><br />Cute length. Short but not too short, and it's gonna work perfectly for my Alice in Zombieland costume perfectly."
4.0,"the quality of cotton of the women sports underwear is good, I can feel these are the good quality of cotton when wearing them. the elastic band around the waist are stretchable and comfortably fit my waist. the reason I rate them 4/5 is it would be better if the stitches to connect each end of the band would not bulky stitched at the back of it. As shown the pictures, there are lots of sewing machine crossed each end of the band, but the quality of the pants are good."
4.0,It‚Äôs good for pictures or short time ware not all day it starts to mark ur face bc of the string u use to hold the mask up
4.0,"Fits well and the fabric is nice and medium thickness.  It's a darker gray which I prefer.  I wish it was just a little longer, 2&#34;"
4.0,"I do not use this for buttons, I use it for attaching things rather than pins, such as another layer of netting around my deck pagoda to seal a gap and keep the bugs out. What I would like to know is how to get refills"
4.0,Fit is a little snug.  Nice design.  Very warm.
4.0,Very dainty and pretty nicer then the picture on Amason. Perfect for prom.
4.0,A little baggy but I expected that based on the reviews. Very comfortable and cute dress.
4.0,"I returned this strictly because it was purchased for a walking trip and it's incredibly heavy. That being said, I would repurchase it at another time because there's no way you could freeze to death in this thing. Nice coat!"
4.0,nice with rose gold jewelry
4.0,"I like it, but the paint is starting to come off"
4.0,"Very compact, takes up very little space. Has a bright light. Very good for camping. This product will get lots of use."
4.0,No bad. Nothing special but until now feels and look great.
4.0,My husband says they're comfortable but he would never leave the house in them. Runs very large and they look sloppy.
4.0,"I can wear both top and bottom of the set with no problem. Bottoms only is my favorite look but to glam up I use both, just follow instructions for soaking the bar and you‚Äôll be good to go."
4.0,Little shorter than I expected (I hate folding my tickets) but quality is nice and fits everything I need!!
4.0,"Classy, body hugging & sexy"
4.0,So thin! I love the design though. Just wish it was thicker. A lighter color would be see through.
4.0,This shirt is really cute and soft. It does run big though.
4.0,"I would buy again, soft and fits well. Good support, but not enough for high impact."
4.0,"A size smaller would have fit better as it runs a little big, but it will serve okay as a night shift."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 120 or so pounds and got a small, they fit super cute! It‚Äôs not stacked but long enough to give the stacked looked. Pretty thick material so they are worth the buy."
4.0,"An event watch to wear. I wore my to my husbands Christmas party. This was my #1 choice. I have watches more expensive; however, I decided on this one."
4.0,Too small I have a big het
4.0,Good product - clasp is a little weak but fixable.
4.0,"This dress was EVERYTHING on me. The silhouette was very flattering and has a classic and elegant look.  I'm 5'11, 38DDD and usually wear anywhere from a size 16-20 US.  This dress is long and the cape (its attached) is a tap bit longer than the dress. I wore 3 1/2in heels and it was still long.  So if you're a tall and curvy plus size woman (like myself) go for it.  I wore it to the MET Opera for my birthday and got compliments from complete strangers! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the cups (I call them boob guards) sew into the dress.  If you're not a A or B cup they do not and WILL NOT work.  Have to take it to the cleaners to have them removed.  Other than that, it was perfect and I plan on ordering it in another color."
4.0,Great for day use. The watch light is not bright enough to illuminate the face so checking the time at night is not happenin. frustrating.
4.0,I love these shoes for my 4 year old Granddaughter.They are at a great price as well!
4.0,Watch looked great and felt awesome on my wrist. The only down side is the glass is not flat across the face of the watch and it‚Äôs curved upward and I accidentally closed it in a window and it didn‚Äôt hit to hard. Only advice I have is be careful working while wearing it because that glass can easily be hit off of things but over all a good watch.
4.0,"This z-strap sandal is so flexy but it does provide its own arch support. Feels very good on your foot, initially I needed to practive walking in them just to gain the stability and feel. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,Really like these - Wear them all the time around the house.
4.0,They are fine.  A little shorter than I thought they would be but okay.
4.0,"Pants are very large, but can be taken in quite easily."
4.0,"Overall, this is a good dress considering the price. I read the reviews before buying it and looked at the size chart to ensure the sizing would be good. Well, I still think the sizing is a bit off. I ordered M, while I could have easily gone with S. I have not worn this piece yet. The dress arrived quickly. It does need ironing, of course. I inspected it for any flaws but found none. So far, I am satisfied with this dress."
4.0,"I like the thickness and quality. The ball is a bit difficult to screw on while on the ear because it‚Äôs so small but once on, no problem."
4.0,Chain is thin and hard to latch.
4.0,"They looked very nice, the length was good but a bit narrow. I returned them and bought another sort that has scratches on the front part too."
4.0,This bag works well many trips no problems
4.0,These fit really nice. But they are not wool this would be something I would like to have. They are just common sweater material. So they are beading up quickly. I have picked up a alpaca blend and they are considerably warmer. But the fit is not as nice. So I give them the four stars for the fit. I like the basic black and the price as well.
4.0,It's a little tighter than I expected it to be but I guess that's how it supposed to be. It should have a snuggle fit since it's a fitness bra.
4.0,"The bracelet itself if very cute, sturdy and colorful.  It is too small for me.  It should have had another clasp added to it so that it could be adjustable for a larger wrist.  I have other jewelry that has the added clasp which I find very convenient.  I purchased a Murano Millefiori ring that I wanted to wear with the bracelet.  But now I have decided to give the bracelet to my granddaughter for Christmas.  She has a smaller wrist.  If you are a thin adult, you can wear this bracelet.  I weigh 170, so my wrists are bigger, and the bracelet does not work for me.  But it is very cute.  I would give it a 5 star rating, but it does not fit me, so it gets a 4 star rating from me."
4.0,Love the color & all the pockets. The handle makes it easy to carry alone.
4.0,"My daughter has started a bit of a watch collection, and she loves this one! It is unique and honestly a great size and fit. The only negative that she has noticed is that the second band that holds the watch band in place is rather itchy against her skin. It is held together with a single stich that bothers her a little. Other than that, this is a great watch."
4.0,"I wasn't looking for a fashion statement, just something to cover my head when I work a long shift in health care. With all of this crazy covid stuff, I don't want uncovered hair anymore, this goes right in the wash at the end of the shift with my whole outfit. I really appreciate the fast shipping.  It's light weight, covers my whole head and adjusts to make sure nothing slips out.  Sweat band is nice.  Is it glamorous or make me look super cute.....no, but it does the job and covers my hair."
4.0,"Looks good. Wish it didn't have wrinkles, but they are few and not too deep. They should fade after some wearing. The seller's sizing guide was very helpful for me to pick the right size. You have to measure yourself."
4.0,"A Cute  dupe for the appearance of a Apple watch<br />But, of course it doesn't have the abilities....."
4.0,"This belt buckle is useful in situations you need a lighter and style, the only bad thing is that the bullets are slightly pointed, nothing that can penetrate your skin, just hurts if you sit in it for awhile, other than that i like it, I would suggest not wearing it in airports, schools, and other buildings with important people like police stations"
4.0,PARA EL PRECIO ESTA PERFECTO
4.0,"Very neat little product! Two fold-up collapsible pairs of clip-on sunglasses, each in small a handy hard plastic case.  Their light, and feel like they must be incredibly fragile, but they're not. When you unfold them and lock them in place and clip them to your mid-sized glasses frames, they work wonderfully."
4.0,They are comfortable but the liner is too loose to hold a phone as shown. They aren‚Äôt compression shorts.
4.0,Only thing I don't like is that sleeves are kind of tight. The other overall fit is pretty much as expected.
4.0,I ordered it XXL so they go too high. A good fit otherwise as my upper thighs are large. I don't think there is a perfect solution as I have short legs but big thighs.
4.0,"Looks great and is soft, although it's somewhat thinner than expected"
4.0,I gave it 4 stars only because it has no belt loops which makes it a bit difficult to keep closed otherwise very nice. If not for that it would get 5 stars.
4.0,"I like this watch, the face is easy to see, the color is great and the watch band is especially nice, because it is thin. I am having a  problem with the size of the watch face. It is a tad too big. I can't bend my wrist properly when I have it on. If it wasn't quite as big it would fit a lot better. Other than the size it is a very pretty watch. I will wear it when I leave the house but it isn't an all day watch.<br />The watch is very attractive and I get complemented on it and I do like it. It works just fine and hasn't lost any time.<br />I received this watch at a discount in return for leaving my honest opinion in a review."
4.0,"Great bang for your buck for ties. Great colors, great designs. Able to tie easily"
4.0,"The apron comes with long ribbons to tie around your waist and neck, I don't love that. The material is not soft, it's durable and thick. It reminds me of what a painter would wear.  However, I showed my daughter the apron and she loved it."
4.0,THIS IS A VEERY PRETTY SCARF THOUGH THE COLORS ARE NOT AS SOFT AND PLEASANT AS IN THE PHOTO.
4.0,The granddaughter loved it but the print was upside down as it had a filter on it one way
4.0,It fit good üëç
4.0,Really cute but where the strap goes over your shoe foot to fasten there is a seam there and that hurt my foot. True to size
4.0,"Just a little bit too long. Otherwise, all good!"
4.0,"It fits well but the color in real life is much lighter than the one shown here.  It is actually a powder blue, sky blue, baby blue hue as opposed to the muted almost grayish blue seen on the model.  Overall, I like the dress."
4.0,"Very cute! Glad that this top was long enough for my tall frame, but I have broad shoulders/frame so I got it in a larger size (I tend to wear med or large), but it fits a bit weird. (I also have a large chest which could be why.) Still love it though...a bit pricey and worrisome on the hand wash only as I work out and sweat a lot!"
4.0,Nice socks & great material
4.0,"I don't work out, ever, but I do a lot of manual labor tasks that results in extremely dirty and damaged hands. For awhile I stopped wearing my ring because I was worried it would get damaged (more than regular day-to-day activities), which meant many people questioning our engagement status. I wanted something that I could wear and not worry about it getting dirty or damaged. I got several &#34;placeholders&#34; which were just the least expensive rings I could find. Unfortunately, as many of us find out the hard way, cheap is not always best. My finger would turn green or it would lose its &#34;jewel&#34; or even break entirely. So after dealing with that, I stopped wearing my ring again. And again, the questions started. I was elated when I was offered a chance to try these out (at this point I'm almost desperate enough to just wear *the* ring!<br /><br />*I did purchase this through a program that offers products at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.*<br /><br />When the rings arrived, I noticed it was a tiny bit small. For some background, I have tiny fingers. A size 6 ring is loose on my left hand. Finding anything smaller than that is nearly impossible (let alone a half size!) So I went with a size 5 (I figured there would be some flexibility). However, it seems to be a tiny bit (like minusculey - but enough to notice) small. This is the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars, as I am currently trying to &#34;stretch&#34; them out a bit so they won't be as tight. At this point I am sure it would be more advantageous to just purchase one size up (6) but I'm stubborn and determined to make this work!<br /><br />They are made from a quality material and they offer a nice variety of colors to ensure they coordinate with whatever you are wearing! I, however, am a very &#34;plain&#34; dresser as I don't like to bring attention to myself. So that means the bright colors are a little dramatic for my taste. I would probably recommend the manufacturers explore other color options or themes (gray, pastels, etc.) to satisfy that demographic."
4.0,It is the length I needed for a lot of my neck charms.
4.0,"The pendant is beautiful, but would really have liked length options for the chain. It was basically a choker on me - had to order an entirely new chain at cost to myself in order to be able to wear the pendant."
4.0,"very thin, almost more like a thick t-shirt, which is perfect for us TEXANS!"
4.0,I wish these had a little more &#34;give&#34; in them. They are a bit tight. Also the first one I put a key on and wore around my wrist for about 2 months (I'm a school teacher) just broke one day. The more &#34;rubber-y&#34; kind of bracelets I've worn for years without breaking.
4.0,Mask fit well. Good sturdy quality.
4.0,I like how comfortable it is. I love the dress itself. But the short sleeve cover I wasn't a fan of. The sleeves squeezed my arms and the color is a duller mustard than shown. But the dress itself I'm more than satisfied with so I'm not disappointed.
4.0,Necklace looked great just a week late getting here!!!!
4.0,"This charm is appropriate for a charm bracelet, preferably for a child or very petite woman. It is much smaller than it appears online. Photos of it on a mannequin would have been helpful. It is well-made."
4.0,I found a spot on the back above the back hem and would like a return label to send it back.  The merchant has apologized. I will give another chance if I see something  that interests me. I will try to clean the spot off.
4.0,"The fit is good, bought for a gift, and they were happy"
4.0,I got this purse Christmas of 2017. I would say I don‚Äôt use the purse everyday so fairly light use. The metal bar in the front pokes out. The stitching on the inside pockets have started to unravel. Other than that it‚Äôs been a great bag. It has a lot of space and the side straps work great.
4.0,Good one but not as bright as the one in picture
4.0,"I do like the dress I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 148 , I orden size larger and fit perfect"
4.0,"Exactly like in the picture. It‚Äôs a pretty big ring, even on a big man‚Äôs hand, it‚Äôs not a bad thing but just be aware. Nice details and nice weight. Nothing bad I can say about it"
4.0,"This spring dress, will need to be pressed before wearing, bold print, was skeptical about keeping. Should cost $19.99,  I will need to put on waist cincher, jewelry and nice shoes to make it me. Will probably purchase a different print."
4.0,My granddaughter loves this outfit. But it runs on the smaller side.
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 & 1/2‚Äù & 130 lbs I ordered a medium and it fit good. Great price!
4.0,"They are SO cute, sadly I had to return them. These boots fit extremely big so could be 2 more years until my daughter grows into them. I could not exchange them because there wasn't a smaller size available."
4.0,"Well made, looks just as pictured. The CC tab kinda takes away from the overall good quality, In my opinion."
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt like it,"
4.0,NOT high impact.  Not even a little high impact.  Super comfy so I wear them around the house but my everyday bras hold me in better than this does when working out.
4.0,Great for exercising on those hot days.
4.0,"They fit well, very comfortableandnd perfect for working out! Will order more"
4.0,"The belt is well made, the buckle head even more impressive, very smooth and shining.  The holeless buckles should be convenient and comfortable.<br /><br />However I am not sure it's made of genuine leather, even though I am OK if it's not for this low price."
4.0,"The color for the non fuzzy part of the jacket is is accurate with the picture, but the fuzzy part of the jacket is a lot bluer than the picture depicts. Slightly dissapointed in the color, but it fits great and is warm."
4.0,"I purchased these boots for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  She had placed them on her Wish List with Amazon.  Upon opening the gift Christmas Day, she found that they were too small. I will advise anyone ordering these boots ,that you need to order a size larger.  I will return them and re-order  Very cute boots and made well.  Don't expect them to be UGGS for this price. :)"
4.0,"Guess I should have paid more attention to the fact that this cardi is loose-fitting. I looks a tad too big, but I guess it is supposed to fit that way. Really cute cardi, nonetheless."
4.0,"If only I were as tall as the model. Need to take it I‚Äôm to have the seam raised 3+ inches; buuut, I like it enough I actually will. Cute, comfy, warm but not hot, fits my chest well"
4.0,"For the price, you won't likely be disappointed."
4.0,"Great product, the fit was perfect. I had to order the clips separately, but in all was a great price. The packing when delivered is a little strange, but when it was unfolded was in great shape. If needed I would reorder in the future."
4.0,"DD asked for these for her B-day and we are both thrilled with them! Very, VERY cute!"
4.0,"These shoes were exactly what I was looking for as far as how they looked, but they were not as comfortable as I had hoped. For me, they were a bit too narrow and they hurt my toes and the top of my foot.  I used Foot Petals all around the inside of the shoe to try to make them more comfortable."
4.0,"I do like this cute one, but metal details are kind of noisy and cheep. Can have scraches very easy, i try to protected with some clear nail polish.  But i do still feeling that i have to handle this one with very much care.  It is cute but small. But i am still love it."
4.0,I am a 40 DDD and this is the best purchase I‚Äôve made for my boobs sports bra wise. I love it and it‚Äôs got everything u need. Size chart was off for me tho I ended up going with a 3 luxe the second time I ordered it. The chart said I should be a 4 luxe.
4.0,"To be fair, I ended up returning my first purchase of this because it felt too tight around my arms. I ended up getting the next size up which fits much better. There are only 2 snaps closures at the crotch. I wish it had 3."
4.0,"Super cute and flattering, but too small and very little support in the bust. Also about 1-2 inches too short overall on my 5'4&#34; frame??"
4.0,Product arrived quickly and looked exactly like the picture. The quality was good but a XXL fit like a XL. I had to return the XL for a 2X. The return process however was very simple.
4.0,Good little knife for the price but poor quality steel. I actually use my knives so I must constantly sharpen them. The point is tough to keep on this blade. Decent leather sheath. Good deal overall.
4.0,Just what I was hoping for.  Worked perfectly for all my husbands collection of sunglasses.  Would totally recommend this product
4.0,Overall did the job for a Halloween costume. Good value.
4.0,These were great for our baby!  Awesome with his christening outfit!
4.0,Great quality material love the color and style I don‚Äôt have a very big chest but it seems to run snug in the chest with a more roomy fit at the bottom. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 194 lbs and got an xl
4.0,This has been the most comfortable and adjustable band for my Fitbit - I've been working past 3 million steps over the last year and have changed bands often till this one. Others were just not adjustable enough to really personalize the fit.
4.0,"Love this dress! It fit perfectly, and it hugged me just right! I‚Äôm pretty small in size, so it‚Äôs hard to find clothes that do that. Super cute and comfortable, although I felt like I couldn‚Äôt move my legs too far or the bottom will split. Otherwise, great purchase!"
4.0,Super cute but if you're busty better order up 2 sizes!  I'll wear a camisole with it but would have preferred to not have to.
4.0,this was everything advertised but I did want a leotard that snapped through at the crotch but it has been worn and was comfortable--no complaints a great buy!!
4.0,I'm 5'6&#34; and even with heels dress is to long but otherwise it's really nice and for the price I can put a hem in it.
4.0,Great quality warm fits perfect
4.0,"Definitely worth the price! A little stiff, but softening-up by the day with use!"
4.0,"After my husband lost his last silicone ring we decided that we needed to buy more than one. He works on a roof and isn't allowed to wear his traditional wedding band. We received the rings and four came in the pack. Two of one size and two another. I really wish we were able to choose which sizes not just what was offered to us. Our pack included two black, one gray and one blue. My husband said they fit fine and is overall pleased.<br /><br />We received this product in exchange for an honest reciew. The product being a reduced cost to us had no bearing on the content of the review."
4.0,"i'm a size 8 measured against the official US standard sizes and this was huge on me, 1/2 to a whole size larger than me."
4.0,"Cute and great length! Material is thin, but as expected for the price. I wore this dress 3 times during fall activities and Halloween festivities, received compliments everytime. Threw a blazer over, and tights under, was great for work. Definitely a keeper."
4.0,I love it. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was not having buttons to hold my mask loops such as my other caps but I did sew some buttons on.
4.0,Nice fit and comfortable. Bought it for my coworker and she loves it.
4.0,"Perfect packaging, came with cleaner solution, two pieces of cleaner material,and a case!! Awesome!!"
4.0,I bought these to help with the post-quarantine summertime transition back to professional clothing and they are great! A little lighter weight than I had expected but I love the quick dry for sweaty commutes in the city. Would buy again!
4.0,I purchased this dress for someone else. They loved the dress and it fit as they expected it to. The only issue we have had with this dress it that it wrinkles very easy and requires a lot of starch to keep it wrinkle free.
4.0,Me gusta.<br />Es muy corto o es para personas bajitas.  O simplemente lo usas como blusa
4.0,"They get the job done for the price and fit fine with a helmet on, they tend to fog if your just sitting around in them but if your moving they work just fine."
4.0,"Adorable. I am 5'7 and curvy size 8, Breasts are C cup and it Fits perfect. Not too tight in the breast.  Flows nicely over body. Will definitely buy more."
4.0,These are adorable little flats for girls. They run about a size big
4.0,I am happy with my purchase. They're made of good quality
4.0,They look like large not xxl
4.0,It was very colorful and it is going to be used to play soccer
4.0,"These high waisted yoga pants are very stretchy and comfortable. Due to the material, they keep me much cooler than other brands of yoga pants. They do not tend to roll down or bunch up, and stay put for the most part. They have also held up nicely being washed and dried. The reason for four stars is the waist portion. While they are branded high waisted, they are much too high (up to my breasts). This is not a big deal, it causes some extra fabric near the torso. Overall, these are great and flattered my body type perfectly. I would purchase again."
4.0,Pants r great but elastic a little tight around ankles- I cut the inside cuff and released elastic to loosen the cuff and love them
4.0,"The display is easily readable with all the info I need, and you can't beat the price.  However, the strap breaks after a year or two, and then I simply replace the watch.  I have half a dozen of them with broken straps, happily still at work in a box.  I tried buying the stainless-steel version with a metal band, but the clasp was unreliable and it fell off somewhere."
4.0,My daughter loves it.great buy
4.0,Look great. Fit was perfect
4.0,These look really nice. Not sure that they will hold up for everyday use but it is a nice set.
4.0,"These sea glass pieces arrived in good condition and were a beautiful light sea foam color just like the picture. I used them with jump rings to make necklaces as gifts and they were very popular and easy to make. While none of them broke, one did crack while I was inserting the jump ring as the hole in the pendant is a bit uneven, but that was my own fault. I only wish these pendants were a bit more consistent in size so I could make matching earrings."
4.0,"Ths patch was missing, but the company was quick to make it right. Everything else was as described.<br />It's also very purple, brighter than pictured."
4.0,This product runs small . I wear a 10 & had to return for an 11. To wear for an 8 hour work shift idk. May have to bring my flats just in case! Somewhat comfortable . Beautifully styled I will say that !! 4 stars only bc product DOES RUN SMALL!!!
4.0,When putting in a Note 4. You have to take off the case. Charges super slow for a Note 4. But is good to have when at theme parks.
4.0,Very nice product. Fots very well and not too hard to out together. Pins are loose so be careful with assembly. All in all it is a great and affordable band to boost up the elegance of your smartwatch. Great as a gift too.
4.0,I like that it was really quick shipping and the coloring. I like that it included three pieces. But the tail is super small. Would be for a toddler/child and not an adult. The ears fit on my head though. I will take that as a win.
4.0,"very soft, after wearing I bought all colors :)"
4.0,"It's not exactly linen, but alright for summer"
4.0,You get what you pay for. Priced appropriately for what it is. It worked perfect for a Bid Day accessory. Super cute. My daughter got lots of compliments.
4.0,"The details did not include really high slits on the sides, making this dress more of a shirt than a dress. Returning it<br /><br />Update: I‚Äôm able to wear the dress as a shirt instead and it still looks pretty cute!"
4.0,Impulse purchase
4.0,this is my 3rd one.  I wear it a lot and also have the reverse color of this shirt.
4.0,"I  was skeptical at first, so far no problems. I don't know if the bags i purchased are authentic, but they seem sturdy and they have many similarities to my purchases from Carson's and Macy's.  If they are not authntic then they are pricey, but if they are then they are still pricey."
4.0,Muy original y muy buen hecha
4.0,I love it. It's very cute and well priced. The only down size is that you have to wait forever when you order it.
4.0,Fits well. Material quality could have been better.
4.0,"I recently had surgery and am not able to wear pants for a while so I have been on the hunt for dresses that won't rub against the incision/muscle area, are dressy enough to wear to work, but casual enough to wear with boat shoes. This dress fit the bill! Fortunately it's also a little longer as I am not super graceful while sitting/standing just yet which prevents me from flashing innocent bystanders--lol. The fabric is a slinky-jersey-type fabric and will definitely show every lump and bump on you. The pockets do make it a little blousier around the hip area which might not look so good on folks that have a little hip/thigh on them. I knocked off a star because the fabric is really cheap and it likely won't last for more than 1 season. I'd rather pay a few dollars more and have it last a full year. Overall, it's a decent buy. For reference I am 5'9, 40D, 210 and purchased an XL. It fit blousy--not too big, not too small."
4.0,"This is a cute outfit. It is paper thin which is good for the hot weather, but I‚Äôm not sure how long the material will keep in tact. Runs a little big also!"
4.0,"The color is darker than in the picture (I got the first one -b. medium wash). And I followed the advice of the reviewers and got a medium even though i am usually a small. It was too big -_- So I order the polka dot one in small and it's great, very cute!"
4.0,"I‚Äôm giving these tops a 4 star instead of 5 because the neckline doesn‚Äôt lie flat.<br />I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 38C, and weigh 158. I generally wear a large or 14-16. I ordered an XL and it fits fine, although I think a large would fit also. The shoulder seams are in the right spot, not several inches down my arm.<br />The sleeves are long but I feel I have short arms. I didn‚Äôt feel they were too tight.<br />The material is very soft and comfortable, and I really like the length. Perfect with leggings. Also the floral colors are very pretty."
4.0,"Bought this for a 10-year old boy - he didn't know what to do with it - he says he doesn't wear bracelets - MY MISTAKE! It was advertised for boys or girls, so I took a shot.  I've advised his dad to put it aside and give it to him later.  He could wear it when he's older or give it to a friend.<br />The bracelet is nice, though."
4.0,Very cute and looks as picured on the model. Only downside is there is no cups in the dress so if you have larger breasts you‚Äôll need to sew in cups/ get a sticky bra
4.0,"Well made, but not as large as National products I have ordered in the same size. Also, material very stiff, but hoping it will soften with future washings."
4.0,Super cute and great for the holidays
4.0,Nice just what I wanted.
4.0,"I like the scarf but it didn't really meet my expectations. I was hoping for a thicker fabric for winter not a thin fabric that is meant for spring. But overall I really do like it because it matches alot of my clothes. But because it was my fault for not looking at the details carefully, i rate this a 4 star."
4.0,These reusable bags are no bigger than any other size reusable bags I have bought on Amazon. But they are cute
4.0,I wear this device daily and I like the dual use characteristics of identifing by blood type and allow ready access to my keys.  Excellent product.
4.0,"I ordered the XXL and typically wear a 16.  The skirt fits great, I probably could have ordered the XL and it would have fit fine.  However, sitting on my natural waist it still hits my ankles, much longer than pictured.  I'll have to have it hemmed.  Seeing it in person it kind of looks Minnie Mousey, but it's still cute.  There is a short liner on the inside, but up on my natural waist, the liner just covers my bum, so it will need to be removed.  The skirt doesn't seem sheer enough to really need it though."
4.0,"Love the print!! It feels nice, comes down to almost my knees in the back which is great since i'm almost 6&#34; tall!  My only problem is it will not close. I included a picture so you could see how it won't go past where you see the sleeves. It doesn't bother me not being able to close it but it definitely wasn't what I had expected so keep it in  mind if you plan on ordering.<br />Also, if it helps anyone I ordered the XL and it fit nice and loosely how I expected a normal Large would :)"
4.0,"This hat was smaller than I originally expected and ended up having to order a hat from another seller. I did, however, give this one to my dad who thinks it was just the amount of hair on my head because it fit him better than it did on my head. I'm inclined to agree.<br /><br />That isn't to say it isn't a bad product, just smaller than I was hoping for."
4.0,"I received the mask today and love it, this  completes my Jedi/<br />Sith outfit. Thank you by the way this mask is a FIVE STAR but I never go higher than 4 stars"
4.0,I don‚Äôt think the square goes good if your heavy busted
4.0,Nice but large. Nice vintage look!
4.0,Would give 5 stars for water proof. But excellent show piece.
4.0,This is a comfortable and fun to wear dress
4.0,Runs a little short if wearing with leggings.
4.0,Although really cheaply made. Worth wearing a few times and throwing away.
4.0,These bags are super cute and the quality is amazing. Price is affordable. I love it!!
4.0,"These masks have very clunky adjuster toggle knobs on the straps. When I first saw them, I was pretty sure these are going to be crazy uncomfortable behind my ears. However, even without an extra strap behind my head or something, I don‚Äôt even notice the toggles!<br />The fabric is nice, and the masks are reasonably breathable. The adjuster toggles are actually very useful, too because they lock in place and the masks stay the size you want them to be.<br />Overall, I would recommend these."
4.0,Arrived a day late but no biggie. Amazon warned me of this the day of. Frames are a little thinner than I thought they'd be but seem to be higher quality. The lenses are very mirrored wich I like. After fixing the bent nose pad (arrived bent) they are pretty comfortable.
4.0,"Bought this for a winter Vegas trip. Was totally surprised and impressed. It's soft and the inside is like fleece lined. My chest is 38H and the dressed covered me for the most part. I ended up wearing something different, but will wear this in the future. I can get away with a black bra under and it's some time viable but it doesn't look tacky."
4.0,"There's 3 adjustment snaps on the collar, but I wish there were at least 4 because when I wear it snapped on the tightest button, it's too big/loose<br /><br />But they're good quality, and getting 4 for the price of 1 is always nice"
4.0,Not so curvy but look nice and adds color to your outfit
4.0,I loved these jeans but they were too big.  I wear a size 16 & these were extremely large.  I did love the softness of these jeans. I may try a size smaller.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 73.5‚Äù tall and fit, about 220 pounds. I ordered an XXXL and it fits great. Pretty decent quality for what it is."
4.0,Good watch and great for an alarm that isn't going to alert everyone.  Unfortunately my kiddo helped his big sister with dishes while I was out....it's not waterproof.
4.0,"Quality cheap glasses.  Great buy for the money and an excellent pair to wear when you worry that you might lose them or get them scratched.  I would buy again.  They broke after a while, but that was my fault."
4.0,I love this dress! I've had tons of compliments on it. Only complaint is that the color doesn't appear the same in person. It's a lot more of a bright color than pictured. I was hoping it would be darker teal.
4.0,Very comfortable. Well worth the buy.
4.0,Fits great cute cut and really like the tie to adjust waist.
4.0,It fits perfectly.  Is bright white as promised.  Pearl buttons are lovely. Requires steam ironing even if hung to dry.
4.0,I ordered a size up ( 11 instead of 10 ) and they fit just right. The sole is non-marking on my laminate floors. We will see how they hold up over time.
4.0,Nice shoe for wearing with jeans.
4.0,It's very light weight and it isnt necessarily a bad thing since it's summer at the moment. The tread can feel a little wonky on my skin but I still love this piece. I still recommend it if you want to use it as a cover up for swimming or something light to wear over clothing.
4.0,Nice the belt little short
4.0,"It fits okay. Not as fitting at the waist as I expected. Still really cute, and I'll be keeping this one."
4.0,The smaller faux pearls are nicer in my opinion.  They look more natural and delicate.  The large ones look like plastic balls glued onto the posts.  I like that these are smaller.  The posts are a good size and don't irritate my ears.
4.0,Plumes aren't quite as &#34;plumey&#34; irl.
4.0,"Very nice material, touch screen works fine, warmth is fine. But if they are to small none of it matters"
4.0,"Fits nice in the sleeves just a little too long. I wear it with leggings and it feels almost like a dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 115lbs and got a medium. Maybe I‚Äôll try small next time. Otherwise, very comfy."
4.0,"Love this dress! It‚Äôs a very nice fabric, comfortable and well made. I‚Äôm a picky buyer and expected such a cheap dress to be basic. This is much better than things I Get at gap or old navy for sure."
4.0,"Nice shirt. Very comfy and fits well. Only odd aspect, the colors are brighter within the shirt than outside. Or, put another way, the colors are more faded outside the shirt than in. Seems like I'm wearing it inside out."
4.0,Fits like the other I have ordered .  Color was a little off than what I expected but over all a good product
4.0,"This case is really cute, especially for the price. It's definitely not a protective case, but I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because within two hours of opening it, it started developing an air bubble. It has continued to get larger since yesterday which is a bummer."
4.0,My wife uses this on the boat and likes it
4.0,Ordered my normal size in tops and it fit as expected. The material gets wrinkled very easily.
4.0,"Dress was beautiful!  Be sure you realize there isn't much give to.dress, it does lace up in back where you can make small  adjustments.  The seller made sure I was aware of.this and even let me change my size after I ordered."
4.0,"Love the print, soft, and price is reasonable for the quality. I am tall and the sleeves are a little too short for me but on anyone else it would be perfect"
4.0,"Let me start first by saying that these are very pretty panties and the price for the quality of the panties is fantastic!  The material is great, the colors are perfect, and the hidden pockets are cool.  The only problem I experienced is that they run small.  I usually wear a L - XL in undies but ordered a 2XL just to be safe and they were still small.  Gave them 4 stars because they fit my size 10 / 12 daughter perfectly...but they are small even for her as she definitely does not normally wear a 2XL."
4.0,I really like these masks but the only thing is I didn‚Äôt really like that where are you taking it it makes a dent in your nose and it‚Äôs uncomfortable and you can‚Äôt really breathe in it which is good but it feels like you‚Äôre suffocating.
4.0,"I love the minions! I like the color of the shirt a lot - I don't see blue heather very often, especially with a graphic that I like. My only problem is the wording. If you go by the movie promo, it should say, &#34;BA-BA-BA BANANANA&#34;."
4.0,"A little smaller then I expected, but she still loved them"
4.0,"This is your basic henley in a neutral color, a wardrobe staple for many men.  Constructed from a thick broadcloth, similar to a lot of my polo shirts.  I'd still call it ""soft"" but it has a coarse weave and not much stretch to it.  Fit is relaxed, with a lot of room in the shoulders and the belly.  Sleeves are on the long side as well.  Attractive cut, looks good untucked."
4.0,"This set is very beautiful however you have to be careful with it bc the metal bends very easy, my first time putting in the earrings it bent behind my ear when I was trying to put the back on it. I have had no problems with the ring or necklace tho, I absolutely love this set and wear it all the time, just with the metal was a little stronger but for the price it's worth it"
4.0,The dress looked amazing! A little big but Gorgeous dress for a great price. I would order Large for this brand
4.0,Pretty summer dress. Drapes nicely. Will go down a size.
4.0,The outfit was nice and Breathable material<br />But the image was to dark
4.0,It took a while to get here but was worth the wait. It is really soft...thought it would be a course material. For the price point it was pretty good!
4.0,Sheds but keeps me very warm the most important feature
4.0,Fits well. Not quite as good of contrast in person as the photo but looks good.
4.0,"I ordered a M based on my regular t-shirt size, but now wish I had gone with a L: I'm 5&#34;7 and normally wear M-L. It skims my ankles, but it's really the waist I would prefer an inch or so farther down. The fabric is very thin, but not see through. All in all, a very comfy dress which you can dress up or down how you like. The green is a bit brighter than what I consider &#34;Army Green&#34; and more vivid than you would think from the picture. In a good way. I guess the 5% polyester content brings some shine to the expected general flatness of cotton. I would buy this again. Come to think of it, I wish I had this when I was pregnant: one size up and with the higher waist it already has, I bet it would be a super comfy mama dress."
4.0,"Its a coil item but its not warm enough, but who cares cause it freaking cool to wear and you look totally bad ass"
4.0,"My wife loves it. I would have given 5 stars but the necklace broke the day she got it. I returned it with no problem and bought her the same necklace again. Hopefully, it will not break."
4.0,The arms are to tight they won‚Äôt close all the way.
4.0,5'6 180lbs ordered  Sz L.  Perfect fit and not bad at all for price! fitted but not snug! pleased with this order.
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;,  127 lbs  and normally wear a medium. After reading the reviews that recommended ordering a size up, I ordered a large in this shirt. I got it today, and it's a little big. I should have  stuck with a medium.  Other than that, it looks great. Well worth the price."
4.0,"These leggings fit as expected and look great on. The material is a little more ""silky"" than expected, which is not exactly what I wanted, but the pattern/design is on point-- fun, but a little muted so it's not too over the top. Some reviews mentioned that they were thin and a little see-through, but I think it's the white lining that you can see when the material is stretched tight. Overall, I am happy with the purchase. They will look cute with a long black sweater and booties!"
4.0,The only thing I would advise is that if you have a little tummy pouch the elastic is very firm and can be a little uncomfortable.
4.0,Bought ad a Christmas present. They were a hit!
4.0,Very cute but not made for tragus piercings like it states. It's too short.
4.0,"I bought this training pants for my 6 years old son . I like the size , the material is easy to wash and very comfortable!"
4.0,This is a beautiful dress I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and about 230 pounds while in my last few weeks of pregnancy. Soft material but is definately a little long which I‚Äôm used to being a bigger short woman the bust fits nice I am a 40h and there is still some room for when my milk comes in which I‚Äôm thankful for. I ordered a size xxl the arms fit nicely the back isn‚Äôt too tight. Over all great dress but a little larger than most xxl dresses.
4.0,Nice dress but the pockets come out
4.0,"Very pretty necklace, very helpful seller as I didn't know to click on its a gift to customize and they helped me with that. The chain is very thin though and broke easily. Just be careful when wearing and you shouldn't have any problems with this beautiful necklace."
4.0,"I really needed a replacement for a pair of shoes that I have that use this same kind of system since the cinch piece was defective upon arrival when I ordered them. I had rigged up the shoes to be able to use them until I could find a way to replace them. When I found these, I couldn't pass up the chance to finally get them fixed. They came with a little instruction sheet which really isn't necessary as the process is pretty simple and practically brainless.<br /><br />I only ran into 2 issues, one of which had nothing to do with the product. That was simply that the original cording on my shoes was actually permanently attached to my shoes at the toes so I had to literally cut them off and I was not able to run the new cording through the front strap as it was sealed off with the old cording. When I finished setting up the shoes, I was so excited I could FINALLY wear them properly! My excitement was a little short-lived though when the end Clips did NOT remain on the ends of the cording. The cording slipped right out of them. And I have medical issues with my hands and I cannot pry those little snaps open again. So now I have ugly loose ends just flopping out yet again which is not what I wanted :( So now I am back to having to tuck them into the tops which is a real pain.<br /><br />At least now I have a reliable cinch to keep the cords from coming loose so at least that is a good thing. If you don't care about the end snap, this is a great pair of shoelaces! They are actually a lot stronger than I thought they would be, and are surprisingly stronger than the ones that came on my expensive shoes to start with. Pretty awesome overall I have to say!<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount but I am under NO obligation to write a review. The choice was purely my own and I received no compensation. I do not sugarcoat my opinions on anything. What you read above is my accurate report of this product."
4.0,"Just got this today. Haven't worn it yet BUT . . . I was amazed at how easy it was to put on (clasp) and it was super easy to remove some extra length on the band to make it fit my small wrist. The face of the clock is larger than I expected so I included a picture. Looks like decent enough quality. Was made in China, BTW.<br /><br />Update: OK, I wore it for the first time today. It felt heavier than I expected, but not in a bad way. After a few hours of wear on the first day, one of the four points where the leather band meets metal came out. My son shoved it back in to the hole and it seemed fine. It might be gluable if it comes out again."
4.0,"I really like this dress.  The pattern &#34;pops&#34; and the placement of the pattern at the waist helps define your mid-section.  The fabric is thin, so for me some shapewear will be in order.  Based on the provided sizing I bought a medium and it was slightly too large, especially in the waist.  I'm going to return it for and small and just hope it is not too tight on my hips.  I'm kind of right between the two sizes."
4.0,Very tight but that's how I like mine to fit. I purchased the xl because I'm in the process of losing weight and I didn't want them to be baggy. These are very tight which is great! They'll be perfect by the time cardigan season comes around. I like to wear these under my cardigans because other shirts make me too hot. I'm 5'6 240 lbs. the cover my butt but it's flat so no hump to go over but my belly is huge. Hope this helps someone.
4.0,"Work as planned, guild build quality. No problems at all."
4.0,"I bought these to watch TV in bed without straining my neck. I really did not expect these to work as well and as distortion free as they do. I love these.<br />Couple tips, they do shrink the TV screen a bit, not terribly, but noticeable.<br />also, the sight line goes stright across your body, if you have on heavy blankets or a puffy comforter, they may block a little bit of the bottom of the screen. Usually a little position adjustment will correct this without distorting your neck"
4.0,"These necklaces are super cute, but the quality is just okay. I got them for my mom and I. Despite the okay quality, we both love them and wear them all the time."
4.0,Much smaller than I thought.  Very light<br /><br />Edit: for the price it's really good product and its a matter of taste .. I would've given it 5 stars but it was my fault that I didn't check the size ..
4.0,"I ordered a 3T for my son (who normally wears a 2T) based on suggestions from previous reviews, and it fits him perfectly! the quality is terrific and he asks to wear his shirt as soon as it is washed from the last time he wore it!"
4.0,"Really cute sunglasses. They're lightweight, comfortable, and come with a nice case. They don't block the sun as well as say a pair with black lenses which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, but they still do block some, they're more for looks than sun protection."
4.0,Feel great. Look great. Wish you could adjust the wrist tightness tighter. Too big on wrist (for myself and husband)
4.0,"Better than most hooks on the market for thick table.  Wish the pads could be bigger for more grip when hooking a heavier purse, otherwise a very good product.."
4.0,"ordered these in med/large for my husband (5'9&#34; 165lb) to wear under shorts for a race.  Fit pretty well, stretchier than some skeleton ones I got for myself from redextend"
4.0,"I would give them 5 stars if the calves weren't so tight. I have average calves and all my other boots like these are not this right. Don't buy them if you have larger calves. Other than that, I love them!"
4.0,These earrings are nice and easy and secure to get on and off. The are a bit heavier and a bit larger than what I was used to so it took a few days for the soreness to go away. I keep them in all the time now. Great because I have sensitive ears. I think if I got another pait I would go with a pattern because they are pretty plain.
4.0,"My wife has been wanting a pair of polarized sunglasses for awhile now, so I was excited to find these. The lenses and polarization are nice, but not very dark. They feel flimsy, so not quite sure they're worth the $50+ they're listed for. They come with a nice storage case though. Overall they're ok, quality wise they're more along the lines of $20-$30 sunglasses."
4.0,I first bought a xl and it was too small. I returned it and got a 3x and it was still small in the top not much bigger then the xl but I like this dress.
4.0,"Good price, good quality, true fit.  I wear this daily but not outside in the winter.  Comfortable and warm, without being bulky."
4.0,Just a beautiful ring. More than picture-smaller than i pictured. Over all very pretty.
4.0,Super cute and fun to wear!
4.0,"Coat fits ok but the sleeves are tight at the forearms.  The leather seems to be kinda dull, no shine to it like leather has as a rule.  Almost looks like vinyl.  Perhaps a leather care product will resolve the issue.  Other than that, it's a nice coat."
4.0,Looks cute but somewhat short so the boob part just reaches my actual boobs. Makes my butt look good though even after baby
4.0,I'm a women's 10/12. I bought a XXL. It's tight through the shoulders and chest but still fits. I really like the style so I'm keeping it. I'd definitely recommend ignoring the size chart because an XL would have been my recommended size. Definitely go 1-2 sizes up if possible. It still may not fit a busty woman or someone with broad shoulders.
4.0,I purchased a 2xl and it was a bit tight for my 40DDD and NO im not pregnant just husky .. Lol... I love it otherwise and would maybe find a brand that has 3x or more stretch on the top.
4.0,Wood is beautiful and the earrings fit my 16g just fine. The earnings lay weird on my head and are hard to put on. I ended up working on them and now they look ok. I still love them but wish they laid well
4.0,The latch isn‚Äôt great.  Afraid to wear it.
4.0,"This is the first time I've ever used compression socks so I wasn't sure what to expect.  These socks keep my ankles from swelling.  They are more comfortable than I thought they would be but the foot area isn't so comfortable.  Overall, I like them."
4.0,This was a gift of last minute thinking and I got it the next day so things worked out great and they loved them!
4.0,Very Nice jacket for those cool nights. The jacket does tend to stick to your skin though on hot days.
4.0,"Pros, comfortable and light weight, con is its see through"
4.0,"From the photo, it looked like it would be a bunch of circles linked together, but I'm actually happy it's one piece! Great price and arrived within 3 days of ordering, even with the holidays."
4.0,I would give it a 5 but the post are somewhat delicate and have to be very careful putting them on and off. They are very comfortable and just the right size for stud earrings. I like how thy look and am very pleased with them.
4.0,I like the  design  the lite wait the colour the design nice
4.0,"Dont size up. I wish i would of gotten my regular size.. Most dresses run small but this one was pretty roomy. I use it for living doll and kawaii aesthetics. Its very pretty and doll like. Be sure to lightly steam straighten it. The material is ok for the price. Wrinkles easily though. The lace etc looks pretty too. Im satisfied but ill have to order it in my size next time, i sized up..didnt need to lol.  I wish the arm ribbons weren't there.. It kinda throws off the design but its workable and still cute. Worth it. Plus size friendly too. Bust and hip friendly as well."
4.0,Love the charm but the chain looks a little worn. The charm was worth the price to me tho.  Shipped fast
4.0,"Fits great, super cute and flattering. Ordered paisley XL and the pink is a very, very pale pink. Almost ivory. Still happy and may order another color."
4.0,Nice comfortable croakies. They became worn at a quicker rate than I would have expected.
4.0,"I bought this dress for a 20s theme party we are having. I bought a small, and am 5'2&#34; and about 115 pounds. The fit is fine, but it is short! I had to buy a slip to go underneath because the way it is cut diagonally and short in the back makes my but stick out. The neck fits a little funky too. It poofs out and doesn't fit tight. I will have to pin it to make it fit and look right. It is perfect for a 20's theme. For the price it is a good buy if you don't mind putting something on under it to make sure you are covered. It also arrived much earlier than the expected shipping timeline."
4.0,"It is a very cute shirt, and since I am short waist-ed the hem on the bottom sits on my hips very nicely. For anyone that is tall or has a long torso I would recommend going a size up unless a shorter shirt/long crop top is what you are looking for. The material is very soft and the color is a really pretty golden yellow.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there were a few spots of the design missing around the eyes."
4.0,"It's a bit tight around the head, but it looks nice as in the picture. Comfy fabric"
4.0,"good material and great design, a little on the small side.  Im an average size guy but was a little tight in the shoulder area"
4.0,These do have rip stop weave.  I did cut the leg on one of these and the tear did stop .  They fit fine.  The only issue I have with these is the Velcro on the small pocket on the front leg wears out quickly.  I installed a snap on this pocket flap and it works great.  Belt Loop fits my belts from 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inch width.  I do appreciate the expanded waist bands on the sides.  I will be ordering more of these. pants.
4.0,It looks more purple than blue. It is pretty.
4.0,"Loved the compression and is fairly comfortable if you have a bit of a stomach. However, due to my height weight ratio the pants run a tad long on me and don‚Äôt line up at the knees. Not too big of a deal, I just pull up extra material to compensate."
4.0,"Un bonito las mangas,"
4.0,Workout clothes
4.0,Fits nice but I'm curvy and not ready to show off just yet lol
4.0,The amount of product
4.0,Cute for out and  about
4.0,The stitching in the back is a little uncomfortable because you can feel it through your shirt. But it's a really cool hoodie.
4.0,This dress is very fitted! I thought it was more of a t shirt dress!
4.0,"Swim suit runs small buy a size larger than you normally purchase. The back of the bottom is not lined so as the fabric stretches it looks very thin almost see through, another reason to buy a size larger."
4.0,Theyre fine. Nothing special. Great for school.
4.0,"These run a little big. I ordered a size 2-3 and they were pretty big on my 2 and half-year old. They did serve the purpose and kept her hands dry and warm on our ski trip. Also, they were kind of hard to put on, especially separating her thumb but that might just be a toddler problem..."
4.0,Keychains are cute and feel sturdy but was disappointed the girl was gold. I see now the description says black and gold but all the pictures show rose gold. Considered returning but will keep.
4.0,"Got these for a costume last Halloween and have used them multiple times since. Was worried that they would be to big (I'm 5'5 with a small build) but they fit well!  Very natural looking, sturdy and stable. They are pretty comfortable and stayed put through a night of dancing. Expected a pretty sub par product due to the price and was pleasantly surprised. Really great quality for the cost and look pretty close to real."
4.0,Small for 2x..
4.0,A great example of casual elegance. Am well pleased including time from order to delivery!
4.0,"Looks great. Nice true to the picture color. Nice material. However I always purchase my Husband's shirts the same size. This one was well fitted in the arms, waist and chest but was a bit small at the neck line. I gave it to my brother and he loves it."
4.0,"My daughter has always wanted this watch because she is a big Doctor Who fan, but I always steered clear of buying it in the past because of some bad reviews I'd read. This Christmas I finally ordered it from Amazon. The watch is pretty much as is described on the site, the case is plastic but does look like medal, the chain is medal with a clip on the end.  There are flashing lights and the doctor's voice when you open it and press the side button.  The Doctor's voice sounds a little tinny, but it does sound like the tenth Doctor. It does seem to keep time, but you probably wouldn't want to carry it as a watch, it's thicker than most pocket watches.  Can't say how it would hold up in younger children's hands as my daughter is a teenager and just wanted it for her Doctor Who collection.  I'd recommend it for older children, teens and the adult collector who doesn't want to pay the much higher price for the silver plated one."
4.0,"I really like these flipflops. They fit just right, and are very comfortable. I especially like that they do not have any bumpy strap attachments, like another pair I purchased elsewhere, that might cause pain or blisters. They seem sturdy, as well, and I expect will last a long time. The only thing I do not like about them is how long they took to arrive; but that is due to my not paying attention to where they were coming from, which was Australia."
4.0,"This dress is awesome but runs big. The other seller selling this dress is more accurate. I would have ordered a Small if that was an option (I'm usually a medium). I ordered the other company's medium and it was great. If I hadn't have found them I would have kept this one and taken it in since it is such a good deal, and up it runs really long (I'm 5'6&#34; and needed 6&#34; heels). Neither company has sequin patterns that lined up though but it's so awesome I didn't care."
4.0,"Beautiful! Just as pictured  my only thing I would say is that it‚Äôs small. I have average sized wrists 7‚Äù and this thing is tight. I bought an extender for it so it‚Äôs fine but, yeah small."
4.0,"This is the best tights! Really controls your tummy!!! First time I bought lavente tights in Europe and it lasted 2 years. I was looking here in store and couldn‚Äôt find it and when I saw it on the amazon I was little hesitant to order it but I did order and I think I made best decision! It‚Äôs very difficult to put it on but I don‚Äôt mind it! Only thing is that I hand washed my tights first time and water was all black color. It has been done very poorly colored. I believe after few wash I‚Äôm not going to have same problem. And eventually it will go in net and washing machine:)<br />Just ordered another one. Only wish I have is to find exactly same tights in ivory/skin color.<br />I‚Äôm 5,5‚Äù and 180 pound. Ordered XL and fits great! Somehow on the package it says 4XL which scared üò± me but it looks great once I opened and try it on!"
4.0,Good quality and perfect fit. Definitely will buy other products from them
4.0,"Save battery! 100% guaranteed.  Looks, you bet, the style is modern and can be worn to formal and semi formal attire."
4.0,"I carry this for a &#34;ditty bag&#34; when backpacking. I like the little window so I could see whats inside.<br /><br />However, I half filled this with water to see if its waterproof. It is not waterproof, & leaked within 15 minutes. So if wwaterproof is what you need, this isn&#34;t the bag for you.<br /><br />Maybe seam sealing would work? I don't know & haven't tried that."
4.0,My son loved it the only complaint is that it is to large and falls down with the slightest move. I fixed the issue by temporarily by adding a Velcro adjuster to the inside until I get around to adding elastic or draw string to the inside
4.0,Love this top! Fits great and is comfy.
4.0,Great bag! So much room. It's what I expected in size but the material is harder. Its cloth but with a layer of plastic material. I would have preferred just cloth. I don't remember if the description said it was plastic material but it definitely is not cloth.
4.0,Get one size bigger!
4.0,Took this on vacation. Went to the tropics and material a little too warm for that.
4.0,I love the way this looks !!! So cute !!!
4.0,"I have not used them as of yet, but did try them on and they do seem to fit the bill. I have a lot of clogs that I feel these will be  helpful for as I don't wear socks with the clogs. These will prevent my toes smooshing up against the inside of the clog toes."
4.0,I wanted a comfy fitted tee and these are it. Other reviews said they run small. I usually wear a small and ordered mediums. Fit great. Soft fabric. Only thing I didn't care for is they are longer than I would normally wear. I still liked them enough to order 4 more in different colors!
4.0,I liked the bracelet but I find the bracelet very heavy.  The design is good and I will keep it or pass it on as a gift to someone.  It is beautifaul and well made.
4.0,Were perfect for my 2 year old. And the bag they fit in was just right for him to carry on his back to Monster Jam!
4.0,JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDER
4.0,I like it. It's nice. The leather is ok but not super high quality.  I'm not sure I would pay $25 for it again. $19.95 at the most.
4.0,I like the material and the quality. But was too small. I recommend getting a size or two higher.
4.0,"One of my last discovers, Tourtered Soul is a fantastic band for those who like Iced Earth's past. Great price and a very fast service. Thanks."
4.0,Seem very nice. They are a gift so not sure if they like them yet.
4.0,They will work for what I need.
4.0,Great summer dress for all occasions
4.0,Fast shipping. Excellent quality.
4.0,It is somewhat small but it works perfectly for my needs.  It is a much more yellow gold than pictured.
4.0,So far good quality and very cute :) &lt;3
4.0,"I'm giving them 4 stars because they are super cute, but as I expected they are teeny tiny.  I normally where a size medium and these barely fit my size 4 daughter."
4.0,"Great Christmas present for a 14 year old boy. This made him extremely happy and the music quality was surprisingly good. It was a little difficult to figure out how to charge it and that took a while,  but overall I would recommend this."
4.0,"I love the mirror effect it has but it's too wide (for me personally). It seems durable and it comes with nice case. If you don't have an issue with it being extra wide, you will most certainly enjoy these guys."
4.0,"Say, it was swell!!"
4.0,"I love all Vera bags!  For me it is all about the organization though sometimes the patterns leave me shaking my head.  With that being said though this pattern is by far my favorite! (I usually go for the solid colors but this one spoke to me!)  I LOVE, it!  I cannot even express to you how much this little bag can hold.  I commute, so not only do I lug around a laptop, notebooks, folders etc.,. (I carry all that in a Campus Tech Backpack, same pattern) but I also need to carry around my every day things and my Kindle, with it's charger.  This little bag holds,not only my Kindle, but day planner, full size wallet, makeup bag,and more!!  I managed to get mine on a great sale, but honestly would pay full price.  The longer strap makes it perfect for crossbody and the smaller strap makes a convenient grab when you are dashing out of the house or car!  All in all I would recommend this bag in whatever pattern you choose. (In the pictures shown please bear in mind that I do not carry the Kindle and the purple pouch,all the time, so bag won't be quite as full as it is shown.  Also the empty pocket is where I keep my phone, but I was using that to take the pictures. LOL) I did take away a star for a couple small reasons; 1) I noticed a bit of wear on either side where the straps attach, and I have had the bag only 5 months (was purchased new.).and 2) I wish the &#34;Vera Bradley&#34; tag sewn on the front flap was a bit more secure. I would hate to have it fall off. I did not take away any points for the super strong magnet that closes the front flap, like I have seen mentioned in some other reviews.  I actually am very pleased that is closes securely and if you are just mindful of it when you open it there should be no issues."
4.0,I got it for my best friend she love the material but it's a little snug around her neck .
4.0,A bit itchy and started to fall apart after 2 Hawaiian days at the elementary school :(
4.0,"Nice fitting, comfortable and very fashionable shoe.  Got them in Red  size 7."
4.0,"Very cute dress. Unlined, so I wear a slip underneath it. I don't understand the red belt, so I switched that out for a black one. But the red belt is nice, I've worn it with other outfits."
4.0,Runs a little small if you plan to wear with leggings.
4.0,Suitable for everyday.
4.0,I like the case<br /><br />Thank you
4.0,"Very  nice  for the  money,  top was slightly  small,  but I have  38D girls,,"
4.0,I love the details of the flip flops.  Recommend this bracelet.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3d0185bf81d5145b86c30fa0a6b03458]] These are very soft and very comfortable to sleep in, they feel almost like a very comfortable set of scrubs. I cant repeat enough how comfortable to sleep in they are, I didn‚Äôt sweat in them I was warm. They are very loose fitting, so depending on how you prefer to have your PJ‚Äôs fit you might want to consider a size down, especially if you are like me in-between sizes. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù about 135 and got a medium, I had to double check the size when I put them on they are very loose fitting. (see the video). Otherwise, these are perfect fall/winter pj‚Äôs. I hope my review was helpful to you."
4.0,"My brother was so grateful I gave this jacket for his bday! Everything in it, he founded comfortable and well fit!"
4.0,I get so many compliments when I whip it out! It‚Äôs the right amount of tough glamour! Love the look! Although don‚Äôt over stuff it...once the zipper gets off track it‚Äôs a pain and never really goes back!!
4.0,"What I expected, lightweight, roomy, comfy tank top"
4.0,"It's a very nice earring :) Fits really good and people notice it a lot which I like. If you like different, this is for you!!"
4.0,Love this cute design of a dress for little girls. The different colors and flowers look so cute and coordinate with a variety of leggings underneath.
4.0,Nice works good
4.0,"Worked well as a stage prop for our recent production, as the murder weapon for Leon Trotsky, LOL. My only wish is that the axe could have been worn either direction, but it was only finished on one side. Otherwise it fit well and stayed in place."
4.0,Nice color structure
4.0,The balls will screw off and fall off easily if you play with it
4.0,"So far, I'm enjoying my new wallet.  I do wish it was SLIGHTLY wider (a millimeter or two would suffice) as it's difficult to get cards out when loaded up with 6 or so... hopefully that changes with time as it breaks in.  Also, the cut/melted edges of the binding are very sharp--a few seconds with a file or a piece of sandpaper would have shown a little more care and pride in the construction but it wasn't anything I couldn't fix myself.<br /><br />I have concerns about the longevity of the elastic strap that holds your cash--seems fine now but will it withstand several years of use?  Only time will tell...The rest of the wallet is bombproof--Very heavy duty materials!<br /><br />Overall, it's a great minimalist wallet and I hope that it provides years of service!"
4.0,"It is cute, but I think this style looks better in the double wrap vs. single.  Also it is rather difficult to open and close.  But it is a keeper!"
4.0,"Great product, as described.  Took much longer to deliver that my other pair ordered on the same day."
4.0,"Ordered this for DH. I used Amazon's ring sizing chart, but the ring had to be returned 2 times to get the right size. This ring ran small so I would order one size bigger. Titanium Kay provided great service and was quick with shipping the exchanged rings. I paid for shipping only one way.  So far the ring has held up nicely."
4.0,"So comfortable!  I use them for sleep and lounge wear.  The white fabric is a bit sheer, so a bit too revealing for going out in public. I also got in black, and those are opaque and fine for outdoor wear.  But for some reason the black doesn‚Äôt feel as soft and silky as the white. They did soften up after first washing though."
4.0,The case was awesome for the first month I was using it and then the plastic piece in the front started to crack. It was a cool case but I am not able to use it anymore.
4.0,Shirts are good quality and comfortable.<br />I got a 2xl and it was to big.  I do recommend ordering one size smaller than you normally wear.<br />I do recommend but be aware of the size chart.
4.0,"This is a nice quality shirt and nice printing but I was not a huge fan of the cut of the shirt. This is a snug fitting s*** and the cut didn't look great on me but I think it is fair to say it was me and not the shirt. I have gotten a few shirts for the seller and been thrilled. This is not the shirt for those with a little chub. the fit is just not flattering.<br /><br />I was given the opportunity to purchase this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have no relationship or affiliation with the seller. All of my reviews reflect my honest opinion! Please, feel free to ask any questions in the comment section and I will try to respond. Have a great day and happy shopping. :)"
4.0,This is a cute shirt. Nice and light. But the sleeves are long you definitely need to roll them a few times to have a normal tee-shirt length sleeve. These are true to size!!
4.0,"Well-made and attractive, but a little big. I wear 7.5 and that's what I bought, but with regular socks they're a little too big. Probably would be fine if I were wearing thick socks or two pairs, so if you're in a cold area where you have to double down on your foot protection, get them in your regular size. The &#34;leather&#34; material feels pretty fake, but they look good and seem sturdy enough so it's only a minor gripe."
4.0,"Brilliant LED shoe although I ordered White and black arrived, sent back and tried 3 more times to receive BLACK every time, my daughter refused to wear &#34;Black Boy&#34; color so I gave up.  Basically if you want Black, fantastic they are amazing LED shoes and an amazing price."
4.0,Great watch! Looks good and feels durable for the price
4.0,love these glasses but over time they became loose at the nose piece but they were only 10 dollars so i can not complain<br />the polarization works great as i drive to school because it blocks out all the glares in sight
4.0,"This is a very attractive watch.  In my case, the band adjustment clamp was VERY stiff, but it came with a screwdriver to make adjustment possible out of the box.  Please be aware that mine came with the stem pushed in which means the battery was in use before I received it.  I have no idea how long the battery may last, but it seems happy right now.  I like this watch, and will buy another as a dress watch if I manage to break it."
4.0,Nice for man
4.0,A E
4.0,"I typically wear a large or extra large, depending on the top. This shirt, however, runs very small. I ordered an extra large and it was about two sizes too small. I am 5'3&#34;, 38DD, so I probably should have ordered up. It didn't look like I needed to, based on the size chart. I returned it but it's a cute top."
4.0,"This is a very comfortable light weight dress. The color is more washed out than I expected from the picture so it is more of a light orange-red. I don't know that I would wear this dress out and about, but it is great for wearing around the house on a weekend to lounge in. It is also very long on me. I am 5'5&#34; and parts of it touch the floor. So it is somewhat longer than it appears in the picture. While it fits pretty well, I think I could have gotten away with a 1x or a large because it is so loose fitting everywhere. I ordered a 2xl because usually if you order from a company that ships from Asia the clothes will be tailored to fit smaller people, so I followed the sizing chart provided by the company for U.S. sizes, not the standard Amazon chart, but the sizing was still off.  Nonetheless, I really like it, it's pretty and I hope to wear it may times."
4.0,"Good value; good fit.  I wore them to Zumba with a long shirt, and they are fine.  Horizontal stripe can make one's thighs look wider, but I didn't care.  I appreciate the print."
4.0,The ring was just a pictured.
4.0,The dress is true to its picture<br />I have it in green and the maroon.<br />I like the slits in the side because it give it more shape
4.0,This shirt is cute on and I love the colors! Great fit! Just not sure how it will wash up.
4.0,Very good for this price. My son is happy. Fits well.
4.0,"Perfect, this of what I wanted it!"
4.0,"Super soft but very off-target sizing. The arms/legs are long, but the torso sizing runs at least a size small."
4.0,I use these when running and they help keep the sweat out of my eyes. The white are of a thicker material than the black I had previously purchased though.
4.0,very pretty and very sturdy - stone is not loose at all.  They are a little bigger than I thought they would be but I love them.  I am wearing them right now!
4.0,So far they haven't broken or fallen apart.  I thought I was going to get a white pair as it shows in the photo but instead I got two green pairs.
4.0,Stretchy cotton
4.0,I was hoping the lenses were darker. But they are OK.
4.0,"I like the brown and green paisley. The dress fits tight across the breast area and the sleeves are sized for someone with slender arms, waist down it's stretchy and flowy. I purched a XL, I'm ""5'1"" and the dress is a little long, but cute and it's not see through."
4.0,Fits fine. Love the colors. For some reason I thought the shorts came with but I should have read the description better.
4.0,"The material is a bit heavier than I expected, so it's questionable for summer, but definitely a great fall piece!"
4.0,My daughter only needed these for a week for a camp performance. They did the job and she liked but I don‚Äôt think they would last much longer than a couple of weeks. They also run one size small so size up.
4.0,kinda cheap feeling but still love them wear them a lot look cute to!
4.0,Love the heathered color and soft fabric.  The materials is a bit lighter than expected--slightly see through in the light.  Sizing might run a little larger than I thought but I much rather have it too large than small.  I ordered a small for my teenager.  I'm actually planning to order one for myself too!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but I should‚Äôve ordered a size up! I am 190 and ordered a large (ordered large in a deferent dress and fit great) but this dress is a little different and too tight on the belly!"
4.0,I found the mask to be made well from a thickness and comfortable fit stand point. My issue was with the tinted plexiglass. It was very blurry with a lot of scratches so I could hardly see through it. So actually wearing it and trying to walk around was almost impossible which goes against what it is . . . which is a costume mask. Maybe it was supposed to be from the island of misfit toys . . . the mask you can‚Äôt see through.
4.0,"I am revising my review after receiving very good customer service from this company, and their interest in improving their product.  While I had issues with the fit.  I believe the issue will be fixed for future customers.<br />Original Review: a good toe sock is made from thin material.  These end up being a bit much between the toes, and the pinky toe is way to big."
4.0,"This was actually one of my better purchases this year. My five year-old was swept away in the Transformers hysteria earlier this year and insisted on a revamping of his school gear to reflect his new status of a Kindergartner. I first saw a picture of the watch as I was browsing on the ToysRUs site and of course, that prompted me to venture over to Amazon to take advantage of Prime shipping.<br /><br />Down to the important stuff.<br />1. The watch arrived as depicted. It is completely functional as a digital watch and the actual Optimus prime figure detaches from the watch band to be played with as an action figure of sorts by a child.<br />2. It's actually pretty sturdy. My five year-old is amazingly reckless with his toys and this watch (band and Optimus) is still intact and working.<br />3. I believe the arms can actually only be moved up and down. My son was disappointed by this as I think one of the pictures he saw (not sure of the site) depicted the arms capable of being pulled out (think &#34;T-shaped&#34;).<br />3. What you see is what you get. There are no bells and whistles here. The design is pretty basic and reminds me more of a retro toy from the early eighties. It's definitely not sophisticated, but the price reflects this. For a gift for a small child just learning to tell time, it is definitely appropriate."
4.0,Bien me gusto
4.0,Really nice scarf. Not overly thick so great for Florida winters üòÅ
4.0,"The shoulders are much boxier than they seem in the picture, complete with pads"
4.0,"Definately smaller than a medium, so the waist is tight, but the quality fits the price paid, and it's cute."
4.0,Perfect. Just got home & tried this on...it's exactly what I wanted. I wear a US size 14/16...the XXL fits perfectly.
4.0,"Feels like butter on my skin!  Wish it was a bit larger, but I love it!"
4.0,"feels like a quality product, good looking, after washing got loose a bit though"
4.0,"They arrived sooner than expected. Was a little surprised when I opened the package as I had ordered a medium, but arrived XS. The thermals are tight, and after moving around a little they slip down."
4.0,"It fits exactly as I thought it would, very comfortable."
4.0,"Very soft, not clingy at all.<br />Detuct one star, because of the awful fabric smell, what goes away after the first wash.<br />Would buy again in a different color."
4.0,"Army issue, brand new.  All the pockets are the same size except one small bonus pocket on the outside.  Roomy enough IMO for a nice little portable trauma kit or whatever else you want to organize.  The top third has a shroud that fits over the middle section and part of the lower section, there is no zipper there at the bottom, only the latches that hold it together.  The outside portion has rubberized backing to the nylon material on the inside surfaces to give it the old school army water resistance but its certainly not water proof.  Its just like the old Army Alice Packs in material and waterproofing.  You could leave it out in a rain only if the latches are tight, the shroud is pulled down and it is sitting up like shown in the pics, otherwise it would get wet if it was laying over on its side."
4.0,"Don't even waste your time ordering this, it is so flimsy that the tools they gave with it just got bent.. I tried to take out a link to adjust the chain and the pin that is supposed to hold the links together just split in the middle. so its basically useless now. I returned it the same day..<br /><br />UPDATE:- After I wrote the above review and had returned the product, customer support contacted me and apologized for the product that might have been a one off scenario where the quality was bad. They told they would be replacing the band. I will update the review once I get the new product. Until then I really love the way they responded."
4.0,Size runs a little small. Otherwise comfortable. Great for a Christmas surprise.
4.0,I love it the only thing is the tag was a little scratchy so I had to cut it out
4.0,"I got this hoping to have a flexible belt with a friction closure for comfort. It really is too wide. Closure works okay, but the width of the belt and stiffness of the webbing make it tough to use."
4.0,"Nice material, fits well, good length teenage daughter really likes them. Needed minor alterations at the waist."
4.0,"It doesn't fluff out like the picture shows at the bottom, so I bought a blue tutu to go under it, and it worked!"
4.0,"I think these earrings are so pretty and interesting, and I get positive comments every time I wear them. They do bother my ears though, so i can only wear them for a few hours without issue."
4.0,Great quality great price. I believe this band will wear well over time. Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,I've already worn this multiple times.  It's pretty great.  The only thing I don't like about it is I wouldn't say it was a Pillbox Hat.  I was hoping the flower would come off of my head a little but it is completely flush with the band.
4.0,To small for me. If it came in a larger size this would be helpful. Beautiful design.
4.0,"I had so many people give me compliments on the dress. The only thing I had a problem with was the length. I'm petite and the back of the dress ended at my ankles. If this came in petite, I would have easily given the final star."
4.0,"Cute little hat, would recommend you purchase down a size or two for the size you want.  I purchased a hat meant to fit a 3 month old, but it probably wont fit until she is about 6-8 months."
4.0,"First, I'm happy to finally have found an xs jean skirt on Amazon. That wasn't easy. For reference I'm:<br />5'2""<br />108lbs<br />Waist 24<br />Hips 35<br />This skirt (in white) fit awesome! The material isn't thick jean material which I actually like because it gives you space to breathe and it's comfortable. It's not too long or short on me either, and I can dress it up sexy or down casual. Also, it's not see through. The only reason I have it 4 stars is because the lower part of the back of the skirt could be tighter. I don't need that much room for my stride when I'm walking in a skirt."
4.0,"Well, it fits mostly how I expected it too, but I bought larger than American sizing. It's a little more snug in the buttocks area, where as the bust area is a little more liberal with fabric, but it still fits pretty good for buying it on line.  I have worn this suit now a few times and I get fun compliments on it's uniqueness. The pattern and the sewing all line up."
4.0,Wore these once for tennis.  Snug but ok.  I have not washed them so I will not make the mistake I made with the MOJO.  I may never wash them!
4.0,"I gave this to my husband for Valentine's day since he did not want to carry a bulky wallet anymore. The money clip is nice, not as strong as magnet as I was expecting but good enough, we will see what happens with use.  I will update if it deteriorates or loses strength. The slots for cards are very tight but that can be expected with most new wallets and hopefully will loosen up just a little bit with time. The case it came with was very nice so it is perfect if you want it as a gift, all I needed to add to it was a red ribbon and a tag on it and it was good to go. Overall it was a good buy, I hope the quality remains the same with use but the company gives lifetime warranty so that gave me the confidence to buy and I decided to give them a chance. I would recommend."
4.0,Color was off looks more green than black
4.0,"Let me preface this by saying, these are great shorts for littles girls. My 6 y/o LOVES them and I have ordered a previous set that she absolutely adores. They are stretchy, comfortable, breathable, fun, doesn't pill or shrink, and the colors remain vibrant even after a couple of washes. They also fit exactly as expected. Hence why I ordered a second set, because they are great quality for what my active 6 y/o daughter loves to do.<br /><br />My ONLY gripe, I ordered the set with 5 shorts and only received 4 shorts, the 4 hair ties, and the 1 very fun and sparkly scrunchie (her fave accessory, btw).<br /><br />Aside from that, they're fantastic and my daughter LOVES the fun designs and their flexibility for her creative and active learning. üëçüèªüòä"
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 185 lbs. I ordered a 3xl in the Tanaka cosplay (not the cropped one) they sent the correct sized shirt but sent the wrong size shorts in a 2xl. However, it still fit me so I‚Äôm keeping it. I‚Äôd say that the 3xl was too big for me but it‚Äôs okay I like for the shirt to be oversized. The shorts are much stretchier than some other haikyuu cosplays I‚Äôve tried. BUT thick thighed ppl please be aware that there is a net inside the shorts that‚Äôs a little tighter than the outside layer so you may need to size up accordingly.<br />I really like the details on this cosplay and for $17, you can‚Äôt beat it."
4.0,"This is wonderful material, and to be honest nothing wrong with it. But it is not made for women with curves or big boobs. If your thin with no boobs this dress is gorgeous!"
4.0,Shipping was accurate and quick. The selection was complicated as it was difficult to tell the size. Adding a constant - like comparing to a quarter or a dime - would help those of us who have difficulty imaging scale/size. The product quality is only moderately good. I'm concerned about how they will wear over time.
4.0,Super cute and fit perfect. Some fading in color noted.
4.0,"A nice and strong umbrella, but it's a shame that it's too long when folded"
4.0,"Delivery was timely, rocks as expected and pictured. I purchased 2 packs. The only negative was that one of the packs was completely unraveled so the rocks from that pack were all over the box, which made for quite a bit of dust and a couple of them were chipped. The other package was sealed very well."
4.0,"It's really pretty! Very easy to use, I was hoping for it to be a little big bigger and thicker but overall it's nice (:"
4.0,wow the lens is big! but it will work great for the summer sun coming soon
4.0,It looks like a blazer but the material is so light that It feels more like a blouse. I think it is a little to expensive for the kind of material.
4.0,"They are not soft, need to wash before wear. I‚Äôm not sure if I just have a weird body type‚Ä¶.but these did not run big. I do have a bigger tummy and have a Pluto booty. So not sure if that is why. I ordered a medium and fit was perfect. No belly roll over and no booty hanging out."
4.0,"This vest is soft with vibrant color and fit well; I am 5 feet four inches tall and weigh around 120.  I ordered the medium and even though I am of the top heavy body type, thinner through the leg and heavier through the gut and arms, this vest in a medium fit perfectly.  I didn't want it to be loose.  It fits rather snug but not at all tight.  Length hits right at the hip, so it's not too short through the torso area. Overall the vest appears to be high quality and looks more expensive than it is. The arm holes fit well to create a good tailored look with shirts and eliminate bulk under a blazer. Pullover v-neck sweater vests like this are difficult to find at this price!<br /><br />I am leery about the fabric and wonder whether it will hold up nicely.  While it is sufficiently dense and soft at the new stage, I suspect it will pill after some wear.  Received loads of compliments at work and the red offset a pale yellow shirt like nobody's business. The red is true and deep. Looked fabulous.  I am going to purchase another in navy, perhaps another in dark grey.  These are great 3 seasonal sweater vests and I will get loads of use out of this, so long as  the fabric holds up.  I will hand wash per the instructions and update the review with durability factors."
4.0,Cute necklace! Chain is a little on the cheaper side but it‚Äôs great for the price of such a cute necklace
4.0,"I haven't actually wore it yet, but I tried it on and it fit great! although I wish the top had a strap but I knew when buying it it didn't have one. Also it doesn't have great support but again it fit great!!"
4.0,"It's a bit big, a little too stiff for my liking and isn't white. It's a little bit off white (unlike the picture). It is really cute and I've already been complimented on it."
4.0,Fit great. My daughter likes them.
4.0,"Nice earrings, but a little bigger then I thought"
4.0,The dress looks better on line than in reality.
4.0,I was Lucy Wilde for Halloween and these were perfect!
4.0,"i actually really like this earcuff. it is really easy to lose though. also dont leave it floating around it your purse bc it WILL get smashed and you wWONT be able to fix it :/ guess thats my fault though. otherwise, BEAUTIFUL"
4.0,Had to close the part of the crab connecting it to the chain; it kept coming off.  The actual crab is cute.  The chain is not great (looks cheap) so I swapped it for another that I have.
4.0,These are a bit tight at the top.<br />One pair developed a hole immediately.<br />But they feel great if you are traveling or just walk a lot highly recommended.
4.0,cute.irritated my ear a bit but my ear is sensitive
4.0,"Our three year old is OBSESSED with spidey and his amazing friends‚Ä¶and she has been begging me to be ghost spider for Halloween this year. She costume came in today and she immediately put it on. WE LOVE it. The quality is good for the cost. It‚Äôs not too sheer and the material is well sewn together. The arms are a little long for her, but she wears closer to a 2-3t and this is closer to 3-4. The fingers are VERY thin‚Ä¶she has skinny hands and had a little bit of a struggle getting them on. All in all, though, this is a great purchase! I just hope we can get her out of it for bath time."
4.0,Very cute - too big for a girl but perfect for an older girl or small to standard woman‚Äôs wrist
4.0,"This product arrived on time, early in fact and was very pleased with how it worked. I Would order this again."
4.0,The most comfortable pair of shorts I have had in a long time.  Look great also.  Leg length is a little longer which is great for a man in his 80s.
4.0,It is pretty. However it is rather thick but not to heavy. They feel like acrylic.
4.0,They are not thick enough to cover my tattoos. Sad about it because yellow is my favorite color! I hope my lavender coming will have more coverage
4.0,This pack of 3 is perfect for my son.<br />The fabric is thick enough to warm him without suffocating him. It is also super soft and stretchy. The Vneck is usefull as you can wear it as a 1 layer.<br />The only thing is that it is short and wide. The mold of these shirts is weird. But as a first layer is not a problem. I would not use it as a regular t shirt.<br />They wash pretty good.<br />Overall is a useful/great  pack for cooler temps.
4.0,My son took mine so I have ordered another one. Best belt I have ever owned.
4.0,Wont fit medium frame glasses. Nice case but kinda on the small side.
4.0,"I am a camp counselor and I purchased these hoping they would be a good alternative to name brand shoes, (Tivas or Chacos) although the shoes are extremely comfortable I recommend leaving them loose on your feet. I have wore them for about a week now and I really like how they fit and they are very comfortable during the work day, but I have found myself getting many blisters on my toes and feet in the locations the bands are. (This is why both of my big toes and bandaged) besides that, the shoes really are great. I am attempting to wear them differently today, and I hope this helps anyone planning on purchasing these shoes"
4.0,"Cute, good quality hoodie.  Very soft and comfortable.  Looks great with yoga pants or jeans."
4.0,"But it's a TINY bit too small if you plan on shoving a bunch of gift cards or credit cards into it. If this is for loose cash and change, you'll be fine, but if you want to put your plastic or gift cards into it, it's a tight squeeze.<br /><br />The measurements are correct, but once you put a few things in there, it's smaller than you anticipated."
4.0,Great quality and good fit. Great deal for this item. Will buy in other colors.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 160lbs and bought a size large. Let me tell you, these leggings are more like spanx! They suck everything in. Zero jiggle ! Lol the high waist is just high enough to cover my mom pooch and the pockets are deeeeep. I wish I bought 2 or 3 more pairs at the promo price. Only down side is that they don‚Äôt cover my ankle which is important to me."
4.0,"Get lots of compliments. Even from men!! I do wish it had some natural fiber in the fabric, though."
4.0,Comfortable but a little big.
4.0,"The ones are a darker amber than what is in the picture. But the material seems strong. And the back has the  .925 sterling silver stamp.  I think the most important thing is that they are lightweight so  I don't always notice that I am wearing them. Also, the amber goes well with my skin color so I can wear them with anything. These are one of my go-to everyday earrings."
4.0,Quality great.. color is pale... I thought it was a deeper jade color
4.0,I think the title says it all. I am currently between a small and medium in activewear so I opted for the medium. It ran a bit big so should‚Äôve gotten small. The style was cute however the fabric was a bit thin to wear just any undergarments underneath. Also the mocha color was more like a light tan.
4.0,"I got a similar headband from this same company in turquoise and thought it was lovely, so I ended up ordering this black one for a more sedate but still beautiful option.  I like how there are various styles of embellishments in a few neutral colors for added ""texture.""  It makes the headband more visually interesting than beading done in one color in my opinion, but is not done over the top, so it still versatile in what you can wear it with.  The quality is good with all the decorative beading and rhinestones sewn on rather than added as an appliqu√©.  I was also pleased to discover (on the turquoise but this one has it too) that the actual headband used is metal, which I prefer because it's more sturdy so it stays in place better and more durable so it should not break easily.<br /><br />Because it is a handcrafted piece, it does have a slight Etsy feel to it, like you can see some of the seams at the bottom where it was hand sewed closed.  This might concern people who want ""perfect"" items, but I think it gives it a little more charm and it does not show anyway.  The inside of the fabric has a contrasting white fabric that is cute, but I do wish a darker, more matching color was chosen because I can see a little on the bottom where it is sewn together.  That part goes behind my ear so it probably would not be that noticeable but I do have concerns that some of the white might show depending on how I wear my hair or if the fabric shifts - my hair is black so bright white would definitely not blend in.<br /><br />For the price it is being sold for, I think this handcrafted, metal headband with sewn on beading is a steal.  You could maybe find something cheaper at an accessory store but with lesser quality, or you might see something similar at a boutique or department store, but I am sure that price would be far higher.  If the contrasting fabric was a darker color, this would have been a 5 for me all the way, but I still recommend it as is - it is a beautiful, fun hair accessory that I think anyone who might be interested in the turban trend would enjoy.<br /><br />THE TRIBAL CHIC Hair Accessories -Embellished Beaded Black Satin Turban for Girls/Women"
4.0,should have measured more closely. It was much too large for me and I gave it to my daughter-teacher who thinks it'll be great for carrying books.
4.0,Good shoe goddaughter loved it
4.0,"Arrived within 3 days...the fit was perfect.the size chart I feel was accurate..the fabric is light weight and see thru, but a tank top underneath is perfect. I would defianley buy again."
4.0,Nice material. Had extra in front as this style tends to be skimpy there. I like it a lot but have only swam in them once since purchase. I never give 5 stars unless it blows my mind.
4.0,Very difficult to put in. You need several hands and pliers
4.0,"I love the colors!<br /><br />It is a bit sheer for me - may need to wear with a cammi.<br /><br />If you are large-chested, go up a size."
4.0,Very well made fits perfectly and very comfortable
4.0,Liked the smaller size. Did not stay in place very well
4.0,"The only issue I have with these workout hoodies are the seams that go along the front. other than that, the item looks great."
4.0,Bello y bueno
4.0,Not too fond of the material.
4.0,absolutely adorable..I love it!
4.0,"The only issue I have with the brown belt is that it is VERY DARK brown, and could pass as a black belt!<br />However the quality of the product is very good and sturdy and fits properly."
4.0,"I love this poncho but it arrived with 2 small holes in it, next to each other on the front near a fold. We patched it with a vinyl patch kit."
4.0,I really like this pullover. It is really soft and comfortable. It‚Äôs perfect for the fall weather. I would recommend you buy it in your actual size. I went up 1 size and it‚Äôs loose but looks good.
4.0,"Tama√±o ideal, bien elaborado"
4.0,"I was looking for sling bag that is small but holds essential things, and I ordered bags and returned twice.  They weren‚Äôt quite right, either too big to be sling bag or too small to put things...  So, my dilemma was size or practical?  This bag is little smaller than I would like, and that is why I gave 4 stars, but still the best sling bag I found in Amazon, and the size on description was accurate.  The design is slick, the fabric is very good, and the price is exceptional!  I would order another one if they have gray in the same design!"
4.0,"I've ordered O2 eyewear in the past and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of their sunglasses. Affordable and stylish. I was a little thrown off when these glasses came because the lenses were described as clear, however they are more of a mirrored silver finish. Which seems to be very trendy right now. I wasn't too thrilled by this, but the glasses ended up being great. I wore them on a vacation to FL and they protected my eyes the whole time. Overall happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I wear a 7 1/2 hat and the Large fit me just about the same, maybe slightly (SLIGHTLY) tighter.  The hat looks exactly as depicted. It also does fold to fit inside of my pocket. I put my wallet in my back right and this hat in my back left and I'm good to go.<br /><br />Also, make sure you understand that this is a military cadet style hat. The bill is not long like a baseball cap.  These kind of hats weren't made to look extremely cool, but rather so you could have a hat that you can store in your pocket while you travel. That being said, this does look pretty good for what it is. I like the checkered look over the plain black, though I wish the OR logo wasn't there."
4.0,But was too small for the purpose I needed it for.
4.0,"I like the design and feel of these glasses. And I like the variable darkness of the lenses. There is a tiny fault on the frame that is obviously manufacturing and I wonder that Guess would let it get out of the factory. Still, it was a pretty nice set of glasses for the price."
4.0,It makes a nice gift and you can't beat the price fantastic
4.0,"I ordered the hoodie for my daughter for Christmas, I ordered a size up just in case and the hoodie was still too small.  The fabric used doesn't have very much give, either.  I gave it a four star because I received exactly what I ordered, right color, same as pictured, really cute!  Just too small"
4.0,Lining slides and gets staticky. Nice and warm tho. I‚Äôd buy one without a lining in a heartbeat
4.0,better made than what you would find in stores
4.0,"The slippers themselves are great!! They are adorable and the print is just like the picture! The sole is great, too. It‚Äôs a rubber sole that‚Äôs similar to a regular tennis shoe, although it‚Äôs still a slipper and not a tough. The only reason I‚Äôve removed a star is because I ordered a size 6 and got a size 5. Luckily, they still fit since my kid isn‚Äôt quite a size 6 yet, but this seems to be a common problem based on other reviews. Definitely recommend the slipper, but I just wish they paid more attention when fulfilling the order."
4.0,For what I was looking for it works well.  For me personally I wish they were a little longer (wider) to have more facial coverage
4.0,Beautiful dress. A little lose. I normally wear 4 or 6...<br />God is good.
4.0,"My oldest daughter wears a uniform to school, and there are strict socks rules (covering ankle, no ruffle, no embellishment ) with color (white only for girls, when boys can wear navy, unfair....) being the worst for winter (no boots allowed,  only sneakers). How can I keep her feet warm in the winter? Ski socks have fancy colors or patterns so this was the only option I found. I ordered several pairs (like 6 for 1 child, 2 for the other). I noticed small discrepancies in color (off white to cream, but I guess not enough to get into trouble ) and size (natural, they can shrink too). But overall fits my bill of warmth and uniform compliance."
4.0,Need to lose a couple pounds for this to look it's best on me.<br />Love the material and color. Super cute!
4.0,"Slightly small, but good matierials, and thick. Warm."
4.0,"Like it a lot, but there was more orange in it than the photo showed.  I bought it for a gift, but it will work with my coloring better so I will keep it for myself!"
4.0,"Cute, but stretched out after one use."
4.0,I would definitely recommend this top fit very nicely.
4.0,"I am pear shaped and normally wear a 14. I ordered the XL and it is tight across the hips. A size bigger would be too big in the bust for me. It can be worn pulled/ruched up to avoid the tightness in the hip area. It is a stretchy poly/spandex blend, which i did not expect but like. I got the orange #8 and it has great fall colors."
4.0,"I love these cloths for cleaning up my moderately tarnished silver jewelry. It's quite amazing what a little elbow grease can do in terms of cleaning and polishing to a brilliant shine.<br />You use the lighter cloth for &#34;cleaning&#34; and the blue for &#34;polishing&#34;<br />It does work better on smoother surfaces as compared to silver that is covered with ornamentation like filigree. You may want to invest in a liquid silver cleaner and brush for pieces like that (in conjunction with the cloth).<br />As with liquid cleaners, avoid rubbing gemstones with the cloth."
4.0,"These are above-average quality, baggy sweat pants.  If that's what you are looking for, these are for you.  My wife picked up about 4-5 different brands and styles of joggers.  These are the baggiest and least flattering of the joggers she picked up.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with them, but the cut/style is mostly like the jogging pants you grew up with in high-school gym.  (With the exception that the drawstrings is white, a bit wider, and on the outside.)  If you want something comfortable and you don't have anyone to impress, these are practical joggers."
4.0,Its a little faded looking. Not as vibrant as the photo.
4.0,"The t-shirt itself is of good quality.  It is a decent thickness, the graphic seems to be holding up well thru washes, and the shirt maintains its size after washing.  This also got lots of good chuckles for my wife who is a teacher who wore it during a Tshirt day during their school's spirit week.  She says her kids still chuckle and go &#34;Sshhhhh&#34; as an inside joke to her."
4.0,"Nice puffer coat, super cute and trendy!"
4.0,"These boots are gorgeous however I definitely have the sausage effect because of my calves.  I don't think I'm stocky.  Nonetheless, I can't bear to return them because they are so beautiful.  I'm hoping that my legs will get thinner one day and i'll be able to wear them."
4.0,"Very nice quality, but runs very small for a man."
4.0,"Not sure about the materials in this, but it is not light weight for something of this size, so it seems like it is good quality. This rainbow like color really stands out in the light as well. This was a gift for my daughter and was well worth this low cost."
4.0,I like the wallet a lot. I needed a new one.
4.0,Fit as expected.  Good quality for the money.
4.0,"Nice design, got lots of compliment for it.  Bit heavy, not something I will wear all day."
4.0,I absolutely love it! It fits perfect! Straps are a little tight to get up but once its on it fits like a glove! I am 5'3 155lbs and i got xl. So so happy. Excited to get into swimming laps again.
4.0,"Great cat mask, the eye holes could be a little bigger, teenagers loved it! Big Hit!"
4.0,"It is really sticky, so it didn't shift or move at all, and I had to stick and restick it several time trying to align it correctly."
4.0,"Great package, easily giftable<br />Mirror hanging reminder, not used as necklace"
4.0,"very comfy but might need to wash it once, so it wouldn't fell so itchy"
4.0,Wife really likes these
4.0,Just as expected--- a large sarong type wrap.  Very pretty
4.0,Warm fluffy. But get soaked fast. Only for dry snow.
4.0,Very cute for a grandchild to give to their grandmother.
4.0,Good glasses for the price and stylish
4.0,I like the hat its good quality the fleece inside keeps you very warm. It fits over my hair up in a clip but the color is correct as shown which is to me is not purple it's a pinkish raspberry colour my only complaint
4.0,Beautiful flowy dress. I love it!<br /> its just a little snug in the bust area so I kept the top two buttons undone... it was worth the buy!
4.0,The price and quality are great. This sweater was actually a size smaller than it should have been for a 3x
4.0,"Love it,but the moon piece on mine was a bit sharp."
4.0,It was a little snug and was made of cheap polyester fabric not cotton
4.0,"Very thin fabric, but it is exactly what I wanted‚Ä¶cooler in warm weather. I also like the stretch. I got the purple, and it is a great color."
4.0,"First of all, I love this cape. However, I am 5'8. So the cloak is not as long on me as the girl in the photo. This makes it a little less cool than I expected, but I still like it a lot."
4.0,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas because I never know what to buy him. He is a farmer and also owns a business and is unable to be away from his phone for long periods of time. He loved it!  Listening to music is clear and it is easy to switch between songs, answering a call is also easy. The calls from his phone are clearer than incoming calls to him which is the reason for the 4 stars. However, this is not a deal breaker at all. I like how the speaker is inside a zippered area so you feel confident that it will not fall out if you are an active person.  I plan on ordering one for myself and other family members."
4.0,I got this dress from my almost two year old. It's a nice dress but the colour is not as pictured. It's much more dull. But I'll still use it
4.0,Nice true to size I got too big my bad
4.0,"Super Cute wet suit.  Love the boyshort cut of the legs.  Arms are a little big (both in length and width) but i have short t-rex arms, so taller women might not find this an issue.  For reference, i am 5' tall and weigh about 130.  36, 29, 29 (chest, waist, hips) for measurements and i bought the tag size 2xl.  fits great minus the sleeves being a little too big.  Looks amazing!  cant wait to use it!"
4.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful bag but it‚Äôs really really small.
4.0,Perfect fit was a bit short
4.0,Nice shoe but had to return.  Not comfortable.
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my niece. Its a cute dress and the sizing is appropriate. Its made of a heavy fabric which was unexpected but you can tell its quality.
4.0,Gorgeous color and great material! The dress runs somewhat small in the chest and is very tight across the tummy. I am 5'4 100 pounds 32D bra and ordered a small. I am exchanging for a medium and I think it will be perfect!
4.0,I love the colors/pattern. Kinda itchy wear the seam is. Definitely for when you are further along. Would make anyone look pregnant.
4.0,"They even arrived early, they are slightly see through up close so I suggest wearing black or white undies.I'm a 14-16 american and have a little space in these."
4.0,Very nice but after the first wear it changes color so had to change the chain with an inexpensive gold fill chain which I know will not change but will get a little dark after a while but after cleaning it with a little toothpaste and toothbrush it looks shiney and beautiful again.gold fill does not change only gold plated.
4.0,Really cute boots. Perfect fit. Just what I was looking for. Boot goes past knee. Heel height is perfect. If you have slender legs you will love these!
4.0,fit as expected - the only thing i didn't like was i couldn't pick the colors
4.0,"Hits all the marks but runs small. These are great, not sheer, no dramatic scoop back (ugh hate that) and the butt seams aren't all gathered so no panty line! I would suggest ordering just one size up because they run small, nobody wants a metal snap cameltoe either."
4.0,Material could be thicker.
4.0,"I received several compliments on my dress. It was flattering and the  sheerness was great while dancing.<br />Family was to wear orange, yellow or brown for my uncles Halloween birthday party."
4.0,"I just prefer the 6-7"" shorts so not for me. Returns were so easy that there is nothing to lose!"
4.0,It fit perfect and the color was great in pictures.
4.0,Son bastante resistentes y quedan bien
4.0,This hat is adorable. I‚Äôm excited to wear it on our trip to WDW next month. I bought my husband the matching Mickey one. They are nicely made caps. They seem durable and well made. The only thing that I‚Äôm not entirely digging is the ears. They don‚Äôt stand up well. They are floppy and have nothing to help hold them up. Any amount of wind will push them over. I imagine I may be trying to come up with something to keep them up.
4.0,I bought this pants for my wife and she loved it.<br />It was perfect fit on her and looks very nice.<br />Made with good materials.<br />Madewell and good quality.<br />Recommend.
4.0,"The Material is thin and clingy. The bows is a good camouflage in the front BUT everything shows in the back  with the light color(Pink), Other than that color, design and fit is beautiful :)"
4.0,A little on the thin side.  But I like them for my boots.
4.0,"Super cute and comfy, just runs big!"
4.0,"The slip was thick enough to have been worn as a slip. It seemed made  well and definitely not see through. I really wish it would've fit but it ran small. I wear 36c or 38b and could not tie. Regretfully, I had to return."
4.0,"On my head, it fits like a knit cap, tighter than pictured on the model. The model must have a small head! It IS cute and warm, but looks a lot smaller on my 23 1/2‚Äù head. I wish it came in the large size because it is soft, comfortable and the price is great!"
4.0,A little taller than what I had expected...
4.0,"Not a terrible watch for $25.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The watch face is stylish. It makes a great conversation piece.<br />I personally like having a manual watch, you have to hand crank it every morning but I feel much more attached to it for that.<br />The color scheme is versatile and works with many outfits.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />It feels cheap, the wristband is tough and feels almost like plastic<br /><br />In the end, it costs $25 and you get what you pay for. It's served me pretty well though over about 3-4 months."
4.0,"Soft, cute. Met my expectations (:"
4.0,"Nice piece, very much enjoy the look and the reminder of The Lord and that he is with us as the scripture says. The cord on mine at least loosens up semi often, occasionally to an annoyingly loose level but that's maybe once every other day. Otherwise definitely recommend."
4.0,Product as described!  It‚Äôs lightweight but warm.  I believe it‚Äôs real silk bc I don‚Äôt stink in it.  I even wore it for a whole week after light workouts and left it out to air dry overnight and it doesn‚Äôt smell.  My only complaint is the neck line shows under all my clothes.  The seams on the neckline and armholes are stretchy and comfortable.  Can‚Äôt beat the price!
4.0,Liked it fits well.<br />Had it a few months now won it twice and the zip fell apart.
4.0,"I really love this bra and the way it fits, BUT, I will say there is not a lot of coverage if you have a larger chest. I have a fairly small chest, and felt like I had to keep myself from falling out a few times. I'm on the small end of a 34C or a 36B, and ordered a medium. Overall comfy material, just be ready to adjust a little!"
4.0,Fast shipping and excellent fit!!
4.0,"I love this ankle bracelet, but sadly, it has broke twice with normal wear. Luckily both times reparable, but it really needs to be for limited wear."
4.0,It's nice but a little small
4.0,"Works well, stays put. However, they are easy to peel out of the shoes."
4.0,This was a gift and the recipient loved it and said it was warm and cute. It fit her well. I haven‚Äôt yet heard how well it held up in the laundry.
4.0,Band is thick and color is true to photo. If you come near Velcro it sticks. Love the band.
4.0,The shirt is nice. Get compliments BUT it‚Äôs crooked.
4.0,"I have an extra large bust (42DDD) & medium pant size (10-12).  Buying dresses can be difficult, but the stretchy fabric works great.  I got the Xlg & it fits perfectly. I purchased a belt to cover the elastic waist.  Many compliments.<br />My con is that the vertical stripes do not match on the side seams."
4.0,"Was a gift for my nephew, however he appears to have a plan to adjust the fit."
4.0,Purchased this top to go with leggings. Love then length. The color is a bit more vivid then pictured. The material is stretchy and breathable. A little heavier then some other tops I have. I don't feel like I'm swimming in this tunic the way i do other tunics. It stops just below my butt! Perfect length for this short torso-ed girl. I didnt really care for the necklace but then again im not a costume jewelry type of person. There is a hem line right at the center of the neck line (in between the boobs) this hem wasn't the straightest/ a bit wonky. That is the only reason I didnt give this a 5 star. The hem line is so prominent that you cant miss it if you arent wearing a necklace that covers it.
4.0,Pro: I like the style and I like the fit. True to size. It's affordable!<br />Con:The ring is light weight. It does not have a lot of gram weight.<br />My opinion: Its just a cute ring. It's not high quality. I don't expect it to last through wear and tear. I wish it was heavier for the price.
4.0,Great item for trick-or-treaters to keep them visible and safe. I gave them out this past Halloween and they were a hit. Two out of 24 didn't work. Not great but not bad either. Will buy more for next year.
4.0,"I have bought two pairs of these earings. The first pair were exactly like the picture; silver middle with blue edges. They are very comfortable and easy to wear to the point I accidentally slept with tgem in. Needless to say, they quickly became my favorite earings. When I lost one of them at an airport, I was distraught. Unable to find the missing earing, I ended up buying a second pair. Strangely, the second pair came with inverted colors; they have a blue center and silver edges. I still love them, but they still were not what I expected. That said, I would absolutely (and probably will) buy another pair if the price drops or I need another replacement. *Pictured is the 2nd pair with the inverted colors. *"
4.0,I bought these for commercial use. They seem to hold up fine for light duty work. They came on time and the price was right.
4.0,"I've only had them a few days, and I used one of them for the left side of my nose. It fits well, but man, it was a bitch closing it. Once I got it closed, its stayed put."
4.0,"Bands were nice, fit well."
4.0,"Very nice, slighty small across the chest but otherwise nice fit."
4.0,tight in the tummy area
4.0,Fit true<br />Material disappointed- winter weight<br />Have to wait 3 months to wear.<br />Will keep.
4.0,My daughter loves these and they look SUPER cute on her. The lens fell out on its own after 5 or 6 times wearing them. We MAY order more and see if the same thing happens. She loves them that much.
4.0,"Easy-to-read time and date. Alarm and hourly chime help keep me on schedule. Underestimated the small size, but its unobtrusive stature makes it comfortable to wear all day. Light is just bad. For the price, it's a fun little watch."
4.0,"The straps were a little confusing to get on at first, and require some stretching and contorting to get out of, as they don't have that much stretch to them, but when the suit is actually on, it looks good!"
4.0,"At the price point, this one is a keeper.  Nice green, nice gold."
4.0,the nightgown was just a bit to small across the chest under the arms.<br />However it will be okay  to sleep in for the few hours you have it on.
4.0,I really liked the color&style.  Perfect for NFL stadium requirements.
4.0,So far so good.  I have not worn it yet.  But it looks good on and fits great!  It is reversible too.  Not problem yet.
4.0,"Fit as expected in size chart.  Nice comfortable waist band and good quality.  Longer than expected.  I am five foot five which is average height and I thought the skirt was a little too long on me.  Because of the ruffled hem line, this skirt would not be easy to hem up, otherwise I liked it.  Arrived on time."
4.0,I am a a bit larger in the middle and I love this dress! Its super fun and flowy.
4.0,It's alright. Had similar one with a second wave before from godmother. Lost it in a pair of scrubs... What I liked about that ring was the blackened waves. Wish it was just a little bigger too
4.0,Not very stretchy.
4.0,Really soft and warm enough
4.0,"While the description says this sweater is for girls, it looks perfectly gender neutral. It's a thick sweater, so great for cold days. It's super soft, too. The neck is on the smaller side and comes up a bit, though not like a turtleneck, by any means(like it mentions in the title). If your child has sensitivities about clothing creeping up on their neck, like I do, this won't be the best sweater. (I wouldn't be able to wear it, but my children are fine with it.)<br /><br />There are no tags whatsoever within the sweater, other than the brand tag that is safety pinned to it. It informs that this sweater is made in China and that it is 47% acrylic, 28% nylon, and 25% polyester. I'm not even sure what size this sweater is. There are no care instructions, either, though it does say ""Easy Care in Machine Wash on Gentle Cycle, Do not Iron"" within the description on this page. This one fits my 8 and 10 year old(small, same size as his brother) children a little loosely. (Maybe it will show what size it is once this review is posted.)<br /><br />Overall, it's a thick and soft sweater that could work great for girls and boys."
4.0,"It is a little tighter than I like, but it is pretty and I wear it often."
4.0,I love these socks except that they are too tight at the ankle.  They are thin but cushiony.  They grip well but the grips are not so large that I cant wear my slippers with them. The seams are  tight and flat - no uncomfortable bulges here.  They are perfect for wearing around the house on a cold day.<br /><br />But they're too small at the ankles.  Waah!  :(  I only deducted 1 star for that because in fairness I do have cankles but I sized up so they should have fit.
4.0,The band was a little bit but easy to make it work! Liked the material! Def worth it!
4.0,It arrived quickly. The pants were a little big around the waist on my 9mo old that weighs 23lbs and is 29in long everything else fit well. We got a lot of complements.
4.0,"This is a review of the Iswee cowhide leather laptop briefcase.<br /><br />Note: This briefcase is made of cowhide leather/crazy horse, also referred to as saddle leather. Crazy horse leather is made by applying special waxes to the surface of leather. When the leather is rubbed the color will change and does not immediately reverse giving it an antique look. This technique is executed very well on this bag, it looks and feels like a very high quality bag.<br /><br />Here are some pros & cons that i've found:<br /><br />PROS<br />+ The cut of this leather is thick and feels soft. It is a deep rich brown color. Even without items in the bag it holds its structure very well.<br />+ The zippers and buckles on this bag are high quality and feel very sturdy. The hardware is a very nice antique brushed brass and go very well together with the color of the leather. The zippers are nice and thick and slide easily.<br />+ The leather straps on the front hide the buckle snap nicely. These two buckles hold the bag closed very securely even when full. Opening the bag is easy and can be done quick.<br />+ The stitching is precise and tight. The inside flap is lined with very soft velvet which matches the color of the leather. The inside pockets are lined with a strong brown nylon fabric that works great to keep items safe from scratches.<br />+ This briefcase feels great to carry. Since the bag is structured it stays nice and flat which works well when carrying on the side or on my back.<br />+ I really like that this bag has a handle on the top. It makes it easy to hold in the hand and pick up.<br />+ The two pockets on the front are very large. Each pocket can easily fit a good sized paperback book without issue. Also works great for carrying a laptop charger or cords.<br />+ The hidden zipper pocket on the back of the bag is perfect for items you may want to keep secure. Perfect for items such as a passport or cash.<br /><br />CONS<br />- The large compartment near the back where i could see carrying a thicker laptop has a zipper in the pocket. It is nice to have more organization options however the zipper could scratch a laptop when rubbing against it.<br />- My laptop is a 15.4 inch Dell which is thick and large. Unfortunately it didn't fit in this bag. It is only rated for a 15 inch laptop so that is to be expected but i was hoping it would. It almost fit so i would imagine most laptops at around 14 inches or 15 inches and not too thick would fit great. I do believe the middle compartment is where a laptop or tablet should go which is nice and padded. I could see a 14 inch or smaller laptop fit in the middle compartment.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />= This bag is awesome. The styling is classic but it has modern conveniences such as the quick snaps to open the bag on the front. It's very compartmentalized with lots of different pocket sizes makes finding items and packing them so easy. The leather is top notch and I could see it holding up a lifetime.<br /><br />I was provided this product in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"They are for really small hands, not for long fingers"
4.0,Nice shoe...however it seems a bit loose.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 135 lbs and a DD. After reading the reviews I got a medium and it fits perfectly. I love the straps adjust, and the pockets. I‚Äôve only hand washed it because it‚Äôs not the best quality. The stitching in the front where the ‚ÄúV‚Äù is looks like it might be coming undone, and there‚Äôs a small hole in the pocket, nothing not fixable. It‚Äôs perfect for summer weather though, very lightweight. You do get what you pay for."
4.0,This was a gift for my sister. It was a little small but she loves it
4.0,although I thought they were going to be smaller and would have been able to attached legos to....... im pleased they're actually bigger and rubbery so my neice (14 months) liked teething on one to test before party haha
4.0,They run large but I wanted to put insoles in to give more arch support
4.0,Love the softness and very comfortable.. wish the they were just a little thicker!!
4.0,the clasp doesn‚Äôt work so you have to unhook the jump ring. other than that its great
4.0,"Bought fir myself but did fit well, gave to my husband and it's looks great! Love the color w the camo."
4.0,I happily received this sweater as expected.  It is will be a great light weight spring addition to my wardrobe.
4.0,This style of belt is a great concept! What could be better than not having to unbuckle/buckle!
4.0,like design
4.0,I just got this tank yesterday and I really like it! It goes well as an undershirt. My only complaint is that it's a little short but not enough to be a deal breaker.
4.0,"I purchased this watchband for a larger Wenger (Swiss Army) watch with 22 mm lugs.  The band is exactly as it appeared on Amazon and has sufficient length for my large wrist.  I'm usually on the last notch with standard watch bands so the extra length was appreciated.  The nylon strap  is sturdy and has plenty of adjustment holes for a good fit.  The double rings on both sides of the band are somewhat overkill.  There are two layers of nylon strap between my wrist and the watch case which causes the watch to raise up from the arm a few millimeters.  It ends up being a bit bulkier that a standard band but after a few days of wear the nylon softens a bit which allows the band to fit a little snugger.  The watch ends up being extra secure due to the way the strap is secured to the case.  Watch spring pins are installed first and the strap is threaded through the gap between the case and the pins.  The means if one pin comes loose, the watch will still be held on the wrist with less chance of being lost.  All in all a decent watch band, rugged and waterproof.  I gave it four star just because I'm still getting used to the extra bulk associated with this style of band."
4.0,"I love all of the stones that it comes with. I was most excited about the tiger's eye, however it is not at all the right color. It's more of a mocha color so it's still pretty to me but not the right ambery color I was hoping for. Overall they are surprisingly great quality for how cheap they were, I was shocked! I am wearing the mocha one now and it's comfortable, pretty, and my body has had no problems with the metal. I definitely recommend!"
4.0,"Very good for the price. The shirt (material) is thinner than expected, but that doesn't matter under a tuxedo jacket."
4.0,Bought these for my sister and she loved them! So many options to switch between.
4.0,Nice little suit. Wish the tie wasn‚Äôt a clip on but otherwise it‚Äôs decent quality and my son is excited to wear it.
4.0,"I got 3 of them, it's a Christmas gift."
4.0,"Feels good. ordered a size larger than normal,probably gone two sizes larger."
4.0,Dress is very pretty. Actually received this a day earlier than expected. I'd say this is pretty true to size I'm 5'4&#34; 32DDD and normally wear a medium and the medium fit.
4.0,I think this is a cute top. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs more of a long tunic than sweatshirt material. But will be great as a fall staple. I am 5‚Äô8 and it fits well but I like my tunics bigger and wished I would have gotten a large for a more oversized look like the picture.
4.0,I am giving this a four because the shorts are navy not black!
4.0,"This necklace is more than worth what I paid for it. My wife looks beautiful in pearls, but I can't afford to get her really expensive jewelry. That being said, this necklace looks very fancy and she loves it, although she feels a bit silly wearing it to anything less than a formal occasion.<br /><br />The length is perfect for her, although fat-necked people might prefer something longer. The potato-shape to the pearls is more noticeable than I would like, but I still don't regret my purchase."
4.0,A little on the mall size 6 foot one tho big head but for the price i rock them super dark perfect upstate ny snow blind
4.0,"Loved them but they are at least 1 one full size larger than my normal size. I needed more arch support and ordered these along with a pair of Chacos sandals. I felt the arch support was higher on the Chacos,although these Crocs seem to have more heel support. I ended up sending these back since they were too big. So, from my very limited experience with these depending on what you need these could be awesome! Just order down a size."
4.0,"Had to send the first pair back because one was much wider than the other, but the second pair are good and super cute."
4.0,"I wore this dress for my bridal shower. I loved it!  The fit was as expected and was so comfortable.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because as I was buttoning the top by the neck, the button split in half.  I couldn't even sew it back on.  I had to go buy a new button to sew on. The length was perfect (I'm 5'2'') and ordered a size small."
4.0,"The kit arrived quickly and is very nice. There is plenty of room and I appreciate that it can fold out to hold even more items. I agree with other reviews that given the price, I thought the leather might be a bit thicker. It definitely feels like genuine leather, but is still relatively slim. Overall, I am pleased."
4.0,Looks good but I  thought the dragon would show more.
4.0,"Really nice houseshoes and soooo warm, very good price for the Quality, bought a pair for my husband and he is wearing them with the same warm feet now[[ASIN:B0052TCYJ4 Plymouth Mocs Mens Chukka Slippers]]"
4.0,"This necklace is exactly as pictured.¬† It's a closer fitting dainty link chain with 4 clip points that go from about 15"" to 17"" with a crab claw clasp.¬† It doesn't catch on my baby hairs at the nape of my neck which is an issue¬†I have with some of my other chains. This is very plain but a great layering piece especially since it doesn't lend to tangling.¬†¬†Seems pretty solid.  I'm not afraid to break it or that it will fall off."
4.0,"I've used these gloves for years and found them to be the best value for the money in sturdiness and grip. The plastic does eventually break and wear off over the thumbs from constant abrasion of steering wheels, but that's no reason for me enough to look elsewhere. In local stores the cost is much higher - these 6-packs are a great bargain."
4.0,"If you have large boobs and want to cause men to have accidents, this is for you! It was an absolute perfect fit, other than the makers of this dress didn‚Äôt take into consideration women with large breasts. I wouldn‚Äôt wear this without a shirt or camisole underneath. It‚Äôs very revealing. The fabric is comfortable and stretches."
4.0,"Great for hiking.  Can be a hat or neck or face covering.  Not too thick, which is good, depending on what you are looking for."
4.0,Serves the purpose of something to contain rosary.
4.0,Great little hat. I like that it comes in black unlike most that only have the grey option. This would make a great little gift.
4.0,Took the advice from other reviews & wish I hadn't. I ordered 1 size larger than normal & the shirt was way too big. Good thing I used this as a Christmas PJ shirt.
4.0,"Colors and material look beautiful, but I had to return it because the waist was way too high for my taste."
4.0,"While the other UA shirts of this exact style fit well, this particular shirt, white colored, fits big all over. It's like it was cut one size larger than advertized."
4.0,Que debe ser un poco m√°s fuerte para as√≠ las bebes tengas un mejor equilibrio.
4.0,It's exactly as pictured.  Can't wait to wear it to the pool!
4.0,nice get large x large if you more than 140 lb if you have belly no support in that area
4.0,Quick service. Nice glasses but temples are very long.
4.0,Fit well for the purpose.
4.0,"This is a good product & I like tri-fold wallets, so that was a plus.  However, it was shipped in a plastic bag mailer with NO protection & was lucky that it was not damaged."
4.0,Just wish it had instructions on how to tie the bow.
4.0,"The fit was good. It's a cute dress, just kind of an awkward style for those who are a bit more flat chested"
4.0,Very pretty with just the right amount of sparkle.  Concerned however with clasp.  Looks very fragile.  Good purchase at a cheap price.
4.0,Like them but there supposed to be 55 and I am missing one.
4.0,"nice bag,"
4.0,"My husband is going on a trip next week, and we are going out of the country this fall.  I sell bags for a living, but we needed some actual luggage, compared to duffles.  I wanted something that would stand out at baggage claim, had spinners, tsa locks, was hard sided, and wouldn't break the bank.  This seems to fit the bill.  They all fit nicely inside each other, so far rolls well, even on carpet, and the locks are easy to use (although I haven't set them to new codes yet).  It isn't truly hard sided - more so flexible - and the side of the middle one was dented a bit when unzipped, but because of the flexibility, looks fine when it's zipped.  The outer pockets on the two smaller ones are also nice.  I was worried about that taking up room inside, but it's added onto the outside, so you still have plenty of room.  I don't know that I would put a laptop in either, but nice to have the option, and to have extra space.  I will update after our two trips."
4.0,I will say this yes it is thin and a little short but it is strong and it's still nice and so is the price I bought a small gold heart charm and it makes it look much better
4.0,Works good for me.
4.0,I loved this medal but wish chain was longer..
4.0,"The material used in this sweatshirt seems to be of good quality, slightly fluffy on the inside & a durable weave on the outside.  I ordered a small and think it would fit a large, or at least certainly a medium built woman.  Should be fine layered over a t-shirt or long sleeve shirt underneath though."
4.0,Gave this as a gift to a lovely couple when they bought their first house! I paired this with a gift card and it was well accepted.
4.0,"Yazilind  blue turquoise(fake) its hard plastic but well made nonetheless, very cute lots of compliments and the price you can't beat it."
4.0,The bottoms fit perfect but the top is somewhat small around the bottom. That‚Äôs the only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars. Strap is not adjustable but length is just right. Good quality. Very happy with it.
4.0,This is the bracelet my sister was hoping for this Christmas.  She loves it !
4.0,"the socks were slow getting delivered, but appeared as advertised."
4.0,Made a nice gift
4.0,Matches well with other items
4.0,Great price for 2 pairs of polarized sunglasses/
4.0,"The Color and Material are Great. Sadly, they were too large for my twin grandson who are sizes 3. I decided to keep the glasses because the boys will grow and can wear the glasses next year."
4.0,"I like the black background and orange T. Stands out against the black front on my F150. Was about 1/4 to 3/8‚Äù thick, which made it a little difficult to get in the two lower slots. But with some effort it worked. Those slots were designed to accept a standard license plate. This tag will probably stretch them out some. But not a serious problem"
4.0,"Comfortable fabric and basic colors, which I found both comfortable in both regards."
4.0,"I am 5'7"" and weigh 125 lbs.  It was definitely long enough for heels.  I ordered both the small and medium and the small would have been the better choice by far.  I usually wear size 4 (if it doesn't fit too tight in the hips).  The small would have worked; however, I have a smaller waist in comparison to my hips and it was a too big in the waist.  I was pleasantly surprised that the underlining/slip fit great...it was not too tight in the hips.  I might would have kept it and had it altered in the waist, but I didn't have time before my event."
4.0,"This is nice and soft and very cute.  It's just a little larger than I expected, I knew it would be on the larger side from the picture, but for my head it seems to be much bigger. That is my only &#34;semi&#34; issue with this, everything else is great!<br /><br />It fits snug enough to hold back the hair out of your face or to wear as a stylish look and without having to keep fixing it and putting it back in its place constantly!  So that is great, but there are many cute headbands out there that needs to be constantly readjusted and this isn't one of them.<br /><br />All in all a great product!<br /><br />NOTE: i did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.  I did not promise a positive review in exchange, just an honest one.  If you look at my profile you'll see other items I've reviewed that I received at a discount and they didn't get positive ones.  My reviews are solely based on my HONEST opinion of the product."
4.0,"It fits as described, I‚Äôm wearing it to a wedding"
4.0,Love these feel of these. Love the support it gives my legs
4.0,Boyfriend didn't like it
4.0,I really like this set. They fit great and are pretty comfortable. I did only receive one tigers eye so if there's any way I could get a replacement that would be nice. Kinda disappointed that I didn't get it because it's one ofy favorite stones.
4.0,"I have found out that the bracelet is not long enough to accommodate as many beads as I wanted to put on it.  It is also not<br />as big around as I anticipated.  These are my problems, not that of the bracelet. The actual bracelet is just fine."
4.0,I really love that sunglasses fits perfect to me. Sadly the quality is poor üòø
4.0,Not as stretchy as I thought they would be and they are a little baggier than I texpected but still comfortable!
4.0,Really soft but kind of small
4.0,Shoes work for water aerobics as expected. Don't like the way the laces close.
4.0,I use these to help with a joint problem with my finger called Trigger Finger. They work great
4.0,Awesome bracelet but the the mirror is cracked on it
4.0,"I received my bag by the end of December, upon first glance I thought maybe I misinterpreted the color I chose but soon realized that I received the wrong color. After contacting the seller, they made sure that I received my correctly ordered item with minimal inconvenience (longer wait time). The color on the Navy Blue is less grey in the photos and the color of the brighter blue is just what I expected. The bag holds everything I need for my work day and can even fit my lunch/water if I need to be hands free. This is a great purchase and well worth the money, even for faux leather."
4.0,"Too balls are muck larger in person, so too big for me.  But I gave the pairs to my daughter who is 24.  She loved them!"
4.0,"I am a big fan of these, they are pretty true to size... maybe a bit short compared to others, but I would say spot on."
4.0,"Arrived quickly. After a few weeks, however, it is cracking along the seam"
4.0,There very long but pretty
4.0,"Nice scarf, very soft. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the colors aren't as vibrant as the picture, but it still matches my dark blue pea coat nicely, so I am happy with it!"
4.0,Served its purpose for costume
4.0,Cute glasses but broke easily so yeah
4.0,This necklace is perfect  to wear for a night out or with a black blouse to the office. The clasps are a bit cheap so I don't hold out hope that it will last long.
4.0,"I am typically a small or medium in tops - I am 5'8 with a shorter torso which is why I enjoy crop tops because they usually end up being a good length for me but this top was way too short and uncomfortable for working out - length wise. If it was a bit longer I would have definitely kept it and ordered more. The color, fit, and material was great otherwise. Very form fitting, almost compression like. The reason I returned was just length."
4.0,This is actually a pretty durable panty. Holds up pretty well in washings. However I would not qualify this as a unisex panty. Pretty restrictive upfront.  The material isn‚Äôt very smooth. Feels very cotton like.
4.0,"These fit my wide feet!<br /><br />I've been on the hunt for new soccer cleats for several weeks. This is the 5th pair I've tried and the first pair which hasn't been too tight on my 100mm wide feet. The k-leather will stretch a little bit for a more custom fit, but the mesh on the inside should prevent them from stretching so much that they allow feet to slide around.<br /><br />I usually wear a 9.5 cleat and 9.5 running shoe. These fit almost exact with a lightly padded sock. I'm going to need the leather to stretch just a bit to accommodate my big toe (height). There is zero extra room at the end of the shoe.<br /><br />Material is very soft / supple, as k-leather should be. The heel liner is a suede-like material which is soft yet grippy. There is also some padding inside the heel to help with comfort and retention. I also find the lacing system helps pull your foot back and into the heel for retention. It's a noticeable difference between unlaced and tightly laced...locked down! I did get a blister on one heel the first time I used them, but that's to be expected with any new boot. They need to be broken in over the course of a few wears.<br /><br />The sole plate is blue with some kind of iridescent chrome-like finish. It's flashy, but wears off. It appears the underlying color is still a translucent blue, so they'll still look good. White laces are going to get dirty and discolor. I happened to catch a review of these on youtube by SR4U and bought his light blue laces to go with the blue sole plate (laces are available on Amazon too).<br /><br />Edit:<br />A month in and they are feeling wonderful. Broken in well. The leather is soft and supple. The &#34;chrome&#34; finish on the bottom is mostly gone and now just a blue sole plate. The fly knit sock portion in place of a normal tongue is no longer white. Playing on a couple of damp and rainy days it's now an off-white / brown color from a bit of dirt and mud. The white leather is also no longer pure white. Running and kicking has left some grass stains, though I haven't attempted to scrub them to see if it'll come out. Personally, I don't care. Cleats are never going to stay clean. The fit and comfort is worth it."
4.0,Beautiful color. Nice fit
4.0,"The T-shirt is comfortable and light weight, the only thing I don't like is it  rolls up when sitting"
4.0,Really helps when pulled over mouth and nose to block/filter the cold wind. Can walk much more comfortably in winter weather now.
4.0,To give to my grand kids
4.0,"Got this for my daughter for her first birthday party. We are doing a Woodlands  ""wild ONE"" themed so this shirt fit in perfect. It's made of 95% cotton and 5% polyester. Sewing job isnt perfect but it its soft and fits as expected."
4.0,Overall good. Definitely saved $ buying on amazon!
4.0,The dress is very pretty just a little to revealing for my taste my daughter wore it for New Year's . she looked gorgeous.
4.0,nice case for my bigger sunglasses
4.0,I would buy again but size down due to the stretch it has.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"this is a great skirt, very comfy and stretchy but a little tight across the hips. the side vent helped a little but it was pretty tight to wear."
4.0,"I love this sweater, but it was bigger than I expected.  I ordered size 14 and should have gotten size 12."
4.0,Wish you could return the brown for exchange of another black will be ordering again
4.0,Love this dress but the fabric will stretch and wrinkle after you wash it once.
4.0,"Nice material. It was a little big .... I base myself on the others reviews ... the matrial is a bit stretchy,  other than that is just ok  I order large, I think Medium would be fit perfectly"
4.0,A little snug.  But well made and attractive looking.  Lets me make a political statement everywhere I go.
4.0,"Very cute cut, a bit tight around the bust of you have ample bust.  Hides the pouch belly. Flattering."
4.0,"I love this bracelet, but I need the assistance of my 15 year old to help me hook it around my wrist."
4.0,Very cute with a blue jean jacket. Hard to keep wrinkle free.
4.0,Love it even though I got the wrong size. Still was nice though
4.0,This is made for a tall man . It's too big long and heavy
4.0,"Nice fit, and love having pockets."
4.0,It is nice to have!!
4.0,"Warm polyester, but very cute!"
4.0,This tracksuit is pretty great. Very soft and comfy. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. Fits as expected (though initially it looked like it was going to be too big). It's thinner than I expected but still cozy and perfect for fall weather. Can wear a pyjamas or a casual outfit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the grey part is significantly lighter than shown on the picture. It's a very light grey. I wish that this came in black/dark grey options.
4.0,"Nice Watch, band is a bit big and can not figure out how to make the band smaller."
4.0,Great winter jacket for here in N. Ca (not too cold here.) I'm usually a small and this fits as expected. I could wear a medium weight sweater with no issues.
4.0,Works for sunny days.. Would like for them to be Lil darker.
4.0,My order came quickly and the product was as described. For the $ they are very nice readers. A slight tint and the correct magnification.<br />They do not have spring loaded hinges so they will probably not take a whole lot of abuse.
4.0,Got this as part of a halloween costume. It was easy to apply and lasted well. Still hasn't worn off a few days later.
4.0,"Comfy, stretchy, a little wide at the bottom and short. Black shorts underneath solved that problem. Overall good quality! *Received free in exchange for reveiw"
4.0,"The lace is soft not scratchy and the material cleans up well after washing. Will shrink in dryer be sure to use low temp. Overall a good buy. I wear mine over a black camo with leggings, makes a great outfit piece. I made sure to get it over sized like a t-shirt dress."
4.0,light in weight but nice enough to pair with something  else like a watch or anothe bangle
4.0,Great shoe.  They are very comfortable and very light.  I use them for walking.  My only complaint is the shoe strings do not slide easily thru the eyelets.
4.0,"I've been wearing mine for about a week now and I LOVE it!! I've gotten several compliments. The stones are beautiful!<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving 4 rather than 5 stars is because the clicker mechanism is a little weak. I had a runny nose the other day (from a cold, not the jewelry) and by using tissues/blowing my nose it came out twice. Haven't had any issues other than that though!"
4.0,I love this bag and I always get compliments.
4.0,"I liked this nose ring. It was very, very pretty. However, since it is just a clip, it does tend to hang out of the nostrils slightly lower than real ones because it's capable of sliding down inside of the nose. It doesn't slightly &#34;cuff&#34; the septum like the pierced ones. It doesn't squeeze your nostrils tightly either like some might think. Depends on how long you wear it. I wore mine for hours and it didn't hurt. If you're a 12+ hour person on the go, you may start to feel it! But nothing unbearable, definitely! If you have a slender septum, then it will definitely hang lower for you. I have a slightly thick septum and it still is a little too low for me. It's great for fashion, great for fun! People can be fooled, but anyone who knows piercings will most likely tell it's either fake, the wrong size septum ring for you, or just a horrible piercing job altogether. It's very beautiful, but I'm not sure how much I can bear to take the risk of wearing it when it hangs noticeably lower than real septum rings. I might wear it if I'm feeling bold, risque, and careless to others thoughts of it. If your mom is begging you not to pierce your septum (like mine) and you don't want to upset her (for now, at least.....) then this is your best bet! It's doable. Just hangs slightly lower. Pretty cute though!"
4.0,Cute. Fit nice for medium
4.0,its soft and breathable but no nose clasp and slides down your face when talking. doesn't really provide protection if it falls off. Will be returning.
4.0,"Great fit, comfortable. I gave it a four because the fabric made me itch.  I‚Äôm going to wash them and see if that helps."
4.0,They seemed reliable. My granddaughter is happy.
4.0,The fit overall is good. The pouch area is a little small and by no means because I'm large. It just doesn't fit as snug as other brands. But I'm comfortable other than that.
4.0,"It's a really nice PJ set. Though, I wish I had ordered a size smaller as this product runs very large. I got a size 6/7 and it fit more like an 8/9/10. My son will grow into it eventually so I'm keeping it. Would just be nice if he could actually wear it now."
4.0,"They fit my child so that‚Äôs good. They are pink, so that‚Äôs good. It seems like they cost more because they are for kids, so that‚Äôs not good."
4.0,Nice bracelet..even though I lost it...<br />Disappointed with myself...<br />But happy with purchase
4.0,"Beautiful product, but unfortunately not big enough for my chest (30H). I ended up ordering a specialized sports bra, and refunded this one-but they let me keep the product!"
4.0,"Love this dress, fits all the right places.  I am 5'6 weigh 124lbs.  Ordered size M"
4.0,Great souvenirs
4.0,"Runs a bit shorter then the others. Right at hips doesn't cover butt. I am 5'9""."
4.0,"These are great biker shorts. Well made, good material quality and look good on. I ordered the wine color. It is beautiful. Just one caution, the color bleeds out of them when you sweat. I will order another pair and I will wash them in cold water before wearing. That's why I didn't rate them a 5."
4.0,"The 6.50 Ct amethyst is fine, not much sparkle, but the majority of the metal weight surrounds the gem and the sterling 18&#34; chain is way too thin for the weight of the stone. In fact, it is the lightest chain I have ever seen . Since it is a gift, I had to substitute a 925 sterling chain I already own so it looks like more quality. Customers do notice things like that and will try to avoid it. Unfortunately, it is not something apparent viewing online."
4.0,Beautiful earings!'''
4.0,"I normally wear a Large and I find the L in this size to fit very well and still be quite roomy. However, the shirt is designed to be tucked in (it does not have a straight bottom edge like a T-shirt or Polo style shirt has). The split on the sides don't even extend below my belt, so I‚Äôd say to get one size larger if you plan to tuck it in. (I don‚Äôt care about the split being seen so it doesn‚Äôt bother me.)<br /><br /> The sleeves also are a tad shorter than most of my other L button up shirts. Out of a few dozen (most from Amazon brands or other dealers on Amazon), I only have two others that have sleeves that feel as short as this shirt. (Maybe this is why the photo of the product shows the model having his sleeves rolled up.) They should be no problem if that‚Äôs how you wear a long sleeve shirt.<br /><br />After wash and dry, the material comes out lightly wrinkled all over. If this bothers you, be prepared to have to iron this shirt. You will also get crinkles at the edges."
4.0,These were ok gloves. Got the job done for what we needed.
4.0,Runs a little small but still able to wear.  Quality is nice.
4.0,"Nice looking glasses and good clarity, but one of the legs broke after only a short time with very little wear. However this company provided me a new pair, highly discounted, after a year's time.  Thus I think this was perhaps an anomaly and would recommend these sunglasses"
4.0,The fit very nicely and all the colors are how you see here perfect for any cute outfit.
4.0,"Fits good and comfortable, but I haven't worn it washed het."
4.0,"A pretty shirt that will be added to my fall wardrobe. The fit was as expected. The material very soft and the shirt nicely made. Delivery was on time and would not have a problem purchasing from this seller again. I rated it a four star because I have not worn or laundered as yet, but I do not believe there will be any issues."
4.0,They‚Äôre actually very cheaply made but they‚Äôre still so cute lol
4.0,"The stakes are a little long, but overall sturdy design. Perfect size and sparkle for my little girl."
4.0,"The set is cute. It fits, the way the panties look I thought they would be uncomfortable but they aren't. Not the best lingerie ever, but worth the price. Came way sooner than expected. I'm 5'3 119lbs and got small"
4.0,love it! Definitely a big tshirt night shirt
4.0,The material is a little sheer and thin but would make a great swimsuit cover up or paired with a denim jacket.  I am 5ft 7 inch and 140 pounds and I ordered a small.  It fits perfect everywhere but the crotch of the shorts are a little too long.  It is an easy fix though because you can cinch and fold the excess at the waist.  I think I will mainly use it as a cover up at the pool over my swimsuit.  I ordered the grey stripe and the color matched the website description in the pictures.  I think you could still wear it as regular clothes if you wore some bloomers underneath because it is not that sheer.  The material is soft.  My favorite part of the item is the color combination.  Treat yourself to this cute piece of clothing!
4.0,Got these for a costume. They are bigger than expected but work perfectly.
4.0,Great deal. Will wear for outdoor party on Halloween.<br /><br />**UPDATE** Wore & received many compliments. Will wear it to more events this Halloween.
4.0,But me and my son love them for my 10 year old. Size 18/20 in big kids were small for my son so tried size 28 and it‚Äôs a good fit. Will order again but I think I‚Äôll go up one size. NOT denim but more sketch fit.
4.0,I bought this for my 8 yr old.  He likes it.  Being a child its way to big for his wrist though.  I improvised by wrapping up the chain a bit.
4.0,The stone is beautiful. It arrived fast and is exactly what I expected. Very nice.
4.0,Good quality. Didn't fade or shrink with frequent washing. Love the adjustable elastic in the back and terrycloth sweat band. Works great üëç
4.0,I am top heavy with a smaller waist and I would love it if this jacket had a sash or a belt so that it didn't look so bulky and manly. I work in a corporate office that is very fashion forward and sometimes the jacket does not seem flattering to my figure. Other than that it keeps me nice and warm and makes it easy for me to keep up with my kids outside in the cold.
4.0,They are nice Booties got them on sale
4.0,Quedan muy bien la tela es de buena calidad y no se transparenta
4.0,"looks classy, great for layering, but it does run small. I went with my usual size and wish i had sized up for a little more length and roominess"
4.0,I love the concept of this hat and it is well made. It just didn't look right on me.
4.0,For the money this is a good watch and was just as shown. I have received several compliments while wearing it. It arrived in the mail quickly.
4.0,Very pretty and aren't super big so they're sublte in size compared to other peacock over the top earrings. The assymetrical look is interesting and no one would really notice if they weren't right next to each other. These earings are a huge statement and it gives off a very sexy edgy look! Good price and well made for the expected price.
4.0,"These are nice watches, I gave them as Christmas gifts in 2015 everyone seemed to like them. My one sister's arm was small and it was to loose for her, I was disappointed that I couldn't adjust it to make it fit her."
4.0,My Daughter loves wearing the pendant because she loves Unicorn's and says its very pretty
4.0,"Nice shoes, good color, two choices of laces. Seem to be comfortable, though I haven't worn them for a full round. seem to fit as expected."
4.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the color!"
4.0,"I like the looks of this wallet.  The shiny carbon fiber sides give it a modern look.  The heavy clip can hold a few bills or a small stack of bills.  I have always wanted to try this style of wallet which is basically a cardholder with a money clip on the side.  It seems like most new wallets these days are designed to block RFID so that is pretty standard.  This one has that feature as well.<br /><br />When you put your cards in this wallet, you pull the two sides apart.  They are held together by 3 elastic bands on three sides of the wallet.  Eventually, these might stretch out but they are tight when new.  (wallets all wear out over time, this is where I think this one may wear out eventually)<br /><br />Overall, it does what it is designed to do.  I decided to give it four stars because I have a bit of trouble getting the cards out without only removing the top or bottom one.  I have to take out the stack and put it back in as a nice and neat stack.  Also, I may not be as big of a fan of the money clip as I thought I was.  I use a minimalist wallet and I already don't like that to get my smallest bill out, I have to pull all of my bills out.  With a clip, all of your bills are out all of the time.  It isn't a big deal actually but I may prefer the minimalist wallet by a small margin."
4.0,It‚Äôs just what I was looking for. I wish it was a little wider after attaching it to my keys but it will work
4.0,"Very easy to wear. Good for the price. Once you get the solution molded to your teeth, fits good. Cool for going for a look or pics, but I would recommend grills that require a full dental impression to be sent to the dentist if you want to be able to talk with them without them feeling awkward."
4.0,These are a gift for my grandson who asked for shoes. You know how teenagers are.  Clothes horses!
4.0,"This is a nice shoe, but it took over two weeks to get here. After Easter, wil not use China seller again."
4.0,Affordable socks that fit me well and are ultra comfy.
4.0,"I'm not in a wheelchair but use a walker and wanted something to go over the front of the walk and over the back fully.  They were right, it leaves a big gap in the back.  For someone in a wheelchair that may be okay but not for someone using this for the walker.  Going to keep it anyway because it's better than what I already have."
4.0,"These are so so cute but slip right off my head if I have my hair in a bun or ponytail, therefore they‚Äôre now for holding hair back when I wash my face instead of keeping sweat out of my eyes at hot yoga"
4.0,I wish they came in a wide width or a little stretch at the bottom near the sole. They're very reasonable.in price
4.0,The size 10 felt like an 8. Runs very small.
4.0,"Cute pattern, but oddly shaped (at least for my body type). Material shows every flaw, I thought it would be more flowing."
4.0,Arrived in a few days my aunt seems to like them for driving at night. When ever I peered through them they just seemed like yellow tented glasses.i don't know what made them polarized.i have a pair of as seen on TV that works better
4.0,Love this... Beautiful
4.0,these soxs are comfortable and a grea value
4.0,I like it so much.. but it is a little bit small than I expected. I  will recommend it.
4.0,"Love the color and the quality doesn't seem too bad. My feet started aching in a couple of hours though, but I guess that's true for most heels."
4.0,Got for youth group
4.0,Size runs very small. If you are a large the large barely fits. Quality is excellent!!
4.0,Great colors and fit I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 - 147 pnds and bought a medium- the only thing is fabric is a bit cheap
4.0,This is not light tan like the picture. Sandal is a lot darker in person. Son says they feel heavy.
4.0,Fits perfect looks so cute
4.0,I took a star off because of the fabric. It says cotton/polyester in the description and 100% cotton on the label. No way.. there is some spandex in it. It is true to size. If you want what the pic looks like then go up two sizes. I am 5'2 210lbs and the 3X fits great. It's big enough to flow over leggings and cover the butt well. I just wish it didn't have the spandex in it. I still like it tho' and will keep.
4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this dress. On one hand, it fit me wonderfully and I received more compliments than I can count. On the other hand, the white lining was SO SHORT until I was constantly tugging on it all night. So, if you want a nice fitting dress that photographs well, this dress if for you (assuming you won‚Äôt be moving around a lot because it will ride up and show your goodies). If you want a carefree dress that will stay in place while you enjoy your evening, keep it moving. Also, I machine washed it and turned out just fine.<br /><br />I normally wear a US size 4/6 and the small fit me fine. I am 5‚Äô7 and wore 2.5 inch heels in the photos."
4.0,"I have several of these ""swing dress"" type tops with pockets and love them! The only thing I would change is the lighter color tops, I wish they were a little less ""see through"" material. Other than that, fabulous!!!!"
4.0,"The ""POLICE"" logo on the hat looked a lot bigger in the picture than it does on the real hat. It looked pretty good though and it was a great fit. I liked the ""POLICE"" detail on the back also."
4.0,I liked the shape and comfort but it doesn't fit well because they are big(wide). Sent them for replacement.
4.0,Bigger than specify. I ordered the small and it feels more like a medium. A little big. Other than that great.
4.0,Flattering fit. Has big pockets.
4.0,bright colors and nice top
4.0,Nicely finished.
4.0,I like the shine.
4.0,Good shoe but the laces come out easily. Toddler pulled them out the first time they were worn.
4.0,"Came on time, super cute and very soft. My only issue is that it came with a snag on the band as you can see in the picture. It was very easy to switch the band and to adjust it. I have small wrists and it fits great, it dries fast after hand washing. I would recommend 110%"
4.0,The Swing dress is just perfect for summer. It‚Äôs comfy and made of non wrinkle material. Easy to pack.
4.0,"It fit  a tiny bit smaller than expected- but it was forgiving and stretchy. My husband gives it 5 stars. The chest part wasn‚Äôt covering my 36B chest- the fabric kept uncovering my breast. I bought a medium. Super cute, and the easy access was fun!"
4.0,"These Alboria PJs are super comfortable. They are navy blue and white (the striped accent at the throat, hem and trimming the shorts), nautically inspired. This two-piece set is lightweight and comfortable. The fabric is a delightful blend of polyester and spandex. The top is short sleeved, and the shorts are traditional, not cute short. However, be careful when ordering. These do appear to run small. And finally, the pockets are a nice touch but totally unnecessary. Overall, these are decent. I give them 3.5 stars."
4.0,I got the cute color ones and I love them! They are a tad small and the colors aren‚Äôt noticeable unless direct light is hitting them but they are CUTE for festivals or parties! One picture is with flash and one without.
4.0,omg these feel amazing to wear even after a couple months. I have not worn comfier undies then these they feel so soft and nice. and they do well handling sweat to.  but they are starting to wear out a bit.
4.0,Fit was great.  Sleeves were not too long for a change!  The only issue is that it is extremely low cut.  I just tacked it together up a bit higher so not quite so much cleavage was showing.
4.0,Great for walking the dog at night when you need both hands so you can‚Äôt carry a flashlight.
4.0,"Really love this shoe!  Very comfy.  The reason for 4 stars is that after wearing the shoe for about 6 weeks, it has stretched to the point where I need to buy insoles to make them fit.  Still, a nice shoe."
4.0,"Very Happy with this ring, it's beautiful and although it is very big I wear it on my middle finger and it has been fine. Gorgeous!"
4.0,Fit was right on target. Grandson loved it.
4.0,I love it. It's true to size.  I usually wear a 2x and that's what I ordered
4.0,The color is as expected but it is a bit short in the torso I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 98lbs and it was a bit short for me
4.0,Super cute but the smell is AWFUL. I haven't washed yet but I'm sure it'll come out. Material is super nice.
4.0,"Looks just as pictured, maybe the purple is a bit lighter color then pictured, but its very close! It  is comfortable to wear. Good value for the price. I wouldn't wear it daily, but for occasional wear its perfect."
4.0,It meets my expectations
4.0,"I use this crinoline under a ski dress. I had an unfortunate incident where my skirt and the slip caught a tree. To my delight, the slip tore away where snagged and didn't unravel. I know this sounds strange, but my previous crinoline would yank me backwards when I caught it on something. I will definitely be ordering more.<br /><br />As with previous reviewers, I found the slip runs quite large. I ordered a size smaller than my dimensions, but will order two sizes smaller next time."
4.0,She thinks they are pretty
4.0,Beware. The sizes on these flip flops run small. I got a small for my Mom. Her normal shoe size is 5.5. The size on  the shoes say 6-7 but fit perfect. She says they are super comfortable. I would buy them again.
4.0,"I'm a 50 year old guy, and I maintain the piercings I got in my college days. I prefer hoops to posts, and the smaller the better. It's hard to find good hoops that aren't either a pain in the rear to get in, or cause problems for your skin. These are the easiest I've owned in locking down. Piece of cake. My only complaint: they tend to come undone a little easier. I have big fleshy lobes, and keeping hoops in is a chore. That said, I love the color. Stainless has not caused any problems for the skin or ears. Definitely a must buy if you like hoops."
4.0,Got these for my bridesmaids. They are very yellow gold but super sparkly. They loved them!
4.0,Would‚Äôve gave five stars but the battery does not last that long I wear it every day and I have it on low and I only get about three hours out of it plus the battery takes forever to charge other than that though it‚Äôs a very good quality first and once the heat is inside it does keep the heat in the vest would recommend just to buy an extra battery if you work outside
4.0,"it is a really beautiful necklace.  the pendant has fallen off a couple of time, the piece needs to be tightened.  I get lots of complements on it, even from people who don't know doctor who."
4.0,A little pricey  and a little on the heavy side but worth it
4.0,"I purchased this belt for myself.  It is true to size, I ordered a Size Large and it fits perfectly.  This belt seems like a high quality and is made of 100% leather.  The buckle is a nice quality, not too big nor too small, it is a nice silver finish.  The loop where you insert excess belt is not attached at all to the belt and it actually fell off and I had issues finding it.  I wish it was attached, so it wouldn't fall off. It is constructed well and looks great with jeans.  Overall I am happy with the quality and look of this belt.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I depend on customer reviews when making purchases and take pride in providing honest opinions on all products I purchase."
4.0,I have used these drops for the past two years and I find that you have to use them every day.  They are for the most satisfactory when the water<br />temperature is cooler than the air temperature.
4.0,I got it for a friend for her birthday and she liked it very much
4.0,"The quality of the tie is really good, in the picture, it looks better than realty, but it's still a beautiful tie."
4.0,"I love the style but I'd like it more if it had a pin insert so I don't smack my hand on the pin backs when I get inside my bag, there is no liner or inside pockets which kinda sucks but it was the size I wanted and it does the trick for what I want."
4.0,"I like this jacket and it fits as it should,good quality feeling leather. Check the colors."
4.0,"It's very pretty and shiny. The chain is quite sturdy, however the trinket is a bit on the small side."
4.0,Much smaller than I expected.  To pick them up from the jewelry box is challenging for my big fingers.  I knew they would be small but didn't realize just how small 2-3 mm really is.  I should have purchased larger ones.
4.0,Noisier than expected unfortunately.
4.0,The material felt amazing and wicked away sweat.  I am 5‚Äô8.5 and weigh 143lbs and got a L (I have a long torso) but probably could gotten a M.  The front is a little longer than the back
4.0,"If you are tall, like me, this may fit you a little strange. It was quite tight over the shoulder and across the chest -  and the back lands right above my crack. It has small padded inserts over the chest which was nice. When I swim it does feel a little like my chest is going to escape from the sides, but it is a great value for the price. Techs suits can be very expensive."
4.0,"They're really cute earrings and are surprisingly comfortable. Only problem is my ears are pretty small and some of them fit but others are too long and the stone is in the way so it won't hook onto my ear. I plan to just grab some pliers and bend the hook a little lower, but its something to keep in mind before buying"
4.0,Beautiful blouse. I love it. Can wear it dressy or casual with jeans. It's a little small around my arms and slightly around my chest but not enough that i have to return it. It's very elegant. Order 2-3 sizes larger. I ordered a size up really needed to order 2 sizes up.
4.0,Compliments a classic look.
4.0,I ordered the wrong ones. I thought these were The no ride up briefs. Pouch isn‚Äôt really a pouch but the material is great. Highly recommend if You like your briefs ride up.
4.0,My wife really likes this. It's a very thin material so she uses it over her bathing suit around the pool or beach.
4.0,"If you're looking for a good sports band, this is one to consider.<br /><br />PROS: soft silicon is comfortable to wear all day, breathable for workouts also.<br /><br />One of the few sports bands with holes that also has DARK Clasp/buckle.  99% of the bands have silver clasp/buckles for some reason.<br /><br />Good color choices.<br /><br />Easy to install with quick release<br /><br />CONS: runs a bit short in length, so if you have big wrists or prefer to wear your watch loose on the wrist; it might not work for you.<br /><br />Overall, a good sports band to consider."
4.0,"Bought this as the size was the largest I could find, but the only way I could wear it on a windy day was to add a tie so it would not blow away.  The brim was a bit bigger than I imagined.  I live in the high desert and this keeps my neck and face from burning."
4.0,"Thin, polyester feel. Ample size and not tight in the ankles. I don't  like that there is no fiber content listed anywhere on the packaging or on socks themselves. I was thinking these would be mostly cotton from the product description, but sadly it does not appear to be the case."
4.0,"If this has been packed a bit better, I would have given it 5 stars for the money. As it was smashed  flat, the mask is warped. Best scenario would be to keep it on a head form. Fits tight and will look good with a black stocking over your face!"
4.0,The strap is the only thing i dont like.  Its unraveling. I just sewed it up. Strap also causes a little discomfort if its on the back of my head and i lay on back of my head
4.0,Great pants I liked them so much I went and ordered another color already. However the size xl feels more like a size 12 rather than 16.
4.0,"I wish they could be flipped up when not in use, which they don't. So when not in use they have to be taken off and unfortunately laid down and misplaced."
4.0,This rings looks more expensive and is a very good product for the money.
4.0,This did help putting my pads back in not as easy to use as shown but does work.
4.0,I love this ring.. very beautiful for that price point
4.0,Little snug in the butt area with not too much crotch room. Kind of like low rides. They eventually stretch out. Good pants
4.0,"This top was a little thinner than I expected but I really love it! Its comfortable, fits well and just the kind of tank I have been looking for to work out in."
4.0,"Great sunglasses, came as described, good fit for my face."
4.0,It fits well and is light weight.  Good value for the money.
4.0,I bought these for a wedding. They're so simple yet elegant. I ordered 6.5 and they fit my feet great. They're comfortable at first but might hurt after a while if you walk/dance too much. Overall good heels.
4.0,"Looks great! Low cost!  Would of liked to have them made from a more substantial metal than the material used for the holding mechanism.  Guess you really don't need it since they are only a cuff link, just hope the internals don't wear out too soon."
4.0,"Great piecing, just a little bit too short on the nose hook part. Very well constructed though."
4.0,Bought one size smaller and fit perfectly.  I just did not anticipate that the lace would hang down and not be attached. The last two inches or so of the lace just hangs there which I find to be a bit odd. I might try to attach it somehow. Otherwise very pretty.
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful, a little small but worth the price"
4.0,"If I could give this a 4.5 stars, I would! I bought this for my senior prom  and holy cow! The colors are gorgeous, and the top is very well supported even for a girl as busty as I (I'm in a 42E) am. :) My only complain was the sewing job being ever so slightly dodgy in some areas but nothing that couldn't be fixed with some old fashioned hand sewing in a few places. It got here extremely early, much earlier than it was supposed to be, (four days early, and the 22nd was the earliest!) I know that nobody else will have a dress quite like this one at my prom!<br /><br />Overall, it's gorgeous, fit perfectly, and is worth more than I paid for, even with the minuscule issues. :)"
4.0,"This is really good quality! (I bought the green one, but it's really more of a turquoise like in the picture) It's soft, with a seemingly delicate material and fits baggy like in the picture, but that's only because I ordered a size up (I usually wear S so I got an M). I'm 5'5 and weigh 101 pounds and this was perfect. It goes really well with this soft white skirt I also bought from Amazon."
4.0,"Very stylish gloves but I do agree with some of the other reviews. These are not good for lengthy amounts of time in the cold, but they get the job done overall."
4.0,"This bra definitely serves its purpose and is worlds better than traditional strapless bras (honestly the worst things to endure for an evening), but it did lack a bit of lift. The price made it well worth it!"
4.0,"Well, they had a good, hard summer and now it's time for the post-mortem.  First thing to know is these are rubberized pants and it's just like being inside of a Godzilla suit.  They're going to be hot, and with a similar gold shirt it's life-threateningly hot.  Second thing to know is that they don't stretch all that well, so sure enough I ripped 'em getting out of a car.  The third thing is that you better know how to dance, because women are just gonna drag you out onto the floor when they see you.<br /><br />I think I could have got a lot more out of them by taking them to their destination and putting them on there, instead of trying to drive around in them.  Honestly, we're talking about some really wild, delicate clothing and if you're going to party like a rock star in it, you're gonna wear it out fast.  And it was totally worth it!"
4.0,"Really cute. The necklaces don‚Äôt come apart, so you can‚Äôt wear one or the other, which is the only reason I gave it four stars. I got a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"I've noticed that dresses like this have started popping up everywere since the Sabrina and Wednesday shows have grown so popular.<br />Me? I just like the style.<br />After checking the other reviews first, I got the dress a size up, and I'm glad I did.<br />Everything fits.. though maybe not comfortably. The sleeves are perfect for my long arms and the length is great. It's the shoulders.. When lifting your arms, the dress rides up quite a bit, and you can't reach forward much without the shoulders getting tight.<br />The material is okay. It's not scratchy but neither is it soft, it feels like a decent costume. And I wouldn't go wearing it around in the snow but it could be worn on a cooler day.<br /><br />Overall: This would be great for Halloween, costume parties, fan events, and more.. just maybe not for everyday wear."
4.0,This is a nice watch. be careful with adjusting the band because the wood can splinter and brake apart.
4.0,Bought for fashion statement for grandson. He was pleased.
4.0,"Cheap, had to re sew tie holder on the back"
4.0,quality item. its just the size of a baby blanket. maybe thats my fault. i dunno.
4.0,This bicycle bag is very well made and durable.  It fits onto a bike well which is most important.  The bag is on the small side so it holds minimal stuff.  This makes it perfect for shorter bike rides.  Just be sure to note the size and if you think that would work for you the bag is of good quality.
4.0,"Born and raised in New Orleans, needed some inexpensive mask for a party at exercise class... These mask are perfect... I am very pleased with them and would totally recommend purchasing these mask..."
4.0,I was super excited to buy this sweater and I love how it fits I'm just disappointed that it doesn't go off the shoulder very well. It is very comfortable and it feels like great quality. I would have given it 5 stars if it fit off the shoulder a little better.
4.0,"Item fits as it's supposed to, but be careful. It might arrive kinda folded up on the print part as it did mine, so it's a bit stuck together. Luckily it was only on one side. So I carefully pulled it apart while using a blow dryer. Some of the blue got on the pink part, but its only noticeable up close."
4.0,prettty
4.0,"Yes, they are what they claim to be, sunglasses.  And yes, they clip on regular prescription glass perfectly well,  But the problem with these (and I assume, with almost all sunglasses that do not wrap around the eyes -- not limited to these) is that when sun angles in such a way that it hits the inside surface of the glass, i.e., the surface close to your eyes -- all you get is a washout of the image you are looking at.  And the darker the sunglasses, the more the image is washed out because you essentially are looking at the sun reflecting back into your eyes.<br /><br />The yellow color version is less of a problem because it lets more light from what you are looking at get into your eyes, so reflected surface light from the sun doesn't wash out the image as much as the darker glasses.  With the darker ones, if you are walking with the sun on at your side or overhead or behind you, you can see practically nothing unless you put your hand up to your forehead to block the sun from hitting the inside surface of the sunglasses.  If you wear a baseball cap with a front brim or visor to block the sunlight, it will help to stop that really awful reflection the glass creates, but wearing these without something on your head to stop the sun from hitting them, especially the dark ones (which, btw, are very dark, I would say quite a bit darker than you'd expect) , walking in bright sunlight could dangerously impaired your sight."
4.0,"This hat is a perfect fit, and it makes a subtle statement to my beliefs."
4.0,"Nice dres, fits well too"
4.0,Cute shirt design. Sizes seem to run small. I bought an XXL (usually wear a M) wanting to use it as a sleep shirt but it‚Äôs not as big as I wanted. Somewhat baggy but seems more like a large than an XXL.
4.0,Nice quality for $. Would buy again
4.0,Not a real fan of the material but the print was nice<br /><br />So I gave it as a gift for a friend of mine who gave to her sister
4.0,"I bought this in green XL. The color is great, and being 5'11, the length is perfect.<br />The only two issues, which is why there are 4 stars, are:<br />1. it's see-through. your will need to wear a slip. 2. it is small in the chest/low cut. I'm a 46C and my boobs pop out a tad. I love this dress, so i will figure out a way to make it work though!"
4.0,"was a little scratchy at first, but after initial wash is better now"
4.0,"This dress is made of truly beautiful fabric, shiny & sophisticated, but not scratchy or uncomfortable. I also like the fact that it had long sleeves (most of the party dresses I looked at were short-sleeved or even sleeveless) so it was a good choice for New Year's Eve. HOWEVER, when you look at the size chart, you should be aware that the measurement shown includes a good bit of overlap, particularly at the waistline, and so the actual measurement that it will cover is a good bit smaller. I got an XL. It measured 51&#34; at the waistline, but because of the button placement, it was snug around my 38&#34; rib cage (the waist is high & sits at the rib cage just under the bust, rather than at the natural waistline.) I will either wear it open, as a duster, or add an extra loop in a more comfortable position for the button when closed."
4.0,These are a great find and fit my glasses perfectly.  I can keep a pair in the car and my bag so I always have them with me.
4.0,Ordered Small but runs little big. I had to stitch and adjust to fit it on me well. but worth the price
4.0,If the material was a little thicker it would be perfect. Love the color.
4.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous and I feel gorgeous in it! The reviews are right, it does run small. I originally purchased a small but have since purchased a medium because I just couldn't make the small work. I will give updates once the medium arrives."
4.0,"Ok I've been wearing this for about a month. It does run small, size up. I'm 165 pounds and XL barely fit me, at first. It was sooo tight in the first row of hooks, barely closed, and it was hard to breathe but I wore it for 2 hrs, then it got less tight. After a couple wears, it's fitting better. I don't know if because I lost inches but, I can wear it comfortably now on the second row of hooks. Give it a shot."
4.0,"Love the looks of this, it matches the satin gold of my Apple Watch perfectly. I don't know about durability yet as I just got it. I signed up for a free 12 month extended Warranty for a total of 24 months, but I haven't received an email notification of it yet. It said a confirmation email was sent to my email, but have not received it.<br />Love the ease of resizing!!! The only downside is it's not so easy for me to put on. Overall, I give it 4 stars for value!"
4.0,"Good cut.  The flares are a bit wider than I expected, but not comically large.  Comfortable through the waist, hips and legs.  Good color.  Nice, thick denim."
4.0,"Product was very nice and a lovely gift. It was much smaller than expected which is why the 4 star rating. Maybe mention the size/dimensions moving forward. We bought other pendants to match - all the same size except this one. Other than the size, the service, shipping and product made for an overall good experience."
4.0,Color was a little orange. But I made it work
4.0,good deal. too bad i didn't read when i bought two. ended up with 'blue' which is a pretty bright and bold blue. wish i had black...doh.
4.0,They came in very well packed looks also premium. The are okay in terms of sun filter. You only get what you pay for so not a bad deal.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5
4.0,I ordered a lot Russell hoodies and sweatshirts. Later to find out they were all too big. I suggest ordering a  size smaller than usual as every one swallowed me. :-)<br />Update: The colors were off. Not what I expected. Yet still like the warm hoodies!
4.0,"It is exactly as depicted. Its cute, pinappley and is a functional wrist watch. Two reasons it is not 5 stars. The first day I wore it the band became disconnected from the watch. Thankfully it was an easy fix with pliers. Secondly, it picks up color from clothing. I tend to wear dark cardigans and the band has started to turn black in just a week.  I would purchase it again because it is an adorable pineapple watch for super cheap."
4.0,"good product, the labels peel of a bit though"
4.0,I feel that it met all expectations.
4.0,Little baggy but still cute.
4.0,It's a lot of dress for the price! Purchased for my daughter's formal wedding this Christmas. I ordered a size larger but still too small.Took to tailor had a lattice back to replace zipper. I also had the extra little drape removed. It's worth the price even if you need alterations.
4.0,It appears true to what is advertised. Small enough to be feminine but well made to be stylish. Seems great
4.0,I love the fit & feel of the pants. The shirt is a little too short for me.<br />Love the pockets in the pants!
4.0,This is nice for sure! I love the flowiness to it and the sleeves are fleece like!
4.0,The socks were just as advertised.  They fit my big feet.
4.0,Actually really like this one despite being so inexpensive.
4.0,"I have been looking for cuff-links for my son. When I came across them, I said yes this will be it. Once I ordered these from the seller and it came to me so swiftly I was already in love. Then I placed these cuff-links in his shirt for his pre-birthday celebration and they worked perfectly. The pi sign is not only creative, but it brings awareness of how important math is in this day in age. It has easy latches to put them inside the whole of your shirt on both given arms. Once you have secured it on the shirt, it does not go anywhere from there.  I would recommend this to anyone who knows the importance of fashion, as well as math. The seller did a great job shipping this product, and would consider buying more products from them.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a deeply discounted rate for my unbiased opinion."
4.0,I like these but they slip off your ears easily otherwise theyre cute to put with certain hairstyles and if you can keep them on
4.0,"I got this as a birthday gift for my wonderful fianc√© and he absolutely loves it! Easily hooked on, stays on, and is pretty fashionable while also looking classy - yay!"
4.0,"My husband loves these outfits. He's 6'7 & weighs 265. We bought the 3X which fits him well but would snatch up more if they offered them in a 4X. I see customers talking about shrinkage & fuzz...Well, I wash them in cold water, hand wash cycle, & line dry NOT THE DRYER. I've had no problems with shrinkage (~3 washes since purchase). As for fuzz, the gray sets do not have any but I did notice some on the black sets (pics coming) around the pockets, between the legs, & the butt area. I just used a de-fuzzer & poof...all gone. All-in-all, Screenshot has great items & I recommend them. The quality of the material is equal to what you would walk into a store & buy & the price is just as accurate for the product. Keep up the good work Screenshot & let me know when you start offering those 4XLs!!!"
4.0,It runs very large.  I have returned an XXL and requested an XL.  That was on 7/6 and nothing yet.
4.0,Bought for a friend. It came on time & seemed to be nice
4.0,"Really nice, soft, but just a little smaller than I hoped"
4.0,"Its good for 2 bucks, a little tough to get on, but its nice for the price"
4.0,"I like it,but the band rolls up. I still wear it night and day and it is very comfortable."
4.0,It's a cute necklace. When I ordered it I didn't realize it was for a child. It fits all right but is a bit on the small side. It will go well with some earrings of mine.
4.0,a bit long but great product
4.0,Very nice just bnb wished it fit bigger
4.0,For me it was a little right around the arms and bigger in the waist
4.0,"I love this dress; the only down side is the silver stitching is super itchy, but other than that, it looks and fits great."
4.0,Very nice tie but a bit too narrow.
4.0,"I love the fabric and the design.  It's EXACTLY what I was looking for.  However, I ordered a size large when I usually wear a medium (5'7"" 140 lbs).  These technically fit, but they were skin tight and zero breathing room!  I wanted them fitted, but not that tight. I feel like if I even put on a couple pounds that they will no longer fit. I'm exchanging them for an XL."
4.0,"Love this! So many compliments.  Such an easy layer.  And it'll fit for a long time in many Baby stages.  Good for car seat, stroller, or even just hanging out in the backyard.  Only issue was a lack of adequate threading on the collar area was pearl buttons, so one has already come loose after just a couple wearings. :(. Overall,  Very glad I purchased this."
4.0,My daughter loves them!!! The case collapse and folds down when sunglasses are not in them for easy to store away.
4.0,When I opened it it looked really small but I bought it for my mom who is 5'4 and 120 pounds. I ordered her a medium and it fit just right so it worked out. But if I would've ordered a large I probably would've expected it to be bigger than it actually is. Other than that she loved it and it was super cute. Fabric is normal to thin quality nothing warm or thick. Overall a success!
4.0,"I love my hat, i needed the one slouchy and long enough to hold all my hair in, and this hit right in the spot. Little bit snug on my head, but thanks God, doesn't give me headache like my old hat that was really tight.<br />It keeps me really warm and stylish."
4.0,"Good product , but a bit too thin"
4.0,Little hard to wear in hot weather
4.0,This suitcase is well designed.  Extending the handles to the edges seems to open up more room inside the suitcase. The only issue I found is the wheels have shimmy.
4.0,"Trying to avoid the dreaded &#34;Costanza wallet.&#34;  This is perfect for that.  Slips in my front pocket.  Only four stars, rather than five, because my wife thinks it looks dorky, like a wallet made from duct tape."
4.0,"These goggles are great! All I have to do is put them on, tighten them down, and then I CAN SEE UNDER WATER! WOW!<br /><br />The nosepiece is laughable - I couldn't get that sucker to stay on no matter how I oriented it, and my nose isn't even that big.<br /><br />Earplugs are solid, and I'm glad they came with the kit - I would never have known the joy of swimming earplugs had they not come with this setup.<br /><br />My one complaint is the case itself - it's great that everything comes in a neat case, but the case itself is unwieldy and very fragile. Mine slipped off a shower rack and shattered into a few pieces. I lost the earplugs soon after that.<br /><br />That said, these were stolen out of my car not long ago, and I bought a second pair. So I like them enough to buy two pairs. Can you say that about your swim goggles?"
4.0,Fits nicely I'm a 36DD.
4.0,My lady friend said I can‚Äôt wear in public! Maybe a little bit more ah revealing than I thought. Lightweight and comfy tho‚Ä¶
4.0,They are perfect for the holidays!
4.0,"It‚Äôs comfortable with good arch support. Unfortunately, make my feet VERY smelly! :("
4.0,"I used this for my daith piercing and it works well. No irritation. It is slightly hard to get it to click shut in my ear, but I think that's more the location of the piercing than the product itself."
4.0,Ok the pjs are fine but I ordered from a different seller and the material was way better and it had pocket but this pj is just so thin so if that what your looking for its for you . Im looking for thik material with pocket and cozy for the winter.  But it dose come fast.
4.0,Looks good and seems sturdy. Easy to remove links and attach to watch. Rose gold isnt exact match but close enough. Would purchase again.
4.0,All good. I just wish it was black steel not yellow gold color. Tough design won't disappoint. I didnt use the plastic part.
4.0,"Great material, love it, but the length was longer than expected."
4.0,"The ponchos work very well and the hood feature is a nice added feature. The quality is better than expected but can still rip if you are in the woods or catch it on a corner of furniture. For the price, these ponchos are perfect."
4.0,It doesn't fit folders but it's cute!
4.0,Great! Fit very well
4.0,"This is such a pretty necklace, the only thing is the chain feels smaller than 18 in.  I have several necklaces with 18 in. chains and this feels smaller."
4.0,"The sleeves are a bit long, so hubby just pushed them up, which was fine.  He was a bit disappointed that the collar was not of a material that lent itself to standing up as a mandarin collar, like in the product photo.  Overall, it's a nice jacket but I wish the collar actually popped up better as in the photo."
4.0,"My favorite shorts for warm weather, also great for travel with the built in draw strings no belt needed, these are outstanding shorts that I really really like.....the one draw back is the velcro on the pockets. After repeated use the velcro is trying to break free....stronger stitching would be a simple fix at the factory and allow me to love these instead of just really really like."
4.0,I‚Äôm only giving four stars because two or three of them were defected/broken when they arrived. Other than that they‚Äôve served their purchase for what I wanted them for.
4.0,I like the watch but it needs to be a little smaller for my wrist
4.0,Based on other reviews of shirts very similar to this - I ordered way up!!! Thankfully! I'm an Xl and got the 3xl - it fits
4.0,"Beautiful dress!  Great colors (navy with blush, pink, maroon flowers).  Many compliments at the wedding.  It is very sheer so a slip is needed or a one piece undergarment.  It is long for my 5ft 3inch height but worked perfectly with wedges."
4.0,"The band is great, but you can only remove so many links so I can‚Äôt make it quite small enough to fit my wrist"
4.0,Good quality but the sizing recommendation was way off. Wife is normally in the Medium/12 for pants so I ordered an XL for comfort. They fell off her waist. I measured the waist of the pants and they were 32&#34; with the string as tight as possible. They stretch to over 45&#34;. I would order the exact size you normally wear and ignore the recommendations.
4.0,Got this for anxiety attacks. It‚Äôs helpful but also looks so cute on. Would have given 5 stars but the chain broke. Could be I was too rough when changing clothes but I def didn‚Äôt expect it to break so soon. Overall like it
4.0,"Good thick glove. I use them in the dog park and they keep my hands warm. I also keep the gloves in my trunk just in case of emergency, i.e. Winter tire change or snow shoveling."
4.0,I thought the red beads would be large like the black. Plus it came in one case versus 2. I am disappointed that the red bracelet wasn‚Äôt the same size as the black one.
4.0,"I get so many compliments when I wear these shoes. Everyone wants to know where I got them. They do get a bit uncomfortable if I do a lot of walking, especially in hot or humid weather. But you can't beat these for style as long as you're not walking a lot."
4.0,does not stick well you need spirit gum
4.0,I gave this to my sister and it is too small.
4.0,"This shirt was exactly as expected and one that I know I'll get a lot of use out of. It's slightly warm for the spring weather due to the material so this shirt would be better suited for windier days and slight dips in the weather. Due to the mesh panels on the sleeves, you do feel a breeze when the wind blows, but it feels pleasant. The material feels sturdy and is not itchy, or uncomfortable. For only 4.99, this shirt is a STEAL. I plan on buying it it more colors!"
4.0,"looks great. runs a little fast, gains a few minutes every couple of days, but that is to be expected from a non-quartz watch. This being my first pocket watch, I do not have a comparison, but so far I am really enjoying this watch and I am glad that I have it."
4.0,"I like the idea of a calf length dress, and it actually doesn't look bad, but it's just not really my style. I thought if I would ever really wear it and I feel like it's just gonna hang in my closet forever with a ""someday"" label. Returning for that reason. Took one star bc fabric is thin and had some weird black threads inside of the button stitching that i could see thru the folds . It looked like ink marks at first. I didn't take pics, and already repacked it."
4.0,"I love this trainer, it fits nice and tight. I am 5&#34;4 130lbs I ordered a small. I mainly use it in the gym the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have the material inside that makes you sweat. Your sweat is absorbed by the trainer."
4.0,"These gloves were extremely comfortable, kept my fingers nice and warm. Used during 50 degree weather. Looking forward to testing them in colder weather. Griping the handlenars dont me you feel reassured that you are actually holding the handlebars tight enough. They are good for the price that you pay."
4.0,"I like the dress, but don't love it."
4.0,"Actual size as described. Not too big.The only sad thing is the anchor is copper I think (it's brownish under the silver plating). So maybe would suggest taking out before you shower or something, which is kinda annoying. It's also kinda opposite where the ball attached to the anchor attaches to the post where as usually post is attached to the charm. I really like this earring though."
4.0,I purchased this dress for a 1920s party.  I am 5'10' and 135-140lbs I purchased a size small and it fit perfectly.  Not too tight and the material has a little stretch to it.  The length was good.  The straps are adjustable.  The fringe and sequins were very pretty and fun.  The dress did not look cheap at all and I got many compliments on it.<br />I took off one star because it arrived with one strap unattached.  I was able to pin it with a safety pin for the party.
4.0,It's a nice ring especially for the price but the sizing was a little off because my husband wears a 13 so that's what I ordered and the ring was too tight so I would definitely go up 1 size when ordering.
4.0,Very nice set!  Looks good together!!
4.0,Nice for the price. The material is a bit thin.
4.0,"These are the perfect size for what I needed, I have all three pairs on and they look great! Very shiny , have only had them for a few weeks at this point."
4.0,"Really good material, it's comfortable. If you use size 8 please select Small size, Medium is probably more fit for size 10 to 12"
4.0,I liked it for what it‚Äôs for.
4.0,fit very small.
4.0,"I love the pattern, style, and colors. This would have been 5 stars if it was just a little longer. It fits great everywhere else,  but it is too short. I purchased for swimming laps at the gym, so I will keep it because I don't care if it looks cute there. But I can't use it for vacations or the beach because of the awkward length."
4.0,"First, let me say that the dress is absolutely beautiful. The lace detail is very pretty. However, the color is navy, not royal blue. The sizing was great though the area with the belt would have been nicer if you could adjust it smaller as needed. I ended up returning it since my coloring doesn't go good with navy and I really wanted the pretty, bright blue of the picture."
4.0,"My favorite from this company. Made well, no fraying, the bow was secure, they fit wonderfully!"
4.0,"Fits nice, came with hole on shoulder. Stitching could have been nicer"
4.0,"Initially, I was worried about this being too hot in the summer, since it's made of wool, but it's perfectly breathable. The only complaint I have is that the metal part that holds in the adjustable strap is exposed on the inside and digs into your forehead -- not comfortable. It's an easy fix however; you can just sew a thin piece of felt over it on the inside, and all will be well."
4.0,"Pretty and looks nice‚Ä¶I ordered the small, fits like a triple x"
4.0,Nice band. wish it was a thicker leather though.
4.0,Bright red in color and good quality.
4.0,"I liked this Swing Floral Flared Sundress. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me a little is it is a bit thin. It makes it comfortable, but I prefer it to be a little thicker and that is why I took off a star.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean. I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
4.0,"Cute top and very comfortable, but the fabric is super thin and I‚Äôm not sure how durable it will be. Love the fit but I wish they offered an XS."
4.0,Really pretty but kind of see through and 2‚Äù too long
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted , easy to use"
4.0,"These are complicated socks. A lot more thought went into them then I can fathom in one sitting. For instance, there is a band of yellow quilting mid arch, which the description is for wicking during hiking. In case you sweat a lot on the bottom of your feet? I'm a US Man's 9¬Ω which I would have thought would be a medium, but these are almost uncomfortably tight, so if I were to buy these, I'd get a large; especially if I were to use sock liners.<br /><br />Regardless, they have gone out of their way to make a premium feeling product, so I'll give it 4 stars."
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt know they were weighted when I bought them, I can only wear them for about 4 hours until my ears start to hurt but when that happens I just flip them over my ears so the weight won‚Äôt bother me. They are super cute, I find myself wearing them all the time"
4.0,Super cute but jewels are small
4.0,"This arrived quickly and was in good shape upon arrival.<br /><br />Make sure you measure yourself and choose well for the size, as there is no adjustment for this hat at all.  So, if you're close to the size limits, recommend you go higher to ensure a fit, rather than be stuck with a too-tight, too-small hat.<br /><br />The mesh is nice, for ventilation, but the mesh is surprisingly thin and decidedly not sturdy, so the top of the hat tends to sink/droop, which seriously degrades both your look, and the effectiveness of the air flow.  This needs to be addressed and fixed with this product.<br /><br />The chin lanyard is fully adjustable and removable.<br /><br />The hat is somewhat absorbent, but not that much.  The hat band is soft and somewhat absorbent as well.<br /><br />Documentation: you get only two small tags affixed to the hat.  There is no manual or any other paperwork; there is no contact info for the manufacturer.<br /><br />Price: the price is right for this, under $30.  That's pretty good for a good-looking outdoor hat.<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is a nice hat for the price, which fits true to size."
4.0,"If you are a C cup or below, you will love this bra. I am a 40 DDD, and it fit around the band, but the cups were too small. Judging by the way it fit my bust , I don't believe that a DD or a D would be able to wear it either unless you are very small around the band. The material was very comfortable and stretchy, it just didn't fit in the cups area. Gave it to my sister"
4.0,"I bought this mask to go with a pair of shorts I have in the exact print.  It is comfortable, a little thicker material than I expected which I feel is good for every day wear/use.  Would not suggest exercising or activity that causes heavy breathing.  Had an unexpected draw string that helped ensure non sliping."
4.0,I purchased this a few days ago and everything arrived safe and nice like described. This is a nice watch and I'm happy to add it to my collection. I am overall happy with the order :)
4.0,"I received this hoodie through the Amazon Vine Voice program. I requested the size small, and I am glad I did because a medium would have been too big on me. That said, I normally wear a medium because I have a 34DD chest. So I would say that this hoodie runs on the larger size. And, the fabric is 65% cotton  & 35% polyester. Therefore, it feels slick like exercise clothing so I would categorize this as workout clothing as opposed to everyday wear with jeans. In fact, it makes an excellent workout top or cover up for going to the gym. Overall, I like it. It is thin, just loose enough to fit comfortably, and the colors are cool looking. I look forward to wearing this more after winter is over."
4.0,These earrings are a great value for the money.
4.0,The only dislike about this dress is the smell..It smell like it's been sitting in the back of a warehouse and I'm not sure how to get rid of it.
4.0,Very warm and exposing fingers is very handy for working outside with animals.
4.0,Like the colors and graphics. Material does not give or stretch. I would size up next time.
4.0,"Very pretty necklace.  I like the back plate which makes it nice so you can change it out with others or leave it clear (since I wasn't sure what the recipient would like the best.)  My complaints are that it was hard to place the charms in because the hinge isn't strong enough to hold it open.  Also, it doesn't seem to have a magnet to keep it closed.  I would still buy it again though because of the great price and the included crystals."
4.0,"little larger than i expected, but its one size fits all....so not much i can do about it!"
4.0,"This wetsuit jacket seems well-made at a great price point.  We will be returning it because of sizing--the length is too short in the arms and body, but not snug enough over-all (my son is 6'3 and 165 so he is hard to fit, we bought a medium).  I took off a star because there is a brand label marked on the jacket.  The absence of a label was one of the main reasons I had selected this jacket and this was a disappointment."
4.0,Product as described. The breakaway behind the neck comes apart a bit to easy but will still serve it's purpose for me.
4.0,"Beautiful, good quality bracelets. Packaging is also very nice and adds to the gifting experience. Only downside is the edges of the bracelets. Can be painful to put on as it scratches your wrist if you like a more fitted bangle."
4.0,Love the blouse .comfortable but large too big.Medium next time
4.0,"The shirt looks nice, and the material also feels soft. The fit is a little on the bigger side, I would consider going a size down. If you like a baggier/roomier style then just stick your normal size. Overall it is a nice shirt, it would make a nice gift."
4.0,"Super cute and functional tights. I‚Äôve never been a fan of the nylon tights for kids, so these were perfect. 80% cotton, and the rest is spandex/polyester I think which gives it the nice stretch. I ordered the 2-3T size for my tall 20month old and there‚Äôs plenty of room to grow. The non slip bottom does work, very helpful for when running around on wood floors without shoes :)  Very happy with the purchase!"
4.0,It's beautiful but to small for me.  I gave it to my church bookstore.
4.0,"Loved the dress and the pattern.  It fit fine, but the top was a little tight on my arms.  Nothing that time won't fix, but it was a little uncomfortable with such warm material."
4.0,"I got these to wear after getting out of casts (broke both wrists, ouch!) I wanted to keep my hands warm and cushioned as they continue healing.<br /><br />I LOVE the design, not only does it look simple and elegant, but the ribbing helps these wristies snug onto my arms, and feels comforting. And the extra coverage for the thumb is greatly appreciated. So many designs just leave the thumb out in the cold, so to speak.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that these are not as soft as the makers advertise. The yarn has a nice sheen and color‚Ä¶ however: there may be some alpaca wool in this blended yarn, but not very much. I have alpaca sweaters, so know what this should feel like. I‚Äôd guess the yarn is mostly acrylic with maybe 10-20% alpaca. Seems like the manufacturer should have to list fiber content, yes? And for the price, there should be better quality in the yarn.<br /><br />That said, I‚Äôll probably order a second pair because the design is doing the exact job I need right now."
4.0,THis sandal was shiny and felt comfortable.  It fit in length but not in width.  Narrow to normal sized woman‚Äôs  foot i would think would be too wide.  A wide woman‚Äôs foot would work or a man‚Äôs foot.  But too girly looking for a man.
4.0,"I love it, just wish the chain was a little heavier."
4.0,"I liked the comfort and ability to loosen or tighten the waist. Love, love the color! They run bigger than I thought they would! The tie was perfect because they did run bigger than I thought! I am completely satisfied."
4.0,"It was a little tight, but it's super soft. It has such a perfect stretch. I might buy a size up in another color."
4.0,"Got it for a gift, so I can‚Äôt comment on functionality. It looks great. Only issue I have is it came already running, so I do worry about battery life."
4.0,These were super snug and compressive on my feet - I have fat feet with high arches and they may have been a little too tight if left on long enough<br />However the main thing I was looking for is low ankle compression and the ankle had no compression at all<br />For most feet and those not needing ankle compression these would probably be excellent
4.0,Cute earrings but they are not leather. More like a foam.
4.0,its great but do go a size down for example i measured a size &#34;27 in waist i ordered a small i shouldve ordered an xs
4.0,"Nice set for the price! A 2T fit my 21/2 yr old son pretty well. My only complaint would be that the shirt isn't long enough to stay tucked in. But other than that, it served us well."
4.0,"Reasonable quality, but looks a lot better than a clip on bowtie once you learn to tie it and practice."
4.0,"Very soft, lightweight and comfortable material. You can probably also use these as swim trunks. I think they are very nice for the price."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful but the sleeves were too big and the hem was too long.  It was my fault for not giving you the measurements, but we are having the alterations done and this dress fits my neice so good.  She loves it."
4.0,"I wear this shirt exclusively. I love the look and fit. I find it incredibly comfortable.<br /><br />As to what others say about it wrinkling: this is true, but in my experience only up until you wash the shirt 5 or so times. After washes and wear, the shirt does seem to live up to its description, and becomes comfortable and clean-looking. (In any case, if you‚Äôre worried, the navy and dark navy show wrinkles the least.)<br /><br />I do hem the shirts, as I prefer to have the option to untuck my shirts. This is not a problem with the shirt, in my opinion. Out of the box, they are entirely too long to wear untucked, though this has the benefit of making it so that, when tucked, they will stay that way.<br /><br />I wish there were more color options available (perhaps a dark brown, a red, or a maroon), though the option for white does leave open the door for dyeing."
4.0,"Good quality leather, good construction, but definitely not large.<br />There was a little corrosion on the brass, but that happens as the tannins leech out of the leather.<br />Works great as a small gym bag, or edc murse.<br />It won't hold a laptop, but you could get a change of clothes and size 12 shoes in here."
4.0,Good product and it arrived on time
4.0,The written sentiment in the box was written in a very small text. It was a bit hard to read.
4.0,Using less sun block which has to be a good thing!
4.0,If your like me and have many credit cards this product is for you. So far it has worked out for me great. The only thing I didn't care for is the felt cover. I personally would of liked something more eye catching like leather or a designed cover but overall its pretty good for what I needed it for.
4.0,It‚Äôs comfortable but the pants are fitted a bit weird it all fits the pants are just weirdly tight around thighs and hips
4.0,best quality around
4.0,Not bad only the thickness is less apart from that everything good.. and design coud be better
4.0,Really nice. Runs true to size.
4.0,"I'm attempting to buy my 3rd color, so as one might surmise, I do love this hat and wear it a TON, still looks new. However... its sizing, in extremely lame fashion, seems to be different for the colors they deem wee little teeny-headed girls VS colossally-domed dudemen. And the non-pink colors... well, who's to even guess whether they are supposed to be for Barbie or GI Joe?! Apparently this otherwise fairly fem lady mostly likes the man colors better. First one was a nice dark teal - would look good atop any pronoun-user IMO: ""girl"" sizing. Second & third attempts, light khaki and a nice olive green color. Again, look great on anyone. Surprise, whopper cranium sizing! Whoops, now the small khaki is sold out. Found the olive elsewhere though, yay. 4rd attempt, pewter. ARRRGH dude sizing again!!! Anyway, I'm crossing my fingers for a size small in Pewter, and advising a deep breath and preparing for returns if you get anything that doesn't look like it goes with a Dream House doll set. *mutter mutter*"
4.0,They're comfortable but too hot for summer time
4.0,I ordered this dress for a upcoming trip to Florida. I‚Äôm a relatively small person and have become used to the fact I will usually always have to alter my clothing. Same goes for this dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 110 pounds and I am going to have to bring this dress in some in the middle. The length is great and Vneck isn‚Äôt too deep or over revealing. I do have to note the seam inside the dress that runs under the bust across the waist is pretty annoying against my skin. But other then that its a pretty great simple dress.
4.0,A bit snug on wide feet but really soft and cute. They since have loosened a little bit on her and will last the winter we'll I think
4.0,"My husband has a normal sized mans wrist and this was almost too short. Otherwise, it seems well made, nice material, sturdy hardware."
4.0,"I loved the outfit and my girl was the cutest bat ever for Halloween, But the ears do not stand up at all they flop right over. I suggest buying this outfit but purchasing a headband that are ears instead! I had to have the ears stuffed with stuffing and wire to hold them up. But, still wasn‚Äôt to big of a hassle."
4.0,"This face cover is very thin and breathable and work good to cover your face with, no filter in this one"
4.0,"Very cute...very small. I purchased these for my 11 y/o g‚Äôdaughter who‚Äôs begging for ‚Äúdanglies‚Äù. The only negative is the link holding the carrot is very fragile, weak and cheap looking."
4.0,"Like most items sized with a very big waist, it's assumed you must be 6'5&#34; so these are a few inches too long. The slick fabric doesn't stay rolled up so I'm not sure if it's hemable or just something I'll have to live with.<br /><br />Still a 4 Star product, just be aware of the leg length."
4.0,Husband was happy with them
4.0,"comfortable, accurate, easily adjustable"
4.0,"For the price, this is a great dress.  I'm 5ft7 so it was short so I wore it with leggings."
4.0,I love the ratcheting belt.  Easy to use and fits regardless.
4.0,Liked the shirt very much but had to return because it was too small.  The return process was easy and quick and I will re-order a large size.
4.0,"A well built cycling shoe.  I have probably 200 miles on these so far.  Thick heavy lugs help on muddy trails.  Stiff, so not that great for prolonged walking."
4.0,"The color is really vibrant and happy, the dress is flattering and cute. I got a lot of compliments on them BUT it was a struggle to find the right bra AND panties to go with it because its definitely a little see-through."
4.0,I like it but it's a bit more 'summery&#34; than I was hoping for - the material is very light/lose weave - more like a Summer hat. I was going for Fall.  It will do nicely though!
4.0,"It is a pretty blouse, really good material. I do recommend for this reasonable price. Unfortunately, I have to return the blouse.It is run too large. I was reading some of the reviews and they said run 2 sizes smaller. I wanted M, so I bought XL. Prepared of the diff in 2 sizes. In the pic, you can see that brust is 40&#34;.. blouse became too large !"
4.0,I could have ordered one size up
4.0,Well made dress. I just need to drop a few pounds to look more elegant in it.
4.0,Would have given this 5 stars if it would have gone over my head. That's what I thought it would have done. Some time I like the option to hang it around my neck and hold it close to my heart. That option isn't offered here. Other then that the item got here on time and it is beautiful. Thank you.
4.0,"1)Product looks great, but enclosed screw drivers lasted long enough to unscrew one side and did nothing on other side.<br />They apparently stripped and just spin in the screws. I even cut off the old broken band and held pin with a needle nose plier and was unable to loosen screw from either side.<br />What size torx  is it? A #5 or 6?<br />I will give a rating after I get it on my wrist.<br />I was hoping to be wearing it today.<br />Thanks, Fred<br />PS I am being forced to give a star rating by amazon.<br />2)Next day, I bought a #6 Torx screwdriver of better quality and had it apart in a few minutes.<br />Put band on and it was a little large. Using the enclosed tool, I removed a link and put it back together. Fits great now.<br />I edited my post and will give a higher rating. Link tool worked great.<br />Thanks, Fred"
4.0,"Very nice bracelet, just a tad smaller wrist size than I expected but it is still very nice.  It is a gift"
4.0,"The shoe is very well made and (my hub says) fits comfortably. However, when we took them out of the box, one shoe had its strap pulled so tightly back that it took a screwdriver to get the snap opened to pull it out. Other than that, all is well!"
4.0,"I used this for two weeks on vacation. It was excellent but I have one design complaint - the cable inside the strap which prevents someone from cutting the strap digs into your shoulders while wearing. Though the strap is wide, it is just fabric covering the cable with no other comfort built in to make for a wider pressure point. I didn't overfill the purse but found it got very uncomfortable if worn for a day out exploring. Please consider this when designing the next version of it. Otherwise happy with the bag knowing my ID and cards were safe."
4.0,Ran a little large but worked. Would be super warm if worn outside in the cold. It was very hot wearing inside.
4.0,Love this out fit I'm tall so I was worried it wouldn't be long enough but I was wrong can't wait to wear this to a wedding...
4.0,"I'm a teacher and like to look professional in my sweaters. Unfortunately, my classroom is always warm, even in winter. These dickies are great to wear under sweaters or other tops. Definitely size up if you want to button the top button."
4.0,The shirt looks black (until I used a flash as seen in the photos). Overall good. Feels like cotton but is poly/acrylic/spandex blend. Not terrible for the price.
4.0,"I'm reeeealy short-waisted so it's hard to find things that fit.  Had my fingers crossed but this was just a little too long in the torso, and when the waist of this style of dress hits low, I just look like a big block, lol!  It's super cute though.  Bummed it didnt work out!"
4.0,They look beautiful on
4.0,Love it. Looks great. Fits great. Seems like its well made and going to last.
4.0,Smaller glasses than anticipated... More of a girl's size
4.0,Looks good on the car and I like the stripes. In terms of durability I haven't jad enough time to see if it holds up thru all the seasons.
4.0,"I got the burgundy. It‚Äôs cute, not see through, and the print is as pictured."
4.0,"I waited a little while (only about 4-5 wears) before writing my review on this and I am glad I did because I love EVERYTHING about this scarf except that the black has started to rub off onto the white and it is now dirty looking. This makes me sad but I still love it, it is very warm!"
4.0,Very warm and comfortable. I wish they had some heel connection so they would slip off so easy.
4.0,Day mode setting was broken!
4.0,"This is an elegant looking watch. The gold plated frame and digits contrast really well with the obsidian background and black leather band. The classic style accentuates the watch. As a result, this watch can be worn to formal events. Just my personal preference but a metal band would have been better. Many people probably like the black leather band as is.  The watch has a certain heft to it so you definitely know you are wearing a watch."
4.0,"Great Dress, fit great. Wore it so reception the snap that keeps the girls covered was poorly stitched and didn't snap. I had to improvise last minute with tank top under it. Color is great too. Ordered a M 5'1 150lb."
4.0,Excelente tela muy c√≥modos
4.0,Fits great on my 10 year old. Cute and safe at the same time. Breathable & comfortable. Great for outside while not having to wear a mask.
4.0,"I really like these leggings. They're soft, extremely comfortable, and the print is very cute. They seem like they're well made, but I'll update as they get more wear.<br /><br />The one thing that surprised me is that they're branded differently than advertised. I ordered three pairs of these VIV leggings, but the tags have different name brands on them. And, the waists are different among the brands: two came with 1/2 inch elastic, and the other came as a yoga top. I thought this was a bit misleading and confusing."
4.0,Very elegant. Ordered several as bridesmaids gifts. The adjustable sizing makes it very convenient. Not sure how it will hold up in the long run.
4.0,I'm 5'7 and these pants in size medium were slightly short for me but otherwise fit very nicely. They are a nice material and I'm excited to use them on my trip to Thailand this summer where it will be incredibly hot! The linen fabric is very light and airy! :)
4.0,"I got the pink gingham style peter pan collar shirt in Size Small. I am 5 feet tall, 120 lbs., 32DD bust. The shirt fits fine for me. I think a medium would have been too big. The shirt is boxy in shape, so will probably look better tucked in on most people. The color and gingham pattern is nice. The shirt has a cute, vintage vibe to it with the peter pan collar, ruffled sleeves, and tie at the back neck. The shirt tag says 100% cotton, so the feel is similar to other ginghams I have worn or worked with. I could not see my nude bra through the shirt, but the shirt is not thick or lined, so be aware of your bra color. The collar and sleeves have some surging, but everything else is stitched with a single seam, which is what I expect for a shirt that cost $14.99. After washing the shirt, the material does soften up. The shirt did shrink a little after washing. I washed in cold water, and put in dryer on medium for a few minutes to let out the wrinkles. Oh boy, the wrinkles! Be prepared to iron this shirt after washing. That is my biggest complaint about the shirt. I hate to iron, and this will make me not wear the shirt as much as I'd like. Ironing the sleeve ruffles is a pain, but you almost have to, or they won't look good with the rest of the shirt ironed. (picture is after washing and ironing)"
4.0,"Beautiful ring, just wish It was sold in half sizes. A 9.5 would of been great! The 10 is too large, the size 9 too tight. Very beautiful though."
4.0,"My son lives these gloves, they keep his hands warm when he doesn't want to wear his big snow gloves."
4.0,"They are cute and arrived quickly but they did run pretty small. My daughter is a size 6 and I ordered her a medium since I read reviews that these ran small. I must say even the medium was kind of snug on her, and were a little short. They looked cute on her but she needed them for a dance routine and they weren't as baggy as they should've been. I would order another pair though because they there comfortable I just may have to go up in size."
4.0,I love this swimsuit! It is super sexy and the tie in the back is lovely!!!! The only thing that I have to say is that the bottoms run a bit large but the top is true to size.
4.0,"Very pretty ,but much too large and heavy for my body type."
4.0,"The dress looks great, my husband loves it.  I said &#34;fit as expected&#34; because I ordered a size up due to comments about sizing.  Yes, you do need to order the next larger size, if hippy/busty two sizes up."
4.0,I really like the material that touches the hand and the muted graphics. It is a little loose on my pickup steering wheel and migrates some due to turning the wheel.. I'm keeping it on for now tho.
4.0,It feels amazing but size one size up and do not dry.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute! But kinda hard to put on.
4.0,Hard but bouncy double insole. Had to pull those out and add my own new balance insoles. Nice and light. Fits and ties well. Not built for the elements.  If you're frequently in the cold these aren't good.
4.0,Gave them as a gift and recipient really like them.
4.0,"I like this robe very much.  Cute, comfy, and it is a nice weight of flannel.  I can't wear man-made materials.  I couldn't find a flannel robe in a solid color, but this is fine.<br /><br />After one year:  I have enjoyed this robe very much and it doesn't seem to have shrunk.  I have washed it and dried it on delicate many times.  It does not need ironing as one customer said.  Not at all.  My only unhappiness with this robe is that it starts looking worn and pills before the year is out (and I only wear it in fall and winter).  It should last longer."
4.0,Really great product. Im from california and i ride a bicycle in 90+ weather made my commutes feel like I was 10degrees cooler
4.0,You'll get noticed.
4.0,"I received this &#34;dress&#34; today. it is not long enough to be a dress unless you wear leggings under it, however it did fit as I expected. the texture of the fabric is as I expecte4d- chiffon. the quality feels good and that it will not fall apart in the first wash load. overall I am very happy with it, except now I have to rethink what I will wear with it. I received this item at a discount in order to leave an unbiased review and I was overall please."
4.0,Beautiful clutch bag.  The chain that comes with it looks very cheap so I used my jewelry making skills and made a new shoulder strap using silver chain and pearls which made the bag even prettier.
4.0,"I like the shape, and for the price the quality is good"
4.0,Nice textured sweater.. design is very good quality. Fits as expected .. true to size
4.0,"Very nice looking umbrella. Easy to set up and use. It covers a lot of area which provides nice shade. I love that it has multiple positions to match the possible position of the sun.<br /><br />Make sure you use the sandbags for weights prior to opening it fully, otherwise it will tip over.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt seem very sturdy when the wind blows. It is very unsteady to the point that one time it almost tipped over, even with the 50 pound weights on both sides.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing another one for my other set of loungers. I am hoping these will last several summers. We shall see."
4.0,Not my favorite charmyl but still amazing. I love the front zipper it allows you to choose your own style.<br />Very comfortable and design is beautiful. I have a long torso so I should have size up 1. It hits me a little higher on waist then is normally flattering
4.0,As little as your little finger!
4.0,"They definitely run really small. Even the one labeled US large felt like a small. I couldn't wear it. I generally wear large, sometimes medium. In these, I had to get a 2XL"
4.0,"First of all; YES the eye(s) are printed on the mask which doesn't really matter to me since I bought to use as a face covering as per Uber's new guidelines. If this is an issue for you, you can roll down the top of the mask. The mask is very breathable and comfortable and my glasses don't get fogged when wearing it. (big PLUS for me since I need to see clearly when driving). The seams all appear to be well stitched and it has a drawstring at the top. So yeah, it was worth while to me to buy four of these so I could have a clean one each day."
4.0,This necklace has a bright yellow flower although it looks kind of dull in the photo.  It's a very nice item for the price!  My one complaint is that there isn't a connecting piece from the pendant to the chain so the pendant sits kind of sideways.
4.0,This product is fine<br />Arrived promptly<br />And packaged well
4.0,"Size up!! I ordered a medium and it was super tight (especially the arm bands - which isn‚Äôt an area I ever have fit issues with). It is nice quality so I am going to try the next size. I like the cut/coverage of the butt. The snaps are a little odd (large pearl snaps like an old western shirt) and a little hard to button, but the material is thick and doesn‚Äôt show every lump. I am 5‚Äô7 and 130 lbs."
4.0,I really like this shirt for summer. It looks great with white capri's and a statement necklace. It's become my go-to outfit.
4.0,Nice belt. Fits great with just the right amount of stretch. Very well made. The only thing i don't like is the leather parts are brown they looked black in the picture. Who puts brown leather on a black and white belt. Otherwise just what I wanted.
4.0,The straps are amazing not so much the tags
4.0,"I do like this top not so much the bottoms, it is padded but not very good. The string in the back could be longer and the tassels fell off right away bit i love the open back and this will fit me for a long time iam pregnant and thats why i got this swimsuit mainely for the top."
4.0,Super cute dress! Only wore it for a short period of time so not sure how well it will hold up though.
4.0,Somewhat small but soooo nice!! Hopefully will stretch a bit
4.0,Really nice wallet. My husband instantly fell in love‚ù§Ô∏è
4.0,Nice bag.  Great size.  Wish it had a zipper pocket inside.
4.0,"A little large but no worries, it is a nightgown."
4.0,Super cute but it‚Äôs very this & made of cheap material
4.0,I like the dress the  colors are vibrant looks good on. I ordered a large I usually wear a medium. I am happy with the purchase
4.0,"I honestly love this piece. Yes, it is a little small. I already knew it would be from other reviews though, so I'm not tripping."
4.0,So far I love this item. It's a beautiful color. I gave it 4 stars because I have only warn it a couple times and want to make sure the color doesn't fade.  So far it hasn't but you never know. But it is a beautiful necklace and I do love it!
4.0,Not exactly the same as the khaki but ok.
4.0,"Came with the top bar broken, where the camo piece is. But none the less work and are cute. Doesn‚Äôt effect the wear."
4.0,"the fit is a bit snug, but otherwise fine. the wife likes it so i guess thats what matters"
4.0,easy to wash and easy to breathe through
4.0,"Larger than I expected, haven‚Äôt used it yet but it appears fairly well constructed. It is made in China- just something to think about."
4.0,"They are very comfy, nice wide for pads, colors are very bright. Love them."
4.0,"The red band around the waist is absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />Lost one star because one of the back buttons fell off the second day I wore it, and the zipper sticks often. However, the fabric is very thick and stretchy, and I feel like this will become one of those dresses I wear every other week for years."
4.0,"I received these yesterday and at first was concerned that they wouldn't stay on, but after wearing them a full day and overnight they seem to stay on just fine and I'm hoping they will help treat my keloids as that is why I am wearing them post having keloids in both my ears surgically removed. I have already gotten compliments on how cool they look, love the design and color. Would have liked to have had instructions come with to know how to wear them, but maybe there isn't a right or wrong way to."
4.0,"For the price of this dress, I expected it to be true to size. It's not terrible, but it is a bit tight to wear over a bathing suit, which is what I bought it for. The color (pink) is nice."
4.0,"I love these socks, but would like them in a larger size, 9-13.  Some people wear larger sizes than 9."
4.0,See thru material but fine with nude colored bra.
4.0,I got these as headache relievers and they work really well they fit your face great they come with two type of tools to tighten or loosen the glasses worth your money!
4.0,"Just a tad smaller than expected. I ordered larger than my usual size as well and it‚Äôs a still just slightly snug, and I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs mostly of the type of material. Beautiful blue color and otherwise a nice quality shirt."
4.0,I like the variation of different colors. I bought it for my galaxy watch 3.
4.0,"Very nice shirt, hope it looks good in Puerto Rico."
4.0,Around the hole on top looks unfinished but the price is right.
4.0,I got this to replace the one my friend lost. she was very happy with it and i was please with how beautiful it is
4.0,"Really like the shirt! Was a Father‚Äôs day gift for hubby. I gave 4 stars because one button fell off immediately. Easy fix to sew back on. Other than that, we‚Äôre happy! I purchased a medium. Good fit, hubby is approx 165 lbs and 5‚Äô10‚Äù."
4.0,Great material. I was afraid it would not fit after reading reviews.  I'm a size 16. I was pleasantly surprised it fit well with a stretch material that allowed it to shape to my body. Nice dress. I will order more colors soon!
4.0,"They seemed a bit short at first, but as they &#34;wore in&#34; my feet went deeper and the back no longer cut into my heel.  I do recommend wearing them for a day or two to give this a chance to work.  Now I wear them all day in the house and even for short walks outside."
4.0,I love my new shades. Got lots of compliments. Great UV protection.
4.0,It shrank.
4.0,"I really can‚Äôt complain because the top fits me almost perfect and buttons over these big boobs but as I kinda expected, the shorts were to big and not a flattering fit. I like my shorts to fit a lil close to my leg and these were just not cut like that. I think I may size down on my next satin pj set and see if I like the shorts better being that the top gave me a lil extra room than expected. Great design and fabric is just thick enough and silky. Correction: I bought an XXl. Will try XL next time."
4.0,"The tapers are good quality, and the materials/coating are fine, but the tunnels are externally threaded, which can irritate actively stretched holes. Also, some aren't properly threaded, particularly the smaller sizes, so they're a pain if not impossible to get properly screwed on. Once your holes are comfortable, they're great, decent weight, and durable. Not so great for the stretching process itself, though."
4.0,"My wife is a Director for an assisted living facility. They utilize key fobs in many of the locations within the community.  She finds it easier and safer to wear and access hers from a neck lanyard.<br /><br />When we saw this one we thought we would give it a try. The vibrant color makes it easier for her to locate when she puts away her fob on her days off. The lanyard over all is made very well. A nice feature is that it comes with two key rings, a phone holder and a name badge holder. There are times she attaches her keys (and she has quite a few work keys) to the lanyard as well. This lanyard is strong. The length is perfect, not too long where it will get in the way when you sit down and not too short so that it hits you awkwardly. My wife is 5‚Äô4‚Äù to give you an idea for lanyard fit.<br /><br />Quality made with eye catching design and color. Worth the investment to have peace of mind knowing where your items are."
4.0,"I just received my belt. It looks great, packaging is very good. I do wish that it had a belt loop on it,oh well. Let me try it out for a while and I will get back and let everyone know how durable the belt itself and the buckle mechanics hold up."
4.0,Being 5 ‚Äò2‚Äù these sweats made me look fat too shirt. Lesson learned
4.0,"I love the sweater but it's just a tap to tight around the middle.  It's just me, not the sweater."
4.0,Doesn't feel cheap. Fits well. Not cut too small.
4.0,Could be a little bit longer in length.
4.0,'merica
4.0,Pretty and elegant
4.0,The rings were too small I should have checked for a sizing on here before I bought it. I'll just gift it to someone or have it as decoration. I was disappointed overall.
4.0,"I ordered a size up because of the reviews I read. I am 5'2&#34; 115 pounds and usually wear a size 2-4. I have bigger thighs and a smaller waist so I ordered a M. They fit well on my thighs, large on the waist but it comes with a belt and they're just a little too long. I used them as a wind blocking layer for a camping trip to Shenandoah and Dolly Sods in October and they worked well. Not incredibly warm, but loose enough for leggings or a heat layer. They stretch a bit and wash very easily."
4.0,I thought it would be a Royal Blue like the pic.  But instead is a faded blue.  Fits good. A little bit up top for me.  I ordered a medium.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äù8 165 poinds
4.0,Pretty but Tiny
4.0,"As others have noted, chapstick will easily slip out of these, but I knew that when I bought them. I added some moleskin material on the inside to snug it up and it's perfect now. Super cute and I love having my chapstick handy at all times!"
4.0,It's a cute shirt.  A little short and boxy but she has high waisted pants.  My daughter likes it.
4.0,"Not bad, but not my favorite. The material is very very stretchy which makes it very difficult to keep off your shoulders. I wound up just wearing it crossed and around my neck, after about 15 minutes of trying to figure it out.."
4.0,"these pants are really comfy and the perfect loungers while still feeling cute, but I would not wear them in public as they become sheer if I bend over at all."
4.0,What a beautiful bracelet in turquoise!  Adds a nice touch to any summer dress.  Gave 4 stars instead of 5 as the sizing is a little big for me but it is beautiful nonetheless.  Will probably purchase in two more of the colors offered.
4.0,I really like this band I haven't switched bands since I got this one. The only thing was it was hard to get on.
4.0,"Very Comfortable dress. Super cute. Fits close to size chart.  bottom wrinkles, so you have to get the iron out, that's why I gave the dress 4 stars."
4.0,"These aprons were cute, but the ties are grossgrain ribbon and very wide."
4.0,"I have to add too it, it will be a nice slip under my other skirt.  ONE short layer of thin fabric that will hit above the knee, then a second layer, also thin, and then ONE thin layer of tulle.  I will need to lose a few pounds but it might work.  It is NOT A-line, it is straight.  You get what you pay for."
4.0,A little clingy but versatile.
4.0,"cute dress , quality is ok probably wont last long but good for a couple of wear over the holiday season ,but  good price for what it is . A little see through but dress itself looks great and fits as described."
4.0,"This romper is adorable. It's exactly as pictured and the material seems like it is good quality, however, the straps are so short! It fits me perfectly everywhere but in the length... The straps are not adjustable and I do have a long torso but have never really had this problem before. I like it so much though that I am keeping it and altering the straps (replacing the part that goes over the shoulder with some cute braided stuff).<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'7&#34;, 165lbs, and I usually wear a size 6/Medium and I bought a large. ."
4.0,I love the look and it's made well - its just bigger than I expected. I might opt to make something for my car rear view mirror with it instead of wearing it as a necklace
4.0,[[VIDEOID:a7b6c1db800a13bfd2707f8b6c4c8232]] I have the series 6 40 mm watch in silver and i hate silver but they ddnt have black when i got it. Soo i really like the series 7 new xolor starlight and i thought it would color match pretty decently. As you can see in the video its not so much a star light cream color but its also not as silvery either. I like how thin the band is from the width as i have small wrists. It is a little bit hard to put on the watch once you have the band on as the magnets are super strong and wants to stick to everything but i think im gonna keep. Not bad for the price either.
4.0,Bought this dress for a wedding received lots of compliments! First ordered a XL ended up getting a L and it fit better! A little itchy but worth it! Slightly long on me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3) but with a medium heal it was fine!
4.0,"I really liked this costume, I wore it for halloween. However, the body suit was a little small. It wasn't really a problem for me though, I still loved it. Would definitely buy it again if I needed to."
4.0,Very nice jacket.  Ordered these for our choir musical.  Paired it with white pencil skirts.  Lightweight and vibrant colors<br /> Got lots of compliments.
4.0,"Wish that the shirt came in more sizes as it was a litttle snug but overall, for the price, good shirt for going out"
4.0,Great assortment of charms. None were the same. My kids loved it. Unfortunately the bracelets didnt come with the pieces although the discription stated bracelets with the charms. Recommend this product. Packaged in a plastic sealed bag.
4.0,Seems to be ok even though I haven't worn it yet. if you want a somewhat loose fit order up in size.
4.0,It was perfect. The quality was way better than I expected. It wasn‚Äôt cheap looking at all. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
4.0,The belt looks very nice and seems to be made of high quality materials. It goes all the way up to size 52&#34; waist so it should work for pretty much anyone. As others have stated I would prefer not to have any name on the things I wear. The main con for me is that the release mechanism to loosen the belt is under the buckle so you can't see it but have to go by feel which can take an extra second or so to find. Although that may not seem like a big deal it is if you have to go to the bathroom right that instant you can end up having an accident. Also sometimes you have to make sure you pull it back enough or it won't loosen on the first few tries. The belt buckle is a little heavy for my taste but that is just a personal preference.  I am I just getting use to it and it should become easier as I become more familiar with the belt. Also the tracks I feel should be an extra few inches longer and closer to the tip end of the belt. I like the fact that it comes in a very nice hard case and soft case as well. This would make a great gift for any man or boy. For $25 it is a fair price for what you get. This would also make for a great impromptu self defense weapon should the need arise. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
4.0,"I like the shirt and the feel of the fabric. The stitching is not the most durable, but washed by hand or on light it should hold up enough for him to grow out of.<br />The shirt was proportionately sized, but the pants look quite skinny. It is cute and matches the tee pee I made for the little guy. He just looks like a girl from the bottom half (sorry roman, I love you)"
4.0,Simple enough to look realistic and very pretty.
4.0,"Little short for a large, but good quality otherwise"
4.0,Super cute and comfy I absolutely love them! I gave it only 4 stars because the padding looks a little weird like it‚Äôs pretty noticeable but other than that I love them! I‚Äôm a 40D and got the xl-xxl and they fit perfectly.
4.0,Great swimsuit - the panty liner melted onto the bottom section so I had to scrape it off - otherwise really pretty.
4.0,"Great hat! Looks beautiful on. Only thing that could be better is if it were made of cotton or paper or some other cooler fabric. On a hot day, it gets a bit warm on my head."
4.0,was to big 0:
4.0,"It takes some getting used to, but this bra works well."
4.0,"I have two of these now, black/red and wine colored. Both are great fits. I like the number on the sleeve too. I recommend them."
4.0,I have a large chest which I thought that I had factored in enough but apparently hadn‚Äôt. I would recommend that you order 1-2 sizes larger than what you need
4.0,These shoes are great for my SON. Should change description.
4.0,"Quality seems great, the lenses are clear, frames seem nice and strong... however I'm a grown man 6' 220lbs... these glasses are tight on my head... They will never fall off... that's for sure.. I haven't worn them for any length of time yet.. as I got these for my next months trip to Punta Cana, February 2019. I just hope they're not too tight and give me headaches or just plane hurt to wear.. we'll see.."
4.0,I was reading reviews to go up a size and I did and it fits me a little big I‚Äôd just go w your normal size still cute tho!
4.0,It is a nice fit but a little tight around the waist. But for the outfit I am is using you won't see it.
4.0,Quick Shipping. Highly Recommend. Will Purchase Again Thanks
4.0,A nice dress. I would suggest sizing down.
4.0,Nice glasses for the price. Just think that the nose piece is a little bit too narrow. The lenses are clear and sharp!
4.0,"The extra links broke off, but they were put through some wear. I still wear it by just attaching it to the ribbon clasp loop, without the chain. It looks really cute and of course, classic"
4.0,Very nice for winter. Well made. Crotch is too low or legs are little too short though.
4.0,i use it for hiking to avoid sunshine and dust and also works as a face mask. Working great for me and i like it. Thanks
4.0,"Fit well, soft. A must have for any SOA fan"
4.0,It didn't come with the headband like it was supposed to.
4.0,"Nice hightop sneaker, well made, designed nicely"
4.0,"It‚Äôs not bad, you definitely get what you paid for but its not like amazing quality. It worked great for what I needed it for though."
4.0,"Bling! It is very good quality the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is the clasp it is very small and hard to put on.  I added a new gator clasp in silver and it is perfect.  I love it and wear it everyday.  Tip of the day, to clean it, drop one denture tablet in warm water and let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse, all my crystal and diamond jewelry come out sparkling!"
4.0,Good quality but they hurt after 30 mins.
4.0,it fits ok other than the bottoms which seem to run quite small plus i hate the style of bottoms.  considering sending this back
4.0,"Very tight, but too big if I add one more link in.  Chain is large which looks nice, but makes it a difficult exact fit"
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised with the dress overall. Paid for expedited shipping and fortunately for us, it came a few days early. Packaging/presentation could have been much better considering the delicate the price & fabric/etc."
4.0,Good sock however it doesn‚Äôt feel like a 20-30 compression like others that I have. Also thicker than I expected. Still a good sock and dies offer some compression.
4.0,a bit cheap<br />looks like jason<br />feels like jason<br />messy paint<br />feels amazing to wear
4.0,It's true to size and fits perfect but it only comes to your waist. So it's not as pictured. I was looking for it to be longer. I would've given it 5 stars if it was as long as the pictured.
4.0,Ok. But too small. I should have ordered one to two sizes up for shrinkage. But it put a smile on my husband's face!
4.0,Very durable and cannot beat what you get for the price.  Yes you can tell the difference between this band and the official Apple Watch band.  But it‚Äôs definitely not a $45 difference lol
4.0,great value for money. last a long time and doesnt get discolored easily
4.0,"I really like these long sleeves, they are good quality, fit well, flattering, and overall get the job done! I wear these for volleyball practice and conditioning and I highly recommend this fabric for working on diving. I like how this seller offers a wide range of colors and options. For an even more flattering look I‚Äôd recommend the v-neck but that‚Äôs my opinion, both are the same material and quality!"
4.0,Had a minor imperfection in the metal. The words look great though and it is well worth the price.
4.0,"Had a funny smell,but I washed it and it turned out fine.  Very pretty"
4.0,"This is a really nice set of fashion jewelry.  The beads are very light weight, so if you're looking for something with more substance, this isn't it.  I bought it for a gift & I was pleased with this set & the receiver of the set liked them."
4.0,"This adjustable cat ring is really cute and well made, although it is much smaller than described.  I can only wear it on my pinkie. But I am glad to have it."
4.0,Super cute bathing suit. I'm a mom & didn't think I'd ever wear a 2-piece bathing suit because of a vertical C- Section. The bottoms come up high enough to cover my scar & make me feel comfortable.
4.0,Well made even after multiple washings.  BUT...shrinks after drying so buy a larger size if in doubt.
4.0,good perceived value
4.0,"First impressions:<br />A little smaller than I expected, but it seems like it will hold up pretty well. Very pretty design, looks just like the picture! I'm planning on using this as my purse in Asia, so I will update my review once I get back!"
4.0,"I'm 5'3 and about 115lbs. I ordered a size 5. The waist fit perfect (not too tight, not too loose) (not too high, not too low). However, the legs were very tight. Thankfully, the material is quite stretchy, so I will just avoid putting them in the dryer... at all."
4.0,I really like this. The silver leaf looks just like the picture.  It's super cute.  However necklace clasp part is super small and kind of hard to put on.
4.0,"It's hard to find something when you wear a size 16 pants and have a 38HH chest. This bathing suit fits the bill! I also like the rouching to help hide my belly. I chose the black with cherry pattern and I wear a black Elomi swim bra (bought through Amazon) under the suit for extra chest support. My husband says the suit is fine without it but I feel more comfortable wearing the swim bra. The only reason I'm not giving this bathing suit 5 stars is that right at the middle of the chest V, it's starting to rip. That is possibly because of my wearing the swim bra and because I have a very large chest, but it was still a disappointment. I also thought I'd love the shorts underneath but I don't. When they're dry they still in place, but as soon as they're wet the shorts rolled up. I wore this suit during our week beach vacation and I had to fight with the rolling shirts a lot. By the last day I simply rolled them up so they were more like a traditional bathing suit bottom cut and then I wasn't fighting the shorts fabric and the ocean waves. Overall a great suit and I'd buy one again!"
4.0,"Lightweight, but quite nice!"
4.0,"its ok, TYR is better"
4.0,Love the dress but it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem to be made for women with curves (hips booty and thighs).  The dress could close but the split opened so wide that it made it impractical to wear.
4.0,"The material is nice. The pants are flattering on my body. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 195lbs with a large butt so I ordered a XL and they fit nice. I only wish they were longer, they hit pretty far above the ankles on me."
4.0,"Love the saying! The shirt material is pretty thin, and I feel after a couple washes the words might come off but it's still a cute shirt :)"
4.0,"These are some of the most beautiful bracelets I've worn that were hand made. However, they are a little tight to get over huge hands like mine. Overall, I really love them."
4.0,"Beautiful dress,  however had to spend $100 to have it altered, it seemed a little big for a size 2"
4.0,Seems to run a little large. Great quality though
4.0,"The ring came 3 weeks earlier than estimated which is great, but the ring did not come exactly as pictured, instead of his birthdate engraved it's GDragon's Korean name which isn't bad. And instead of photo cards I got an OK quality Big Bang Banner that's like 5 inches wide and 18 inches long. The ring quality is great but not everything came as described."
4.0,"The clasp was broken, but it's beautiful and goes perfect with my gown so I will make it work."
4.0,"This is a pretty little necklace with vibrant and bright colors. When I wore it, people noticed it and I got a lot of compliments on the neat design and the colors. The chain itself feels good against the skin and caused no skin reaction, though I can be sensitive to some metals.<br /><br />The jump rings on this item are not super strong and are prone to splitting open. This is an easy fix, and I just ended up replacing the jump rings as I do really like the necklace. This is fairly normal at this price, so I wasn't super surprised but it was a bit of a pain to do, and if you do not happen to have jump rings, then it would be very inconvenient. I would not recommend this for hard wear or for a child..it is really not sturdy enough to stand up to that. I like it..but it isn't a tough necklace!<br /><br />I was provided this item for review and evaluation purposes. All opinions are my own and influenced in no way by the seller of this product. As always, if my experiences with this item change over time, I will update this review. Thanks for reading!"
4.0,Fabric is a little thicker than expected but love the design and holds up very well during washes.
4.0,Nice fitted shirts for working out.
4.0,"It's beautiful, and it does not look cheap, thank you."
4.0,"This is an adorable! It does fit a bit small, but I knew that from reading the reviews, so it was no problem. The pom-poms fell off the first time in the wash, so I'll have to see those back on. Otherwise, we love it!!!!"
4.0,"Received these today. They feel very comfortable and look to be great quality. I will give these a try when my clinicals start and update my review. Giving 4 stars because the inside of the package wreaked of cigarette smoke. Luckily I can wash the socks but found this a bit irritating considering the smell is a trigger for my migraines. Hoping these relieve some aches I get with being on my feet all day!<br /><br />Update: I wore these all day for a few days and although they are comfy, I wouldn't recommend these for ladies with bigger calfs. They tend to slide down"
4.0,This was way too small for an adult woman. Im giving it to my 13 yr old Grand Daughter.
4.0,"Overall, I'm glad to have this solid little Timex in my watch rotation. I wanted to experiment with a smaller watch before making more costly purchases and this was a good way to do it. Nice field watch look, interesting integrated bars, flimsy strap (higher quality Nato is inbound), seconds hand doesn't land on the markings. You're getting what you pay for and, I guess, I mean that in both its positive and negative ways.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the watch arrived new, in-box with a scuffed scratched crystal."
4.0,"This set of necklaces are a much better quality than I was anticipating, especially for the price! I wouldn‚Äôt describe the choker necklace as dainty, but I would still wear it on its own. Nice and shiny, and they have a good weight to them."
4.0,"Really love it. I'm normally a 3x I got a 2x and it's perfect. I instantly felt sexy wearing it. Only disappointing part is it's not really pink which is want I wanted, it's peach colored. Very soft and comfortable."
4.0,Wish the thumb was not fully enclosed.
4.0,"Very lightweight and flows nicely. I am 5' and thought the dress would be a little shorter. It is just above my ankles, which will be fine.  In the photo, the model must be tall for it to hit at her mid-calf. Overall I am very pleased."
4.0,Fracturing my humerus bone and getting ready for surgery I.needed something like this. Plus it works perfect when I have chemotherapy treatments. I live in Florida and this light weight shirt is fantastic! Money well spent!
4.0,I like it but it pulls arm hair
4.0,Held up good on our trips.  Nobody makes luggage that will withstand the abuse at airports.  This met our satisfaction with fewer scratches and dents.
4.0,"This is a good, simple watch. Battery is good for many years, so says the packaging. The face is plastic and does show scratches. Also, the backlight is damn near useless in dark conditions. It emitsa green light from one side of the watch, and it's just not very effective. Although, for ten dollars? Who can really complain. It's comfortable, small, and has alarm and stopwatch features. I relaxed the band with some other cloth/nylon band because the rubber one was sweaty, it was quite easy to do. Overall, its a good work watch. A watch that you won't mind using in dirty conditions, because it's inexpensive!"
4.0,"A little tight fit in the arm holes so had to order a size up. Otherwise, they are thin but I like them. Great for summertime"
4.0,"lindo para cocktail, playa ,"
4.0,"While this kimono, looks good and feels good for the price, the size isn't one size fits all.<br />I'm pear shaped, which means I have thick hips and the kimono doesn't close around my hips.<br />Also, the Velcro grips onto any of the fabric, which can damage the kimono."
4.0,"These are super cute, start to be kind if see through, so should have gotten a size bigger. I'm a size 16/18 and they cupped my bum perfectly. I don't have wide hips and they stayed on ok."
4.0,The band is nice and easy to install. On time ship. Order was just as described. Would recommend
4.0,They're cute but not high quality. You get what you pay for.
4.0,"Beautiful dress and comfortable fit! My measurements are 37 bust 21.5 Waist 40 hips. I am 5'9&#34; and i weigh 160lbs. I ordered a large. Everything fit like it was supposed to. The only reason I gave it four stars is bc some of the stitching was sticking out on the side, I can just clip that off though. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,Really cute but I‚Äôm in Arizona ands it‚Äôs to hot so I have not been able to ware it out yet.
4.0,"I really like them, they hold up really well and don't irritate my ears which are sensitive to some metals. The only things I don't much care for is how difficult they are to put in and how uncomfortable they are when laying down. But otherwise I really like them."
4.0,"I liked the dress but unfortunately I ordered the wrong size. The color was a dark navy which I wanted. The lace was a nice quality, and actually was quite long for my almost 6 ft. height. I had to return it and was picked up the next day. Easy return."
4.0,"For what I paid, it‚Äôs better then the beauty supply stores in my area. I slept great and didn‚Äôt sweat throughout the night."
4.0,Not Bad.
4.0,"i love the design. it‚Äôs great quality for the price. fits a little more snug and shorter than other comparable jerseys you would find here on amazon.<br /><br />i‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù 170lbs and i generally go large for my jerseys as a medium would be too small. i almost need an XL in this jersey. as it is, i enjoy the large as my tightest fit jersey.<br /><br />love the design"
4.0,"Necklace is exactly like the picture, except it looks more dull in person, but hey it's cheap, so I didn't expect much."
4.0,"Ok, I‚Äôll start off by saying I like the suit. It‚Äôs very flattering and the mesh sections make it look a little sexy! The straps are adjustable so you can make it fit how you want. The material is standard bathing suit material but that‚Äôs to be expected for the low cost. The booty is fairly well covered with just a little cheeky-ness. The downside is that it is in Asian size. I ordered an XL (playing it safe) thinking it might be a little big cause I normally do a L in one piece bathing suits, but it‚Äôs actually very snug and almost too short for my torso (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7). I had to be careful pulling it around my hips so that I didn‚Äôt tear it. I‚Äôd definitely size up if you‚Äôre ordering this suit! (Maybe even two sizes if you‚Äôre worried). All in all, I like this suit and I‚Äôm definitely going to wear it on my vacation."
4.0,I love the color! It is super cute with Jean shorts! I get lots of compliments on it too! The only thing that could be a little better<br />Is the orange color the word peachy is in. It‚Äôs a little too bright orange for me but no biggie.
4.0,"I ordered a medium, I probably could have gone with a small. I have a shorter torso so no matter what size it is it will be a little long. It does go down low on the sides. Looks cute with a bralette or sports bra if you are comfortable showing a little side skin."
4.0,The stone is a little offset in the pendant but overall it is very pretty. I'm satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this shirt. It fits nicely. True to size, quality of the material was good and it washes well. I did not dry it completely in the dryer, I partially dried it then hung it up."
4.0,Product arrived quickly. Fiance loved it but is worried about walking on it.
4.0,I should have ordered down a size. I ordered XL should ha ordered L. I still wear them but I often have to pull the up. I have tan blue & red.
4.0,"The jumpsuit is for a party and it is exactly as described.  It might be a little small for a large man, but will fit most people ok."
4.0,"These look great. I am always reluctant to buy glasses without trying them on. This time it worked out.<br /><br />The shape is full but not too big. I did not realize in the pictures, but the arms are metal. This in my opinion gives them a more luxurious look. They look very similar to may daily guess shades.<br /><br />The lens colors also look great and gives you some flexibility in matching with clothing. Speaking of lenses, these do the job. Have I had better? Yes. Are these bad? Nope. They make the bright sun very tolerable without just making everything dark. They do add a slight brownish shade to everything. It is not so bad that you can't discern colors, but it is definitely there.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it only comes with one storage bag. This is not a big deal,but it would have been nice to have protection for all of them. The cleaning cloth is large and does a great job as you would expect.<br />All in all these are great glasses."
4.0,"Light jacket that is very comfortable. Not for heavy winter, but I expected that from the description and previous reviews. Got a size S which fit as expected. Would be nice if there was an inner lining, like black or something, but for the price that's a side note. The color matches the pictures, if only maybe a micro shade darker, but still looks like a Tanjiro outfit."
4.0,"**Update: I ordered a second one in reddish purple. Same size. However, it is extremely tight and about 6 inches shorter than the black one. Will be returning it. Also ordered in the regular purple. It fits perfectly. The black and purple came from China. It was supposed to arrive after 1/23 but came 1/14. These two colors fit. The reddish purple came from Amazon and was TINY!<br /><br />I recently made a decision to wear more leggings, tunics, and just be warm and comfortable. I bought some leggings and this dress. I am 5'8&#34; and normally wear a large on top and XL/14-16 on the bottom. I bought this in XL. The length falls just to the bottom of my butt with the lace going to almost mid-thigh. I'm happy with the heavy T-shirt weight of the dress. The texture is like Jersey sheets, relatively soft."
4.0,Fits great. Not too shallow as far as hats go ( cheaper ball caps always seem to be ‚Äúshort‚Äù and just cover the very top of your head). The embroidered phrase seems to be good quality. Boyfriend keeps stealing it.
4.0,"I love these pants and have purchased them in several sizes.  I wore them for several weeks after I had surgery and the darker color ones have enough coverage to be worn in public.  The lighter grey ones are a bit too revealing to wear out and about, so I just wear them as pajamas.  The rainbow stripe is super cute!  I normally wear a size 6 or 8 in pants and got a medium in these."
4.0,Fits very well. Classy looking.
4.0,"I had to order a size down and it's a very tight fit, but a beautiful blue color and would look great if purchased in the right size."
4.0,The dress was great. The only downfall was that it had a small hole in the seam. (Needle and thread fixed that)<br />Other than it was great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and weigh 163 lbs.<br /><br />More pics on Instagram @facingparisb
4.0,great for the price you cant beat it
4.0,The capsule pills are a bit big for my tastes. About the size of my hand. I would have liked smaller ones but these DO open which is neat ! So you can stuff money and small items in these. The dragon radar was just as cute as can be with sounds and makes for a great prop for a costume.
4.0,"I've ordered 2 of these so far in 2 different sizes. This one I ordered in a 6, the other an 8. While the 6 fits, the top elastic is so tight it hurts. After washing, for whatever reason the elastic folded over on itself and no matter how hard I've tried, it will not go back the way it was. It's still wearable, just not very comfortable."
4.0,So pretty! It took awhile for my ears to heal from the size adjustment and that is the ONLY reason I am dropping a star. It would be awesome if these came in smaller gauges but maybe that's not possible with this style and most of the good stainless steel cartilage jewelry is 16G. If you wear earrings in all of your piercings all of the time it likely won't even bother you. Has to be real stainless steel o I'd be in allergic reaction hell after wearing them for weeks now. Definitely beautiful and worth the price.
4.0,I love the colors in this swimsuit.  I have a dark brown complexion and thought it complemented me very well.  The only thing that was a little off was the sizing because I'm a 14 but the size of the top was bigger than I expected.  Love this swimsuit overall thoug!6
4.0,"super comfy. pilling occurs between legs but, I don't mind because they are just pajamas. But took off a star to be fair."
4.0,Looked awesome
4.0,"Pretty good quality, very comfortable and the pockets are convenient. However size is a little too big than standard sizes."
4.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for to read while riding in the car or outside. They are beautiful over sized dark glasses. I got the tortoise shell and they are still very dark with the variations. They do take a little getting used to the bifocal area, but I can read without the sun bothering me."
4.0,Very amazing sunglasses for the price. I was only expecting a more noticeable wood grain finish
4.0,The boots are very cute but not as warm and comfy I had hoped.
4.0,These glasses come with all the other lens like it says and the case is handy has small compartments for each len so they don't get scratched and has a cleaning cloth and bag and it has some sort of attachment which im guessing is for prescription glasses definitely makes everything darker or lighter depending on the lens and they reduce sun glare off of objects although they didn't fit snug to my face oh well.
4.0,"Comfortable, looks nice. Sometimes doesn't clasp and falls off. Great for the price."
4.0,Very comfortable to work out in gym
4.0,"Nice product, but slightly oversized"
4.0,"i love how soft and stretchy they are! i got the black. they are not see through at all. i‚Äôm 160 pounds and 5,4 and i got a large. they are a good fit not great i would‚Äôve went with a medium if i was going to use them to work out. but the pockets are a plus to overall love them"
4.0,"Jersey in snake screen print. Not actual snake skin. All letters, numbers, & snake decal are stitched. Over all a very nice jersey."
4.0,This is fit as I expected it.<br />Looks nice!<br />The overall quality is good.<br />Recommend.
4.0,"Looks good to me, exactly what I expected. Perfect size of wallet for what I needed."
4.0,Note: photo shows bracelet stones as light blue. Stones are very dark blue and attractive.
4.0,"Cute top, wear it all the time!"
4.0,Very cute- I wear as a tunic top over leggings. My only complaint are the large loops that hold the belt.
4.0,These are a great value- they fit well (I got the 2g plugs) but are a tad small so I have lost several if I wear them overnight. They are super comfortable but do occasionally fall out.
4.0,"The color is more faded than I expected, but very happy with my purchase."
4.0,Beautiful ! Fits true to size . Great buy
4.0,I blocks out the light completely. It just as the add said it is.
4.0,My husband drives a lot in his job and says these are great.  He has the yellow version to reduce night glare and a gray one for daylight driving.  He's happy with both.
4.0,"Fit surprisingly well for a cheap pair of glasses, look pretty good too"
4.0,the ring is very comfortable on finger
4.0,Great jacket. Sleeves are big around wrist area. fit is good and hoodie is perfect!
4.0,"nice I like it , almost to short"
4.0,"This women's t-shirt plus-size casual printed short sleeve loose fit top with athletic crew neck is too tight for my figure. The length was perfect but size XX-Large was much too tight in the girth for me. I am 5'8"" and weigh 225 lbs. I will need to have this shirt in 1X or even 2X. The shirt itself is well made and I loved the contrast look. I think the shirt is true to size, I just need a bigger shirt."
4.0,Yes I did like it .
4.0,"Hey it's Erica The Reviewer once again with another product review.<br /><br />I got this ring a few weeks ago and have been trying it out since then. I really like it. It's unique and very comfortable. I like how I can still bend my finger wearing such a large ring.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not modified due to the fact that the product was discounted. If I am not fond of a product, I will always be honest . Please leave a comment if you have any further  questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review! This is Erica the reviewer in and out!"
4.0,"The headband itself is great but the camera mount has no adjustability and points the camera to high.  I had to add the hat mount to the band to get it to work the way I wanted (hint, hint to Contour!!)"
4.0,"This is very cute, but the latch is a bit tricky to put on. Otherwise I love it."
4.0,Nice fit super soft. Would have been 5star if they weren‚Äôt see through. Good thing I ordered the larger size so they weren‚Äôt stretched thin.
4.0,They look nice.  I chose the smaller ones (3mm).  Might look better is a slightly larger size.  Aeeived timely.
4.0,"Excellent product, great for work"
4.0,"Nice, light weight dress.  The only thing i would change is on the back the dress the white was was done in spots not like the front of the dress.  But I still really like it."
4.0,cute dress.  Great style and color.  Material cheap but stretchy and not see thru. Bust is ridiculously small for bug boobs. Undershirt definitely required.
4.0,"Daughter is 4‚Äù4, 78lbs we bought her the turquoise unitard in a size 8. She wears it with a sports bra so it‚Äôs less awkward when it‚Äôs bathroom break.<br /><br />We bought this for a circus basics gym class my 8 year old is starting. Clothes can‚Äôt be baggy or have anything that may be caught up in trapeze or ruin aerial silks. We wanted to avoid wardrobe malfunctions from being upside down as well. Can‚Äôt go wrong with a one piece! She loves it, it‚Äôs a pretty color and not at all see-through. It‚Äôs not going to get baggy with wear. It‚Äôs stretchy like leggings but not super stretchy, it was a bit of a workout getting it pulled up but once it was on she said it was comfortable and had full range of movement.<br /><br />Minus one star for a discoloration that looks like it was laundered with a darker garment. We are washing it now to see if that comes out."
4.0,"The dress was beautiful, I followed the measurements for the fitting and I can say they are very close to the actual dress. The dress came a little big in the breast section, but it was easy to fix. The length was perfect for a noon garden wedding. Got many compliments!"
4.0,Bought for my wife. She wore it to the beach and loved. Looks good on her.
4.0,Dress fit perfectly
4.0,I‚Äôve been wearing Lanz flannel nightgowns for years. Not see through so you can wear around house without bathrobe. Lasts for years. Always feel cuddly inside when I wear mine.
4.0,Nicely crafted piece . I wish it was bigger. I enjoyed the craftsman piece in the work
4.0,Cool looking watch for a great price<br />Doesn‚Äôt look as durable though
4.0,"Cute top, nice material. But ordered size by comments, it's more of a slim fit. I normally wear a large to XL depending on fit. Ordered a XL and it's snug across my chest"
4.0,"Fits well, good quality for the money"
4.0,a little on the small side
4.0,Beautiful bracelet well made
4.0,"Like everything, accept its a bit thin in the winter. Though i bet perfect in the summer."
4.0,If you love Christmas vacation than this is a must have!
4.0,"Perfect PJ,s"
4.0,Too small for me.  Very hard to remove
4.0,"I really like the top portion of this bathing suit.  It gives great coverage - very much like a sports bra.  The top has removable pads to keep from showing through the fabric.  The straps criss cross in the back.  The print is very nice and bright.  The only downside for me is that the bottoms are slightly small on me.  I am a US size 4 and ordered a medium. I wish the bottoms had just a tad more room around the hips because of where they sit on me.  However, with the print on the top, I can wear this with almost any color bottoms.  I am a 34D and the medium top fits great.  It doesn't have as much support as a sports bra, but its really hard to find a bathing suit top that does. Overall, I like the top enough that I can overlook that the bottoms don't fit the best.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I liked it but it was too small so I returned it and purchased in a larger size. I love it!! I've worn numerous times and it's comfortable and perfect for me a mother of 3 who doesn't like to show too much of anything. It's perfect.
4.0,"Son is 5'2&#34; 7th grader.  Loves the coverage, comfort, but sleeves too long = a pain.  I need to roll then tack them up with thread."
4.0,"Really excited about the pack when I got. Perfect size for my daily needs. I was going to start using it as my pistol range bag but found a big rip at the stitching exposing the cushion in side the main strap. If you‚Äôre looking for something durable you might want to explore other options. Customer service average. Good price though. Bought on 5/8/19.<br />Update 8/25/19. I was contacted but seller after review. They apologized for inconvenience and sent me a new replacment from a new suppler. 100% satisfaction is there core value and they stand by that, which is HUGE! The new one is slightly bigger than the previous and i love that. Better zippers, etc. They definitely made the right choice going with another supplier. Customer service is too notch! I definitely recommend. Thank You..."
4.0,these are gorgeous and worth the money
4.0,A little bit longer for a 5'2 person like me. Beautiful dress. ...wore it as maternity dress.
4.0,cool tie goes nice with my 2 tone outfit
4.0,I feel like it's great for the price. It hangs nicely and the material is soft. It came to my knees and I feel like it's a modest dress. The material is a little thin but I didn't feel like I needed to wear anything under it. It's cut a little weird but still felt flattering. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh about 170 and I ordered a L.
4.0,"I love the dress and color. I got it a size bigger because I love extra room, but it fit a sprinkle snug."
4.0,"The material doesn't stretch very much at all, but it is still good quality."
4.0,Perfect for my daughter's prom dress. A tad snug but we expected that so it would stay up without straps.  The clear back stayed in place too. My daughter was very happy with it.
4.0,Loved it. Very pretty in person. A bit low cut for small boobs.
4.0,Nice and cute.my daughter love it and feel comfortable with it.
4.0,"Overall I like this, but I'm not excited about it.  It's a bit more sporty than what I had in mind (heavy zippers) and the lining feels cheap.  It's adequate, but I don't love it."
4.0,You must get this if you have a Fitbit flex. You'll probably never worry about dropping your Flex after getting one of these.
4.0,"This will be perfect. We are planning to travel to some warm places where it is considered impolite/rude to show your knees. Lightweight fabric, lots of zippered pockets."
4.0,"I have very small wrists and the silicone band that came with my Apple Watch always upset my skin. I‚Äôve had this band for around 3 months now and it‚Äôs great! It makes the watch seem less bulky, the metal is holding up nicely, and I get complemented on it constantly! I got the black and the finish seems to be wearing a little bit on the clasp since I am constantly taking it off and on again but that is the only thing that I have noticed. Instructions to remove links are fairly easy to follow, just be careful to not break any pins!"
4.0,Loved these they are beautiful ! Only issue is that the band is so thin to make it tight around the ear it hurts and being so thin I lost it the first time I wore it. It fell off. If the band was thicker it would definitely stay on better. But they are beautiful!
4.0,"This a good quality, soft leather and shearling hat!<br />I ordered small, Bit big, wondering why I'm seeing it $10 less?<br />My head is small..I was worried it would be too large!<br />My head is only, Like 52cm or about 20""<br />I usually get kids hats!<br />I recieved it today..<br />My friend noticed it right away!<br />He said lovely hat!<br />Made in Turkey..not China!<br />It kept my head very warm.<br />It's 39f, less than 4 celcius.<br />Really glad I got it!<br />Wearing a hat keeps me feeling Warmer..<br />My face was cold I didn't wear my scarf!<br /><br />It came with a business card..with their email.<br />So if it falls apart, I guess they would be happy to replace it? Nice touch!<br />It looks pretty well made.<br />I would have preferred black fur on the outside.<br />This was all they had left?<br />Greyish blue fur.<br />I'd love a coat made from this!!<br />NYC weather can be brutal..<br />Its going to be even colder on Xmas day!<br />Its more than I wanted to spend,<br />but it blows cheap acrylic hats out of the water!<br />I wish it was a little longer, over MY EARS!<br />I'd have given it 5 Stars for that, and maybe had snaps,  instead of leather strings!<br />I like this hat alot, even though I only wore it out for 20 minutes..<br />I totally Recommend this hat!<br />I'm happy!<br />My cheap Chinese one of acrylic I wear to bed!<br />My room is very chilly!<br /><br />Only thing that upset me was the delivery!<br />By The courier,<br />who threw it onto my porch?<br />Last thing I'd want is for it to be taken!<br />Never even put by my door!<br />USPS!!ü§¨<br /><br />I'd buy another!"
4.0,"Pros:<br />-good quality<br />-stay on feet reasonably well<br />-print is cute<br /><br />Cons:<br />-large<br /><br />Wanted something to protect 8 month old daughter's feet when she cruises around in walker. These are sturdier and stay on better than normal socks but cozier than shoes. They are large on her, which could be a problem for little ones who are walking unsupported. I would say my daughter's feet are average."
4.0,Much slimmer than my old wallet. Holds quite a few cards and cash.  It performs as expected.  No window for ID or DL but otherwise room for everything
4.0,"Nice product, comfortable and fit just right"
4.0,"Good belt! Wish buckle was a little bit smaller, but I really like it!"
4.0,"Very cute, nice color and good quality. I would keep it, but the small was a bit too big and they don't carry it in x-small."
4.0,"Perfect for any occasion. Personally, I wear it with high waisted tan shorts & a jean jacket, or jean shorts & a sweater. It is a little sheer, so a nude bra or undershirt is necessary. Overall it‚Äôs a pretty good staple piece for your closet!"
4.0,"I ordered a 3X on this because of reading the reviews that it ran very small. I normally take around a 1X. I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 185 pounds, and a C cup. This fits perfectly in the 3X size!  So glad I listened to the other reviewers.<br /><br /> My only complaint is that the photos make it appear to be longer than it is. I ideally wanted this to wear with leggings  and while it is slightly longer than waist length,  it doesn't come close to covering the butt. So I will be wearing with jeans or yoga pants instead. I wore it with black yoga pants yesterday and it was very cute.<br /><br />I did wash it before I wore it, and the first time around at least it held up well to washing on cold and drying on medium.  There were some complaints on other reviews that it was see-through or too thin. I bought the royal blue color, so unlikely it would be see-through, but I have no issue with it that way. I imagine that in a lighter color that could be a problem since the fabric does seem fairly thin. However, I do like how light weight it is. If only this were made with a built-in bra it would be perfect!"
4.0,"Sharp looking. Keeps time well. Price is below the quality of the product. My only complaint would be that the band at maximum expansion was still a little too tight. I am a big guy so I get it. However, I would have paid an extra buck or two if the band was just a 1/2&#34; longer."
4.0,My son in law has started wearing cufflinks at late. His last name of course starts with A. Got them for his sticking. I hope he likes them.
4.0,Theses are really cute and comfy and perfect if u have hard wood floors that get dirty over all good buy
4.0,"I love this dress! Super comfortable and the fit is perfect. I live where the summer is steamy, so the lightweight fabric is cool."
4.0,Wow this dress is gorgeous. I‚Äôm 102 lbs and 5‚Äô3 and I ordered the xs. It fits my body perfectly except for the chest. I wish it had removable cups instead of being a sewn in bra. I‚Äôd return if it wasn‚Äôt so gorgeous!
4.0,"Be warned, there are different style dresses. The dresses that only have buttons on the bust area (such as the bright red and the peach) are beautiful and amazing summer dresses. However, I did not like the quality of the dress with buttons all the way up and down. For girls with larger busts, be warned that the buttons do stretch a bit but it's not that bad."
4.0,They were smaller than I thought they would be but they are very pretty.
4.0,So the ruffles of the sleeves are a little weird. They have 2 layers of fabric which make it lay a little odd but for the price this is a perfect piece!
4.0,"Purchased as a gift, but is very pretty. It comes in a few pieces, but is easy to assemble."
4.0,I bought this last minute and I had a tight budget so I took a chance. I was pleasantly surprised! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 120lbs and the medium fits great. It‚Äôs flowy and flattering but the material is cheap. It‚Äôs great if you just need something for a one or two time wear. In this case it‚Äôs for my grandmothers funeral (we‚Äôre all wearing pink roses- her favorite) so I don‚Äôt plan on wearing it again.
4.0,"Cute bag. Wish the fabric was the same type on both sides. One of the fabrics used is much thinner and I'm not sure how much wear it will withstand if used as the outside of the bag. The other fabric is more of a canvas and quite suited as the outside of the bag. So, technically reversible, but I doubt you will use it as such."
4.0,Runs a little small but otherwise great shirt at a great price!  This shirt is exactly as advertised. Thank you!
4.0,"Good quality materials , perfect size"
4.0,Ok but is very short
4.0,"Really like the dress.  It is a little short waisted for me, but I intend to wear it anyway.  A little longer waisted would make the length perfect."
4.0,"Really good, durable and convient.  I wish they had some more of the smaller ones in the package."
4.0,"Sheet material, nearly see through. The straps are a bit odd so that if pulled down normally, the front of the shirt falls very low. Definitely needs to be worn with bralettes that you expect to be seen"
4.0,"these are really cute for price, not a lot of support, worth it for a special outfit or just kickin around"
4.0,"I bought this sweater in two colors (bark/navy). I actually really like them, glad I got two. They look as pictured, they‚Äôre heavy, warm sweaters. Longer in the back, fits through the chest, but a little scratchy on bare arms. My only complaint (the loss of a star) is that the navy looks black most of the time and navy in certain lights. :/  The bark looks like taupe which was a pleasant surprise, I thought it was more green in the picture."
4.0,These are beautiful earrings. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give a perfect review was because of the earring backs. The backs easily came off and you‚Äôd loose the earring.
4.0,quite a gap in the color where it ties.
4.0,Love the dress but when I took it out it smelled of vinegar not sure why. I found it to be tight in the chest even though I ordered the right size but still like it a lot
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she is obsessed with Sailor Moon. I was surprised that the material is very heavy duty. The quality was great. The only downside to this is that the bow on the front us not attached very well and came off within a week. I was going to send it back but she wanted to keep it saying she would just glue something on the front. It does not effect the closure at all as it is an inside magnet.
4.0,They are cute to look at. I hoped they would follow the curve of my ear from my second set of piercings. They are a little bulky for that but I still like them enough to hold on to.
4.0,"good fit, good grip"
4.0,"I wear a women's size 5, and these socks fit me mostly okay.  Maybe slightly big, but that wasn't a deal breaker. I liked the material.  Wish the ruffle was a little bigger/more substantial. Wish there were more fun colors.  Overall, a nice, simple, cotton sock with a little ruffle on the top."
4.0,"This was last year's gotta have....it was for my great granddaughter,7 y/o going on 18 !!! She loved everything monster high...I purchased a lot of this brand from Amazon. The products made a young girl happy. ... this order came from another distributor,order was prompt and well received"
4.0,"It‚Äôs pretty, but it‚Äôs definitely not the ring advertised. This ring sent to me, does not have the stones advertised."
4.0,It's a little bigger than I expected but gives me room to move around comfortably.
4.0,"I really liked the dress, the cut just wasn't great for my figure. I'm sure after a couple washes, the starch comes out and the dress gets super comfy, though. The color was spot on!"
4.0,Comfortable but a little bigger than I thought.
4.0,The material was much heavier than I expected I usually prefer skirts to be a little more light and flowy. It worked out well though because I bought it as part of a Snow White costume for Halloween and the extra warmth is appreciated. I agree with some of the other reviews that the asymmetrical cut is a bit weird but otherwise it fit well I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 170lb and a large fit comfortably. Also I did not realize it had pockets when I bought it. Bonus!
4.0,"Once you get past timing off all the loose threads, it's a nice dress. Nice material, not too thin, not too thick. Just a nice, great fitting dress. It's a cute little black dress<br />statement staple piece."
4.0,"Bought these for a friends birthday party, it was a hit. I would have given it 5stars but it didn't come with a safety pin option."
4.0,Seem amazingly durable. Expected a flimsy pair of sunglasses but the frame is metal.
4.0,Fits a little loose at the chest if you have a smaller chest
4.0,"They are cute and a good, cheap deal. I bought them to use until I find a quality belt I like. I don‚Äôt think they will last long because it creased a lot when bending to put on after one wear. Hopefully I get a season out of them."
4.0,ordering on line its making my life easier.
4.0,This item is so cute! Can't wait to try it on my newborn but it does run a bit small almost looks like it won't fit. Hopefully it does because it's so cute!
4.0,I love love this shirt!! Beware it does run small for reference I'm 5'7 125lbs and a 32DDD I ordered a medium and its definitely tight but I still wear it. Its adorable with the scalloped neckline and shoulders. I would buy again but order a size up. Also it is shorter than an average shirt. But I do recommend it if you get the proper sizing.
4.0,Cute suit..fit awesome. This particular print fits differently than the cherry print. Both are size16-18. The cups are waaay bigger on this suit but still nice.
4.0,"A very cute dress, just way too small.  Had to return."
4.0,I like the color scheme and durability as well as good stretch. I actually never have to use the lock clip on the strap accept when I switch to another band.
4.0,Cute but should have been a bit longer.
4.0,Nicely made just wish it had a cover for credit cards in the back of it.
4.0,"I'm 6 ft tall, and 235 lbs if not a little less. I purchased a couple of these tracksuits in a size large from a different vendor, but the pants came about 4 inches above my ankle. I purchased this particular item in a large also, and the pants ran longer and came about 2 inches above my ankle. I gave 4 stars because the jacket is not as long as I would like it to be for my torso and the entire set runs a little big. I am returning and placing order for a medium... pictures coming soon!"
4.0,"It is a nice wristband...It fits my Blaze fitbit...The color is much darker than picture, but it works great."
4.0,"I like the design, it looks just like the picture, however, I thought it was cloth. It's not cotton-like, it's more silky-like. It does get the job done though! I can use it as a scarf or headband. Recommended!!"
4.0,I gave the green camouflage to my husband from the pack. He has allergies and got a bad allergy outbreak after wearing this. I washed it along with the others and they are fine now
4.0,pretty bra straps.  I don't like strapless bras so I use them when my clothing might show my bra straps.
4.0,Soft for my son to wear. And he‚Äôs so much into Spiderman. I just get confused sometimes if it‚Äôs for summer because the fabric is thick.
4.0,"I liked the look of this uniform top, and the material appears to be quite sturdy.  Overall, it is a very professional shirt that I had ordered to wear at my job as an ER nurse.  However, the bust area was at least 2 sizes too large and the waist was about 1 size too large.  For reference, I am 5'8"", approx 195 lbs, wear size 36c, and ordered a size 12.  I sent it back, but if I was to order again I would order a size 8.  Happy ER nurses week!"
4.0,Snug but worked well in cold weather for me when I was coaching softball.
4.0,I bought on her upper size scale based on reviews and it was a tad snug but I liked the way it fit my wife (she liked it too)
4.0,"The fit was fine, right length, sleeves not overly long. For my body, the flow from the chest was not attractive. I had to return it."
4.0,Weird cut!<br />And not enough lopps for the belt
4.0,These looked like prescription glasses.  I misplaced them.  I ordered darker orange that cut 99% instead of 45% as I had terrible headaches.  Melatonin helped as well.  The rating all depends on what you want them for.  I thought they looked great on.
4.0,wish it would dry me off just a touch better but like it works great.
4.0,Very cute but run small
4.0,Nice material great color. Drop waist fit not all that flattering. Overall a nice dress.
4.0,"This bracelet is very nice. It's a great size in length and width. Wide enough to be seen far away. Beautiful grafted and shines brilliantly. Seller got it to me quickly and it was wrapped in a gorgeous box. It's very light weight being hollow, so if you're into heavy gold bracelets you won't like this. I got it for a great price and it's great for everyday use."
4.0,"I almost thought getting this was going to be one of those online click bait "" look what I really bought"" dresses. However, it was fine. The red color you see on the photo seems a bit enhanced to a slightly deeper red. My dress was not that deep red. It comes with a basic cut black ribbon for the ""belt"", nothing special. Use your own belt. The company says order a larger size because they go by Chinese  standard sizes. I didn't know what they meant but ordered an 2X being as I needed it for 5'1ft 160lbs. When I got it it fit just fine. I think wearing a tutu or something to fluff it up underneath the dress would make it seem amazing like the photo."
4.0,I like but smaller than expected.
4.0,"Fits about right, a little snug but that‚Äôs probably all the tacos I eat and then believing I‚Äôm still the same size. The material seems to wrinkle easily in the belly area, but it may come out once worn and used daily. Super cute and exactly what I‚Äôve been wanting!"
4.0,"It was a little long on my mother in law, but she still liked it."
4.0,For me the bifocal is to small and to close to my nose. Uncomfortable if I have to focus for long.
4.0,This is my second one<br />Wish the strapes could attach to the back of the suit instead of around neck.
4.0,These are great low-profile socks for heels. They don't show when you wear them. They have a heal grip on the inside. The only they are missing is ridges on the bottom like I have on another pair that isn't as love-profile.
4.0,Love the feel of this shirt and I ordered size up but still lil tight for what I like. Next time I order will be another size up but the stretchy material helledj
4.0,Very good tho I wish the chain was thicker but I love it so much I use it for techwear outfits
4.0,No problems after 2 years of daily use.
4.0,Love the ear rings but one of the little hooks on the back that slide onto the bar was broken a bit. I used some superglue and it holds up well in the vet tech hussle and bussle!
4.0,Pretty bracelet ...goes with anything you have.  Good price too
4.0,Pocket fits an XR and is secure. However I was expecting more of a compression fit.
4.0,"Lovely lightweight scarf, perfect for any season."
4.0,the dress is pretty although very transparent ..
4.0,"I purchased this for my daughter as a college graduation present as she owned the wallet.  A good quality product from Vera Bradley, but I thought it would be a tad bigger.  Probably more of an evening purse than an every day one."
4.0,Supple leather. Evenly colored & easy to work with.
4.0,This watch is beautiful. I had one like it in the early 90s which was stolen. This watch is a lot bigger and heavier. But it is very good looking. The only downside is that it doesn't have a second hand. I've had it only a few days and haven't verified that it keeps time very well.
4.0,"Good watch, bought as a back up, ended up not fitting my larger wrist(woman with LARGE wrists) I was able to put it on and it didnt loosen up(A good thing for those it fits) Great design, and sturdy for its material.<br /><br />Would Recommend to a friend?

4.0,Surprised that this dress was as cute on as it was.  Material is thin but flattering style.  Good for the money. Bought a small.  Get medium if you want it loose.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 138 lbs
4.0,Nice jacket and was what I wanted.
4.0,"This is a pretty light weight skirt for being velvet.  The material feels nice and the elastic waist doesn‚Äôt pinch in over the day.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180lbs and I have this in the Large.  I could wear the Medium I am sure.  There is a lot of room in this skirt.  The length is below the knees.  overall, well made and not bad looking."
4.0,"The material, print and color is as I expected and is well represented in the picture. Perhaps I'm in between sizes but the medium was very tight in the waist and the large was loose around the bust. Still a very comfortable summer dress and a staple in my wardrobe."
4.0,"I like the bag but it's not the same as other VB bags I have. Bottom is soft, others have a stiff bottom. Strap is a little stiff. Others are more flexible."
4.0,Great buy. Great fit. i had to order large as my hips are wider compared to my upper body (not that i'm complaining) so a little roomy in the top but the bottom fits like a glove. perfet length and I am 5' 91/2&#34;
4.0,Very pretty. Better in real life than in picture.
4.0,"Very attractive, sturdy bag with multiple interior compartments and a zipper to secure your items. I'm a short person, and the size was perfect. Wish the internal side pockets were a little deeper and wider to better accommodate a cell phone and/or something like a tissue packet.. Would have also liked one external pocket for my sunglasses."
4.0,"This is a pair of slacks with pockets sized for 5‚Äô1‚Äù and shorter. The fabric is 80% viscose, 17% nylon, 3% spandex in a flat tight weave that has a little give. There are 4 pockets, 2 in front, 2 in back, all lined with nylon and sewn shut, so if you want to use them, you have to get a seam ripper. The back pockets are closed with buttons. The fly zipper is 2‚Äù long (!) and topped with 3 metal clips on the outside and a button on the inside; a spare button is included with the pants. The waist band is 2 ¬æ‚Äù wide, made of 2 separate horizontal strips with a seam in the middle, and there are no belt loops. So that middle seam in the waist band will always be visible. The legs are straight with no flares or tapers at the cuffs. The slacks were made in China.<br /><br />I find these slacks fairly heavy duty, good for waitressing. The lack of belt loops is a limitation, however, and the sewn up pockets is a hassle. The fabric is heavy, not that comfortable, but tough. You can work in these pants and not worry about stains or runs. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and these pants don‚Äôt quite cover my ankles. They are OK in heels, but don‚Äôt work in flats since they really look too short. These pants would be a good selection for folks who stand under 5‚Äô1‚Äù. Overall, these slacks are decent work pants, especially for folks on the petite end of petite."
4.0,"Overall I am happy with my purchase.  There weren't any instructions, but a quick YouTube search fixed that.  Make sure the pins are in there properly or the band will continue to pop off.  I don't feel it is in there as tightly as the leather band was but time will tell if it will stay in place."
4.0,nice set for the price
4.0,"Nice looking sandals.<br />My son likes these but the inbetween toe part is a little bothersome he said.<br />I think he has to wear these longer! Although Never has trouble wearing thongs!<br />There made well, and look good although the material is faux."
4.0,This is my favorite type of mask. Initially they are a bit tight around the ears. After a while they become too loose. I still like them better than most.
4.0,Wish the fabric was softer. Overall cute pj‚Äôs
4.0,Perfect for the price.  Son wanted a watch and this is a perfect piece for him
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but the material is thing so panty lined may show, other than that I like it."
4.0,"The size chart is off. I should have went to a store to have her feet accurately sized. My mistake, we will use them when she can fit them."
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress. It runs a little be small for me, I'm 38 D and is too tie for me.I definitely will try to get an XL next time."
4.0,"I ordered these for my 8 year old who is 56"" tall and 78#. They fit him perfectly but may be too small in a year. My 11 year old could not get them over his big head. The material is silky and lightweight, they washed well and were hung to dry. Colors were bright and consistent with photos shown. I didn't buy it for warmth, purchased as a face covering for summer months so I wanted it to be lightweight and not too warm."
4.0,"My daughter loves it, but it did seem to run a little small. also the headband isn't the best construction, so don't expect them to stand up like in the picture"
4.0,A little loose around the waist
4.0,cute addition to my daughter's costume... and she wore it all day one day and had no problems keeping it on her head which I thought would be a problem.. very happy
4.0,I love this shirt so much. It‚Äôs a very lightweight ‚Äúsweatshirt‚Äù. The material is super soft and has held up well to washing. I hang to dry. It hasn‚Äôt faded or pulled in anyway. I hope you buy another one
4.0,"Ordered a size up ( normally wear a 9, not offered in 9 1/2, so, ordered a 10) and they're WAY too big. :( Totally disappointed! Beautiful shoe, but just way too big. I'm sure it depends on your foot, but, I would definitely NOT recommend ordering a full size up. Get your normal size or 1/2 size bigger if you can. Bummer...I wanted to wear them tonight!"
4.0,nice gold tie holder
4.0,Colors are crisp and sharp edged design.  Fit is good. Only had for one week and wore once.  The elastic materials seems to be holding up well after wash and dry.
4.0,"I bought these for my son, they fit great, they wear great, but he says the legs ride up a bit."
4.0,The snowy season was mostly finished by the time I received these boots.
4.0,"Runs small, fabric was cheap"
4.0,"Definitely for smaller heads.  I bought them for my 6 year old boy who is big for his age.  These shades are to small for him, but fit his 3 year old brother just fine."
4.0,Nice belt. Make sure you measure to get the sizing correct.
4.0,"This crochet knit sweater is made from polyester.  It is comfortable and pretty.  Upon unpackaging, it looks extremely wide, but when wearing it drapes in a flattering manner."
4.0,"If this was about 2&#34; longer, it would be perfect. Not sure why plus-size clothing never seems to understand, we are not all short people...! Extra length helps the fabric drape over a larger body too. It is very soft, comfortable fabric. A bit of a breeze and it blows up though, beware... ;)"
4.0,I wear mainly in the cooler early mornings. Love the pockets.
4.0,"I do like the product but I think the gold side is ugly. The black side looks better. It‚Äôs a little slippery, but it serves the purpose. I use it all the time."
4.0,"I just wanted something to lounge in, will be okay, just a little large. Had to iron it to get the wrinkles out."
4.0,This is a great light weight shirt that helps keep you cool on a hot day. My only complaint is it does run small so order a size up. That was the case for my husband. I do recommend
4.0,great for cold  rides and does a great job wicking away sweat
4.0,"Looses about 1 to 2 minutes in a four to five day period (not too bad). Other than that nice watch.  Like the finish, easy to windup, wish the chain was longer, that's about it."
4.0,vibrant colors - only small problem with one inch section on scarf that had a little bit of dye missing - very slight.  but really didn't detract from the scarf since it gets folded up when wearing it so no one would see it.
4.0,Not only are them comfortable but fashionable as well. My wife loves them too.... smile
4.0,The loop on the pendant was too small when I got it. Not being a jewelry maker adjusting the hole to fit the necklace it didn‚Äôt look as pretty as when I got it (the metal is woven in a difficult pattern)<br />Overall still a really cool necklace! Happy with it
4.0,Right now it is coldish in SoCal.  My vibrams have no real barrier between me and the hard cold floors.  These hiitave are amazing.  The first time I wore them one heel did start to blister but I wore socks with them for about a week to wear in the shoes.  Now I can wear them with or without socks.  I love these shoes and I like the bit extra cushion they have over the vibrams.  Also you can't beat the price on these. Will buy another pair soon.
4.0,"First let me say I ordered an XL because I keep hearing Ralph Lauren sizes run small. I'm 6' 200lbs, average build. Normally a large when it comes to jackets but I ordered an XL just to be safe. Length-wise, it's perfect. Almost a little short. But the arms are a bit too long for me, and the coat itself is a little baggy, like it's too wide. I feel like a large would have fit me perfectly but probably would have been too short. I really need to stop ordering coats online... the sizing issue would be solved by having those tightening restraints on the bottom of the coat and at the wrists, but this doesn't have that. Maybe I'll get shorter and fatter and this will fit perfectly. Anyway, the coat itself is great. I wouldn't wear this in below zero temps, but it's perfect for a fall jacket and still keeps you warm. I just wish the jacket had the ability to tighten the waist and the wrists."
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180lbs with an athletic build.  I have these in the size L (us 10).  They fit, I can zip them up (and still breath), however, they are cut to be a slim fit.  Due to my body shape I should have gotten the XL.  The material is nice to the touch and they aren‚Äôt overly heavy they are a bit short in the leg for me.  These sit right in the middle of my ankle so the only way these look good is in heels, I can not wear flats with them or they look off.  Overall, not a bad pair of work pants I however, do recommend buying 1 to 2 sizes up depending on how you like your pants to fit."
4.0,"I like the fit and colors, but I've noticed that the paint on the top ball is slowly chipping. I still like the size and comfort of the jewelry."
4.0,"Overall I really enjoyed using this drug. I have this strap for less than a year in the sink fell apart yeah I have to get another one. I‚Äôm not sure what kind of warranty these things happen, but they will not last a year.."
4.0,"The bracelet itself is cute. I like the idea of changing out the charms. I was going to use the 'wings' charm. I held it up and it literally says ""With Brave Wings She Files"". This would have been appropriate years ago, when I had a job where I filed a lot."
4.0,Cute shirt very loose. Could have been longer. Thin material.
4.0,Very thin but served the purpose.
4.0,"These KANCY KOLE Women‚Äôs Denim  pants are denim weight and as such, I'm not going to be jogging in them but use them as hiking cargo pants because of the pockets and cuffs. The only drawback for me is the white lining of the front pockets stick out."
4.0,Have been searching for chambray shorts. Happy to find the Lands End brand here. Perhaps from a past season. Well made. Good fit. Have not washed yet so not sure how much they will shrink
4.0,Pros<br />-fit as pictured<br />-great fabric<br />-good construction<br /><br />Cons<br />-very tight on the bicep<br /><br />I'm usually 18/20 ordered 2x body fit great drapes well. Has a dropped shoulder and on my fat biceps was kinda tight. All things considered will keep and may Oder in another color.
4.0,The bracelet ring is a little flimsy but good other then that.
4.0,The earrings look very nice the only thing is they are a little heavy- weighted on the ears.
4.0,"I wasn't happy that they were about 1- 1 1/2 inch different in lengths, but they work. I like the texture."
4.0,4 stars because it's too short to wear as a dress
4.0,It fits good and I really like the fabric
4.0,"Very beautiful and shiny as shown A bit smaller than in the picture. So if you have fatish toes, it may not fit. It's not meant to be taken off and on too often, otherwise it may break."
4.0,"Nothing to dislike, just wish they were a little bit bigger"
4.0,"Get pants to wear around the house. Attempted several workouts, pants rolled up a bit. I love the pocket feature!"
4.0,It was a little bigger than expected but it's definitely pretty.
4.0,Very satisfied with the ring.
4.0,I love my bracelet. The only suggestion I have is to move the small heart to a different location. It do make a little noise. May not bother some but other than that it's beautiful
4.0,It‚Äôs a decent shoe
4.0,Does a pretty good job of keeping groceries hot or cold.
4.0,Very beautiful ring but sizing runs small and I had to return. My ring size has continually been 7 but it was way too small.  I would recommend sizing up if you purchase it.
4.0,"This 22mm silicone watch band is exactly what I needed. The watch I purchased this for, a Junkers GMT, has a black dial with red accents. The red stripe on this black band sets it off perfectly.<br /><br />The silicone is soft, yet strong. The buckle is stainless and plenty strong.This band tends to be longer than I need for my 6.5"" wrist size but the two keepers keep the excess secured while also being plenty long for a buyer with bigger wrists. It's a good band and attractive. It does not come with spring pins,so you'll have to buy them separately. I would liked to have seen built-in, quick change pins so I take a star away."
4.0,I bought a few of these for Christmas gifts.  Everyone that got one seemed happy with it. I didn't get one for me yet so I am not sure how well they hold up.
4.0,I purchased these for my mother in law. She said the medium petite pj bottoms were about 6. inches too long. Other than that everything else about them was fine.
4.0,"I bought this hat as a gift for my fianc√©e, and he loved it. Material is great and design is great too especially since he loves this team. No complaints"
4.0,Very quick delivery and overall a great sweater. Soft material. Fits slightly smaller than expected. I ordered a large and normally wear shirts that are medium- large. Might have ordered a bigger size next time.
4.0,Got this for my 9yo to give to her friends as a gift for end of school year.
4.0,"It was longer than I expected as boleros are usually shorter than shrugs.  For the price, I am very well pleased."
4.0,I love wearing them while at work daily. So comfy since I work for a gym. I would love to buy them again.
4.0,"I like my watches likes I likes my sunglasses cheap, stylish and easily replaceable.<br />This fits the bill. Thank you Casio. Me love you long time."
4.0,Gifted to a friend for Secret Santa and she was very pleased.  Nice deal for under our $10 limit.
4.0,Delivered on time.. receiver likes it
4.0,The dress is a soft cotton.  Easy to care for but I don‚Äôt recommend machine drying!  Fits a little snug in the arms & shoulders but overall a great buy
4.0,"Had to size up, the inside lining is also hard to get not to show. I safety pinned the skirt together at the bottom so it wouldn't show. It was a good idea since it got very windy as well. I wore this as an actual skirt, not a pool coverup though."
4.0,"Seems like a great product.  They were a anniversary gift for my wife. Only con is when I received the item it was a ring. Amazon made it right, when the seller reached out and I responded they didn't care to reply......"
4.0,The fabric is not thick and is kinda sheer so you probably need to wear something under. But it is stretchy and flattering! I really like it!
4.0,I don't like the skin tight look.
4.0,"Nice dress th hat requires no fiddling with.  Put it on and go.  Can dress this up or down.  I like the many ways I can wear the dress. I'm a small and this fit true to size.  Disregard any size specs associated with this account as it's my husband's and not relative to womens clothing. I wear a small and it worked great..not too long as I'm only 5'2"""
4.0,"Love this top! It was much larger than I thought, but it is still wearable."
4.0,Great for a second life on a old casio watch. well built . could have been longer.
4.0,bought this when it was $36.99. would still buy for current price. everything is swell apart from the sleeves/buckles which go towards my waist. I have a small torso/bust which may explain why I guess
4.0,"Bought it for my 12 yr old son, and he loves it. Its a bit big but he does not seem to mind."
4.0,Bought xs but feels like like S
4.0,This is such a beautiful bracelet.
4.0,Shirt looks and fits good.
4.0,This watch looks attractive. dial looks nice with this blue colour. band is of steel and gold color lining with band is attractive and stylish. No problems occurs till now and hopping no problems occurs for many years too. A good watch for me. I like this one.
4.0,Fits as expected.  Bright white.  My only gripe is the paper tags.  No need for them in this day and age.
4.0,Very pretty but 1 corner at the top came apart so its not a straight line
4.0,"The only issue is the occasional magnet attachment to something metal on the clasp.  Otherwise, the adjustable band is a snug fit and keeps the watch from moving around on the wrist.  I have the black color and it looks good with the watch."
4.0,"Fit is good, length is excellent for me (5'9). I can walk in flats and its not dragging, nor is it cut mid-shin, showing the world my scandalous ankles. I wish that it came in a wider color selection, and that it was't quite so thin."
4.0,Very comfortable. Fit perfect. I'm tall so I wish they were just a bit longer. But overall I am very pleased
4.0,"Thin material, but super cute.  :-)"
4.0,It's as expected - but I haven't washed it yet so can't comment on that.
4.0,"I really like this dress and the fabric is light and  it has a fun style to it. The only problem is it is too big. I bought a medium and although I have a relatively small waist, this has an extra 2 inches if I pull it tight to where it needs to be to actually support my breasts somewhat.  I may fix it because it is pretty, light, and a little daring."
4.0,Good bundle for the money
4.0,"Bag was as advertised, hope the size was right.<br />Overall fast shipping."
4.0,This runs very small I gave it my 12 yr grandaughter
4.0,"These work as expected, they do make the key chain super long, so consolidating keys onto one ring helps."
4.0,"The fit was consistant with the other reviews. My daughter is 3 years old. I buy her size 5T or a small 4-6. She is 97% height, 97% weight. So she's pretty stinkin' tall, toned and bigger boned. This fits perfectly with no room to grow. If she grows at all, the length will not be comfy for her. Thicker material makes for a great quality. The pink seemed to fade a bit, in the washer/dryer, with only 3 washes (tide and downy), but i would certainly purchase this brand again. I would even purchase from this particular company. Good quality. If your daughter has any cute &#34;meat&#34; on her bones, I would suggest a half size bigger. :)"
4.0,Got it for a friend who's graduating soon; it's a good representation of our leader. All hail the Flying Spaghetti Monster!!!
4.0,Perfect fit for my 180 lb and 31&#34;waist. Exactly what I expected for workout shoerts with deep pockets to hold my cell.
4.0,It's super cute however the sleeves are definitely tight to the point I accidently ripped it off and I didn't even try all I did was reach into the freezer for something so now I think since it ties at the bottom I'm gonna flip it around and make it tie around the neck to stay on instead I think it's gonna look super cute that way and it is definitely a little short in the back but you can't tell unless you bend over
4.0,rock and roll
4.0,Very comfortable and keeps you cool
4.0,Great color and easy to use. Strap is a little too long
4.0,"Bounce free - check!<br />Accurate sizing - check!<br />Pretty color - check!<br />Flattened, awkwardly horizontal boobs - check!"
4.0,The ring is of nice weight and fit. It wears well. I only wish it had been packaged better. I would have paid more for it.
4.0,Very pretty and the zipper detail looks very nice
4.0,I gave these to my daughter for Christmas this year.  They should have clear lenses since you wear them in the dark.
4.0,Comfortable dress and easy to wear!
4.0,Its a pretty dress but I got a size bigger because the last dress was a little small but this one was a little big but its wearable.
4.0,Live them but would prefer some about half the size. I like them small
4.0,I like it will order again
4.0,"Fits good, feels good. No weird smells. I like that it's long in the front"
4.0,"I like the shorter carrying handle, but the shoulder strap is stubborn and hard to shorten.  I plan to take the handbag to a cobbler and have him punch more holes to shorten the strap as needed and sew the tip of that strap.  I like it otherwise and use it for about everything I need to carry going places.  I hope the magnetic snap will hold and last the life of the handbag."
4.0,It was fine but too small for golf shoes
4.0,Beautiful suit but sizing was a bit off.
4.0,Not my favorite because it is so light it barley stays in So when I needed to take my nose ring out to conceal it I just brought my regular nose ring and switched as soon as I was done.
4.0,The fit isn't as generous as I thought it would be.
4.0,So far so good in terms of the watch keeping time.  I don't for the watch band on the watch - it is a little itchy (stitching) and the color is too similar to the wood on the clock. It appears darker on line and i prefer that contrast.  Overall I like it.
4.0,Top and bottom of shirt reversed
4.0,"The boyfriend loves them and they make colors, especially red, pop. It makes some other colors look funky, but overall happy. The case didn't hold up well and fell apart. Overall I would recommend."
4.0,Didn't go by the chart and they ended up being a little big. Otherwise they're comfortable
4.0,Got as a teacher gift. I expected it to look a little better in person.
4.0,They will be great to cover my silver platters so they don‚Äôt get scratched.
4.0,A little snug. But I make it work.
4.0,"It really is a nice hat.  However there was no feather, as described (which is OK by me.  It just wasn't as described)."
4.0,"The top was a little small for me, but I have large breast. If it was going to fit perfectly I would have has to order 2 sets in too different sizes.  Wish companies would offer this option for people that have larger than tops or behinds."
4.0,Great for the beach or to wear over something. The white is definitely not thick enough to wear as a dress.
4.0,FUN SHOES.  LOTS OF SPARKLE
4.0,"Nice chain and pendant. Blue is pretty bright and doesn't look as real as I had hoped, but it seems pretty well made."
4.0,Really really like this but wish it was adjustable.  It's a little too big for my wrist.
4.0,At first i thought They are out there and flashy but then they grew on me. I do have to say that if you have a small face these will look to big on you. I need to get them tighten a bit and they will fit perfectly. I usually spend hundreds of dollars on sunnies but these dont look cheap and were definitely a great addition to my collection. Got a lot of compliments
4.0,Like the skirt üòç
4.0,Love this bag!  Well made and just the right size--not too big but holds everything
4.0,"i like it but, to big."
4.0,Super comfortable. Didn‚Äôt fade or shrink when washed. It is thicker and softer than a regular T-shirt
4.0,I like the color and the texture
4.0,Super cute but really small. Doesn't stay in place. Will only wear occasionally. Might be better layered with other necklaces.
4.0,My son loves this scarf. He said it was perfect.
4.0,I have the red one also and it makes a great accessory. They do kind of have a smell but nothing your perfume won't take care of!
4.0,These compression socks work very well for me. I have been having problems with my achilles and they added extra support.
4.0,Order exact size or one size down for a good fit. I ordered a size up and it was humongous.
4.0,"The metal and chain are very durable, though one of the wings were slightly bigger than the other."
4.0,the material is surprisingly nice for the price.  It's just too big for my daughter.
4.0,Purchased for my son and really like the long sleeve option. Color block on the back is vibrant and nice. Great looking and we‚Äôll made.
4.0,These booties are adorable. I bought them because the style was call ‚ÄúWyatt‚Äù and that‚Äôs my 2 month old grandson‚Äôs name. Lol
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34; 140 lbs with a 28&#34; waist and ordered a small. the tapered waist fits great, but the cut exposes the entire chest and even upper abs. and the strings are thinner than shown because they roll after being washed and dried. I would wear the hell out of it if I went to a hardcore gym, but I go to a gym with pretty strict clothing regulations. However, it's my favorite marine corps tank. great for chest and back day."
4.0,"It's a set of six.  Three medium sized beads and three small sized.  They can be worn together for a glamorous look or worn in a set of three for a more conservative look.  They can be given as a single gift or can be made into two gifts.  They're very lightweight.  Whatever is underneath the gold plating is an unknown.  I'm uncertain about the durability, but they're super affordable.  I'm actually thinking 3 1/2 stars, but since I can't do half stars, I'll go with four."
4.0,Feels good on wrist Not waterproof
4.0,Snug fit but ever so flattering!
4.0,"I'm 5'5, 34B and ordered a medium. It was too big for me. But I ended up giving it as a gift, total success!! My friend is 5'4, 36C fitted perfectly."
4.0,"My wife purchased them.  They were a touch long for her, but not bad.  She looked great!"
4.0,Very light weight and keeps the water out. I wish it had pockets. It gets warm.
4.0,"Overall, a really nice keychain if you're a fan of the show. However, there is only one thing ""off"" about it. The smaller keyring loop isn't all that good. It became loose after two weeks, thus detaching the keychain from the ring. I've since bought a modern replacement with no troubles since."
4.0,"Very happy with quality, performance and look, but be aware that it is necessary to remove the locking end in order to thread the belt through pant hoops. If you intend to leave the belt on a pair of pants for a while it works great. But this design is not ideal if you change the belt/pants frequently. Also it is a no-go for airport security as it is metal and tedious to remove in a hurry."
4.0,"Nice colors, good quality"
4.0,She loves kitties these were nice
4.0,"It will hold a few credit cards and some cash and that is about it.  If you want something small, sturdy and compact, with cool colors get this."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:45f93c0202ac195caf3073f4bed5304c]] I‚Äôm obsessed with this keychain! I had been wanting to order one for quite some time and this one was one of the best prices with the exact keychain attached that I was searching for. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because a little strip of jewels came off. They do send a few replacement stones and some glue which is amazing but most of the jewels they gave me were the wrong color. Other than that I am in love with this adorable bling bear keychain! Looks sooo cute with all of my keys and is the only keychain I need since it‚Äôs pretty big and is an amazing statement! Obsessed with this and highly recommend getting it for yourself or as a gift. It comes in a cute organza bag that you can use to keep the glue in or it can be reused to store jewelry or anything else!
4.0,"I am 5'9"" tall, weigh 141 pounds and received an L size dress for review.  It fits o.k. though a bit loose and I think a medium size would fit me better.  The material is all synthetic and the dress went through the laundry cycle just fine with no fading or warping even after being dried in the dryer.  This is a dress that I would wear to regular (non-fancy) events.  Maybe to the office with a nice sweater or blazer jacket, but it's not something I would expect anyone to give me compliments on.  The floral red is pretty, it seems to be constructed well and it should last a long time.  This might be a good dress to pack in luggage since it came out of the dryer unwrinkled even after sitting in it for a few hours after the load was finished.  The hidden zipper in the back works very well and it's easy to zip and unzip by yourself.  I like that the neckline is not too low.  It looks pretty much as pictured on the product page."
4.0,watch great - but snap on band comes loose when wrist get N bent position. Hasp will unlock at many times while wearing!  thks randle üòé
4.0,I bought this for the yard work and bike riding.  its awesome
4.0,very cute. love the color.
4.0,"These earrings are gorgeous and elegant at the same time. They are more of a medium size earring, so all the sparkle is not over the top. The shape of the earring has a beautiful flow to it. I deducted one star because  one of the posts was a bit tarnished and shorter than the other. Still wearable though and it does not show when wearing them.  I love them!"
4.0,These are great for working out and have a secure leg pocket. great price and worth every penny.
4.0,"Purchased this for a cruise, perfect for days off the ship."
4.0,I love these really easy to put on my daughter. She looked super cute with them on
4.0,So cute and I love it! Decently cheap quality but definitely enjoy what I got! I‚Äôm a size small/2 and I got the small and love it
4.0,"I love these jeans... I've had them for well over a year now, and to be honest the chains are made of plastic... They rip and tear apart very easy... Especially after washing them. I usually reconnect them on the sides by wrapping them in the jean shred from the section the chains fell away from... I still get compliments everywhere I go whenever I wear them."
4.0,Very shiny and a nice size for the price.  The &#34;gems&#34; seem well secured so far.
4.0,I just got it today. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to wear it yet. But I‚Äôm looking forward to it
4.0,These were for my daughter.  Her only complaint is that were very wide and fell off of her face until she squeezed them to make them fit tighter.  Otherwise she really liked them!
4.0,"Not a bad product, but maybe not amazing. The ring is smaller than I was expecting, which can really limit the amount of keys/accessories. If you have multiple keys already on the ring, adding additional keys can be difficult due to the thickness of the ring."
4.0,"It's nice, fits a bit larger than expected."
4.0,"Very nice, fits very well."
4.0,I like this dress as it looks just like the picture. However I ordered an xl (my usual online size) and it fits my body like a medium. It is also much shorter than pictured.
4.0,"It runs a little small the good thing is that is stretch so I was able to wear it, is comfortable."
4.0,"Because of the reviews that I read b/f ordering, I knew to go up a couple of sizes. And because of that,  I have a perfect fit! I love the fabric, and the colors that they came in. So far so good.<br />If there is any change in anything I will let you know !!!"
4.0,"For hot dog lovers, this is perfect"
4.0,"Look exactly as pictured,  the measurements have you get a size too large,  nothing that a thick sock cant fix."
4.0,I like this wallet aside from the fact that the coin part is small and tight.  I love the color and that it is compact.
4.0,Fits as expedited ..ordered a large was scared medium would be too tight could of ordered a medium..but atollcomfortabe to wear and adorable dress just as pic
4.0,Love!!! Wish the material was a little better but loved it still
4.0,"I cannot remember why I cancelled the order, but I remember they were extremely friendly & easy to do business with.  Off hand, I think I was also searching for a bone corset at the time and this product did not offer that support.  Still ideal for someone who is already past that stage and has the ideal shape."
4.0,Used them with a halloween costume. They are plastic not metal. but they still look good! not too big and not too small!
4.0,Got this as a necklace for a Homecoming dance.  The daughter I purchased it for used another necklace that matched her earrings better.  One of my other daughters took it back to college with her.
4.0,"I love croakies, no issues with the product, but I've ordered the Ziggy patter 3 times and keep getting the  flag pattern. Really frustrating, so if your looking for Ziggy, don't bother or make sure you get free returns ...."
4.0,"My wife loved this gift - until the chain failed (we assume) and she lost it while we were out and about. It looks nice, but it doesn't hold up."
4.0,Great material and cut but I am too curvy to pull this off. The deep cut is very nice but my F cup looks insane.
4.0,beautiful!....fits just right!
4.0,"I have been very satisfied with all the Dr. Motion products I have purchased. I need to wear compression socks, and it's nice to have some variety. They fit well, give good support, wash well, and go with everything."
4.0,"I prefer these slide on tie bars to the clasp kind, since you can't feel them poking you.  But I've also had one fall off and get lost (grrrrr).  But it's awesome, and I recommend it to guys who love cats like I do."
4.0,Nice don't fit rifgt
4.0,"Nice and thin, low profile. The band is pretty short so for those that have thicker wrists, it may not work for you. Also, the light is weak."
4.0,"This fits well. It looks really nice with a classic appeal. I can wear it for a job interview, yes, but I can also pair it with jeans. It‚Äôs a fun look. My only complaint is that there isn‚Äôt any stretch to it. I‚Äôd like some stretch to the shoulders."
4.0,"I find the watch to be heavy and bulky. however after couple days I got used to it,  I like the look of the watch,"
4.0,"The dress is as I expected for the most part. Soft, flowy material, and great color - looked as the picture indicated. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it was longer than I anticipated. I am of average height, and it falls  mid-knee which simply does not look good on me. I assumed via picture and description that it would be mid thigh, or maybe just above the knee. It is a really comfortable dress, so I am trying to like the length.. :)"
4.0,"This dress is so cute! The ruffles are adorable. I had to safety pin the waist a little bit to hide the seam, but other than that, this dress is great for the price! I am 5‚Äô4 120lb and ordered a medium."
4.0,"Well made, good quality. Fit was a little small."
4.0,Stitching has come loose already. Ribbon came unglued from hat
4.0,"These are very nice! I have muscular legs and they fit just fine, even have a bit of bagginess (which I wanted) if worn just below the knee. Colors are rich. Got them today, so can't speak on how they hold up in the wash, but they're so comfy I've been wearing them around the house with lounge shorts :)"
4.0,"The fabric is on the thick side, nice finishes, and color is great. I wish it were just a tad lower cut, as the top feels a bit boxy. The dress has a natural waist and a very slight flair, making it comfortable to sit and walk.  The dress requires a pair of spanks to smooth out the skirt if you have thighs (I'm not wearing any in the picture and you can see, it bunches/ clings a bit). I am 5'7"" (but my legs are short, and the length goes to just below my knee) I could have gone L or XL based on the size chart, but I'm glad I got the XL, because I wouldn't want it any tighter in the back or bust. (I'm a 34DDD, and and the XL fit is great, no smushing. If you want a true pencil skirt/ tight  look, and you're between sizes, go with the smaller, the fabric has some stretch. However, you have butt or thighs especially, probably go up a size if you want to be able to move without it riding up."
4.0,"The top was extremely true to size, didn‚Äôt have any issues with sizing. Material was comfortable and soft and stretchy where it needed to be. The only thing I will say negative is that the color stained the white long sleeve I wore with the outfit. Other than that, the top is a 10/10"
4.0,"It is a little sheer, which you can't tell in the picture. I like it anyway"
4.0,It's adorable. It fits my great niece perfectly
4.0,"I bought these for my grandson for Easter.  They were delivered in a timely manner, they are so adorable and his mom and I loved them.  However, when we tried them on his little toes came right to the end and we didn't feel he would be able to wear them through the summer.  Because we liked them so much, I reordered a size larger and expedited the delivery so we'd be sure to have them for Easter."
4.0,Can't seem to close them. They are really nice though.
4.0,They tickle
4.0,"These are cute.  However, I expected them to be longer. So, I would order a size up."
4.0,Smaller than expected but it‚Äôs very cute.
4.0,"I love this dress and give it 5 stars for style. But the under layer is sheer and very staticky and rides up too high.  I don‚Äôt feel comfortable going out in public. I bought a cheap slip to wear under. If it works, I‚Äôll keep the dress. If not, I‚Äôm going to have to return it. Which would be sad because it is so darn cute!"
4.0,"These are great shoes, my 11 year old daughter loves them. I feel like they have a more purple/pink hue  than the picture reflects. They look great with a pair of leggings or jeans. They run slightly big and have a cute, age appropriate heel to them."
4.0,"I love the yellow wrist strap, makrs it easy to find in my purse!<br /><br />The metal isn't super stong, bends a bit."
4.0,It was to be expected
4.0,Pretty cool belt.
4.0,Pretty decent overall smudge kind of easy.
4.0,"Since they are so small, the clasp is difficult to open and close"
4.0,"The shirt stops halfway up my torso. I wouldn't recommend buying this product if you're over 5'4. Otherwise, it fits as you'd expect, with a better-than-expected quality."
4.0,"More stiff than the original so it takes some getting used to. On the up side, a very attractive pattern on the band. Fit to the 42 mm watch is perfect, a good buy"
4.0,"These were not cottony enough for me, but nice."
4.0,"They are cute and they don't irritate my ears, which was the whole point of getting them!"
4.0,"Colors are very pretty, dress fits well but isn‚Äôt soft. The material is stiff"
4.0,"I loveeeee they're solid and they look real too, just they're a lil to small but I love"
4.0,"This necklace is smaller than a dime for sure but if you want a dainty silver necklace this is adorable. I love it! *** Quick update after a week, nothing major I thought I lost it for a minute because the chain broke but I was able to fix it"
4.0,These are good classes for the money.
4.0,Shirt was SO soft! Fit as expected!
4.0,I bought these thinking they were atleast the size of a quarter or half dollar. It's my fault for not reading the dimensions.<br />They are about the size of a penny.
4.0,"I love it! I am a curvy shaped woman and it fits great. I am going take a little in on the top, otherwise amazing!"
4.0,"If they were packaged better I would have given 5 stars. But came in just a ziplock bag, & molds were stuck to the instruction sheet. But they‚Äôre comfortable, and look great."
4.0,"I was happy with this pendant.  The description needs some clarification,  as to the proper measurement.  It could have been anywhere from 1 1/2 to 4 inches.  Saying that,  the gift recipient was very happy with it."
4.0,Very cute watch. It pretty much goes with everything! The only negative is that the band color fades away. But I still wear mine
4.0,The key chain is nice
4.0,Love the color & fit ...
4.0,i bought this hoodie for my boyfriend and he's very fit and slim so the small looks more like a medium.
4.0,"I am really satisfied with this purchase. I was a bit worried about the sizing but it has a lot stretch. You just have to pay particular attention to the sizing. Overall,  great product and I would highly recommend anyone to purchase this romper. I'm thinking about wearing it to my school's graduation."
4.0,I just love the pants for every day sport or shopping etc.. I just vary the shoes! I am 5'6 and 130 points I chose the medium the length is good (could be short on some body taller) and the medium is fine a confortable fit (small would have been Okay in my case)
4.0,I really love the look of these but they‚Äôre so light weight and feel too delicate. They get stuck in my hair when I wear it down and get a bit tangled up. I wish they had some more weight to them and that the backs were the same color.
4.0,Nice product. Wish the case was a little better quality.
4.0,"i normally wear a 14, but the xl fits nicely"
4.0,"My son will love it (its a Christmas gift). I have found that Disney stuff runs a little small in toddler sizes at least, so I suggest buying a size up."
4.0,colors just as pictured. Like the look and feel of the fabric
4.0,I personally prefer a deeper garnet color but these are still elegant and fit nicely. Not for &#34;petite&#34; earlobes.
4.0,Not even close to navy blue.  It‚Äôs teal.  It‚Äôs a really pretty simple dress and I love it but it‚Äôs really small for an XL. I wish they had a bigger option.
4.0,"I ordered this dress because of the gorgeous print.  The poppy print is vibrant and colorful.  I received an XL size which is way too large for me.  I usually wear a Medium.  The dress is high waisted with elastic in the back waist.  The dress is long with buttons running the length of the dress on the front.  The sleeves are 3/4 length with a cute bow-tie on the cuffs.  I gave it one fewer star, because it is very staticky.  It‚Äôs made of 100% polyester.<br />Although it‚Äôs too big for me, I still wanted to use it in some capacity.  I decided to wear it as a pseudo-kimono robe in the house.  As a dress, it would be pretty to wear in the spring."
4.0,These are very cute shoes.  A little scratchy and hard but don't wear them all day.
4.0,Do not buy this for the mask! Wings are long as I wanted but I wish they were 2 sided. Still nice. Very disappointed in the mask. Both straps fell off right out of the bag. Even just holding up the mask it curls down. There is no structure to it even if the straps stayed on.
4.0,The dress fit just the way I expected but the under dress is a little shorter than it looks in the picture but I am going to wear it anyway for my sons wedding.  I also received the dress in 2 days quicker than they had quoted me.
4.0,It's cute and is just like how it looks on the website.  It's pretty thin material but doesn't seem cheaply made and there ARE a lot of button snaps because of the design.  Sometimes style has an inherent cost.
4.0,Very nice but only time will tell on tender ears
4.0,"The wallet has 3 card slots on each side...large enough to hold 2 cards per slot. The only complaint I have which isn't really a complaint more of an observation, is that this wallet is wider than the similar J Crew one that I had. Could be because the card placement is horizontal instead of vertical. Overall I like the wallet. The elastics are nice and tight - hopefully they will stay this way for many uses!"
4.0,"This is a cute necklace, and exactly as pictured."
4.0,"The reason this got a low star review from other reviewer's, is because it comes stuffed into a tiny little bag and is all wrinkled and crinkled and looks like it would never ever in a million years look like the picture! However, once I steamed it, it was absolutely gorgeous flawless just like the picture. You have to carefully steam the entire garment and then also steam the feathers and fluff them as you steam, it works beautifully. Surprisingly it is great for the price. If you have a problem with the feathers coming out you may want to add a little garment glue right in the insides where they're attached and they'll stay for a long time. For the price and a little steaming you'll have a really nice pretty fluffy Zsa Zsa Gabor gown."
4.0,"I would it love to give this item at 5 üåü, unfortunately the top padding inserts do not stay in place, they should have a different shape instead of these round ones. So, I sew them with some stitches. My size bra is 36B, weight is 116 pounds, height 5 feet and waistline 26 inches. The bottom is absolutely perfect."
4.0,Good compression easy to put on
4.0,"Love the boots usually wear a 61/2 so ordered 7, fits big."
4.0,"Love this stuff and completely satisfied with the purchase, but ordered Super Scarab and Star Dust, but received Super Scarab and Infinite Nebula."
4.0,"This is a beautiful ring. However upon receiving it today, I noticed that the ring box looked cheap. That is a minor issue. The ring is stunning. I accidently ordered it not knowing it was an engagement ring. I ordered it in a size so it would fit my ring finger. It is a bit big but my class ring was the same way. I'm sure with some wear, it will fit well.  Its a great deal :) I think I'll be wearing it everyday"
4.0,Great product and easily fits my lip balm. The shipping was painfully slow that‚Äôs why I gave 4 stars.
4.0,"I read the item description and knew the width, but it would have been an even better belt if it were thicker. Worked great with a plain black dress and matching turquoise heels"
4.0,lovely fabric and very chic and sophisticated.  The pants run small.
4.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. The cut and design are just so pretty. But the actual sizing is quite small. I am usually a Medium so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately, it fits more like a small. It goes on but shows every single flaw. Not too flattering. If I had ordered a large, it would have been great. Sad to not be able to enjoy this one. Dress looks nicely made, includes rubber inside to keep the shoulders on. But I would recommend sizing up."
4.0,A little smaller that I expected but very pretty. It's a gift
4.0,Really like it for a beach dress.  Chiffon and pretty.
4.0,Im 5'5 135lbs and this is a little big on me but I still like it. It will be something simple but pretty I can just throw on in the summer.
4.0,"Haven‚Äôt opened and used yet, because it is a gift.  Looks nice and came in timely manner!"
4.0,"Ring arrived in good condition.  Looks like the picture, except that I think the ring and stone look larger than they look in the picture.  I was looking for a more subtle ring, and this one is more &#34;showy&#34;. The color of the green stone is brighter, in some lights it nearly &#34;glows&#34;, and the clear stones are so sparkly I find myself staring at it .  It's so much fun that I choose to wear it nearly every day, even when it doesn't go with my outfit."
4.0,Good sunglasses but spring action is not smooth.
4.0,This dress fits nice but as the day goes on it gets very loose
4.0,"Very pretty especially for spring. pastel stones, very sparkely"
4.0,"Some came with a nose piece that the kids loved, some came with year piece that the adults loved. A couple broke and scratched very fast . Overall an ok product!"
4.0,"Not able to see the durability as it is a Christmas present. Although I did open product just to make everything was there and accounted for. They look just as pictured, a little smaller than what I imagined, very soft and self rising. Color is great and quality seems good. Hopefully they don‚Äôt break once they get played with. They came in a box and packaged very well."
4.0,"I'm happy with this belt except for one thing, which seems to be a problem for all this type of belt: the faux leather bit at the tip of the belt is quite fat.  It fits through my belt loops once, but then when I want to tuck the excess into the belt loop after buckling, it won't fit through the belt loop.  I don't think it's really necessary for that endpiece to be so bulky."
4.0,not crazy about the handle
4.0,This shirt is so cute! I can‚Äôt wait to wear it!
4.0,"They are a little large for my 6-1/2 size foot, but I love bamboo socks!"
4.0,Purchased by my daughter and worked for a wedding she was going to. She said they were fine.
4.0,This fit well. It'fs supposed to be somewhat loose fitting. I love this shirt but I do feel that one of the elbow patches isn't lined up quite right. Just have to twist the sleeve a little so it lined up on your elbow where it's supposed to be.
4.0,"Handsome but narrower than indicated, and it wants to lean.  According to its Amazon description, the dimensions of its base should match that of a lunch bag that I need to replace. The width of the older bag (which has a rigid bottom that has not stretched over time)  nicely holds my food storage items.  Fitting the same containers in this bag is a struggle, and the bag also does not want to stand up on its own (probably also because of its narrow base).  So, while the bag is beautiful, it is not as functional as I wish."
4.0,"Nice swim shorts but runs very small.  If you like it snug, order 1 size up.  If you like the shorts to be looser order 2 sizes up.  Nice quality."
4.0,"The other purchaser is right -- this does run small. I usually wear a medium but have large boobs (34F). This is form fitting without being too tight, but it is definitely not a large. I'd say it runs about 2 sizes small. Also, the red portion in one layer and just sewn in with a few stitches. I don't really mind, but if you're looking to wear this long term or move around in it a lot, you might want to stitch it up a bit more yourself."
4.0,"The shipping takes forever, but my scarf is cute, and soft. It isn't as long as I would like, and not an infinity scarf as it might appear in the picture. But I still really like it and can see myself wearing it often."
4.0,very cute not as heavy as I thought but still nice
4.0,"These feels very soft compared to by cotton scarfs. I also have a merino wool one and this one feels better compared to the merino wool one.<br /><br />Be careful with the washing, please follow the cleaning instructions providing in the box for the longevity of the scarf. Spending ~$50 for this scarf is kind of expensive to me. However, the end product is stylish, comfy and war scarf."
4.0,"I have long looked for suitable hats for my grandson-twin boys, the hats are really delicate, however, fleece lining on the inner side is only at the height of the ears, so the next part of the cap is airy. The boys are around 3 years old so the hats are behind large and they still have to wait to get them dressed."
4.0,"Great watch for traveling, because it will adjust for time zones. Addition pluses, altimeter and compass. Minuses include hard to read in low light, yes it has a light button but if you are driving you can‚Äôt push the button and read it before it goes ou. Two if your shirt sleeve covers the watch during the day the battery may not charge enough. Would I buy this watch again? Yes I would for sure!"
4.0,"This is a very nice felt organizer for my day pack,  I only subtracted 1 star because it is a bit heavy for long distance hiking.  For local use it is perfect."
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, nicely made, bt it is a little large for a small size, still my wife liked it a lot"
4.0,"I wear a XL normally but the XL in this sweater was extremely baggy, I kept it but I will probably wear around the house."
4.0,Smears off very easily
4.0,Nice graphic Tee. Would buy again.
4.0,"The style of this cardigan is adorable and it's very good quality. However, while the idea of having pockets is nice, they stick out funny and make it very unflattering in the hip area. Minus 1 star for silly pockets, but 4 stars still because it was good quality and just because I didn't like it on myself, doesn't mean it won't look nice on someone else (I'm 5'3"", might fall better on someone taller)."
4.0,"Great! Bottoms are fitted, top is a little bigger but fits!"
4.0,Unless u have a curvy shape like this it looks like crap lol. Material is normal bathing suit. Arrived fast.
4.0,I purchased this for my daughter.  She was so happy when she saw them.  They fit her nice and she said they are comfortable.
4.0,"Looks good, fits good, wicks pretty good."
4.0,This is a beautiful dress coat. It is very well made but does run very small. Works great as an accent piece
4.0,Great gloves. One hand was a little snug but other than that they were warm and very useful!
4.0,The add said 80% Cotton when received 65% cotton.
4.0,I bought 2 other Medium jeggings that fit just fine and LOVE them. But the grey ones are really tight.  Maybe mislabeled?
4.0,I normally wear 8-10 and ordered the XXL according to the sizing provided which is supposed to fit 10-12 but it was way too big. The fit is more for a 14/16 not 10-12. I just had a baby so I figured the 10-12 would fit but the sizing is off and is more of US standard size. I thought it would run small coming from China but not this one. I won't be able to wear it unfortunately unless I alter it to fit me. The design is lovely though.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"The jumper fit perfect. If you are curvy like me, you may want to go up  a size. I purchased a size XXL."
4.0,"I have Predator 2 sunglasses I purchased over a decade ago for driving with prescription lenses. I got lasik lately and don't want to give up my favs, so I bought these replacement lenses and I am glad I did. They aren't as absurdly dark as my prescribed lenses (unfortunately) but they do work great and cut glaze dramatically."
4.0,"This cami is comfortable enough, the fabric is soft and the adjustable straps allow for a more customized fit.  I also really like the shade of green that I ordered.  I washed it in cold water and let it air dry without problem. I'm pleased with the product."
4.0,Good tie for the money. Fabric quality was a little lower than I expected but still a old buy for the price.
4.0,It ran a little small.  The material feels nice and hang nicely.
4.0,"This button up plaid shirt fits well, and I love this combination of colors. The shirt is a lightweight blend which is great for spring or summer."
4.0,"My daughter is thrilled, although they are smaller than expected."
4.0,"I am Bummed it does not fit, would recommend going a size up than your normal size. Is a very cute style though."
4.0,I love this so much. I‚Äôm a 34 C and it fit perfect. It‚Äôs so cute
4.0,The clip broke pretty quick but it still works and my daughter loves it.
4.0,Beautiful size wss a little off!
4.0,Fits great and is super cute.
4.0,The earring post could be  sturdier.  It‚Äôs easy to bend.
4.0,"I like this sweater.  It is easy care, oversized, and warm.  The tunic style is comfy.  One thing that was weird was that it didn't have a back tag so I wasn't sure which way was front.  It also didn't have a  fabric care tag.  Other than these two things I like the sweater.  The color is great.  A nice bright green."
4.0,"I ordered this BEAUTIFUL Solid Flared Super Soft Fold Over Maxi skirt for myself. I was searching for a skirt that was versatile. One I can easily change from dress up work mode to causal in one day. This skirt delivered on BOTH VERY nicely.¬†<br />~~~<br />I'm 5'4 at 145 lbs and chose size Large. The fit it true to size.¬†<br />~~~<br />DESIGN: The top has a waist cincher! I was able to flatten my tummy! The length arrived at my ankle which I love. Nicely paired with either high heels or stylish sandals. Also gives a nice a flair when turning :-)<br />~~~<br />FABRIC: Lightweight and Comfortable. It states I can machine wash, I'll instead hand wash. I want this to last me.¬†<br />~~~<br />When chilly outside I have paired these with leggings underneath and a sexy top.¬†<br /><br />The waist fold over gives me the option to either pull straight up over my bust and use a short cardigan giving it a chic look. Or long sexy long paired with some heels.<br />~~~<br />Also available in 8 colors and I want them ALL! Hubby of course LOVES it :-)! I've received many compliments.<br />~~~<br />Overall, I would definitely recommend.<br />~~~<br />DISCLAIMER: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my HONEST review."
4.0,The bag looks good but it's way too big
4.0,"Fits great, BUT, I made sure I ordered the multi colored pack & I received black & gray only. They will do for now but I was not happy."
4.0,"I used to have my nose pierced and I find that I miss it a lot now that it‚Äôs gone. I wanted to get another but I have gone back to school and on clinical days we cannot have any piercings with our scrub uniforms. I was these faux earrings and I knew I wanted to try them out. There are 4 pairs (8 earrings in total) which is great for me because I constantly lose things.<br />I have my ears pierced already, but I do not wear them a lot so every time I go to put an earring in I have to force it through and end up with puffy, red, painful ears for a while which is very uncomfortable. I had initially gotten this for a faux nose ring but I found that it pinched my nose a little and it was very uncomfortable, alone with a little too thick looking to be considered a nose ring. I‚Äôm not sure why I get a pinching feeling in my nose because I don‚Äôt get it any other place I‚Äôve tried to use it.<br />These look great as earrings, a lip ring, or a septum ring. I haven‚Äôt had any problems with them falling off, the ‚Äòback‚Äô of the ring seems to work like a spring that keeps the front and the back together so that it doesn‚Äôt fall off when you use it and it makes it look more realistic. I received this item as a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review. I am giving it 4 stars because I like the item, I had fun playing around with them, and I think they are a great way to get a faux piercing. I did not like how it pinched my nose, and adjustable backing part can actually fall out of the ring."
4.0,Bought these for my mom and she loves them so far. She really likes the post and how they don't get lost easily like the ones with the little plastic sliders.
4.0,They are so cute but WAY too heavy
4.0,"The bottom fit great but the top was just too small and offered no support. It could be a thing of preference, but on my body the top was definitely not as flattering as the bottom was. Regardless I'm keeping it because for the price the bottom is definitely worth it."
4.0,"Good design, good stuff, I liked it.<br />But, I got ripped off, and I was not sure if it was sent to my carrier or if it was mismanaged by the carrier.<br />I do not know who to complain to."
4.0,"Very nice shirt I bought for travel to Africa. Comfortable, sun protective stylish. Only issue is button holes have fiber running through the hole which catches the button and makes buttoning and unbuttoning awkward. All the shirts I bout on Amazon share this problem. You can certainly cut those fiber but still a finishing detail missed."
4.0,Great novelty product.  Not sure if I would really wear them.
4.0,"nice style also and quality is ok, not as thick as the white one, but also a nice buy"
4.0,dress is very cute but the medium was too small across my shoulders so it did not fit properly. i had to return
4.0,"It came with some strings hanging from underneath the arm that had to be cut off, but other than that it is a great dress. Very smooth. I wear a small in dresses and got a small. I'm 5'4 around 120 lbs and fit great."
4.0,I typically wear an XL. This was more like a large and was much shorter in length than I expected. I was able to pass it along to my teen daughter. Super cute top!
4.0,"very nice overall, I do worry a bit about the clip on the end being able to hold on to the canvas (not the buckle end)"
4.0,"grest shirt!  It is a super comfortable shirt. It is lightweight and very soft material. My only negative is that it doesn't really bunch up that well like in the picture, but I still love it. I wish it was a little looser down by the hips, especially for this of is that are a little &#34;plump.&#34;  The sleeves are 3/4 length and are a little tight, but still comfortable. It feels like I'm wearing PJs when I wear this shirt!<br />I received this product at a discount for a honest review."
4.0,Soooo comfortable. Fit Fabulous!! Colors are fantastic
4.0,"I love this necklace and I've worn it almost daily since I received it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because (at least for me) the star you adjust the length of the necklace with gets stuck often, or slides down so there isn't the line falling down the middle. Other than that it's perfect.<br /><br />Update on May 12,2011: recently the chain on the necklace broke off when all I did was pick it up. It hadn't been worn that much and was treated with care, so I was disappointed that for the price the chain was so fragile it broke so easily. Very sad, I liked this necklace a lot."
4.0,"I bought this for the head of HR at my company for our annual Secret Santa. A common subject of discussion at company events is about her son who owns a pot farm and dispensary on the west coast, so I thought this sweater was a perfect holiday double entendre gag gift. It got a round of laughter when it was revealed during the Christmas party during the gift exchange."
4.0,"This dress runs slightly smaller than expected. It is form fitting and definitely sexy. If you are looking for a Little Black Dress that will travel well and can be dressed up or down, this might be the one for you. The fabric is soft and very comfortable. There is elastic on the sides creating a ruched effect, which adds some texture and makes this more than just an average t-shirt dress. You can hitch it up a bit if you want to show a lot of leg, or keep it closer to knee length. The material seems to be a cotton blend, but I don't see an indication of fabric content on the tag. It does suggest that you dry clean, hand wash, or if machine washing, hang the dress up to dry. This dress is not the type that has anything built in to compress your flesh, so be aware that it will not hide any bulges. If you have anything you want to hide, you should probably invest in compression undergarments."
4.0,"These are nice slippers that go on easy. I like them for going to the necessary in the middle of the night, they slip on easily so I don't have to walk on a cold floor.  They are warm and comfortable but they are very flat and so with no heel support, don't feel great after hours of use.  I prefer a bit of a heel for the ""pushing forward"" effect. Maybe it's just me.  But I do find the slippers to be a nice deal for the price, the inside is warm and comfortable and some may prefer the lack of a real heel."
4.0,This item popped up when I was doing a search for a copper toe ring.............this is definitely not a toe ring. It actually fits on my thumb with room to spare.
4.0,Love the dress but did not like the strap around the neck.  I cut the off and it was perfect.  Dress fit perfect after that.  Arrived on time and Material was great verify flattering.
4.0,Use for my wedding! Love this dress. 4star because rend after one use.
4.0,"I am 5'6 and curvy. Fit a little large on me, too large for a shirt but too short for a dress. Looks good with skinnys or leggings. Wore a tank underneath, it's a little sheer. Ships from overseas but fairly quickly, received in 3 weeks. It's some kind of polyester materiel so stretchy and easy wash but make sure to wear your deodorant with this one lol. I got a lot of compliments!"
4.0,"These gloves were ordered according to my measured hand size and they fit the main part of my hand just right, but the thumb was way too small and I had to cut the seams open about half an inch up from the end in order to get my thumbs comfortably in. My thumbs are not out of proportion to my hands so this seemed odd. Otherwise, they are good for cycling, giving some padding and sun protection. Also, I like the velcro closure as it allows easy in and out. Good gloves except for the really tight thumbs."
4.0,I find the mask to be a bit too thick to wear for extended periods.  I was in Walmart yesterday for about an hour and the air flow just didn't seem to be sufficient for that long.  I couldn't wait to get it off.
4.0,Im a inbetween size... there decent
4.0,Because Every time I sat down the lace would roll up on my leg.  Wondering whether to return them or not.
4.0,"This bracelet looks really nice..I like to wear it to work and still put the rubber band on when I'm working out. I am a very small person (5'1 and just tiny in general) so I generally have problems with 1 size fits all being too large...this is no exception, it is a bit large and moved around a good bit (which is why I don't wear it working out). But other than that it looks good. My parents bought me a fitbit for christmas, I wore this around them and after a while I brought attention to it and they said they didn't even realize it was a fitbit."
4.0,Pretty colors.  Not itchy.  Can be worn with coat or sweater. The only issue I had is that it's thinner than expected.  So if you're looking for a pretty winter warm(I mean actual winter with snow)scarf this is more decorative.
4.0,Not the best quality but for school uniform jackets which might disappear very soon it's really a bargain.
4.0,"Very cut and well worth the money, but one broke. Otherwise they were a great buy!"
4.0,"I really like the style and look of this dress. I am 5'3 and 143lbs. I ordered a medium, but I really think I could've fit the small. Overall, I'm impressed but I took away one star because it is extremely long. I definitely have to wear it with heels or else I will trip over it, and it will drag the ground."
4.0,"Perfect for Valentine‚Äôs Day, price was well worth it!"
4.0,Dress is cute and comfy. A little smaller than what I would typically like.
4.0,Great for the price.<br />Size fit as expected.
4.0,they are a little wider than need be
4.0,"I really liked the assortment and the pendulums were nicely balanced.  For the price, they are a good value."
4.0,Small and cute..
4.0,"Nice dress,better with a belt.Comfortable."
4.0,This top is a great basic to go under a cardigan or vest. Its very cute and i love the detail. My only complaint is that it was a tad bit see through. If that could be an issue for you i suggest ordering a dark color. Fits true to size. Not a stretchy material.
4.0,"It isn't exactly like the picture, the openings in the petals weren't cut out which was a little disappointing.  I still really like them though.  They are light weight and definitely have a Bohemian vibe"
4.0,Pretty but a little flat. Nice for yourself or a gift. But I like the round pendants better.
4.0,My son loves the swim cap this comes with! The cap doesn‚Äôt keep your hair dry but it looks cute. It‚Äôs nice and fitted. Note the shorts are not lined.
4.0,"I love it! But, as a high school student it doesn‚Äôt fit a lot of things. I ended up having to carry my books in my hands. I got the 15‚Äù one. But it doesn‚Äôt hurt my back and it holds my laptop really well. I recommend getting a bigger backpack for school."
4.0,I wore this for opening day at Del Mar. It was awesome. Its not the best quality but it's good enough for me. The headband is comfortable and you can move around the flowers.
4.0,"This is actually the Zaruba madou ring from the Japanese TV show called &#34;Garo&#34;. I never thought I could find this here on Amazon. It looks very good, but not so well made, and some corners look weird. The jaw of the ring is not well done, so Zaruba looks like he has only the few front teeth. The teeth on the side look black. I got size 10 but then I found it was too big for my fingers. Now the ring is put on display. I may buy another one to wear.<br />I hope JBlue made more Madou rings and accessories from that TV show, like Goruba, Eruba, Siruba (Silva)."
4.0,Nice but awfully small
4.0,These fit nicely and were comfy and warm.
4.0,I love this Chemise. It's super cute and fashionable. The material is very nice. It washed and dried with no shrinkage.
4.0,Light weight. Looks as pictured.
4.0,"I am impressed with the quality of this product.<br />CAUTION: I ordered my size but feel like it‚Äôs a bit too snug. Sort of like a cheap hotel, no ballroom.<br />I‚Äôm used to a relaxed fit 36‚Äù Wrangler  jean but probably should have ordered a 38.<br />Overall, they are good."
4.0,These sunglasses are good quality and reasonably priced. They hold up well especially being around active young kids. They fit very well.
4.0,These tank tops are nice but very form fitting and only hit at the waist
4.0,I order up because I am busty but I should have ordered true to size it runs a little large
4.0,"I really love this dress, especially for the price! I bought a similar one elsewhere for $50. My only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily."
4.0,"Just the right size, however it would have been nice to have a chain option to wear it over the shoulder or around the neck"
4.0,super cute. The white shirt came with a little hint of pink. Not fully white.
4.0,Fits perfect and I love how it feels!! Made of good material and is soft and silky!!
4.0,"Based on other customer reviews, I ordered a size up and the fit was a little tight, but I was able to wear it, but you should order at least one size larger."
4.0,I was going to return this because the cups fit poorly but it works for correcting my posture so only wearing it at home
4.0,Looks great. The colors are right and it doesn't look cheap. My only issue is it does not come in a box. It's wrapped in bubble wrap not convenient for gifting.
4.0,"Decent  material, not much support on the top. But made it work"
4.0,"Very good beginners kit - has all the necessary tools for amateur watch repair. Doesn't have the absolute best quality, but much higher than expected.<br /><br />No instructions or even a list of the name of things included, though, which is why I deducted one star. If you are targeting amateurs, you should include instructions.<br /><br />I received this at a discount for leaving a review."
4.0,It's not fancy but does what I need - hold my sunglasses.  I had a Ray Ban case that ended up cracking -- can't see spending that kind of money if it's not going to last longer so bought this one.  My aviators fit nicely.
4.0,"Top is too small, but quality material"
4.0,Great shirt for hanging out around the house or when playing with the kids it is long enough to wear with leggings and looks good with jeans and a pair of boots also! Pockets are nice but definitely not for holding anything!
4.0,"This shirt isn't bad, it just wasn't as flattering on me as I hoped. But the quality of it is fine...it's not see thru or anything like that. It does flow away from the body so it could conceal a tummy. There's stretch. It's not my personal favorite but it's a decent quality top."
4.0,I ordered a large and it fit perfect. The material is not as thick as I would like it.
4.0,This is a excellent loop for the price. In my mineralogy career I have used some very optically good ones at ten times the price. For reading the tiny black on black part numbers on electronic components this is great. Very little edge distortion.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but a little tight in the waist. Dries fast. In public a Tanga suit is worn underneath, do to the see thru properties, when not tight to skin. Good product."
4.0,"This sports bra fits nicely! It has medium support, soft and comfortable."
4.0,"It was a great costume. At first, i disliked that it felt like the neck part of the costume was choking my neck. But I mean it is a body suity. It is suppose to be tight. Then after an hour, it didnt bother me anymore. Successful halloween costume."
4.0,"the material is cooling and theyre particularly nice if you have quite thin arms like me, and have trouble finding sleeves that fit. but thats all that is really good about these sleeves, other than that theyre pretty lackluster<br /><br />i bought the three pack with black, gray, and white. within one day of using the gray pair, a loose thread got snagged somewhere and the fabric completely fell apart before my eyes. the black and white pairs have survived, but only because of how exceedingly careful ive been with them since the last incident.<br /><br />basically, theyre not bad, but definitely not the best quality"
4.0,Biene un poco arrugado pero es perfecto
4.0,Good ..loved it
4.0,Can't beat the price. Better than expected
4.0,They were very pretty but didn't match wedding decor
4.0,I have several Southern Attitude t-shirts in XL.  This one fits a bit tight.  I may have to get the 1x.  Love the color and design.
4.0,These laces are sweeeeet but they werent quite long enough to fit nicely through my adidas sambas.
4.0,It's pretty and delicate but it does feel like it's going to break whenever I wear it.
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable dress.  I got it for an all white party. it is very thin however. you can see through it, so hiding undergarments may be difficult."
4.0,Generous fit
4.0,It was great. It fit great and I‚Äôve gone into the water with it a few times and it is still in tact.
4.0,Shirts are nice.  Could be more fitted around the waist.
4.0,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the opening in front , u def need a cami underneath, and what's nice about this dress is you can switch up the colors of the cami , love it !!!!"
4.0,Very long- had to have hemmed for my average height daughter.
4.0,I have very different taste depending on my mood and thought this bracelet would be an interesting addition to my jewelry collection. It is actually to my surprise it does indeed look exactly like the picture in the description. It is adjustable and fits well. It looks good on and I have worn it a number of times. I thought it would be a little heavy but it is not more so than a watch would be. It seems to be well put together and so far has be able to handle being taken off and put back on a number of times in a day. The only issue I have with this bracelet is the fact that once you put it on and tighten the slip knots there are tails that hang off the end of the bracelet. I have to tuck these in while I am wearing it so they don't continually brush up against my arm. Otherwise I like this a lot and I can see keeping this in my collection until the knots give out.
4.0,I got these bracelets for me & my best friend and they are super cute. The only problem is in the pictures they are double hearts & as you can see there‚Äôs only one heart on each bracelet. If it weren‚Äôt for that I would‚Äôve given 5 stars.
4.0,"The only thing I dislike about this shirt is the material, but I love everything else about it."
4.0,"This is a very nice watch.  However, it is still not big enough for my wrist - fits tight!"
4.0,Very cute sock. Arrived as promised and is of good quality.
4.0,I just got it today and its everything I expected. But I don't know what the charms are for lol
4.0,Losses glide quicker then regular dual purpose cream but way longer then lotion. Has no fragrance to it.
4.0,"Soft material,  and the flexible nosepiece helps get a custom fit.  I washed them before wearing (or course). They have well-made  adjustable earloops. And they look nice!  My state just went to mandatory masks in public indoor spaces so it is nice to have masks that are comfortable and somewhat attractive."
4.0,The dress seems a bit snug but my granddaughters think it fits just right
4.0,"I normally wear size Large pants, size 32-ish waistband. I've bought other compression shorts on Amazon and Medium fit me well. US size medium for these are basically unusable with anything in the pockets (even a phone in the phone pocket on the right leg), which kinda defeats the whole point of buying these specific shorts.<br /><br />I returned and ordered US size small, and they fit perfectly. I don't know if it's just the nature of the stretchy material, or if their sizing charts are way off.<br /><br />As for the shorts, it's what you'd expect. Comfortable, a bit cheap-feeling but if you want this style of shorts for a cheap price then this is basically one of your only options outside of the usual direct-from-China storefronts."
4.0,Was beautiful gave to my staff nurses for their keys and it broke the first day so she requested another please send
4.0,Good support. Good fit.
4.0,"I bought these leggings on a whim in 2013...in colors they even have anymore lol! I have literally been working out in them, washing them, wearing them all day at school, fluctuating in weight up to 40 LBS. for FIVE YEARS and they are still in such good condition. I figured it was time to buy more since they‚Äôve been so good to me. I noticed the colors are DEFINITELY not as nice as they used to be and they used to have heather colors of all kinds that were so pretty! Get compliments on the old colors all the time. I opened the first pair I ordered (heather charcoal) and I was shocked at how horrible the quality was! SO BAD! But the rest of the colors, NOT HEATHER, were the same as the ones I‚Äôve been wearing all this time. Just needs to be 88%nylon and 12% spandex. Only get those. So in all, 4 stars because the color selection has gone down, the price gone up, and heathers are trash, but ultimately they should last a long time, stay fitted and they don‚Äôt kill your wallet compared to others. Just wear a long shirt at the gym if you‚Äôre gonna be doing squats lol"
4.0,"So, it seems this product was made for people with a very pear-shaped body. My proportions are pear 35-30.5-40.5, but I have a short waist and a belly, making me a less defined/roundish pear. I'm 5'3&#34;. I think it's the petite-girl-carrying-some-weight body type. Lol.<br />Anyway, I tried a similar swimsuit with no ruffle, a light top, a dark bottom and sort of a vertical pattern all over, and it made my body look extremely boxy. My theory trying this suit next was that fair-skinned girls perhaps should do the opposite of the standard light top/dark bottom pear thing because the level of contrast with the skin is higher with dark fabric and draws the eye. Adding a ruffle to the bust and the horizontal lines on the hip would accentuate those areas thereby making the waist appear smaller... right? Well, I think I was onto something because this swimsuit looks much better and highlights my curves nicely despite breaking the rules. üòú<br />My main criticism is that the top is TINY for the size of the bottoms. Probably 34B or possibly even 34A. I wear a 34C, and if I do the lift & tuck, it looks slightly vulgar. One COULD call that sexy, though, right? Lol. I just think if I were a 36C or 34D, it would be unwearable, which makes no sense for a size 10. I usually don't even fill out a size 10 top. üôÉ I do think it offers plenty of support, which is nice, and it seems well-made. The only other issue you might have is that the straps are short (adjustable, removable straps.) They might work for a taller woman, but you would definitely not be able to cross them. I can just barely do it without their cutting into me. Oh yeah, you do have to put it on over your head, too, which is slightly annoying.<br />As to the bottoms, the color in the photos (mine and the seller's) is a little washed out. It's almost clownishly bright in person (not neon though) and IMO very cute. There is A LOT of room in the belly and butt, especially the butt, but the waist and leg holes are pretty tight. I was hoping I could pull it down a bit at the waist, but more than a couple of inches, and it cuts in. (Plus, the butt sags. Lol.) It does cut into my thighs a bit, too, but not enough that it's uncomfortable. At least the lighter colors draw less attention to that area than others might. Because the belly and butt are so big, the bottoms offer almost no control. You'd have to size down quite a bit to help with that, but then the waist might be too small! And I don't see the point of the ruching up the sides. It adds volume but no support and breaks up the pattern. Why?! In terms of quality, the mesh lining has a slight dry rot smell. Don't think it will last, but this is a $10 Prime swimsuit as I purchased it. I do like the bottoms and<br />think they look decent. They're just a little weird.<br />Overall, I really like this swimsuit. I know there's a lot that sounds odd about it, but I want to offer fair criticisms to try to help with shopping. I searched for hours for what might be right on me, and this is where I landed. Except for the butt, I actually find it very flattering and cute!<br />Sorry for covering the tummy in the side photo. I had no idea what to do with my arms.<br />Hope I helped!"
4.0,"This dress fit very well. I wear it as a winter dress, since the material is heavy (but the sleeves are short - I never got that about winter dresses). The yellow in the winter really brightens up the room!<br />The major problem with it, in my opinion, is that the line where the top of the dress meets the skirt pushes out a bit at the seam. But the rest of it is nice enough that I kept the dress, and recive compliments for it.<br />The collar is also closed and modest, which I like."
4.0,Fits  great
4.0,Nice shirt but way too big. I got a small for my mom who wears small and this has to be a night shirt for her cuz it's way too big.
4.0,"I wear a small and I got a medium because of the reviews. The medium fit well, like a small in my opinion. I thought the compression was pretty good.They aren't buttery fabric, but I love the color. Great buy for $15!!!"
4.0,"This is a really cute gift set. I liked all the pieces to include the little tie on the box, I even threw that on my wrist. The baby amulet though probably is a bit large for most babies so I put it on myself I like it. There are so many little things in this box that the recipient would never feel let down it's so fun. The little red string would probably fit best on the baby though."
4.0,"I bought this bag to replace a bulkier bag I'd been using. Pros: lightweight, water resistant, 2 pockets (one zippered) on the inside and one slide pocket on the outside, carrying handles that are long enough to sling over my shoulder, vertical shape makes it more compact than your typical gym bag, small nylon laundry bag included. Cons: shoulder strap is thin and uncomfortable (though not worrisome to me as I use the carrying handles), enough room for shoes & gym clothes as well as a few other items but not enough room to comfortably fit a full change of clothes (I usually go straight home from the gym so that's ok with me), laptop/tablet divider takes up potentially usable space if you're not using it as such.<br /><br />I really love this bag for my gym shoes and clothes, and it would be great for a running-around-town bag. However, you may want to reconsider if you bring a ton of stuff to the gym or if you're planning on heavily using the shoulder strap."
4.0,Shipping was super fast which I always appreciate. I received 6 bracelets in three different styles so they're great to use as friendship bracelets. I did have one that looked a little messed up but for the most part I'm very pleased with them!
4.0,"Based on the reviews and size chart I orders 1X and it fit perfectly. I am 180 pounds, 5.5 feet with 36 D bust and muscular in some places. The material is of good quality so although it is form fitting it does not cling to the body. Great for conservative office. I received many compliments."
4.0,Very comfortable and not to heavy and thick.  Had several compliments when I wore it.  Nice and soft
4.0,Many compliments beautiful dress. I'm 5'2 200 and got a large. There's no stretch but it was still comfortable
4.0,Order 4 my granddaughter she loves it...
4.0,Fits fine. I was not a fan of the inserts but when they aren‚Äôt in it doesn‚Äôt support as much. Decent for the price.
4.0,"I dont really think they are worth almost 70 bucks....but they are super comfy and they match a sweater I have. They run big, they stretch alot and are very comfy. Wash up well. 7 out of 10 for me."
4.0,"The pant looks exactly like in the picture but came wrinkled, It is difficult to iron because of the ruffles, needs patience. Wrinkles easily, Other than that everything was good."
4.0,"Very cute.  Not sure why they are slightly longer in the back than in the front, but this does reflect the picture, if you look closely."
4.0,I like these bands. Ordered two one brown and one black. They are very stiff once you brake them in you have a permanent crease but other than that I love these especially cuz of the price.
4.0,"The material is different than I was expecting but it's soft and stretchy just a. It staticky, I haven't washed it yet though. I ordered a small and I usually wear a size 8 but this fits great, I'm 5'3&#34; 160lb and wear a 34DDD. I was worried it was going to be way too long but it hits at the floor once I have it on. I have no idea when or where I'll wear it but it's incredibly sexy and flattering."
4.0,"The heels are beautiful and full of sparkle.<br /><br />I wear a 7.5, so I ordered a 7.5.<br /><br />The shoe fit as expected, except around the ankle.<br /><br />I have very small ankles, so the strap wasn‚Äôt snug. It was very loose to the point a blister started to form where it occasionally rubbed.<br /><br />Other than the wrap though, the shoes are very comfortable as easy to walk in.<br /><br />They are pieces together nicely and would make a great addition to anyone‚Äôs closet."
4.0,Like it just fine but when I received it the finish was damaged on the loops. Only other gripe is that it's a bit rough on the wrist until you wear it in some.
4.0,They are pretty and fit good.
4.0,Fits comfort and warm
4.0,I have not gotyto use these yet. But they where exactly as  described. The sizes where spot on.
4.0,"It‚Äôs nice fabric and decently made, I ordered a XL but found it would likely fit a Med size lady‚Äôs torso."
4.0,"These came in quick. I'll test out their durability and water resistance in a couple of days when I go out hunting. First, I'm 6'3"" 260. I wear 36x36 pants. I pretend to do strong man so I'm not thin but not that round. The fit is pretty good around the waist with plenty of room. I wear size 13 shoes and these fit my feet well with a little room for thick socks. They are tight on the calf. The overall height of the waders is good as they come up to the middle of my chest, however, they try to split me up the back side. It would be nice if the inseam was a little longer. So far, I can't complain for the price. Time will tell if they are worth the money."
4.0,"Not great quality jewelry, but a fabulous costume set for an event I attended with a tiger theme (no one could tell it is really a leopard). Catches are difficult to operate, but I got compliments all evening long."
4.0,"Super cute and easy, wearing as swim coverup"
4.0,"This coat is a nice weight for cold weather. I ordered it to replace on my husband had for many years that was dirty to the point it was time to go. While I ordered the size marked ‚ÄúB‚Äù since there was not an XLT option, the sleeves were not as long as he would like. They are long enough to keep him warm and do cover his wrists, but when he raises his arms his wrists are somewhat exposed. The length is the body seems to be good and the circumference around his chest and stomach are roomy enough for him to wear with a hoody or other bulky layer underneath. As a guy that hauls in and chops wood and other outdoor things he needs something warm and for the price overall this fits the bill. Shipped and arrived as expected. I would have given 4.5 stars if I were able only because I really was disappointed as was he with the sleeves. It is so difficult to find XLT coats and shirts for men."
4.0,First my son who is 20 years old loves anime. He has a funny personality as well. He is walking around the house today wearing his cape LOL. Now the reasons for the 4 stars. The button is not attached well on this cape and the material is more like a Halloween custom material. Not the plastic type of material more like a canvas material. With some minor adjustments this will be an awesome cape. The design is great and as stated in my other post I am 5‚Äô2 and he is 6 ft tall. It fit me just fine and it also fit him ok. He is a little tall for it but it does work. So yes I would recommend this for fans of Shingeki No Kyojin.<br />Yes this product was received at a discounted/free rate in exchange for an unbiased review of the product.

4.0,"Exactly as pictured, has lasted about a week so far."
4.0,I loved the shirt for the skit we were doing.
4.0,This product fit great.
4.0,This is a great bathing suit.  I love the details on the back.
4.0,Sleeves are a little tight if you have large arms
4.0,"It says ""one size fits all"" and surprisingly, it did.  I wear a women's XL and it fit me just fine.  Skirt seems much higher end than expected and hits nicely at mid-calf (I am 5'8"").  Looking forward to wearing it during the holidays."
4.0,"This cleaning kit is not a magical solution, but it does work ! woth just a few drops on the brush and some warm water, you can create an effective lather that leaves your sneakers clean. Does it leave them as if they were BRAND NEW? No. but it leaves them clean and ready to wear confidently again . See before/after photos attached *"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:cf2e6a87496fc607cbad178e000a452b]] I‚Äôm 5months pregnant 5‚Äô5‚Äô and 152lbs large fits great around my legs but stomach a little tight. I can button all the way if I want to be uncomfortable. Guess I‚Äôll just unbutton as my stomach progresses to get big.
4.0,This top is really cute just don‚Äôt get the white because it‚Äôs more of a dingy white color. I kept the black one though. Runs small. I‚Äôm usually a small and a medium fit way better!
4.0,"Cute color - coral is what I would call it over watermelon red, but I love it.  However the tassels are all balled up.  Will I brush out all 200 of them to make them look like the picture?  Prob not, so...."
4.0,"These are nice bands, the silicone is soft and comfortable.  I have a couple of issues.  One is the sizing. I got the 42MM 44 MM ML which says it fits 6.3""-8.3"" wrists.  I have an average sized wrist of 7"" exactly.  I was worried the SM would be too tight.  There is NO way these would fit a 6.3"" wrist.  I wear it on the next to the tightest notch and could easily wear it on the tightest notch as there is quite a bit of stretch.  Because of this there is a LOT of excess band to tuck in. the end of the band falls about 1/2"" from the watch base where it's attached.  Also, when I start to bend the band to tuck it, it pops off of the little prong that inserts into the hole.  Very finicky but once it's on, it's fine.  Just keep in mind when ordering if you're average size and in the middle you may want to size down."
4.0,Cute top!! It is baggy so I could have probably done with a medium. The top is made of a very soft material so it is very comfortable!! It is a very vibrant pink which looks great with white.
4.0,I'm a large chested woman. So the pads had to come out. It tends to roll up under my boobs so I have to readjust them when I wear them. But gives great support.
4.0,GREAT BUY. GREAT QUALITY AM PLANNING TO BUY MORE AS IS A VISION EXPERT I SHOWED THEM TO
4.0,"interesting material, not a cotton, soft feel, but looks great"
4.0,"I was so sad when this was too small.  I went by the sizing chart and ordered my normal size of a medium when I actually needed a large.<br /><br />I don't handle temperature changes very well anymore so I wear something with long sleeves in the house quite a bit.  This looked like a perfect item for a housecoat for me.  It is well made, soft and comfy.<br /><br />I should have ordered one size bigger."
4.0,"I've only tried it on, and the fit was fine. Looking forward to wearing it to either the pool or beach."
4.0,I‚Äôm so disappointed. I bought the size for 7 to 9 years but what came looks like it‚Äôs for 3 years old. I‚Äôm really sad about this purchase
4.0,Nice fit and clear vision
4.0,"These very cute socks are labeled for 0-12 months old but seems more of a 3 ‚Äì 6 months fit ‚Äì but babies vary so much in size, it‚Äôs hard to be exactly specific. To check to see if the socks would shrink at all, I washed one sock with cold water and put it in the dryer on the normal cycle.  The sock, which is made of 80% cotton, did shrink a little (see picture).  This is all the more reason the fit would probably be best for 3-6 month old baby, and even then, if the socks didn‚Äôt totally go up to the knee, it would keep the baby‚Äôs legs warm as pant legs often ride up. The non-slip feature is especially good since my grandson may wear these when he‚Äôs jumping in his jolly jumper and it will help him not to slip. This pair of socks was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I hope this review was helpful to you."
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter in size small, she is about a size 5. These are a little loose on her but she loves how comfortable to are and the fact that there are pockets"
4.0,This I a very sexy shoe however the color is very different from what is displayed. The color is VERY light/pale
4.0,"A unique design, but attractive, inexpensive watch. However, the very small date window is not easily read with a quick glance. Were it not for this, five stars would be awarded."
4.0,This is one fun toy. although you cannot put medium size toys it it or it will not go down when you win. Small candy or toys are better
4.0,Oh it‚Äôs perfect size but other than that stering were a little long.
4.0,"This logo free part of your sweats is what its material and form is intended, keep your eyes non-stinging, and also secures vision assist from sliding down your nose. When they come out of the dryer, they appear to have shrunk, but not so. So far, very good, and I will order more as needed. Gym training and yard work in Florida absolutely requires them."
4.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. We both like the way he looks in them as well. Great for fashion and Halloween. They are a little snug but still fit well.
4.0,"Real Good Quality, the one down side was it only came with the Black Buckle in the box, was really looking forward to both buckles .. but fits  and looks great.."
4.0,Love these sweatpants so far. Extremely comfortable they were a little big but I like the extra comfort that gives. I will be buying a couple more pair I believe.
4.0,colors not a s bright as shown
4.0,I bought this top in grey & LOVED it. So thought I'd buy another. This fabric seems to be thinner than the grey. Maybe it's just the color? I'm keeping it but like the grey Soo much better.
4.0,Very nice just like the pc
4.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt say this runs VERY small , I just felt that I went up a size and it just fit. But with that being said this is a very nice coat for the price point. Well made with a silk lining. VERY SOFT and I love that it covers my hip area which is my problem area. It was shipped next day which is nice to receive so quickly and came in a vacuum sealed package. Once it was opened and puffed out I was able to feel how truly soft this is. It has a silk lining and the whole coat is well constructed. I would definitely recommend to a friend but advise them to go up at least one size from their regular size.  The red string bracelet was a very sweet and kind touch."
4.0,"The glasses are quite attractive and they do fit well.  They arrived in a very nice case that included a little tool for tightening screws on the glasses should they ever come loose.  I'm very impressed with the quality of these glasses and I love the fact that they are polarized, especially since I go fishing regularly and polarized glasses help to significantly reduce glare from the sun's rays bouncing off the water.  After trying these out this weekend while fishing, I discovered that it took quite a bit getting used to the brown color of the lens.  I ordered brown to match the brown frame, but in hindsight, I think I might prefer more of a gray toned lens.  This is a matter of preference only and in no way detracts from the overall quality of these glasses."
4.0,"Nice hat, good prie.  Brim seems to be a little unstable and off center.  Possibly from shipping.  Overall a good buy"
4.0,These have been really comfortable for my son to wear. He keeps them on just for winter warmth even. They are adjustable and the prints are cute. I had to take a star away though because we've only had them a few months and the plastic filters are starting to fall out and seams are coming undone when washed. We are down to only 2 of the 5 left that haven't fallen apart.
4.0,"This is a good ring, but a bit too wide. It is very flashy, so if you are not into that, you might want to avoid this ring. Other than that you will enjoy it."
4.0,Didn‚Äôt protect from the sun like I thought it would
4.0,"First, let me start by saying that replacement bands for the Garmin Fenix line of watches are not as plentiful as there are for other types of wearables that I have had in the past (Samsung Galaxy watch, Fitbit Alta HR, etc).  That's a disappointing situation for someone that likes to change their band to match their clothing.<br />I ordered the white version of this band with little expectations of a well made product.  The fit is excellent, even better than the original bands that come with the watch.  I have very small wrists and the watch typically slides on my wrist because the settings that I can choose from are either too tight or too loose.  This band fits perfectly on the very last hole.<br />The band is slim enough that it looks feminine (yay) which is probably not a band for a male customer.<br />I will be also ordering the black version of this band as the original white silicone band gives me a rash after extensive use and it will give me an additional fashion band to use when not exercising."
4.0,Bottoms a little tight and top a little bigger than a normal small size
4.0,Shirts run small to size. Need one or two size larger. Below weight needs XL or XXL
4.0,I like it so much but you do have to get a bigger size than your normal size especially if your size 14 and over
4.0,The shoes are very well made and fit as expected. The only complaint I have is that the color is not consistent with that pictured. The actual shoes are a darker orange instead of the camel color.
4.0,"This is a great heated vest, however the sizing runs small."
4.0,"This skirt is perfect!! Quality is good and is exactly as described. The size chart is china sizes. I wear medium in US size, so I ordered an XXL, it fits perfectly. The pink is very cute!"
4.0,I love them they very comfy
4.0,"I actually use it to hold some pills that I need to take during the middle of the day. I have worn it as a bracelet several time. For me it is almost too heavy as a bracelet. The charm wants to constantly slip under my wrist, so I find myself constantly flicking my wrist to get it back up. If I wear it all day, I can get a sore wrist from flicking it back up. But it is cool that it can be a bracelet or necklace."
4.0,"I liked wearing this belt as it helped keep my belly tight. However, it is pretty long and can make you feel hot after wearing it for a while."
4.0,"Beautiful color, perfect texture on my legs, everything is comfortable and sucks the skin in pretty tight. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a bit of a cameltoe so you can‚Äôt pull it up to your belly button if you‚Äôre a bigger girl or in general i don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôll have to sag the hip line a little bit, but i wear shirts/jackets to the gym that reach past the cameltoe so i don‚Äôt really mind it. Hard choice between 5 star and 4 star, simply just because of the cameltoe."
4.0,"I have longer, thick hair and the caps will slip somewhat."
4.0,"I'm 5'3"", 34d and 30"" waist. The medium fit pretty well, although I'd like it a little looser. It is loose in the legs but fits well through the shoulders and arms. This hit the top of my feet so I feel it is too short. I would buy a size up but it isn't available in black."
4.0,Nice and sparkly earrings.
4.0,Love stitch!
4.0,They are HUGE like Huge huge and in the crotch there is already a hole starting and I‚Äôve only had them for two weeks but they‚Äôre still comfy and worth it
4.0,"Its a nice bracelet, but the bolo is hard to slide and it is very lightweight."
4.0,Beautiful piece. Great buy!
4.0,"I bought these as my previous boots shoestrings decided to be my cats play things for the weekend. So I picked these up on a whim. Extremely comfy, snd worked like a charm for a week in yosemite with 100 miles of hiking.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-comfy<br />-fit as expected<br />- water resistant<br />-breathable<br />-smell wasn't terrible after long days<br /><br />Cons:<br />- while breathable, these do get a bit hot footy<br />- notice some traction issues on slippery surfaces<br />- collect dust a mofo"
4.0,So cute. Just get couple of sizes bigger.
4.0,Pro:<br />Good color.<br />Fit well around the waist.<br /><br />Con:<br />Slightly longer than anticipated.
4.0,Loved the colors. There needs to be another small jump ring in it to make them hang right
4.0,I love wearing this skirt in the spring with a white t shirt and vintage cowboy boots..
4.0,"Nice weight , well constructed fit was as per measurements. My only problem with thi is I would have liked it in a longer length!"
4.0,"I was a little nervous to buy clothes from Amazon, but I was having so much trouble finding a shirt just like this in stores. After a while, I told myself I just needed to go ahead and buy it knowing I could return it if I hated it, but I ended up loving it! It worked perfect for what I needed. I just wanted a long shirt to cover my bum when I'm wearing leggings (I refuse to see them as pants.) Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with anything else but leggings. I've tried it with jeans, but then I just look frumpy. It's also really plain, so it does better with really colorful leggings and I necklace to make it not seem so boring. I was really happy and will buy more clothes from Amazon."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11, measurements 38-28-38, I bought a medium and was very happy with the dress! A little snug in the chest but otherwise it fits pretty well and is long enough to almost hit the floor. The material seems like it will wrinkle but is a great dress overall, would definitely buy this again in another pattern."
4.0,I got my size but it‚Äôs too big size down  they don‚Äôt have the size I need so I gave them away
4.0,"Bit small, but will still be usable.  Cute design, fast shipping, well packaged."
4.0,"I am a smaller XL and these fit me well (6' 205).  I use them with a pair of size 11 boots and the fit there is acceptable.  draw string on top will hopefully keep me from being swamped by a sneaker wave out here in the NW Pacific.  Very easy to get in and out of, pockets are ok, so far so good!"
4.0,Fits good very nice sweater
4.0,The straps came off after 2 wears. My son loves these but they do start to smell if you don't wear socks with them.
4.0,I bought these for my tragus and they look amazing. However it's next to impossible to get the jewel in. Once it's in it's well worth it. Love this buy
4.0,"5'4&#34; 116lbs, bought the size small. feels like polyester knit. i don't love it, but i don't hate it."
4.0,Snug fit as expected. Very comfortable!
4.0,Cute and well made hat.
4.0,Bought the jacket for my husband. He likes it. Only negative is he wore it 2 times and the seam in the pocket ripped. Wasn't impressed with that.
4.0,This is such a cute suitcase! I love the color and the inside fabric looks like the inside of a child's purse. I mean that in a good way. It really fits the outside well. The suitcase works better than another major brand at the airport and fits better under the seat. I highly recommend this.
4.0,"Bought these as maternity panties because it seems silly to invest in anything expensive. They're comfortable with a decent amount of stretch so they work well. They run a bit big, but for my purposes that works out for the best."
4.0,not finished at the botton wanted a finished edge not freyed
4.0,"perfect for my 8 years old who wanted her birthstone, but we just weren't willing to spend so much on top of the line emeralds.<br />Sadly, i ordred 2 sets, knowing she would lose one... and one of them came without the back !<br />still love them"
4.0,"These were exactly what I had in mind, the only slight change I would like would be a tab that fits in the watch band to help it hold its place, but since being on it hasn't slipped at all!"
4.0,First off I really love this bathing suit but the top is way to large for me. The cups just swallow me. I am a plus size girl but only have a C cup :/ I would love to be able to return just the top?!?! The bottoms fit great!
4.0,I like the elastic waist. The material is good quality.
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; and 150lbs and ordered a medium.<br />First of all, the quality of the fabric surprised me- I expected cheap, thin, and ultimately see through but I was wrong! It's thick like a really good Long sleeve shirt...<br />As for fitting, the sleeves reach my wrist perfectly as the length of the dress is also perfect. My only issue is that the seam between the top and skirt part is a little wide and isn't as fitted as I wish it was although it's possible I got a size too big...I'll just wear a belt for little extra definition.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase this product again and in different colors!"
4.0,"I got this dress for family Christmas photos . I‚Äôd give this dress an 8/10 ! It was very comfortable, soft, pretty, and practical . Only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a 10/10 was because In the listing , the plaid part of the dress seemed a little more ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù, If you will. And when i put it on , it didn‚Äôt seem as ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù. No big deal . Still loved it (:"
4.0,very nice looking purse in person too. I haven't used it yet but love the quality.
4.0,"This sunglass is so cute and trendy! It's super lightweight too. I've been getting compliments whenever I wear it.<br />I think the only thing that I don't like about this product is the fact that it leaves a line on my nose bridge :( but other than that, I highly recommend buying it!"
4.0,Really useful love it
4.0,"Much larger than expected, not sure how I feel about it yet but if you‚Äôre into that they are super cute"
4.0,Buen dise√±o y seguridad en el envio
4.0,Was easy to put on my glasses and holds them up well but can get uncomfortable after a while. I use these daily and they have gotten better comfort wise.
4.0,"Cute, but very heavy. I have a small tree and it pulls down the branch I have it on. If you had a bigger tree it would work fine."
4.0,"I love this dress. I brought a size too large , so I had to have in taken in. The fabric is great. I can wear it with or without a shirt underneath the dress. I would definitely buy again if other colors were available."
4.0,Nice looking and great for adding a little something extra on your wrist.  Looks more expensive that it was.  I would buy again
4.0,Lovely and nicely made.
4.0,It is a nice costume jewelry necklace
4.0,Great product but very thick. Good for winter use!
4.0,"Purse is a little bit larger than I had anticipated, but has great outer and inner compartments. I should have paid closer attention to the dimensions.<br /><br />The top zipper is a bit problematic - it's hard to grab and open at times.  Also, the carabinor is difficult to attach to the zipper.<br /><br />Fabric and pattern is nice."
4.0,Great for cheap sunglasses - the tint is cute!
4.0,For the price it's really cute. Bright yellow color
4.0,The fit is small for an extra large but this is so cute I won't send it back
4.0,"OK shoe trees that have the features I wanted but mediocre quality.  I ordered 4 and there was no consistency, a lot of sloppiness in the assembly/shaping, and a couple had been repaired by the factory when the wood cracked/broke.<br /><br />Update: the seller reached out to me, apologized, and offered to replace the shoe tree.  I increased my review to 4 stars to reflect the good customer service.  It‚Äôs refreshing to find a seller that stands behind their product."
4.0,Zipper in the back is a bit tight but the dress is great
4.0,"I loved this top, but I wanted beige and it was more yellow."
4.0,It arrived on time and was about what I thought it would be.
4.0,"The watch is a beautiful silver color, and made form nice materials, however, the clasp is not the one advertised. The clasp on the watch I received is a (double) deployment clasp NOT a Fold-Over Clasp with Hidden Double Push-Button (I don't know if the wrong illustration was selected but I was hoping for a different clasp). The band is also not as wide as I was initially thought. I still like the watch and will keep it but wish I had gotten a more accurate description. The link remover tool is definitely a bonus."
4.0,"Comfortable house slippers, run a little small"
4.0,Comfortable fabric but a bit small in bust area even though I followed size chart. Also cute but does make me look pregnant even though I am not.
4.0,Love the dress .  Sleeves are a bit longer than I would like  but over all its a keeper
4.0,"Solid, no issues. It is what it is."
4.0,"I use these as an under shirt. They fit pretty well, it would be nice if it was a little longer but overall not bad"
4.0,Overall a great way to have a mask that does not bother your ears. I didn‚Äôt give five stars because the mask loses elasticity with every wash.
4.0,I love the patterns on these undies and overall the quality is great. The thighs are a bit wide though and don‚Äôt fit my son snugly and sometimes bunch under pants. They wash well though and are quite soft.
4.0,Very cute. But runs a bit too small so it's kinda tight
4.0,Very comfortable - material is nice
4.0,"Look ok, will not fake to be a high end, but looks nice and is good size"
4.0,Cute for grand daughter
4.0,"I wanted something lightweight, but I was a bit concerned when I received it that it might not hold up. I have taken this piece on two international trips -- on planes, trains and busses -- and it has definitely done the job.  I purchased a backpack that fits over the handle and I can tool around the airport with ease. As hard-sided luggage goes this is not a 'heavy duty' piece - but it has worked for me; the spinner wheels, handle and zipper have held up nicely. Definitely a good value and worthwhile purchase."
4.0,My hussy like the fit
4.0,"This bag is beautiful, nice size, quality leather, and functional. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the awful chemical smell when it first arrived. I hung it outside for a few days and the smell is pretty much gone."
4.0,"I would give a 30% improvement on locating balls, but I found it straining on eye after you wear it for 4 hours but it does help in locating where is balls are located! it also seems to work better with the yellow balls to me for unknown reason which I was surprised.. I recommend it"
4.0,"Lovely dress, received lot of compliments. I'm size 12/14, large fits great and very flattering to the figure however, the only down side is the material gets the little elastic stringy things and the colour fades with washing. I suggest you handwash"
4.0,Very pretty dress however the fabric is very thin/see through
4.0,knew they were 3/4 sleeves but they were just a little bit short
4.0,"Very confortable.  They dont make my size though.  Male a 32DDD, please!!"
4.0,The slippers are soft & warm and easy for my little one to put on.
4.0,"Young LA brand fits inconsistent.  I've ordered a few things from them over the years and while some times a Large fits like a Small, in this case a Large fits like a large.<br /><br />Comfortable shirt, nice to wear around the house or casually.  Large fits well 5'11"" 195 lbs."
4.0,"I am very pleased with my talit.  I purchased it for my not yet born grandson!  I am so thrilled to find a messianic prayer shawl, thank you!"
4.0,"Purchased for my mother, who is always cold.  It is a nice robe and fits her well, but would like for it to have been thicker.  She has worn it a couple of times, but goes back to her thicker robe."
4.0,Simple pearl dangle earrings.  Well constructed and looks very nice when wearing.  The pearls are a little larger than pictured and are more of a teardrop shape not round as one would expect the typical pearl.  Overall this is a nice earring for the price.  Pleased with this purchase.
4.0,They are sturdy and fit much better than expected. They are very comfortable.
4.0,"Great fit,,but be aware it's short! You will show lots of leg."
4.0,We have a big boy but compared to other items listed at this size it seems a little small. He is a 7 month old wearing 12 to 18 month clothes and is not fat.
4.0,Perfect for playing in the sun.
4.0,Great knock around shoes for taking out the trash or walking the dog not make for a long distance walk
4.0,"There not bad pants for work or quality, although this was the second time I ordered one size bigger for my son. He's normally a size 32 waist he couldn't pull them up. So I ordered 34 he hardly can button them. Length is pretty much what it says. Other than that for the price they are ok pants for work."
4.0,As others have stated these are tough to get into an earlobe due to small 3mm opening so if you have thicker lobes these aren't for you and go to atleast 4mm. It is also tough to get the ball in since they are so small but I was able to get all 4 in with balls inserted but took over an hour. The product was received and was as stated so I'm good with my purchase.
4.0,"This winter workout top is great for stretching, yoga or outdoor actives like walking, hiking or gardening. The shirt stretches with you as you move, and it goes well with a pair of leggings. The top flares over the hips and the dark blue color is flattering with black leggings. A very comfortable shirt to workout in."
4.0,"I normally wear Ray ban plastic frame sunglasses and have a very hard time wearing aviator sunglasses because my face shape just doesn't like them. I however love the aviator glasses look and have been searching for a pair for a very long time. I was shocked on a happy way that these sunglasses fit my Asian face so well. They are very lightweight and comfortable. They do not slide down my nose bridge at all so there is no constant adjustment of the glasses on my face. I love that these are polarized and they work quite well. The Aztec design is fun but looks a little bit cheap, hence the 4 stars. It would have been nice to purchase a solid color frame or a tortoise colored frame. this Aztec design is more suited for someone in their teens or 20s. I'm in my 30s and can't pull it off as well. The sunglasses came very nicely packaged in a cloth bag.<br />I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I myself heavily rely on product reviews when making most of my purchases especially since 80% of my purchases comes from the Internet and I really dislike making returns. I strive to be unbiased and to include information that I find helpful for me to make a purchasing decision. I would gladly purchase these at full retail price. they are well worth the low price for polarized light weight glasses. If I ever lose them poolside or on vacation I would not be as upset as if I lost my other ray-bans."
4.0,"the other reviews are true, this dress is VERY SHORT. I can't image any one, of any high, not being able to wear this with out shorts underneath. but cute other than that"
4.0,I just like Orvis...
4.0,I'm only 5 feet tall and this top was too short and it was smaller than most tops I've bought that are size Petite Medium.
4.0,"I like the quality,  but it is quite tight through the chest.  I'm not returning it as I'm planning on taking it to my seamstress for some remodeling...  or making it into a skirt.."
4.0,It was a great color bought it as a Christmas present .
4.0,i got it adjusted but nice
4.0,Beautiful. The top was too small but took out the padding. Then fit nicely.
4.0,"The bra has nice strong adhesive and lasted all night long. I wasn't able to use the drawstrings though due to the bra being almost too small. However, I didn't need to."
4.0,Great bra a little big if your interested on the small side
4.0,Love everything about this shirt except the buckles on the arm. They clank and make noise. Had to work on getting them off.
4.0,Runs small so bigger size necessary
4.0,The dress was beautiful. I knew I would have to have general alterations done; however the sewing at the back of the dress where it laces up was not sewn in alignment with the inner lining of the dress. My seamstress was able to fix this problem very easily though. After all alterations were complete I was overly pleased with how the dress fit. I would definitely purchase again. Happy customer.
4.0,"Nice looking quartz watch for the money but don't expect Omega or Tag quality. However, it does keep accurate time and looks nice."
4.0,Comfy but hoping it was a little more roomy. But I'll keep it as a layering top.
4.0,"No defects, no faults or slight tears."
4.0,"After a few tugs and attempts to adjust around, one of them got its extending piece very loose. I feel like it will bend too much one day and it will pop out. The ring does not really center when used as a septum ring,  but not because it is a defect... Its just the way it is designed. Works fine as earring or nose."
4.0,"Except for being unable to take up the linkage to size the watch to fit better, I really like this watch.  It is very stylish and really dresses up an outfit."
4.0,"They came packaged in a really nice little cloth pouch, they are exactly as pictured and have been great, the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the diamond turns in its setting and can rattle a bit a first which can be a bit distracting and loud in your ear, although I'm sure a dab of clear glue from behind could stop this problem."
4.0,Its exactly as it shows in pictures but no pockets instead zippers for cool style and easy on and off
4.0,"Love it so far!! Perfect fit. Most definitely makes the watch a little more feminine, which is exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,Overall good fit with the look of a push up but the feel of a sports bra. Would give it a 5 star if the attached padding was slightly wider.
4.0,"It is smaller than you think,  especially if you are a little large in the bust. The length is just fine."
4.0,Nice style and fit to this dress though the material is a little heavy
4.0,Silky soft and comfortable  washing machine friendly
4.0,It is useful as expected.
4.0,"I love this boot. It looks good, gets compliments, and is easy to put on. However it's a very flat sole compared to my other shoes."
4.0,The best thing about these earrings is that they are much lighter weight than expected.  They do feel kind of cheaply made because of this but when you are wearing them who can tell.  They definitely dress up any outfit.
4.0,This necklace is smaller than I thought but it OK.
4.0,I gave it 4 starts only because cinching up the chain is a bit difficult.  The color is definitely rose gold - but it's a different shade to the apple watch rose gold.
4.0,"Great product. Very pretty design and worn to a wedding. I'm 5' 8&#34;,130lbs (34B, 29 inch waist) It's fitted around the ribcage and then flares out. The hem is a few inches above the knee.  I ordered a medium due to the previous reviews. (I was able to tie the ribbon tight to create the fitted look around the chest area.) Should have ordered a small..."
4.0,I love them and they are great for workouts just wish they had pockets. They are comfortable and not at all see through.
4.0,Very pleased with my rabbit ears. They fit myself as well as my 16 month old grandson. Perfect for Easter
4.0,I'd love it more if the handles were just an inch longer and it was more comfortable to slip over the shoulder. I've had such a hard time finding a small/medium sized bag that could fit over the shoulder. Otherwise - lots of great pockets and not too heavy. I love that its a big enough purse to slip a book in but not so big that it looks like your grandma's bag that could fit a small dog.
4.0,"It's a little snug, but I expected that. You could wear it in the winter time as a winter hat. The eye holes are a little bigger than expected, but am ok with that as well. Overall, I'm satisfied with it."
4.0,"This is very cute. Arrived quickly and in good working order. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the WHITE battery pack is very visible on the back of one ear. (About the size of a 50 cent piece) I plan to get a piece of black lace or something similar to cover it because it does sort of spoil the effect. Otherwise, happy with purchase."
4.0,love how it fit and feels!
4.0,"Material was a good quality. The only dislike is that the length was just a bit below waist. I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô-11‚Äù and weigh 195 lbs and ordered a Large ,when washed they shrunk a touch so length shorten up a bit. Would recommend a XLarge."
4.0,"I got a xL n it fits as a medium, darn near small. If i had the option to get a medium, it would have been a belly shirt.<br />Nice fabric, good stitching. Didn't expect the flare on the arms to be longer than the sleeves."
4.0,Lens was not as dark as I expected but glasses were a good fit
4.0,"I like the fit of this dress, i got many compliments when i wore it for the first time."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely adorable! I'm a huge fan of paisley as well as purples and greens so the pattern and colors are fantastic. The arms, from shoulder to elbow, fit well but the rest of the dress is huge. I order a 1X as I didn't see an XL option. I now see that size so I'm going to return the 1X and hope the XL isn't tight on the arms."
4.0,cute and solid
4.0,"I have VERY small hands and wrists (my ring size is a 4).  That said, this fits me, but just barely.  It has limited stretch. I'd recommend this for a child or a woman with VERY small hands and wrist!  It is quite pretty and worth the price IF you are small"
4.0,These boots are very nice. They are darker than I expected which is great for me because I wanted them to be more black than grey. They're a bit snug around the foot area is all I noticed. I loosened them a bit and they still made my feet feel constricted and I have very normal sized feet.
4.0,"Very good hat.  Plenty roomy, but stays put on my average female head.  The color is beautiful and blends with any blue-toned red, from hot cherry, to cranberry, to burgundy.  It looks great with black, too.  Good quality."
4.0,Cute jumper. Fits amazing. The only thing is the color is lighter more pink than fuschia
4.0,The order arrived quickly.  The glasses came with a small bag for keeping them scratch free.  The style is nice too
4.0,It served well for my project!
4.0,Quality was good but ran very small.
4.0,Sizing is such of that when ordering from China. 4x equal to xl. Great quality otherwise. Order smart
4.0,My kids loved this and it has taken abuse from them and still looks good.
4.0,"I use medium and since the reviews said that runs small I ordered XL, fits like a medium, the cup size was a little big for me, I'm B cup and the swimsuit is more like a C, I'm 5'2&#34; in hight, fits nicely!"
4.0,"Love the design of the mask itself, like the fabric choices, however, they looked a lot brighter in the photos than they actually are.  The colors are more muted.  The ear loops are plenty long enough for adjusting with the tab.  And they feel pretty thick but don‚Äôt block breathing.  I purchased them to wear if and when I can get back to cruising."
4.0,"These socks are extremely comfortable. I live in Florida and they have allowed my feet to maintain rather dry. I am in boots 16 hours a day, and even when I feel my feet starting to get too sweaty, after simply removing my boots for 10 minutes, these socks are completely dry again. I have been wearing ""smartwool"" socks for a year now, and I would have to say that these socks are superior in both durability and comfort. It seemed as if the smartwool socks would wear rather thin too soon. However, these socks seem to be a tad bit thicker and possess stronger materials. Highly recommended."
4.0,There is plenty to cris-cross on both pointe shoes. Strange color that doesn't really blend in. Great elastic.
4.0,Personal use and good value for money
4.0,I like it^^
4.0,Back in black made a really good material doesn't rollover doesn't fray wash it every other day credible good sweater
4.0,They worked as expected and got many compliments that these heels protectors are a genius invention
4.0,If you are a potential purchaser of the product- beware- the color of the product on the screen is far far darker than the actual color you will receive. Genuine Tanzanite's have a lovely deep dark blue- but this one had a light blue hue- more like an aquamarine's color.<br />Excellent fit!<br />Very dainty and elegant!
4.0,"I gave this product 4 stars only because I think the earrings are a little large.  However, they are attractive, light in weight and an extremely good deal for the money given that they reportedly are gold-plated."
4.0,These are my favorite sunglasses! I have gotten SO MANY compliments on them. Only thing is they do slide off of my face. I have noticed I am often pushing them back up. Would buy another pair though.
4.0,It's nice dress...not as long as I expected.
4.0,The bottom edge of the lens was a little sharp for comfort. Over all I'm happy.
4.0,Looks just like the picture. Was bought for my Anarchy Panty cosplay and I am pleased with how these will look with the gold necklace and bracelets she wears in the show!
4.0,"I have a lot of misc bad foot issues, pain and also neuropathy and needed to no longer go barefoot at home. These are quite good and the comfort is very decent. They are washable, both the shoe itself and the inserts. Fairly good foot, arch and heel support for a very good price. I‚Äôd recommend these and I have 4 pairs. I only wear them around the inside or outside of my home due to my painful feet and wear more supportive lace up shoes for walking or longer wearing needs.  Comes with two types of removable inserts, but one type is too firm for me."
4.0,"Purchase these for my grandson and they are almost too small for him, age 3yrs. They seen a little fragile, so far, so good. He loves the car shaped storage case."
4.0,It became wrinkled quick but I still liked the poncho feel of it. The slits are very high on the thigh which made it very comfortable as well.
4.0,Only drawback is toddler slips a lot on hardwood floor.
4.0,5‚Äô11‚Äù and a Large is comfortable with plenty of room.  Medium would fit but not much room for under shirts.
4.0,Very easy to put on and has stayed secure when working out and around town. My only issue has been swimming. The water seems to have a way of overpowering the magnets and it will come off. I don‚Äôt really mind since I don‚Äôt often wear my watch while swimming. If that‚Äôs not a problem for you then this is a great purchase.
4.0,"Lighter (more orange in person) not as cognac brown as in the pictures.  But I love the way it designed and will hold a good bit of things, phone keys, makeup, cards, pens, and I even keep a small umbrella in the zipper pouch."
4.0,Nice 4th of July shirt.
4.0,"I‚Äôll start by saying that I love these. They‚Äôre easy to get on, and the girls say they‚Äôre warm and comfy. I love the fact that they have the flip out traction control piece. One of my girls has cerebral palsy and slips all the time because she doesn‚Äôt have great balance. Especially on slippery ground. This I think will help tremendously. My one and only complaint is that I ordered a ‚Äúused‚Äù pair that said it was only going to have damaged packaging. Not that it had clearly been worn several times. The bottoms still had mud in it and when I flipped out the bottom piece mud came flying out. Plus it‚Äôs kind of rusty. I‚Äôm hoping that it taken care of properly the bottoms of the brand new one won‚Äôt rust."
4.0,"size charting needs improvement , quality as expected. always buy one size bigger."
4.0,"Item wore well, ran bit long, drawstring on hood frazzled too easily, very static cling!"
4.0,So they are nice and warm thick texture but the part where the ankles are is loose so I couldn't wear with heels but boots definitely yes
4.0,Tightening the Shoelaces helps with the slightly large slipper but the laces may become undone at times since they're leather. Slippers helped my plantar fasciitis after two weeks of wearing in the house. Would not look appropriate for wearing in public.
4.0,"The fanned, half-moon shape of these earrings is quite eye-catching! All the little crystals sparkle in the light, and the stones seem securely and symmetrically set. They are super lightweight and comfortable to wear, and I think they offer a nice bit of subdued, Art Deco bling for the money. The post backs slip on and fit securely, but due to that feature, the actual straight pin/posts themselves have a tendency to bend a little when the earrings are being gripped for removal. That‚Äôs the only reason I deducted a star. I suspect that over time (over several consecutive wears), one of the metal posts might weaken just enough to snap off entirely. But all in all, I was impressed with the visual design and product presentation."
4.0,"Bought as gift for niece. She loved the print on the item. Fabric material not the best, but good for the price."
4.0,Bought these to go with matching ring.  Love the color and feel of the earrings. Would  buy again as they are so cute.
4.0,The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because it‚Äôs a little too big for my small wrist. I ordered a small but it‚Äôs still a little loose. I just twisted the scrunchie to make it tighter but it‚Äôs super cute and comfortable!
4.0,"This dress is perfect for the wedding I'm attending because of, not in spite of, the skulls on the lace overlay. It fits great everywhere except in the chest area. I have an, ahem, ample bosom, and because there is absolutely no stretch in this dress, it squishes my chest. Whatever. I'm going to wear it with my hamburger bun boobs anyway; its SO GREAT otherwise! Basically, you should follow the size chart the seller provides (not the generic Amazon one) and go a size up if you have any doubt. What a fun dress!"
4.0,it arrived ahead of schedule and is a pretty ring - i'm thinking about matching earrings next but it matches other jewelry i own
4.0,Cute but I wish the band itself was a little thicker.
4.0,"Good quality, inexpensive, fits well"
4.0,"I'm 5 '2 170lbs and lots of curves top & bottom. The material is good quality, I was shocked. Very well made !!! Adjustable straps made my top area look great. The skirt perfect. BUT I have a short torso - the center bunched up a little but my tailor can adjust it for a few dollars so I'm keeping it. HINT: The hubby loves the little cherry print and followed me around.<br />I arrived in 2 days as promised."
4.0,Nice details.
4.0,Haven't wore them but I like the color.
4.0,I ordered grey but it is most definitely not grey. It‚Äôs brown. I like this dress though so I‚Äôll keep it and I‚Äôll probably order other colors! I‚Äôm normally a small so I ordered a small but it is just a tad big.
4.0,"After wearing then 3 times the outer cushion started coming off. Also the fog up terribly. My son was practically blind going down runs while wearing these and opted to have the snow and wind in his eyes...that says something. You're paying for what you get.<br />Update- shortly after writing this review I was contacted by the seller, (who is not the manufacturer) she offered to fully refund my money and send me a new pair free of charge! That's quality customer service! Because of that I am changing my rating from 2 to 4 stars. Possibly I had a faulty product. The seller stated she reached out to the manufacturer and asked them to upgrade the quality of their products."
4.0,"I love this shoe, but unfortunately it is very tight and uncomfortable across the toes."
4.0,Really like the color and strap design
4.0,"well built, good quality fabric, it's not rigid and adapt to head curvature. 3 velcro patches (back, top, front)."
4.0,Love the detail of band. Just wish the stone was bigger.
4.0,The only complaint I have is that the metallic soles are not soft and a bit irritating. Keep feet fairly warm despite low  weight nylon .
4.0,It will work well for what I want it for
4.0,Beautiful earrings. Great quality but heavier and larger than I expected. I ordered them for my 8 year old and they were more adult sized I feel.
4.0,beautiful dress & fqbric.  The bust isn't large enough for me but buy I will weaar a tight bral there isn't enough time to send it back
4.0,sizing runs small to regular size worn...
4.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend he absolutely loved it, the band was a little big for him but we went and got it sized for about $8 in the mall, the time was set for eastern time but it was easy to readjust it and the date was set a day ahead. The watch came in right on time. Beautiful watch though!"
4.0,I like the Velcro tab on it as opposed to others I‚Äôve had that had a Velcro strip that came apart quickly.
4.0,beautiful and comfortable but some of them turned my fingers green üåö overall a great purchase!
4.0,"Took quite a long time to appear, but I do like the quality and fit."
4.0,Much better than the stock band. Softer material and breathable. Takes getting used to fasten it but I'm getting the hang of it.
4.0,"The boots seemed a little bigger, but he will have some extra room to grow and wear toe pair of socks.  I asked him about the size and fit and he said they were perfect.  Great boot for school and outings."
4.0,"Very cute..received in a timely manner...Fit as it should.  I ordered a size XL and it fit like a size L/XL rather than an oversized XL. If you wear<br /> a size closer to a 1X, it may be a snugger fit. Awesome poncho though!"
4.0,This is sexy & my man loved when I wore it out on his harley. I paired this top with a sexy pair of faux leather skin tight pants and riding boots. This certainly turned a few heads. If you have large breasts expect some serous cleavage!
4.0,"Snug on my 8-year old, but fits my 4-year old well. The"
4.0,"Love it - holds my great-grandfather's train watch very nicely.  As noted with other reviews, the plastic stand is not glued or fixed to the base, so it can slide around.  Simple way to fix that (if it bothers you) is to glue some non-sliding material to the bottom - such as you can get for lining drawers and such."
4.0,quality is good. form fitting
4.0,The dress is snug around arms and cut short at shoulders. Best worn with a strapless bra and use accessories tap to secure to achieve the look shown. I can see myself purchasing again in a different color for a different wow factor.
4.0,"I got this shirt for my son.  He has several friends that work on rigs.  He loves it!  Nice quality shirt.  Very comfortable, soft and hangs well.  It does run a tad on the small size.  He‚Äôs an XXL and tall.  It does fit him just a little snug.  I would recommend that you go up a size when purchasing.<br /><br />I‚Äôve washed and dried it and it came out very nice.  No shrinkage, it did not wrinkle and none of the graphic‚Äôs came off.  The shirt is 90% cotton and 10% polyester.  It‚Äôs a nice medium weight, not too thick and not too thin.  All the stitching and seams are nice and straight.  I would recommend this shirt for purchase.<br /><br />I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  I take honesty seriously and give fair and impartial reviews.  I did not receive any other compensation for this review."
4.0,Very pretty colors and the fit is pretty good.  The quality is as nice or even better than the ones you find in the store for twice the price.
4.0,Smaller than the other two I have ordered but still really cute!!  So cute that I ordered two more so I can give one to my sister and have a spare!!
4.0,I bought this as a part of a costume for my toddler.  It was perfect but does run a little larger Than normal. The fabric is a little coarse.
4.0,Tag says nothing about satin. But I love them anyway.
4.0,This is so pretty!! I got it as a casual dress but wear it to church all the time!! I'm only 5'1&#34; and it isn't too long. Brushes the floor with out shoes. Just fine with pumps!! The collar can be tightened to be modest or a little more sexy.
4.0,This Gi is absolutely my favorite out of the several I have owned. Atama puts out a quality product.
4.0,Product great. Great lil plastic case. HUGE PLUS WAS THE LIL AMERICAN FLAG CLEANING CLOTH!! LOVED THAT!<br />Didn't care for how it was shipped tho. Wasn't protected like I would have done considering they are GLASSES AND BREAKABLE. JUST SAYING ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4.0,Fits and hugs the contour of your body if you're a medium go up a size for layering but other than that great buy...
4.0,Definitely cuts nighttime glare.  It took a few minutes to get used to the yellow.  I was a little nervous that I wouldn't be able to see pedestrians or pets on the road.
4.0,Like these socks.  Wear them anytime of year.  Just whenever they are clean.
4.0,"I ordered it a while ago, when it got here. It was too big. The sweater is still very comfortable!"
4.0,"Like wallet. But, credit card slots are too tight for me to use e it !kmy physical disability!"
4.0,"These fit good in the waist to the knee, but knee and below is a bit odd. The legs are baggy, but short."
4.0,"Chosen by my grandson as a birthday gift,  looks fine to me I'm sure he will love it."
4.0,Love but warning don't wash it! Unless you wash by hand and lay flat to dry.
4.0,"I like it! I read that it would be long and it was, but very cute and will go nicely with tights or skinny jeans. Material is stretchy and comfortable though a bit staticky. I just spray some static guard on it and it‚Äôs great!"
4.0,liked how they looked
4.0,Cute bracelet! Goes with many things. Comfortable with a somewhat snug fit for the ability to complete computer tasks without the hassle of removing it and remembering to put it back on.  Have not worn it enough to suggest the durability however it is lower priced item.
4.0,"Saw an ad for something like this and decided why not try it. So glad that I did. I  use it at work, having it at a length to be out of the way but accessible working in a school. When we're on the motorcycle, I just wear it the length I want to keep it out of the way but I can whip it out to snap pictures. Shopping it's over the shoulder, so I can check my Shopping list on the phone, and access whatever is needed. Someone really had a great idea in a very little package that is so simple. I'm actually jealous of that person."
4.0,Good fair prices modest suit for tweens.
4.0,Very soft material & well made. Better for a shorter torso. Will buy again but will size up to be safe!
4.0,"I ordered them in my normal shirt size (large) and I was expecting actual compression to help control the girls. I did not get that. I got a set of very flattering camisoles instead.<br /><br />I'm not going to return them because they DO fit, DO flatter, and DO moisture wick, which is imperative in Florida resident wardrobes.<br /><br />These tank tops are flimsy and thin like 1 ply toilet paper compared to rash guard type shirts or swimwear. I'm going to try my luck with finding a different product to meet my needs."
4.0,Great pair of glasses. Very light weight and not bulky at all. Also gives protection from the sun
4.0,"These are BEAUTIFUL biking gloves! I did order the wrong size though. I ordered medium as I am typically a medium-sized glove, but in these I definitely need a small and I hope they will be small enough to fit as they were made to. I am hoping to order again soon."
4.0,Seems really well made.  Should last a lifetime.  Buckles are a little hard to use but very secure.
4.0,"Bought for my son as a Halloween costume.  I purchased a size larger because reviews said ran on the small side.  He is small for his age so it fit big on him, but intended as it was for a costume and then he can grow into it.  He loves it and that is all that mattered."
4.0,Fabric was nice but it was a little tight across the chest.
4.0,"sent back, not for small wrists"
4.0,The arms fit a bit tight but fit just right everywhere else. NOT very breathable.
4.0,Had the boots for about 8 months before they started breaking down. Not a everyday boot just worn occasionally. Looked nice and enjoyed them while they lasted. I‚Äôll spend a little more$ for something that will last though.
4.0,"I love the cut of this leotard, especially the neckline. I've worn it for almost six months, and it's survived weekly wear and laundering. The one complaint I have is that it runs a bit smaller than I expected, which causes a lot of problems for me in the bust. I wear a size 16 in street clothes and ordered an X-large. I'd definitely buy again in a larger size."
4.0,"Haven't worn or washed yet, so I don't know how much they will shrink...BUT I'm quite sure they will. They are thick enough for winter, soft, but they are shedding what looks like rabbit hair NOT wool as stated on the label. Great colors and patterns."
4.0,I used these to put snacks in for my sons construction birthday party. They are super thin tho and that‚Äôs the only thing I didn‚Äôt like. Other then that they were good!
4.0,"Super cute fit and good feel, still not sure about the light blue pattern but just out of my comfort zone"
4.0,Light warm and visible. As advertised.
4.0,Extremely good quality for the price! Would recommend!
4.0,"I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the one I received had a very small hole in it. Other than that I love it. It‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs stretchy, and it does the job. My daughter wears 4T shirts and the 4 fit her nicely."
4.0,"the socks vary depending on color, some have toe seams that bother me, others don't. the price is good for 12 pairs. I use the ones with bad toe seams to walk barefoot around the house, not with shoes"
4.0,"As an alternative to air pods or other devices, this is great as they headphones are within the hat.  The hooked up easily to my phone and others next to me could not hear them so it provided a focused sound<br /><br />Main negative is that I found the hat is much smaller than many adult hats and really needs to be stretched to fit well."
4.0,"Good pants! Feel good, fit good, look good. Grab a pair!"
4.0,I weigh 225. Currently pregnant in this picture. 36ddd top heavy. It is super soft and comfortable. I am 5&#34;4 and it just touches the top of my feet. It doesn't drag on the ground but it's just long enough. It really is a nice buy for the price. Its more off white than ivory or cream like it looks in the picture. Other than the slight color difference its nice. I give it a 4 star rating only because i was hoping it'd be slightly more flowy on the bottom half but i do have wide hips and a big butt so it could just be me. Id buy it again
4.0,The earrings were great for the price.  I recommend the earrings for anyone who wants a good looking earring at a great price.
4.0,Better a bit too large than too small. I like this top.
4.0,"These leggings are very cute, comfortable and soft. I get tons of compliments when I wear them because they‚Äôre so festive. The only thing that would make them better is if they had pockets."
4.0,Mixed feelings about this set. The fabric is soft and really comfy. The shorts are booty shorts...very short but overall flattering. The shirt is cute but not all that flattering on me. It‚Äôs more boxy than the shorts. I do like the little strip of fabric at the back.
4.0,A little bit smaller than expected but looks good.
4.0,"It's ok. It's a cute, easy to wear dress. The fabric is nice and soft and so far stands up to washing well. Less dressy than it looks on the photos."
4.0,Love the fan.  The front size looks exactly like the photo.  The back side shows the wood slats.  I wish both sides were full lace.  But other than that it is great quality.
4.0,"My husband is a mechanic and can't wear a regular wedding ring.  These Qinaoco Silicone Wedding Ring for Men are perfect.  Good quality, comfortable and sized perfectly.  Will work great for him during the day.  I would definitely recommend them!"
4.0,Good design. Like it.
4.0,Neat accessory for our ugly holiday sweater contest.
4.0,does not fit large adult head size
4.0,"This ring is very nice for the price, but the Rhodium does not show as well in person as it does in the picture.  It still is an attractive ring, but will not fool anybody that it costs more than it actually does."
4.0,"Decent for what your getting, logo was a bit faded but over all great quality for the price"
4.0,I like these and they have been a pretty good help in putting on makeup.  I do not think the strength of the lens is true.
4.0,Great for keeping the mask üëÆ off you.
4.0,Runs small.  I am 5 ft 4in 140 lbs and bought a medium. I could have gotten a large for a better fit
4.0,Soft well stitched button pop off easily beautiful a lot of buttons to fix but worth it
4.0,My replacement lenses was a good buy.
4.0,Great quality pins. Only problem are the pieces that hold the pins down. One of them broke and a few don't hold the pins at all.
4.0,"These are kind of tight on my lip and I feel it more than I would like however it is clear. Not too shiny but if your lip doesn't cover it then you'll definitely see it, more so up close than far away. It doesn't the job but I can't keep them in for longer than my shift."
4.0,"I loved this dress, but I bought 1 size up and it was still a little snug. Beautiful dress though but I wasn't able to use it for the event I needed it for and ended up returning it."
4.0,Quite nice for better than I expected soft comfy material and nice style and flow I'm happy with this purchase
4.0,"Great in every way, except the yellow ladder pics are undefined and the other kids teased saying it looks like pee. Other than that initial joke, the pajamas fit great and are nice and soft. Wash well, too."
4.0,"It fit well for the most part. The biggest problem I had was the legs. The lace isn't stretchy at all and my thighs are too big for it to fit well. If you have average sized thighs for your body, you should be fine. I have very large thighs and there lace was just too tight. It's really cute, I just wish I could wear it."
4.0,Always staticy
4.0,Son loves it. He is 6.
4.0,"Hoodie was great! The print was clear across the board! If getting for a kid, go a size down, run a bit big. Not a thick hood, thinner with an athletic feel"
4.0,Beautiful dress little tight in arms.
4.0,"Slippers looked fine, and well made, but too small, so I had to return.  Unfortunately a larger size is not available,"
4.0,This piece is so pretty. It dresses up any t shirt or blouse. Get alot of compliments.
4.0,"Bought this dress for a business trip in FL to use for the informal beach reception part of the event. Dressed it up with high heel sandals and accessories.  It was a hit, I received so many compliments.  The fabric is heavier than expected but still has a nice flare.  I am 36DDD and bought the Medium, it fit a bit tight in the chest but also felt and looked very attractive.  I recommend the use of a t-shirt bra. The yellow is bright and lively, perfect for spring and summer.  Can't beat this dress for the price."
4.0,Fit my wife perfectly !!!!!
4.0,Good appearance and works well. Great value
4.0,"Well made, great color"
4.0,"I use this as an overnight bag for short trips. The zippers are not the best quality and come unzipped just by pulling the track apart.  When this happens, I just unzip it and zip back to close.  It's cute & works ok for my light travel needs."
4.0,I typically use pampers which were sold out due to COVID19 panic buying. Parents Choice is some of the better generic that I have tried and would buy these pullups again. My son also loves the Paw Patrol designs.
4.0,"Cute shirt, perfect for leggings.  Runs a little big."
4.0,Nice shirt but runs about 2 sizes smaller than the tag.  There is a warning on the product that says it runs small so it is known. I adjusted for that and it was still too small..
4.0,Fits ok. Just kind of a low rise waist. Gotta be careful or you will show everybody your butt crack.
4.0,One shoe smaller then other. But I‚Äôm just using for shower.
4.0,"Looked great, was a gift."
4.0,Purchased for replacement on M Frame Oakley's - works well and is good value.
4.0,I love this piece it was so beautiful on! I need to order another one. It laid prefect and easy to put on
4.0,"Very pretty earrings. Lightening deal price was fair, not sure I would pay $400 for these. Arrived on time in a beautiful box. They are perfect for everyday wear - classy."
4.0,Just bought this from costco 2 packs for under 20.00. The only real issue I have is that if you are not careful the pole will come lose and so you have to really twist it to get a good tight fit. But other then that real easy to use. Also this is battery only.
4.0,Cute suit. The bottoms are more of a bright coral but that is ok it is still cute. I read to size up on this suit but that is not true. I would order it true to size.
4.0,Fits well. Good quality for the price.
4.0,"This bright little number is made for sleeping, but it is perfectly capable as a housedress or an even to walk around your yard. It covers everything. The material is thick enough to not be see through. It is made like a t shirt, only much longer - midi length. It is comfortable and you will not be missed if you are in your yard. It is very bright and happy."
4.0,A little tight around the arms but looks great - a little thick so gets hot
4.0,I'm always cold so this scarf really helps me to stay warm! But there were no instructions with the product.
4.0,I love this band of sunglasses they are well made and very comfortable my only problem is I got a sojos gift card in one of my boxes with my glasses and I got so excited but it was expired.
4.0,"like the dress, but either i didnt read the full description or something, because its the wrinkly material, which i dont prefer, but its still super cute, and i will still wear it"
4.0,"Not much to say that hasn't already been said.  It does the basics, plus a stopwatch that you'll never use.  It's very thin and light.  The back light is sad but works in a pinch.  The thin resin band will become brittle, split, and  eventually break.  The watch costs less than most bands.  I've gone swimming with these and they usually can handle it.  One fogged-up on me once, IIRC.  The A158 is the metalized-plastic version of this with a stainless steel wrist band.<br /><br />Been through a few of these.  Realized I never replaced the last one that I lost when the band broke at some point.  For anyone that owns more than a few watches, it's hard not to have one or two of these floating around."
4.0,"Love the product. Because they are handmade and made out of organic material i think its hard to manipulate the material. But the line up for the post isn't straight, but I make it work iblove them"
4.0,"too small for what I thought it was, but I love it....."
4.0,"Good quality, soft and comfortable but sizes run a bit small."
4.0,Loved this product as did my great granddaughter.  Ordered a size 4.  This is the size she is currently wearing.  It was too small and I had to return it and order a size five.
4.0,Love these boots. Inner lining comes out and you can wash. Only bummer is the rubber boot st the top cut a whole in the soft lining (I patched it).
4.0,Power /home button rattles. Apple Watch kind of looks like knock off in case
4.0,"Fits great! I wear a size 12-14 in pants, so the XL was a perfect size!"
4.0,"Of the 3 --- original CT, Chuck II, 70s CT --- the 70s are the comfiest!!!!<br />Would have given 5 stars if not for the laces which were not the same length (one was shorter than the other)."
4.0,feels good not perfect their worth money paid
4.0,"Beautiful however not thrilled with tarnished, dulled appearance that seems to be purposeful.  It was okay.....if I had received it as a gift, it would have easily been regifted.  Service good."
4.0,and im a little subconscious about my body. i love how these fit but with my belly.. its a little awkward and uncomfortable. since i got these for work and im moving a lot and they dont bother me that much but if i sit down my thickness seaps through. if you understand what i mean
4.0,These are super soft and comfy ... I ordered a size up because of reviews ... I glad I did they fit perfect
4.0,"Perfect fit, very confortable pants. I can move fine in this pants they are very flexible and they are not super tight on my waist. They are ankle length. I don like the color lines down the side of the legs but thats just me been picky. They are good yoga pants."
4.0,It‚Äôs great!  I love it.  Fits as expected.
4.0,"great for any sport,  the low price is a bonus I don't feel bad if they break while hiking or doing outdoor sports."
4.0,I purchased this as a gift.  Very nice looking watch.
4.0,Pretty butterfly has a good amount of sparkle
4.0,Runs a little small and length shrunk dramatically after I washed it but the fabric is good quality otherwise.  Should order larger size
4.0,The only complaint I have is the print is off center. (the only reason for 4 stars)  Other than that its a great shirt with a nice retro feel.
4.0,First try on so pretty tight would say runs a tish small but happy with them other than that.
4.0,This is a sexy dress!
4.0,Works pretty well when putting on eye makeup.
4.0,"cool glasses, they looked really great for less than a day, then one of the sides just fell off. I have superglued it back on and it seems to be working fine, but the are still super cheap glasses that are only good for a day.<br />EDIT: the next day I got an email from them with a code to replace the glasses, so great customer service and hopefully this next pair will last longer!!"
4.0,My sister/friend loves this
4.0,Very nice petite dress.
4.0,"These are soft and really comfortable. My only complaint was that a couple of them have started falling apart just after one wash, one has a large hole/tear between the fabric and lace and one has loose threads  coming off. Be sure to wash these on delicate or do not dry so they last."
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but the insole came out after first use. Fit as expected and my daughter loves the pattern
4.0,"the case does not have openings on the sides for buttons.  however, if you push down firmly in the area of the buttons, it will work"
4.0,Super comfy and cozy. The only thing I don't like is the colors fading. Seems the printing was not right to begin with.
4.0,"This is a cute top. It fit a little more funky on me than on some of the people who posted pictures. I have bigger boobs and a smaller waist, so it was a little too flowy. I wish it was more form fitting. I bought the small. I wouldn't recommend wearing it during hot yoga. No moisture wicking at all. Still though, cute top/back -Kristin"
4.0,The black top was very thin and see through. I have to wear a tank or a sports bra so you can't see it.
4.0,"You get plenty for the price , but come on . My earring broke in half while it was in my ear ! The hoops are left open when worn!"
4.0,"This hat isn't textured, it's soft and for me I like that it's not a heavy material. It's great on a day you need to just cut the chill, not go out in a blizzard.<br />It's slouchy, fits great and very cute.<br /><br />One negative, it can snag if you throw it in your purse and catches on something. Lesson learned so now I just tuck it into a pocket inside my purse where there's nothing for it to snag on and it's good to go."
4.0,"Much better that the original band, one opening, holds unit securely and (!!!) has an excellent watch band clasp.  Not the whimpy &#34;hook&#34; one that the original came with."
4.0,Really like these sunglasses.  Would love them if they were just a little bigger to fit my eyeglasses better.
4.0,"This dress was so great! It was super cute and flattering, got compliments all night! It did take some adjusting - I ordered a small thinking it would be snug around the chest/waist, but it was still a little loose fitting unfortunately. Other than that this was a perfect dress!"
4.0,Very nice for the price. Was unsure which size to get. In a tailored shirt I take a size 8 so I purchased the medium to be on the safe side but I think the small might have been the way to go.
4.0,"It‚Äôs cute but NOT as long as it appears on the photoshopped model. It‚Äôs right at my waist. It‚Äôs cute still with a long tunic and long necklaces or something, so I‚Äôll keep it. But I wish it was longer or came as it appears."
4.0,I got this necklace for a fairy costume I am making for Halloween. It arrived much sooner than expected and is very very pretty. You can see a bit of the glue sticking out on the gems on the bottom but it was easy to get off with a knife. Better quality than I was expecting too.
4.0,I like it because there's not too much padding like a push up bra has (hate push up bra's) :) It's a good buy!
4.0,"Got this cardigan today. It's a beautiful deep blue color. The sleeves are Very form fitting. Not tight per say because I can move and flex my arms plenty, just... Snug.<br /><br />Other reviews said it Bunches weird around the waist and I agree. If the lower buttons are closed,  it causes weird folds around the small of the waist. I'm debating if I can stand that without it bothering me later.<br /><br />I personally cannot button the top half around the bust (36C). There's some gapping when I do but it looks cute open anyway.<br /><br />Considering getting a Large instead of medium..."
4.0,My best watch as far as style. I get compliments every time i wear it . i love that it‚Äôs not too loud and it has a big face.its not flimsy or bulky . lightweight but solid  . the only thing i found wrong is that it doesn‚Äôt hold the time . the hands shift sometimes throughout the day . so it‚Äôs mostly for style .
4.0,"These are so adorable! They did shrink quite a bit when I washed them for the first time, so I would buy a size up to take the shrinkage into consideration."
4.0,"A little on the small side, but adorable and exactly as pictured."
4.0,"I purchased four of these for my family for our trip to Disney World this August. They were very useful for the early afternoon rain showers that occurred daily during our stay. The only complaints we had were that the cuffs were a little tight (I pulled my hands all the way in and my daughter stretched hers out), because the design is so straight, it's hard to walk and not get wet on your bottom legs (if there was a little more of a bell shape, it probably would have solved this) and they were super muggy and sticky inside. Though the last one isn't the manufacturers fault, it's Florida's.<br />I would definitely recommend these especially from an environmental standpoint. They're durable and reusable. I saw a lot of one-time-use ponchos in the park and all I could think of is that they will need another one tomorrow and their current one is going to end up in the landfill. We'll be using these for a while."
4.0,"Love the dress on the model.  If you look at the photo it‚Äôs not a high & low, the one I got is.  Photos are deceiving.  I like 1 length.  And the seam in the front makes no sense.  Will be returning"
4.0,"This is a cute, comfortable shirt, if a little short. It fits well around and in the length of the sleeves."
4.0,Absolutely love the colors and design of this suit! I ordered the pink bottoms size L (size 10 pant) with black geometric design top L ( 34C) and they both fit well!
4.0,"I bought this shirt in a dark burgundy and loved it, so I also purchased the blue ombre. It doesn't really look like the picture. The shirt is pretty much all one color. I still really love the fit. Keeping it. Perfect to wear with leggings casually."
4.0,Thin cheap materials. But what can you expect for the price. Looks hot. Will buy again when this falls apart.
4.0,Bought for granddaughter who loves horses. Smaller than expected but cute.
4.0,There OK med is a little bit large  but other wise OK. Arrived on time they came in a  large box with one other item.
4.0,Love the purse but no scarf came with it as pictured.
4.0,The suit runs true to size. It‚Äôs sexy and modest all in one. Very slimming. I took 1 star off because there is no support for your boobs‚Äîat all.
4.0,Hubby likes they and they stretched just enough to be comfortable.
4.0,Warm and cozy good material. A bit small but not too small.
4.0,"I love the look, but wish it was just a bit wider. It holds my cellphone, but not much else."
4.0,"That hat itself is awesome, but the fit is a bit big.  I measure my head at 22 inches, so based on that measurement I bought the small size, but its still too big.  Maybe they meant 22 inches with full thick hair and then maybe it would sort of fit.  However, like many other hats before this one, I stuffed the inner band with some black thin foam (weatherstripping) and now it fits perfectly.  Looks really cool too."
4.0,I love the brand Pajama Jeans and have several pair. This is the first time I ordered the lite blue. It have a strong odor. But they fit nice.
4.0,Exactly what I wanted and ordered ! So comfortable also and it looks professional not like yoga pants at all but all the yoga pants benefits.
4.0,Just as pictured - but kind of cheap feeling. You get what you pay for though!
4.0,The necklace itself is awesome. The size however was much smaller than I would have liked it to be. It shines and it isn‚Äôt really heavy on the neck. The chain could‚Äôve been a little longer but overall I like the necklace.
4.0,Comfortable and breathable. Will by again
4.0,This fit on my husband very comfortably. It is a loose tshirt material and perfect for working out. It‚Äôs his favorite work out tees now. Fits as expected
4.0,my son loves these. he says at first they are a little hard to get on but his feet don't slide around and it allows him to run around without worrying about stepping on something sharp while also getting air so his feet are sweaty.
4.0,"It is a nice, soft fabric. Nice for warmer nights, or playtime when just a bit cool."
4.0,"I was sent two pair of the same size by mistake. Turns out I‚Äôm glad they did bc there were small differences between them. The right shoe of one pair was too small, but the other pair fit (both were 7 1/2.) These are really cute for under $30. They look nice but are obviously cheaply made. The outsoles have felt on the forefoot (which makes them slippery and a magnet for pet hair.) I don‚Äôt know who in their right mind would do that! I am keeping them."
4.0,"These bras are great quality and look really cute on me, but they seem slightly small.  I ordered 40D, but I think I should have gone up to 42D.  These are a little snug.  I don‚Äôt feel wore or anything poking me, I just feel like these are a little tight and after a few hours, all I want to do is unfasten them so I can breathe.  Great quality for the price though.  And the straps aren‚Äôt real big.  I hate big straps, so that‚Äôs a plus!"
4.0,"These rings look nice and quality made.<br />I did however, order size 10 and they were uncomfortably small, I returned them and order an 11. Hopefully they will fit.<br />For reference, I have 2 other silicone rings, size 10 that fit perfectly, and my real wedding ring, size 10, that fits perfectly."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 150lbs wear a size 6. I purchased a medium size to be safe. It‚Äôs a bit long, but I love how it looks. Wish I had bought a small. Material is not super thin, overall I like it and I‚Äôm excited to wear it."
4.0,"I love this top, very cute! Somewhat smaller than I expected. I will order up a size next time."
4.0,"fabric feels similar to some knit shirts I have - not super soft, but the stretchy aspect of the trousers make up for that.  Comfortable waistline and happy there are choices in the lengths - didn't have to hem this brand of slacks like I usually do.  Good type of pant for office wear and shaking out wrinkles after the wash without ironing.  Will order other colors."
4.0,These are made well and a super cute mix!  The variety is fun and so is the mix of sizes.
4.0,"I just want to say that step 2 did make any sense, they weren't being too specific in the instructions, however, if you buy advised with precaution it does work. Eventually I had to get used to it, but I would still give it a 4/5 stars."
4.0,Bra is of good quality and is durable and has great hold and support.<br />The only reason I deducted a star is because I cannot get the second catch attached on the back without someone else's help.<br />I do not have flexible arms...<br />So I wear less often.
4.0,"Shipped quickly, product just as described"
4.0,"My aunt said, &#34;it was warm and snuggle and she love the color&#34; !!"
4.0,Not much shape so be sure to wear the belt
4.0,"The presentation lifts the gifting option for this pair of earrings. The earrings are nicely designed and appear to have good quality construction. The titanium steel has a nice sulvery lustre. The weight is lighter than it would seem visually, which is a good thing. The hinge and locking mechanism work well.<br />While the title states that these are Men's stud earrings, I consider them to be unisex, usable by any gender. In fact, I do not have pierced ears. The significant other gleefully accepted them, and said they were cute, would be fun to wear casually, to meet her girlfriends...shop, eat..... She said the 'post' was unusual and took a bit of maneuvering to put it in and out. But, that it was worth it.<br />An interesting design, well crafted. Inspection found no flaws or defects. I imagine over repeated use, the hinge won't be as tight, but that's true of most hinges.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. While they have a 'tough intention' it is an eye catching and attractive piece of casual wear jewelry. As such, it garners a 3.5 - 3.75 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation."
4.0,"this is a pretty attractive, slide style bracelet.  There isn‚Äôt a clasp so no need to worry about this coming off easily.  You hold one side of the bracelet and pull the other to open the bracelet enough to get it onto your hand.  Then you flip your wrist over and either bite down with your teeth on one side and pull with the other to tighten to fit you.  OR you ask for help.  if you are lucky you have long fingers and don‚Äôt need to involves biting your jewelry into your morning routine.  Wing is nice piece, small amount of sparkle that keeps it tasteful and not over done.  Blue/teal area is bold and nice to look at.  The wing itself is a bit thick so doesn‚Äôt lay the same on each persons wrist.  Me, I have a large wrists so no issue, my daughter has tiny wrists and this ends up turning so she has to readjust it various times during the day."
4.0,"elastic in the top kept rolling over with every move of the shoulders. but over all, I got lots of compliments."
4.0,Attractive bag for the price but wish the snaps were magnetic.
4.0,I love the way it fit!
4.0,Super cute tank. Ran a littler smaller than i thought. If you are bigger up top then order a size up
4.0,"I read other reviews where they stated that it is too small.  I learned that there is a top and a bottom.  It is just large enough for me when it is in the correct position.  If you are looking for perfection, this will not get you there.  Yet, it does work and is comfortable."
4.0,Great bracelet but one of the blue pieces on the side came apart right when I opened the package. I don't know if it's because of the shipping and handling but I kept the broken pieces and I'll have them fixed so no big deal. Also the fastening is kind of annoying but you'll get used to it. Overall I love it.
4.0,"I ;love it, but wish the fit was a little smaller."
4.0,I dnot feel these are as good as original lenses. But in all fareness I think my wiley x lenses were polorized. They work as intended.
4.0,"Luckily, unlike the longer pants, these shorts aren‚Äôt sheer. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 140 lbs, and normally wear a large for shorts. I got a bigger bottom. I sized down like other reviewers and am glad I did because these fit. They‚Äôre incredibly comfortable and feel like the soft jersey knit bedsheets if that makes sense.<br /><br />Definitely recommend these!"
4.0,"I L O V E D these earrings. They were exactly what I was looking for... until I lost one!  I really wish they were screw-backs and not just posts.  We're all wearing - and removing - face masks now, and I really wish I had been more careful - or that they were screw-backs! That woukd have earned 5 stars..."
4.0,"It‚Äôs really cute can‚Äôt wait to wear it,, but the clasp was broken, I‚Äôm sure it was not the sellers fault it probably happened in transit"
4.0,The style and quality of the hat is excellent. When my husband tried it on it was snug. I stretched it on a head bust and it seemed to help. Otherwise the hat is warm.
4.0,Quality hat but size down. Like the kids hat fits on my adult head and the toddler hat fits on my baby
4.0,"My daughter normally wears 2T-3T but, I did size up and got 4T. We're hoping they will hold up after being washed a few times. So far, the designs haven't started to peel. I also let them air dry. I did notice the olive colored shirt (pictured) was slightly bigger than the other two."
4.0,"The criss crosses don't lay flat, but I have enough sewing skills to adjust them."
4.0,"I thought this would be a great dress for the mother of the groom.  It looked great on, and fit well.  It was just a little to sexy for son's wedding."
4.0,"I ordered this for my graduation, it was pretty see through so I wore a slip under it and it was also longer than I had expected, I had it trimmed to my knee. When I got it, it was about mid-calf."
4.0,Beautiful colors that the pictures don't do justice. A bit small so harder to get on.
4.0,This dress fit a bit small for its size but was a very pretty dress.
4.0,These socks work great for our son who hates wearing socks. The seam always bothered him and would go with out socks on a daily basis. These do run what I think a little smaller than expected but know for the next order what size i need to buy. One thing I wasnt aware was they ask you not to dry them in the dryer. A tad bit of a pain but ok as long as it gets him to wear socks.
4.0,Really cute and good quality... however the sleeves on the women‚Äôs medium was a little short.
4.0,"Cute but runs big, good quality though"
4.0,"When I opened the bag it had a strong plastic smell.  After it was out for a while it seemed to smell better.  The straps on the watch are longer than other Apple watchbands I have gotten.  That is not a problem unless you have small wrists.  Mine are seven inches and I had band to spare.<br />It is shiny and for some reason makes me think of plastic.  I don't normally like the silicone bands as I think they look plain.  I know they are popular, this watchband I expected would be a little of both.  It is not.<br />As far as the way it is made it is done well.<br />The holes for the lace are sharp punched through the band.  I thought it would look more like lace and a little more delicate.<br />It doesn't look as nice as many other Apple watchbands in the same price range to me.<br />This is my opinion, I am sure others will like it.<br />I hope my review helped you."
4.0,"Pretty, soft fabric, long enough to work with leggings ... but the cut added 10 lbs to my appearance along with making the girls look droopy.  Will be returning.<br /><br />**Update** The company contacted me and offered a replacement product, which is great customer service in my book.  I got a black v neck sleeveless dress in large and it fits great.  Much more flattering.  Raising the review from 2 to 4 stars for the customer service."
4.0,"It took only a couple of minutes to get the product out of the box and operational. I probably should have not tried opening it inside the house first as it is much larger than I had pictured it. The color is very bold and striking and the fabric is strong and thick enough that it is basically waterproof.<br /><br />I am impressed by how strong the nylon fabric is and the mast is solid enough that it is never going to bend. Maybe if you ran over it with a truck it would bend, but not under normal circumstances. The only real downside of the product is that it is completely unusable in any type of winds more than 5 MPH or so. It's huge size makes for a large amount of wind loading. The opening in the center allows a bit of wind to get through, but not enough to keep it from flying away or destroying itself in high winds. For winds up to 10 MPH you might be able to get away with having the mast anchored to something VERY heavy and solid (a lot heavier than a table, unless it happens to be made of concrete). Anything above that and you risk the whole thing either blowing away or collapsing though."
4.0,"This is my second pair of memory foam slippers. It took a little getting used to my first pair. But after a little time wearing them, I grew to like them. The only thing that I didn't like about them was that there was a back to them. I like being able to slip on slippers without have to bend down to pull them over my heels. So I was really looking forward to these slippers without heels.<br /><br />Another reviewer remarked that they run small and recommended sizing up. My foot is an 8.5, so I figured that the ""9-10 Wide"" would be the right size. As it turns out, my heel comes right to the end of the slippers. Too bad that I don't have a size ""11-12 Wide"" to try."
4.0,I love it. And its leather. Perfect fit
4.0,Fit a little smaller than expected but still fits. Great texture
4.0,Nice and well tailored shirt. Thanks
4.0,Loved the dress and how it fitted but mines came with a little hole in the bottton of it.
4.0,Fits great! Now I just need some rain!
4.0,Looks good but these run LARGE.  Had to cut off a lot of the band.
4.0,"This is an okay top. It is very square, two holes for arms and slits all the way up the sides. There is a bit of detail down the front. It would definitely serve its purpose for a bathing suit cover up. Anything else, and I would have to say no way. It says ONE SIZE, but that really is in the eye of the beholder. It fit me great, but had zero shape.<br />This item brags of:<br />****Material: Polyester.

Color differences allowed for light effects.<br />Although I did received this item at a discounted price, that does NOT reflect on my review at all.<br />My opinion is ONLY mine, and I tell it honestly and with truth."
4.0,"I like the look, feel, and everything except the top.It's tight.<br />I'm a nurse, and I work 12 hour shifts.<br />I have bought a lot of compression socks, but these felt like they were cutting into my leg by the end of my shift,  I had to pull them down until I made it home.<br />My only complaint is the top band. If you have very narrow legs then you may not have a problem."
4.0,Bought to give away. Lots of great chokers for very lil money. Kept the stretchy band for myself. Love the look.  So does my Mann
4.0,Good quality for the price. Will buy another.
4.0,Thin quality
4.0,It was a very pretty bracelet. Very believable. However i was looking for something with a larger stone. The bracelet was true to length. Well made and i would recommend it if you were looking for small stones.
4.0,"Great fit, seems like quality material. Im happy with my purchase..."
4.0,I like the color and the size..
4.0,The print is perfect big the material is a little thin and see through
4.0,"Ordered small, was thin sheer fabric and was a little large around ribcage & waist."
4.0,"My hips are 45 inchee wide,so it fit like a shirt on me,I did purchase the largest size. It's still very pretty."
4.0,"Comfortable fit, I received a lot of compliments when wearing this."
4.0,"Love G-Shock and appreciated the fact that it could track steps with a year battery life. It's been good so far, I like the dark face and I adjusted the lum."
4.0,1 size 12 was different from the original 12  i bought 1st time
4.0,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to get my &#34;true size&#34; when I made my order.  The corset came and seems very well made for it's price.  Unfortunately, it was very large and I actually had an inch to spare when I had tightened it all the way.  I am returning it for a smaller size."
4.0,"Looks good, fits pretty well and comfortable."
4.0,"Runs small. I wear a 10 jeans, med top. After reading other reviews about it running small I decided to order a XL instead of a L. Even the XL is tight around the waist! I'll make it work for the price. Good quality tho!"
4.0,Loved this dress. Super comfy
4.0,I usually buy 10/12 size and they fit fine. This one was a bit big and loose. Not bad quality though
4.0,"This is a cute, provided one thinks skulls are cute, casual woven bracelet with a small, jeweled skull.  This bracelet is adjustable by tugging and pulling the dangling loops with the gold beads to adjust for wrist size.  It's tricky, at least for me, to get the bracelet adjusted to fit so that the beaded loops are basically equal in length.  The skull is tiny, and the zirconia jewels catch the light when there's bright lighting but otherwise the effect rather subdued.  I like this for casual wear but not while I'm home.  One of my cats immediately found the dangling loops irresistible so I had to remove the bracelet and hide it for a while.  My rating is 4 stars because of the difficulty in adjusting the loops and I expected the skull to be a bit more sparkly."
4.0,Comfortable and casual. It has pockets!
4.0,This robe was purchased as a gift.
4.0,Per the size suggestion I ordered the medium. I am a 32D they fit comfortably with no digging in my shoulders. I almost forgot I had it on that‚Äôs how comfortable it is. I am not a huge fan of the cups in these it does weird shaping to the girls.
4.0,"This product is great. but don't shower with the bracelets on, it weakens the leather immensely and caused them to break upon taking off the bracelet"
4.0,"I like this sweater a lot! But there isn‚Äôt a tag, so I‚Äôm constantly fumbling with it and the ‚Äúwings‚Äù come down very low. Wish I would have purchased a size down (ordered a small)"
4.0,Perfect but back broke off
4.0,"fine , very comfy"
4.0,I absolutely loves these!
4.0,Colors were vibrant and material was better than I was expecting. The packaging is awful. Had to take it to the cleaners to have professionally steamed.
4.0,Fun glasses for the price
4.0,I love stretchy t shirt dresses in the summer. This one is no exception. I recommend ordering a size down as it does fit a little big.
4.0,"Fits well, a little give around the chest, which is nice. I received it quickly."
4.0,These are cute but a couple of the flowers fell off one of which was off before it was opened and we had to glue it back on
4.0,Very nice elegant. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because it's a bit transparent
4.0,My daughter loves her robe. Just wishes it had a hood.
4.0,Works just like the old ones. Cheap watch to tell time. Let's see if it is as durable as the old ones.
4.0,Only worn twice but seem fine to me...
4.0,"The ring I received was almost exactly the same as pictured. Very similar colors with lovely flecks which catch the light. I ordered a size 9 and received a size closer to 9.5-10. The side stones are a little bit smaller than pictured but the ring is still quite chunky. The band is round rather than flat like most rings. This is slightly uncomfortable between the fingers but still very wearable. Adjusting the size would take quite some effort as the band is very sturdy. I haven't noticed any of the stones being loose as other reviewers stated. Overall, this ring has a nice weight, smooth feel, eye catching appeal and is definitely worth the $35 I paid."
4.0,"This is a perfectly fine daytime casual dress for the price, though I would have preferred a slightly higher quality satin poly (even if that adds another $10 to $15 to the price) as a night out dress. This material would fare better in a print that hides its wrinkles and imperfections. If you don't have a big bust (like me), the ruched waist kind of looks like a cummerbund that doesn't fit. It comes out of the bag slightly wrinkled and may fare better after being properly cleaned. I will comment to this review with an update once that is done."
4.0,A little on the short side but good quality shirt.
4.0,"I like the watch, I've had is a couple of weeks. It's been accurate so far.  The blue color is closer to sky blue, but it looks good against the black face and case. The hour markers glow when exposed to light.  I have received a couple of compliments on it from women. The leather band is comfortable and it's not too big or small on my wrist, 42mm case."
4.0,"Good option instead of Rx sunglasses, but maybe not for long wear times. Felt a little bulky over my glasses which have thick lenses."
4.0,I was disappointed in this dress for it was cut so small through the bust and there was no stretch at all in the fabric.  I did have to return.
4.0,Good fit.  A bit light weight but a great price.
4.0,not quite the colour I was going for but the fit is perfect
4.0,"These ties are a bit shorter than other ties I have bought,  but only by about 2 to 3 inches,  so it's not a big deal.  The color and patterns are very nice.  At first touch,  did not feel like high quality.  However,  after wearing them for a few days,  I  was pleasantly surprised.  The ties held the knot all day and they do not wrinkle easily.  And for the price,  it was a good deal.  I would recommend them if you are looking for decent ties at a very low price."
4.0,I bought i would‚Äôve gotten away with being able to wear a bra with this but it runs on the smaller side which is good so you don‚Äôt need a bra. i needed a bra to wear my breastfeeding pads lol. I still loved it but wasn‚Äôt long enough in the front for me. I purchased a large to get more room and I‚Äôm normally a medium which is why i say it‚Äôs on the smaller side.
4.0,"This badge necklace is beautiful! I love that I can change the color of the gemstones by easily switching out the charms!<br /><br />That said, the necklace started tarnishing along some of the edges within just a couple weeks. It‚Äôs still pretty, and I‚Äôve had it for a couple months now, but the tarnishing was disappointing."
4.0,Fits very nice. Color is exactly as on image. It is very soft material.
4.0,Product came just as described. A quality product.
4.0,Arrived as anticipated.  Quality appears to be good but have only written a few times so far
4.0,"Seemed small, but easily stretched to fit my big noggin.... doesn't look very reflective, but they are!!! Warm material, I favor the black one, but the price is very fair for 3 hats!!!"
4.0,If you have a broad foot of any kind you need to buy a least a 1/2 size to 1 full size larger due to the taper toe.<br />I bought a boot stretcher for the wifes boots and hope it helps. Good boot but runs a bit narrow.
4.0,I read a review that guided my choice of size. I normally order a 9.5 (women) and ordered a size 10. It‚Äôs too large for a great fit.<br />Good gripping sole.
4.0,Beautiful dress the only reason I gave it 4 is because it smelt like a mold warehouse. Which made me a little hesitant to wear it. I had to wash it twice but it didn't get injured in the dryer.
4.0,Its ok. Its cute. It covers the toes and can be used for the beach and elsewhere.<br />But in person its a little bulky and not my daughter's first choice in foot wear.<br />I think if we saw it in the store we would have passed on it ...
4.0,Great product for computer screens easy on the eyes and cuts glare from screen.
4.0,great for a gift.
4.0,"I like it. I feel like it may just be my apple shape, but the lace sticks out from under the blouse at an angle. However the shirt is cute."
4.0,"Beautiful hat, just arrived smashed in its box. Shipper should be more careful."
4.0,Highly recommended to keep your cool and keep you cool. Good quality and absolutely functional for outdoor hot and tropical weather conditions. Really like this product.
4.0,"It was very comfortable but misleading. The dress collar is not like the picture. If you want off the shoulder, you'll have to cut it yourself. It's just a regular t-shirt dress. But it is cute and the colors are very vibrant."
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my niece for Christmas.the chain is good length for her (she's 10), I can't wait to give it to her."
4.0,"It is a good item, only complaint I would say is it's not exactly red, more of an orange/red"
4.0,"Nice quality, but a little heavy."
4.0,It's definitely not heavy duty but it's functional and very cute.
4.0,"Great for winter time keeping my icy hands warmer. The fit is fine, I just wish they looked a little nicer. They are very basic, no frills."
4.0,they work well at night unless it is raining
4.0,a good bargain for silk. sleeves a bit short.
4.0,"This shirt is okay, but the pockets stick out too much on me!"
4.0,"I was hesitant to buy this dress because of the low price , but with the prime option it makes it safe to send back if not satisfied.But I was  pleasantly surprised by the quality - even there is no tags  it  is made of a  nice fabric, very neat seams, comfortable to wear. My only complaint- it seems like it made for very curvy butts ( like those fake butts you  see on a skinny asian models). Im size S ,proportional  5'2 , 34 C , 27 in waist and 38 hips -and it fits way too big in the butt area. But for me it is not a problem, I sewed 2 in off. Otherwise it is a really nice dress, even it is  ""no brand name"", especially for the price."
4.0,"A well constructed hat which looks good. Would give 5 stars if they had a Medium size.  For some reason, they made a S/M and L/XL.  I have both and neither fits me just right.  I purchased the L/XL first, but found it just a little bit too loose so purchased the S/M, which is a bit too tight and gives me a headache after wearing for awhile.  Wish there was a size in between which fit me correctly."
4.0,Love how it looks and very light.  Only thing is that it is thin and not lined so will show some rolls without some good spanx
4.0,The shirt was so narrow and made of low end quality. Skirt was good little long but that's ok bcuz I have a sewing machine. But it was such a great price I'm not going to complain. For that price I think it's an amazing buy. The problems are fixable and cheap to do so.
4.0,"Good pair of sunglasses for the cheap price. However, they have been known to break easily."
4.0,Better for kids younger than 10. Quite small.
4.0,"I bought this for my birthday #Hey ARIES ‚ôà I'm curvy in the Lower area (Just had a baby 10m ago) I must say this fit me perfectly! Order a size up because it runs small. GOD bless Women who post their weight & what size item that was purchased in the review!!! It helped me make the correct decision based on my current body type. Material is thin but perfect for cool Spring tempatures. Soft and pretty decent quality for the price. The material has lots of stretch (Minor stitching defect but nothing major or noticeable to the naked eye) around the wrist area on the jacket. The color looked like the photo. Pants have pockets, jacket does not. I really liked this outfit."
4.0,Fit a little too loose.. I could have ordered a small
4.0,The watch was beautiful. My boyfriend usually wear alot of flashy jewelry but he loved it. Of was a great fit
4.0,"A little difficult to take off, but comfortable"
4.0,comfortable/material nice /good for all seasons
4.0,"ordered 3 lots, only had a few duplicates, but none in each individual lot"
4.0,"I receive the item in Amazon's timely fashion - very reliable. Have ordered this top due to a recent surgery which makes it necessary for me to have the roomy tummy area. The long bottom is a new fit for me - will take some getting used to, but I think it'll work great. Looking forward to putting it to work with some leggings."
4.0,These rope straps with rubber loops do not slide up and down the frames of my sunglasses like my rope straps with loops. The rubber loops are not made for thick framed glasses. I am satisfied with my purchase and will buy more in due time..
4.0,Little small but very much quickly recieved quality pretty exeptional overall good price for the great quality definetly a steal<br />.
4.0,Runs small but nice and light weight. Great for office use when it gets cold.
4.0,"I got this for a casual Halloween/October shirt. I enjoy the feel of this shirt on the skin. Wish they sold extra small, runs a little looser than I expected but this isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me. Maybe with washes it‚Äôll shrink with time. Would recommend."
4.0,Very good gloves for the price. Fit well and has kep my hands pretty warm.<br />I only wish they came in additional colors such as a darker brown to match my leather jacket.
4.0,Fine around ears.  Best worn as a chin strap.  Caution - in that position it fogs up your glasses.  You can wear the strap across your nose.  That way it will not fog your glasses.  But it's a tight fit that way and warm.  Made in China.
4.0,I do love this dress BUT I can't for the life of me get all of the wrinkles out in the skirt. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know!
4.0,Love it but its tearing at the seam in the top. It's been less than two months.
4.0,Lovely!  It was very large which the picture did not convey.  But the stones were nice.
4.0,I received item in a timely manner. The picture shows dangling earrings but the ones I received are post back.
4.0,"My small 3-year old (he does wear 3T but he'll be 4 in March), tried on the Medium 3-5 years size and it fits him just right. Really, there's wiggle room width wise and some length in the arms and legs, but the hood fits only JUST over his head and the I can't zip up the zipper in the front all the way. I'm giving it 4 stars because it does fit and it's so stinkin' cute! The only disappointing thing is that he won't be able to wear it as long as I had hoped."
4.0,Lots of compliments. Love the fit.
4.0,"I know this is supposed to be an adjustable high waist, but the fit just felt a bit odd to me.  As a 5' 11"" tall blonde, I like to look good in a Bikini.  However I also work out and do yoga on a regular basis and this means my stomach is actually quite tight and flat.  As a result this bikini bottom didn't fit too well.  I think this is more useful for keeping bulges in than for someone with no bulges.  If you want more coverage than most bikini's, then sure, give this a try, the material is comfy, but for me, the fit just felt a bit odd."
4.0,"Works for smoothing under thin shirts , but shows with loose neck shirts"
4.0,"All of these fit nicely except for the gray pair.  It is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller!  The tag says the correct size, but it is a whole size smaller.  So for the price you're really only getting 4 wearable pairs, not 5.  This company needs some quality control."
4.0,Love the piece that can be take off. Son is 7 and it is a little big for his head.
4.0,Great product so far! The quality is better than I expected. We shall see how it holds up after washing it.
4.0,I like it. good delivery time
4.0,"These sunglasses are good. They look more expensive than they are and the frame itself is fairly sturdy and looks like it will hold up for a while. The lenses are not polarized and are plastic instead of polycarbonate which is unfortunate because the clarity is much better when using polycarbonate. However, I use these for driving and for outdoor activities not involving the water (since it's not polarized) and they're comfortable."
4.0,"top (white fabric) a little transparent. Still wore without a slip, but would have preferred more opaque."
4.0,Love the print and feel. Bought 18/20=2x. It not tight cause it stretches. But very form fitting to the body. Buy a bigger size.
4.0,the coat is really nice and warm...but needs a heavier zipper
4.0,The shirt is well constructed but runs a little small.  I would recommend it just go up a sizefor correct fit.
4.0,A Little smal for the size
4.0,a little bit short in the front of blouse over all I like it.
4.0,Necklace was really pretty.  Use this product  as a Christmas  gift.gifts
4.0,"Great leggings, very nice feel and quality!"
4.0,"Fit was spot-on and accurate with typical US sizing. I felt the length was a little short (5‚Äô10). Overall pretty, but I was hoping for a casual swim cover up type of skirt and it was more of a structured/day or night cute outfit vibe!"
4.0,The fit is larger than the measurements
4.0,Great gloves - held up for my wrist and elbow surgery I had - used it for showering and not one of them torn/no water issues
4.0,I like them just i wish It will be more long lasting. We use them 2 times a week and after first 2 laundry they got some small pb.
4.0,"Came unattached at closure, but what can you expect for the price.  I will be able to fix it & will enjoy wearing it."
4.0,Looks like picture.  Happy with quality. Got a half size larger.
4.0,I ordered the green and it was definitely not what was shown. More gray. But I ordered the wine too and it was exactly as pictured! At 5'7-5'8 I ordered the medium and length was perfect (long enough for leggings but not too long for jeans). It was a little bigger than expected but good quality! I would size down and the color was off on the green but would order again.
4.0,"Very sweet wedding gift for my mother in law! Came asexpected, good quality"
4.0,Loved the dress. It's a comfortable wear. Very trendy.
4.0,"I bought this swimsuit for a trip to Maui. Unfortunately the top was a little large and required a bit of tweaking, other than that, I like the suit. Well made, beautiful colors, good fabric. Hides what I want it to hide and shows the rest."
4.0,Large pocket and plenty of room. Good quality and very elegant . I am very happy with this purse.
4.0,This sweater is very stylish but is very roomy.  I liked the raised seam lines and the back was finished nicely with a longer style of seam (to give it some style and distinctiveness).  I was a little disappointed as it was too big and roomy and so it hung off of me in an unflattering way and I usually wear a Large or X-large in tops.
4.0,"exactly as described, shipped fast, I definitely get jealous looks at the pool :)  I'm not sure how well the ribbons will hold up but that's not a deal breaker."
4.0,Great purse but would have like longer straps so I could wear it over my shoulder
4.0,[[VIDEOID:52bc769a77fcb33ff1dba10ef8bca4d6]] Looks good. Just bought them for my 11 year old granddaughter. She hasn‚Äôt wore them yet. I‚Äôm hoping they don‚Äôt cause an infection. I loved that they sent different backs for them. I wish they were a little larger
4.0,"Fit is great, material feels great, and is flattering when worn. The sad part is the piling that occurs in spite of my washing it inside out in cold water and line drying it."
4.0,Just order a size up :)
4.0,Cute but very long for a 5&#34;4 girl... even with heels!
4.0,The sweater is very warm and comfortable.  It‚Äôs fit is a bit loose for what I expected but overall a great sweater .
4.0,"I would highly recommend these pajamas.  The color and material are very nice.  They fit as expected and are true to size.  I liked them so well, I went back and purchased the other color that was available."
4.0,Pretty large. I would suggest sizing down. The rubber is solid and the canvas is somewhat durable. Can‚Äôt really complain for the price.
4.0,"It's really cute and real silver. The ring is very thin and if you aren't careful, it will snap in two. Once you adjust it, leave it alone. Other than that, it's real cute. I use it on my upper finger."
4.0,"Bought for Halloween costume. Delivery good, product nice"
4.0,great quality but was a bit big - the sizing offered was not really what we needed.  I would buy again and we are keeping as the quality and light weight of the shoe is great.
4.0,"I retuned the dress only because it was too small. I am 5'7, 145lbs with a B cup on top."
4.0,"I love it, however, I could have sworn that I ordered the dress in BLACK, and when it came in, the dress looked more like BLUE.  I checked back on my order history and there was no way to see if the dress was black or blue.  Kind of frustrating. And because I am a musician, color is a big deal.  Everything we wear is black!"
4.0,This item is very cute.  It runs small so buy size larger.  Customer service is excellent in case you need assistance.  Would buy again from this seller.
4.0,Looks good.  Poorly packaged so a little buckled.
4.0,Nice üòä
4.0,"very nice and flattering.  I only knocked off one star due to them feeling a little snug around the leg around, but not so much that I wouldn't order again.  I would say if you are between sizes and have normal sized legs, you likely can size down."
4.0,This purse feels all my needs I just wish it was a little softer. Thank you üòä
4.0,The Wife Loved it. Affordable Jewelry. Outstanding.
4.0,Stones have very little yellow but lots of white. Nice sizes.
4.0,Does as advertised. You can put your cock and balls under both straps for a slight lifting. Or you can put your cock between the two straps and leave your balls below. This will really get you some glances when at the gym (from girls and guys)! And those glances only help to make things bigger and harder!!!
4.0,"They didnt look like they did in the pic, not the same shade of blue or same distress Mark's. They were actually a little big, quality was good though I can tell they wouldve lasted a while"
4.0,"Beautiful piece, nice quality, especially for the price.  However, I purchased it for exactly what the item was to be and say... Pocket Hug.  Which was NOT engraved on the other side or anywhere in the packaging.  Disappointing to say the least."
4.0,"Pretty bracelet,  fits comfortably. Cac adjust size if needed"
4.0,"Nice beanie, but would like it to fit a bit more snugly."
4.0,"Very cute but not recommended to wear in the water constantly, the silver will change color and wear really bad."
4.0,FISH BITE THIS.
4.0,"Ordered this for my daughter(who is a cat lover) for Christmas. It is very cute, a little smaller than I expected but I know she will love it!"
4.0,This bag fits my laptop well. I appreciate the variety of storage compartments and that the top zips closed. My biggest complaint is that it falls/leans which is creasing the fabric and further exacerbating the issue.
4.0,The belt is pretty nice. I compared it to some of my old belts of comparable price and it looks pretty good. I‚Äôm excited to wear it.<br /><br />The problem is it is a tad too loose. Although it comes with an alleged hole puncher it is completely incomprehensible how you are supposed to use it. I ended up giving up and hoping I don‚Äôt lose much more weight.
4.0,"The quality is decent and it‚Äôs a cute top but I have a large bust (40DD), which makes the top a bit short. I still like it but it‚Äôs some worth noting."
4.0,Well made but not helpful for D cup gals. I missed it was not returnable so stuck. Be sure and read the fine print if you order
4.0,these are nice but they are too loose and I have a big head.
4.0,Delivered early. The buckle is a little smaller than it looks on the picture. It was a little dirty. Overall good enough for the costume I needed it for.
4.0,Great price and perfect fit. Soft--but THIN--material. This isn't a wear-in-winter-by-itself dress by any means.
4.0,Warm and effective.  Can't really ask for anything else.  Simple and does the job.
4.0,"This looks wonderful on, however it is a little thinner material than expected and I definitely need to wear black bra and undies underneath to avoid it showing through too obvious. I am a 36c and it is a bit snug on chest but not uncomfortable. It is more tight on my shoulders/arms than I would like. I ordered this for my honeymoon in March and will be bringing it along. I may wear as a swimsuit cover rather than dinner dress. Maybe size up to be safe unless u feel comfortable with a more fitted look."
4.0,"I have this to my boyfriend and he wears it every day. The chain is not the best material, but that was expected for the price."
4.0,"This dress fits larger than I expected. The hem length appears in the model photo to hit just below the knee.  I'm 5'7"" and the hem is only 2 to 3 inches above my ankles.  The sleeves are also very puffy and quite a bit wider than my arms.<br /><br />The fabric is sheer.  It says polyester and spandex, but feels like regular poly cotton broadcloth, so basically bedsheet fabric thinness.<br /><br />It honestly looks like a pioneer dress on me.  To wear this, I'd need to add a lining to the skirt, alter the sleeves to make them short and shorten the bottom ruffle to raise the hem just so it won't look so much like a pioneer dress."
4.0,"Love it , color, clarity, it doesn't fade, looks good with all clothing, great gift for a young lady or adult women"
4.0,Fit is comfortable without strong compression. I would be hesitant to go a size lower as I feel the top would be too tight.. but overall happy with the top and it fits well and is suited for workouts.
4.0,This fit my daughter except for being too short she normally wears a 7-8 so I got the 8 it was more of a tunic but it worked for what I needed.
4.0,"I like the size, color, and style.  However, I am questioning the RFID capability.  There is nothing in/on the wallet that declares this quality.  If I were certain of this feature, I'd rate it a 5 star.  Of course, I don't know how it will hold up to daily use since I have only had it a short time."
4.0,These shoes are not only pretty but they provide good support.  They are also comfortable.  One issue I have is that the main strap is a bit long and sticks out further than I‚Äôd like but its really not noticiable and doesn‚Äôt cause a problem.
4.0,"When all the necklaces are placed in it, it is somewhat difficult to find one. Really helps to keep my dresser top clearer."
4.0,"Very comfortable and sexy.<br /><br />Color: on the coral side of red<br />Fabric: very thin, soft, and stretchy. I preferred one size down from normal because it looked better stretched out rather than with a couple wrinkles. The thinness doesn't hide anything, I could see the lace texture of my bra, the lines of my &#34;seamless&#34; panties, and every bit of tummy that wasn't perfectly flat.<br />Cut: much much much shorter than in the product photo<br />Size: was a bit larger than expected. I'm typically a size 6, but the small fit better than the medium"
4.0,True to size. Decent quality. Feel free to pull the trigger on these. The kiddos love them.
4.0,Fit great just to warm to put it on yet
4.0,They fit as expected .<br />I'm size 30 so I order size USA M<br />I wish the pockets were just a little deeper .
4.0,"Me encanto es muy bello, lo que si no vi en el producto que sea plata de ley 925, tengo mis dudas."
4.0,Stunning! Bueatiful and sexy. Also the quality is pretty good. The only down side is the pressure on tbe neck. I would prefer npt having a colar
4.0,The shirt made my 5 year old very happy! Fits smaller than I expected but will still get use out of it since he was growing into that size.
4.0,"Beautiful color (royal blue), nice and silky feeling too. Only downside is the robe does have a couple loose strings but for the price it's great."
4.0,"Perfect number of pockets for organization, nice quality, but cant fit my wallet.  I would have given 5 stars if it were just slightly larger by maybe just an inch more in width."
4.0,"They did what they were supposed to do, no complaints here."
4.0,This item it'se diferent in real view
4.0,Very soft. It is kind of short and a bit wide but is very stretchy so when you put it on it fills out.
4.0,The only problem I have is the fringe coming off.
4.0,"It was smaller than I thought, but it was still a quirky touch to a spirit day at school."
4.0,"I love it<br />Makes me stand out in the gym.<br />The only negative thing I find is that the stitch is not strong enough, especially in the crotch area... But rocking it..."
4.0,This was really pretty and worked well to bring on a long plane flight. Only complaint is that when it arrived it smelled really strong of chemicals. It could have just been the plastic bag it came wrapped up in- but... stinky.
4.0,"Lenses are great, the frame is a little cheap"
4.0,Cute but doesn‚Äôt last long
4.0,"I am 6ft 195lbs. A large fits great around the waist. Since these are lounge pants, I want them loose.<br />The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that they are about 6 inches too long. They must be made for the NBA?"
4.0,My niece love these.
4.0,"It good price, the color good too."
4.0,"It's ok. Gives nice cleavage and I like how it's adjustable, and it's really pretty, but it also gives a uni-boob appearance under a loose shirt. Also they stick straight out so you have Fem-bot boobs. Has a vintage bullet bra look without the points. I think it would look nice under vintage styled clothes. I'm a 34C, I bought a 36 C and it fits well."
4.0,"The thing I really love about these cute water shoes were the great grips on the bottom. That's why I purchased them in the first place so my daughter wouldn't slip at the pool or a splash pad. However, it's hard to know the right size. They were a little snug on her feet, but we could still use them for a few times. It's a great product, and I would highly recommend them."
4.0,They did curl around your wrist but the design wrinkles.
4.0,"Fits nicely, love the pockets.  Gave it 4 stars cause it is a little thin."
4.0,These are so beautiful! Would have given 5 stars except I wish they were a little longer and less binding.
4.0,"The beads are larger than I thought they would be so it looks best, I think, without combining with additional bracelets.  The beads are quite beautiful, the color is as it looks in the picture so it's great on its own, but can be layered if that's your preference.  I'm pleased with this purchase and would buy from this seller again."
4.0,"First point to mention is I purchased these for myself; an adult that wears a kids size 2 & had very wide feet. The fit is perfect. Although the shoe is labelled as ""Large"" with no actual shoe sz indicated. I was admittedly disappointed by the fact the bows are NOT red as I had thought based on the picture & would have liked the color mentioned. They are a deep fuschia/pink. The bows are a nice quality & the footbed as well. The ""strap"" is very thin & scratches your foot uncomfortably due to the glitter on the edges. Since these are kids shoes, I would suggest a trial run around home before sending them to school or off. For the $8.96 price I'm really pleased with these. Don't expect to wear them to run a marathon but likely will last a few months before falling apart."
4.0,so cute but fits a very specific size. i am a size 4/6 and I loved it but while I am not super tall (onlly 5'4&#34;) it still kind of felt like it was almost to short... maybe I have along torso. But it is so well made and I so wish it had worked. It is worth a try and the return was very easy.
4.0,The dress is nice but it was damaged when I received it as one button was not sowed on.
4.0,"Nice product. Comfortable and easy to clean. However, they are too long so I had to shorten them by around 5&#34; and after doing that I lost that nice, silver embellishment shown at the bottom."
4.0,"Nicely made.  The cut is a little unusual, but for the price I consider this a big win."
4.0,"These come in handy when you need to go a half size up in a pinch. Use them for your fat/ bloating days, Thanksgiving, or when you don't want to buy a bigger size pants just for the waist. It's hard to get the button through the loop hole at first, and for me the zipper didn't always go up all the way or it would fall down as the day went on. Still recommend."
4.0,"Super cute & light weight, was a littlw smaller than I expected."
4.0,"The purpose of this shirt was two-fold. First, I needed an undershirt for concealed carry. Second, the shirt had to be snug and sleeveless. Wearing two shirts in 100+ degree weather is no fun so sleeveless is absolutely necessary.<br /><br />Pros: fits as described and cool.  Great for concealed carry.<br /><br />Con: The shirt has tags. When I tried to rip off the tag it ripped the stitching. Hence the 4 stars. If it had a printed label this shirt would be a 5 star rating."
4.0,Hey there!!!<br /><br />Size as expected.<br />Quality is little below optimum for UA.<br />Print is lighter than it appears in the pictures.<br />Washed once and size holds.<br /><br />Overall a good buy on the expensive size. But does look cool.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
4.0,"It fits but if you normally wear a size small for your sports bra, the strappy back is not going to look as flattering as it does on the model.  A size small girl won't have enough girth to get the straps to appear/remain separate from one another - they straps all kind of group together as one.  I kind of anticipated this when I saw that the size small was a &#34;s/m&#34; combo but it was just too cute not to give it a try, plus I was hoping it'd run a little small due to Juniors sizing.  That said, it's very comfortable to wear though it doesn't provide much support (not that I need it but I am used to slightly more snug fit).  For size reference, I'm 5'4&#34;, 115lbs and wear a 34A bra."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and the dress came to about my knee area, so it was a pretty modest dress. Still lovely though, probably most ideal for some young women or girls who are trying to find something that makes them feel pretty without feeling objectified or uncomfortable. When it comes to the dress itself, the material was stretchy and seemed a bit flimsy. The top of the dress was very comfortable and made me feel very secure. The straps are broad and comfortable, and they won't slip off. The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because the thinner material made the dress not as formal as I was expecting it to be. This dress would be good for a winter/Christmas vocal or instrumental performance, or for a night out."
4.0,I had an issue with the gloves and it was resolved promptly and better than I expected.
4.0,"Sexy, fun Unicorn unitard purchased for halloween. Tons of compliments. Very revealing, plunging next line so plan for that, and high on leg. Unitard is a great shimmer white and rainbow unicorn horn tail accent and hoodie are perfect."
4.0,Very thin and light.  It carries what is needed.  Very small change purse.
4.0,The top of the socks are too short to go over the knee and too long to just cover the calf.  I end up folding over about 3 inches of the top and that puts a little too much pressure on the top of the calf.
4.0,Lovely bracelet...have no complaints.
4.0,"Lights up, works as expected! Thank you!"
4.0,its a tad bit too long for me. It goes past my knees. But then again I am a tad bit short.
4.0,"Firstly, let me say, I am not disappointed. I received exactly what I expected. This was my first purchase, and they were delivered today (12/17/20). With that, I will not speak towards durability. However, they are ‚Äúgiftable‚Äù and would make neat stocking stuffers. One pair (in the picture) is a little heavier than I‚Äôm used to, but nothing like the door knockers/bamboo earrings from the early late 80‚Äôs 90‚Äôa hahaha! Nonetheless, I would purchase again. Hope this helps. Happy holidays! ~Taki"
4.0,"There are some great things about these panties and there are some not-so-great things.  This are very light and breathable and the lace on top helps to prevent it from rolling down.  While wearing them, they did roll down a bit on my back, but that could be attributed to my extra layer of &#34;fluff.&#34;  These panties are definitely cuter/sexier than you normal high-waist control top panties. They were very comfortable in the thigh and inner leg area.  These panties do not form a visible panty line (which is a definite plus)! Lastly, they are very soft!<br /><br />Now on to the not-so-good things... While I appreciate them being light and breathable, I'm afraid they won't last very long.  The pair that I opened already had a little hole in it (I ordered two), so I think I will go ahead and send back the unopened pair.  The fit on the bottom portion was outstanding, but the top is definitely a &#34;control&#34; top and was a bit difficult to squeeze into.  I did reference the sizing chart, so I am confident that I ordered the correct size. Overall a good panty but be aware that the top portion is indeed a &#34;control&#34; top and does not stretch very much."
4.0,"If you're not really picky about the colors, you'll like this scarf.  From the photos it looked mainly red and black; however, what appears black is actually navy.  The yellow doesn't look so much like gold as it does &quot;highlighter&quot; yellow.  Besides that, it seems to be a very lovely scarf.  It's nice and soft!  I bought it mainly to use as a shawl at home, so the colors don't matter as much as if I bought it to wear as a scarf.  I'll keep it instead of returning it.  The price was right.<br /><br />I'm at work, but I'll try to post pictures from home.  (If I can figure out how...I used my cellphone.  LOL)"
4.0,"This charm was exactly the type and size I wanted, & the price was right!"
4.0,The two buttons on the top part keep popping off and exposing my shoulder. I got the green color dress and love everything else about it. Hopefully they can impose the clasp.
4.0,"Large for my 3 year old, slide off when she moves"
4.0,The fabric for these jammies are very soft! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and the length was perfect for me. I don‚Äôt like baggy jammies as I feel like I get caught up in them at night. I will say the waistband was a bit bulkier and tighter than I expected. I‚Äôm at size 0/2 in pants and felt the squeeze a bit.
4.0,"Love them, they are beautiful. Slightly heavy on the ear but besides that I have gotten many compliments."
4.0,Cute and stylish! The chain was shorter than expected but it's still a pretty necklace.
4.0,"Fit and feel was GREAT, except where somme of the rank insignia disappear into the seam. The sharp fabric created a spot where it irritated my skin. The wavy rank line was also not a well attached as the dashed line, but overall, that product was exactly as it appears in the pictures."
4.0,Adorable and practical.
4.0,It's cute and the material is nice and light weight.  A bit shorter than the pic looks. It's between being cropped and not. Falls right at the hips. I got a large.
4.0,"Pretty, but too big for my ear. I plan on giving it to my sister in law."
4.0,"These looked super small out of the bag, but are extremely stretchy and fit fine. It is slightly thinner than some similar leggings I‚Äôve ordered, but not so much that they are see through, but if you have any fat or lumps around your waist or hips they will show, not as smoothing as some I‚Äôve had. All in all they are really nice. Color is slightly off but still nice! If you don‚Äôt have mom body like me you will totally love them! For now I‚Äôll wear with a looser shirt :)"
4.0,why does this sunglasses lens seems to be purple not black. I remember I had one before is black lens.
4.0,"Comfortable, good graphics"
4.0,"This is a good quality replacement bracelet. Nice weight, solid link and a flush fit to the watch case. Very nice brushed surface with polished sides to match the aesthetic of my Orient Mako. This doesn‚Äôt have screw-in pins. Feels solid!<br /><br />Now the other side, awful clasp !!. This part doesn‚Äôt feels solid at all. Bit giggly. I‚Äôm not sure, this may be only with the particular piece I received. I‚Äôd have given 5 star, but the clap part was really a disappointment. I‚Äôd recommend this, for the price you are paying."
4.0,Okay ring looks better in person so far nothing like a green finger.
4.0,The dress seems to be true to size but it is a very clingy dress straight line so any extra body fuff or curves and u will see it in dress
4.0,"I love these sandals! I would definitely give them a 5-star for comfort and fit....4-start for looks...but I am somewhat saddened that they are very easy to damage. Just from a few time of &#34;stubbing&#34; the fronts of them on rocks or pavement there are little spots &#34;peeling&#34; along the front edge. Otherwise, LOVE them!"
4.0,"was folded so tightly, that the wire in the brim doesn't want to straighten flat and will have to steam the fabric to remove the creases. can do and will be great."
4.0,"Really like this wallet. I have used a traditional bifold for years and knew for the longest time it was too bulky and bad for my back , but I never found a thin wallet I liked. This is a very good quality wallet and also very efficient with regards to space. I've had it for a week now and love it. Works in either front or back pocket. The only negative is the pulls trap for the credit card. It doesn't always retract all the way in when replacing your card. But overall a great wallet!"
4.0,got here fast.  was what i expected.  next time will order one size up
4.0,This a cute summer dress to just throw on. It's very thin material though. But nice for a hot day on the beach.
4.0,I bought for work. I work at donut shop. Bigger then I expected. I do like the colors in them.. I think they are meant more for children then an adult. Nice quality for the price.
4.0,"Amazing Jersey set! I am only rating it 4 stars because the picture is not on it. After reading the reviews, I ordered this jersey because the picture was not on it and that is what I was looking for. Other than that, great jersey!!!"
4.0,The fabric was lovely but the cut seemed more like Junior sizing. I didn't like the slim fit through the belly but my daughter loves it. It reminds me of something Daenerys might wear. I wish they had an XXL! Or that I still had that shape....
4.0,"Not a bad product, I wish I purchased the next size up since I wear these type of bras over a traditional sport bra. I am a 36 c/d and ordered a XL. The padded inserts are a little awkward looking in the white one but I removed these anyway. But other than that for the price and what you get, it‚Äôs a good value."
4.0,"Nothing really fancy and very &#34;Tunic&#34; style but very comfortable. Have not washed yet, don't know how that will turn out."
4.0,"Cute shirt, but quite clingy. Runs small - I bought a large and typically wear a medium and it fits great."
4.0,fit over my glasses great
4.0,dont stay on long
4.0,"Worked well for my recent trip to Vegas. I used it to hold my wallet (small card holder) and I was able to take 2 pairs of flip flops (b/c the were flat), a pair of boots, a pair of flats and tennis shoes! ... Girls have to have options when traveling and this makes it easy and convenient b/c they are not bulking up luggage!"
4.0,"I needed some ""basic work"" pants for the summer, so I ordered these without hesitation.  The pants themselves are very comfortable, and offer plenty of room without causing one to be mistaken for M.C. Hammer.<br /><br />As far as the style, they are definitely of the ""casual"" variety,  and depending on your workplace dress code, you may not get away with wearing them.<br /><br />But if you're just getting around, handling your business, or looking for some good pants that are both good for relaxing and manual labor, then these are good.<br /><br />The fabric is also quite comfortable, without being too thin.  They are also quite breathable, which is a good thing for the summer.<br /><br />The only real downside is that some may find $29.99 to be a little pricey for the kind of pants that you could likely find at the thrift store for a fraction of the price.  Then again, if you don't care about cost, and want some roomy, comfy pants, then look no further.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review."
4.0,They run 1/2 size too small and not a strong arch support. They are very cushioned and comfortable. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.
4.0,This is super cute - a bit thinner material than expected and the slit is VERY high.  It was too small for me in the bust area - I am a 42D
4.0,Slightly cheaper quality.
4.0,Smaller then I thought but it‚Äôs very beautiful
4.0,"excellent quality, but size is larger than amazon size chart"
4.0,Material is a little more thin then i expected but it fit to my normal size.
4.0,"I really like this dress, the size seems to fit true to size. The quality is good. The only thing is the overlay where the sequins are is much longer like probably a good 4 inches longer then the underneath slip layer of the dress. The under layer comes just above my knee and the lace sequins comes below my knee by a few inches. Still looks nice."
4.0,I gave it to a friend to encourage her to continue her college studies. She loved it!
4.0,"Cute, but extra flimsy. I thought they would be more durable."
4.0,A little small cut for the size but good quailty
4.0,very cute but the spikes fall off a LOT. they are hard to find and come with no extras. i love how it looks though
4.0,"Giving 4 stars cuz it was a little ""gap-y"" around the front edges. I may have needed a 36D rather than a 36DD as I've recently lost weight, but then I would be concerned it'd smush me out over those edges. Us girls know that strapless bras re never ideal and if you get too small then they fit really funky. This is basically a 4.5 star bra.  One thing of note is that there are only 2 hook and eye sets, so get your band size correct, not much wiggle room in sizing. That being said I LOVE that it hooks under the armpit so you don't have the bulky back hooks. The lace makes it super pretty all across the wide back rather than some that dip down in the middle to fit smaller hooks (and give you the dreaded back fat hangover).  Would be pretty under lots of summer tops, too! It's more of a balconette style once you add the staps, so prob not an everyday thing - but it is beautifully made!. I was worried about the SEAMS esp on the cups - but the DON'T show at all. This is a keeper."
4.0,"Cute ring, can wear with arthritic fingers"
4.0,"I am a 16/18 petite and I ordered a 1X. It fits perfectly, and falls below the knees. It's comfortable. My only problem is that it kinda feels like an old lady nighty. It does cover all and for a mom with toddlers who doesn't want to flash anyone in the middle of night, it serves its purpose."
4.0,Nice pendants but I am not crazy about the necklace. The type that it will come off easily.
4.0,Perfect! Love it
4.0,"Looks nice, but the fabric makes it look little bit cheap. good color combination. Little bit bigger that what I expect."
4.0,"Even those these said narrow they looked cute so I thought I'd give them a try. I run between an 8 & 8.5 so I ordered a 9 and I'm glad I did.  The 9 fit well. They are narrow, but the shoe isn't that narrow the narrowest part for me is the shoe opening. Kinda makes it hard to move your foot. They look okay just like the picture. Has two zippers."
4.0,Fit great and the wife is happy.
4.0,"5'5"" 140lbs-ish They fit very well in the waist and the length is just below the ankles but it is a little tappered in at the bottom so is doesn't look bad.<br /><br />I was kind of expecting a more 'jeansy' feel, but it feel soft almost like sweats, which means it stretchy which is nice. Also... they smelled stink. Lol"
4.0,"Good for the price versus Under Armour at $49.95, but not as thick/heavy/warm as Under Armour - we kept it kinda knowing what we were getting for the price - definitely worth the money at less than $20 versus the Under Armour at $49.95.  Quality appears to be excellent."
4.0,"Very cool shoes, my kid loves them.  They come with a USB to two micro USB cables so you can charge both shoes at the same time from one plug.  It has been about a month and it has been rainy out with no problems walking around in them.  They seem to hold up pretty well so far."
4.0,"This Pretifeel Mens Crewneck Pullover Sweater would be a perfect 5 stars if it weren't for the issue of running small. It arrived in a size large, which should have fit my husband, but my teen son had to try it on for me since it was too tight for his dad. Even on my son, who usually wears size medium, this sweater fits closely, so you should consider ordering a larger size. Other than running small, this sweater is excellent. It feels soft and substantial. The Navy Blue color has a handsome heathered look that gives the sweater a unique look. My teen said that the sweater is both warm and comfortable. I would order this Pretifeel Sweater again, but would size up next time."
4.0,This was the perfect gift for a friend about to undergo chemotherapy and radiation.  The card accompanying it explains the significance of the stones.
4.0,"Cute pjs, but thinner than expected. Also, the material is a cotton blend. They are soft, but as ‚Äúbreathable‚Äù as 100% cotton."
4.0,Was a great dress! Fit very nice. I would‚Äôve liked it to fit a bit tighter but all in all I was satisfied!
4.0,I like everything about this card again and it doesn‚Äôt wrinkle easily it‚Äôs what I had expected
4.0,"This backpack is well made with enough compartments and features to satisfy most people. The only knock I have is the fact that it tends to fall foward when loaded with ""stuff"". I admit that is a petty complaint. While a flat area along the bottom of the big compartment might compensate for this problem, it probably would bother most people, so I can understand not including it.<br />On the plus side, I love the padded MP3 player pocket; not only is it located in the right place (high, back), it has a velcro closing strap and a headphone hole if you want to listen while wearing.<br />Styling is very nice and well represented with the pictures on this site and their homepage. I also like the padding on the pack-back, and the strap padding as well as the adjustable straps that allow you to make the pack more compact. Also, I like the carrying strap on the top. Initially I didn't think much of it, but I use it often.<br />My student days are long gone, but I needed a backpack for multiple needs (beach, airplane carry-on luggage, bicycle riding, etc.) and this purchase met those needs perfectly.<br />Quality is very good.<br />Recommended."
4.0,I love the hat. Great fit and received many compliments. Wish it wasnt velcro for fitting but i like the hat.
4.0,A bit heavy watch but good quality. Liked it
4.0,"The shape is a little funny but I would order the same bra size you normally wear. Yes, it's a little tight but it's a sports bra. It should be tight. I ordered a size up the first time and there was too much space in the cups. I prefer my real size, especially if I'm doing cardio. Great for the price though."
4.0,Works great. Does the job
4.0,"The beads are resin, in think. Not glass. The silver beads are not metal. They are also plastic. Everything is plastic. However, like any material, it can be amplified with a little charging. It looks amazing, though. I am now addicted to eyes. I must have more. üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è"
4.0,"I'm usually a med / lrg and went with a large. It fits how it should. This shirt is very lightweight. Holding it up, you can see straight thru the entire shirt. Other than that and a couple stray threads, it's very cute."
4.0,"This dress fit well and was a good length (which is saying something since I am 5'11"".) It also has pockets! Unfortunately, one of the pockets arrived with a hole in it. Other than that, it's a nice dress."
4.0,"The face of this watch is really pretty.  I like the band, too, but the chords hang too long.  I could replace the band, but enjoy using it as it is for now.  I would buy it again."
4.0,"Its funny that some reviews said its too thin, because I actually expected it to be much thinner and lighter, based on other packable backpacks I've had. I love the design of the zip-away shoe compartment to make this two different sizes, but the cloth is thick and stiff and its hard to fold up and it actually takes up a significant amount of suitcase space once folded. I was hoping for something really small and light that would take up almost no suitcase space. Oh well.<br /><br />So, its good for what it is, it just wasn't quite what I wanted so I'll be returning it."
4.0,This bra looks and feels really nice and I also like the color but it's a little snug and gives some armpit fat that I'm just not a fan of. I love the strappy back and longline look but the fit just wasn't quite right for me.
4.0,"The hat and jewelry are very sturdy. I'm allergic to most jewelry but not these, and no green lines on my skin after wearing them. The mask is a bit awkward, doesn't fit my face well at all. Most everything is well made. My only complaint is the phone attachment broke as soon as I tried to apply it to my phone. Otherwise, it was a great purchase."
4.0,Definitely cheaply made but very cute. The lighter colors are a little see through so just keep that in mind. I am waiting on a darker colored one right now and might update my review depending how that one is. I recommend this as a cute summer top!
4.0,I love these socks. They really work.
4.0,"Good quality material (all cotton in the ones I received), colors have stayed fast,  and mostly comfortable to wear. But placing a prominent thick seam right down the middle of the front is not the best construction practice - photographs used by seller don't reveal how thick this seam really is"
4.0,Good idea but a little thin for protection.Mel
4.0,Need updated picture because wallet did not look like picture.  Very nice quality. Definitely worth the price. Don't expect to get in a week either. Mine took a month to arrive
4.0,"good watch, band tooooooo small !"
4.0,Makes everything burst with color on a sunny day and also prevents the sunlight from affecting your vision.<br /><br />Sit a little high on the face so when wearing a hat forward it can‚Äôt be completely covering your forehead
4.0,First Communion gift.
4.0,I‚Äôm a medium and medium fit good. It‚Äôs not a compression top.
4.0,The children's size 2.5 to 3.5 can fit a womans size 7  its a bit larger then expected. But I love them and will just buy my daughter a new smaller pair :)
4.0,"These fit comfortably over my regular prescription glasses.  They come with a hard-ish carrying case.  They definitely block the polarized light (or only let in the polarized light?  I forget which way it goes, but in any case it works.)  I deducted a star because it didn't take many occurrences of them falling off my hat before one of the lenses popped out.  The lesson here is don't drop them a lot."
4.0,I wear an 18 in everything so I ordered an 18. I should have ordered a 16. I still like them. Color and fabric is exactly what I was hoping for.
4.0,I ordered a medium and should have ordered a small. Over all cute but seemed a bit cheaply made but cute for the price. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 135 and needed a small to fit more fitted. The medium works if you want a loose fit.
4.0,Love this shirt! Proud to wear it!
4.0,"4 out 5. I was a little disappointed in the exterior material. The photo I took is the bottom of the case and the material is stretched. If I could go back, I'd probably just get a black exterior as I don't feel it will last very long. The case itself is nice and made of a strong material to protect your hats."
4.0,Fits and looks nice.  Friendly website.
4.0,"This is a lovely watch. Bought it for our daughter who loves it. She has a small wrist and the band is very large on her, which we assumed it would be. We can usually get links out of watch bands ourselves but not with this watch - we had to take it to a watch place and they took out 4 links so that cost another $10.<br /><br />Face is quite large so would not recommend for a child under about 12 years of age."
4.0,It‚Äôs comfortable and doesn‚Äôt look sloppy
4.0,I like this wallet but don't love it because it's tiny! My cards have a hard time going in and out because the slots are just too small. Holds everything else fine but that's a huge downfall because I use credit cards almost every day
4.0,This watch arrived within a few days and is really cool. Especially for the price!
4.0,"Solid, as decribed. the toe box part could have been knit tighter but overall it does the trick of falling just above the ankle as seen in the pic to carry out the current trend :)"
4.0,"Obviously not the TOP NOTCH fabric, but it's adorable and solid quality. Wearing it almost every day since it arrived! I recommend for yourself, or a gift!"
4.0,"Beautiful watch. Only issue is that the watch strap came undone after only 2 days of wear.  It wasn't worth the money to ship it back, so I fixed it and it's been wonderful since. I love looking at my watch and I get compliments a lot. I am a woman and while the watch is a little big, it still looks good on my small wrist."
4.0,"I like this band because it is very comfortable and easy to adjust, it also dries quickly when I get it wet. I can be very hard on my stuff so it doesn't surprise me that I am currently on my 3rd band. The cloth is good, its where the cloth is held to the bracket that connects to the watch that seems to be a weak spot. But I'm giving 4 stars because I do like it and it doesn't bother me to order more because I am hard on my stuff."
4.0,This ring is very realistic. However when you keep it in for a long amount of time it does start to sting and that's most likely because of the magnet
4.0,Fast ship....not sure if it truly works as it says it is suppose to. Products appears to look the same as advertised.
4.0,The pants are lightweight and comfortable I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3 225 pounds I Usually wear a 34 or 36 in waist. I ordered an XL and they fit. They are baggy in the leg but the length and waist are good. I will try a large next time. My only issue is I wish there was a drawstring or something for the leg openings. If it had that and a slimmer fit I would give five stars. Also the bottom to fasten them with seems flimsy I have no doubt it will break soon.
4.0,"Warm and good quality. Perhaps order a side larger though because as a women's 2x I usually can wear a men's XL and this, while it fit and is stretchy, the buttons would pull apart and make unsightly gaps"
4.0,"Was hoping they would be just a little bigger but they look great, very pretty and work wonderfully for my daughter."
4.0,Perfect for summer time!!!
4.0,"I bought this cover up for a trip overseas for my wife. She really liked the way it fit although it was just a tad bit long, but she's on the shorter side ( 5 feet 1 inch) The colors were as expected, but with slightly less yellow than the picture showed. The material was very light and breezy and dried quickly while she was wearing it. We were both very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Fit me fine, and very comfortable."
4.0,"Good value for the money. Expect massive shrinkage when you wash it -- probably 4 inches in length. I'm 5'9&#34; and now have a mid-calf dress. Sleeves are a bit tight. The fabric is heavy but soft - a great choice on a cool evening. Nicely cut and seems well made. Stands up to laundering just fine. Just consider ordering up to cover for shrinkage, and if you're tall and want a floor-length gown, this is not going to quite work."
4.0,"I like the look of the band, it‚Äôs sturdy, and adjustable, it allows me dress my watch up and  wear my watch with dressy outfits."
4.0,fine for what I needed
4.0,"I used this while traveling, and found it to be well designed and handy. Even though my traveling purse doesn't need to be as big as my every day purse, I would have loved an extra inch or two all around."
4.0,"Love the colors!  Not as soft as I thought they would be, but still warm and comfortable."
4.0,The High Definition in these glasses work very well the only thing that I don't like is that the side of the frame is a little too wide and there are blinds spot for driving.  Other then that they definitely do the trick for the sun and giving you a very clear view as well.
4.0,It is awesome but pls try to provide different sizes because this size is so big but I like it
4.0,"Very cute boots! They do seem to run a little large and wide. So I definitely wouldn't size up on these. I also have an adult pair in these same Joan of Arctic style, and those run large on me as well. But very cute boots!"
4.0,A bit too large but very comfortable.
4.0,Comfortable to slip bare feet into on a chilly orning.
4.0,"CONS:<br />This set is cute but is not accurately represented in the main photos. The lace on the nightgown has a more basic design than pictured and is more of a peachy-pink tone. Its lower quality than the picture<br /><br />The underwear it comes with is okay but not my preferred style. Its a basic 'T' shaped thong which isn't very comfortable and doesn't provide much coverage<br /><br />PROS:<br />For the price, I still feel like it's a good buy and have been enjoying wearing<br /><br />After several washes, the nightgown material still feels great and dries relatively wrinkle free if you hang it up afterwards<br /><br />The satin on the nightgown is nice and soft. Color is as pictured (teal color)"
4.0,It was very large. Would suggest ordering a size down. Material is really nice
4.0,The pocket should have been made shorter across the top edge so it doesn‚Äôt sag down as much as it does. It looks super awkward.
4.0,"I like it, working well, and looking good too."
4.0,"The neckline kind of chokes, so even as I wear the dress and enjoy its aesthetic, I‚Äôm uncomfortable. It looks cute and the fit looks fine, but I‚Äôm really surprised by how unpleasant the collar is. I‚Äôve marked this garment as somewhat small, but honestly it‚Äôs fit is fine for my frame despite the neckline. And I have thin and longer neck, so... I don‚Äôt know. But I find when I wear it I tug down at the neck a lot."
4.0,Nice shades with a nice case.  Great for the value.
4.0,Met expectations except that fingers were a little long.
4.0,"Lovely outfits. However, I order 6-9 months for newborn and 3-4 for his older brother who wears 2T. Both lovely outfits need to be worn now since they were too small for later use. The 6-9 months is actually 0-3 months. 3-4 is actually 2T"
4.0,"These are very accurate for cosplays and there actually not uncomfortable, but they are slippery and you can see through the socks.(But easy fix don‚Äôt paint your toe nails.)"
4.0,Paint quality could have been better. Overall great for costume. Added gold paint to make it stand out.
4.0,These are cute but run small on the face. I bought 2 pairs and gave to my girlfriends. They love them!
4.0,What does touch screen mean?<br />They‚Äôre soft gloves but I thought they‚Äôd be a tad thicker for the cost of the gloves. The right thumb lining isn‚Äôt stitched perfectly. It‚Äôs ok. Maybe the gloves can be a little longer but they‚Äôre ok
4.0,"I really like this shirt!  I ordered a small (my regular size) but the cut on the shoulders and chest was slightly tight, which is odd because I am not large chested ...but  the waist area gave me more than enough room.  It almost seems like an XS.  That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.<br />The length of the shirt is slightly short but okay.  ( I am 5'10&#34; ) .  I could get away with a small and keep it but I really like the shirt so will order a MED and see how that fits.  One of these will be returned.  Overall a great shirt. ."
4.0,"Liked this shirt although it fit much too big, should of got a small"
4.0,They do slip down on my face but not husband‚Äôs. They are very comfort cool...I wet mine with water and wear around neck and cover nose and mouth when out in the heat.
4.0,My mom had a hard time putting this on as it is a challenging to do so. The colors are beautiful as well as the design which is simple. The fabric seems good quality to my and the details on the edges are good. I did not like that I bought the product guessing because there is not chart to size guide provided for the product.  The bikini is more comfortable than the top. The combination of the set is nice (black and green).
4.0,Love the fit.  Love the feel. I ordered up a size.  The green was much lighter that picture shown. The black is perfect
4.0,Yes its real and yes its large and yes it's what you want in a fur collar. Only complaint was the way packaging was handled; it was basically balled up and smashed in a vacuum pack to the point that the fur took a couple months of hanging to unsmash. Otherwise it would have been a 5 star.
4.0,They are a little long for my husband but he tightened the Velcro strap and that seemed to take care of his foot sliding down to the end.
4.0,Light weight. Beautiful
4.0,This purse comes rolled up in a wee box all wrinkly. The fabric isn't that nice. It is big and things could be lost in the free-for-all center pocket. I do think it would be a good purse for traveling as you can fit a lot of crap in there.
4.0,"This apple watch band is a really nice alternative to the plastic bands you get if you purchase the apple watch sport. It is real leather, it it has great stitching, and the color is pleasant to look at. This makes your watch go from something that sticks out and maybe gets way too much attention, to something that is more subtle. At first glance, the band is super stiff. In fact, it is kind of hard to get it al the way around your wrist without taking a risk of dropping your watch. Once it's on though, and it stays on for at least a few minutes, it starts to get broken in. This is an attribute of leather that makes this just a curious observation, rather than a problem.<br />It comes with a little screwdriver, and that is to adjust the band in case it becomes loose from the holders that keep it attached to the watch. I've seen that the holders themselves are sold separately, so they must be something that falls off. But, if you give it the benefit of the doubt, you can always take it as a courtesy, in case you want to take off the leather strap to put in your own custom strap.<br />One thing that kept me from giving this item five stars was that the strap didn't fit me right away. I had to make another hole to put the clasp in. My hands are really small, and this has been an issue with watches... but it hadn't been an issue with any of the other straps I've gotten for my watch... so one star less for this band.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I got this at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased review."
4.0,Thin unlined fabric and slightly loose buttons at the crotch.  That being said...it‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL on and AMAZING for the price.  I loved getting something reasonably priced that she can play in guilt free but still look fashionable.
4.0,Last set I ordered were too short. These are just right and hold very well. Interesting stretch pattern material. All OK.
4.0,"It's nice and Very cute. It's not very flowy in the arms. A little tight, actually. It's not something that completely ruins it but I surely won't be doing any lifting or hugging in it!"
4.0,"They are flimsy (but I paid $6 for them). They look great! I have a very small face, and these fit it perfectly. They're nicely coloured with the faded amber. They are pretty see-through, but just as pictured. I love these little sunnies!"
4.0,The o-rings are a bit too big but these are nice for the price and such a nice bright green color!
4.0,"At first, I loved these shoes. They are very cute, they go on easily, and they stay on. I love that they are a combination of moccasins and sandals. The major downside to these is they are not built to last. My child has been wearing them regularly for about two months and they are starting to fall apart. Several of the pieces of fringe have come off or are only hanging by a thread, and there's a lot of wear in general. I really wish these were higher quality because I seriously love them. At this rate they are definitely not going to last the entire summer. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"This necklace was purchased for my friends daughter, it fit her fine because she is small but I don't see how it would fit an adult well. More like a choker. It is a cute necklace"
4.0,Loved this! Super cute & worked perfect for my car keys.
4.0,Love the shirt! It‚Äôs very soft! Every time I wear it I get compliments!
4.0,They're really cute and fairly comfortable but way too overpriced for a faux fur slipper. I may return them.
4.0,This dress is not what I expected but it's okay.
4.0,I love the extra detailing that is characteristic of Neon Buddha. This swing jacket is a nice weight but I had trouble unbuttoning the top 2 buttons to fit it over my head. I still have not been able to unbutton the bottom buttons but am determined when the weather gets cooler. The sale price is great so I am keeping it.
4.0,Shirt fits as it should
4.0,She didn‚Äôt like the fit due to weight increased
4.0,"Remember these are $11 - $12 sunglasses.  I simply use them for driving when I have in contacts.  I've owned 2 pairs, and will continue to use this supplier."
4.0,"The pattern and pockets are nice, but the material was clingy and the overall fit was unflattering on my body type. I ended up returning this tunic."
4.0,I received this today. I like the material and it fits good.
4.0,I wore these for my wedding and loved them. They were exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,Pretty for the price. Lot's of compliments on a long silver chain
4.0,"such a cute dress. Usually wear size 'M, 8/10..I ordered a 'L.  Fit me for the wrap, around the waist bust was a bit big but that's because I'm an 'A cup.<br />great purchase for the style, print, and price"
4.0,"Cute earrings, can be dressy or sport. Worth the money"
4.0,"Overall love the suit- it is exactly how it looks and the quality is great. It's always hard to find a suit that fits both your butt and your boobs. In this case, my boobs were spilling out a bit. I wish there were cups to support them but there arent. I wouldnt recommend if you have big boobs DD+.  Also, I've been wearing it only a few days and I've been sitting on the steps inside my pool and have noticed the material is catching on the stone and is a slowly ruining it. Just make sure you dont do this!"
4.0,"Very beautiful dress, it's very comfortable and I got a lot of compliments"
4.0,"They're very pretty.  I didn't notice when I ordered them, but there is a right and left; you can't just throw them on. They fall at an angle  and I would have preferred straight earrings that are faster to put on and don;t require checking the angle first, otherwise I would have given them a five.  I've only worn them a few times, so I don't have any idea how the finish holds up for such an inexpensive earring."
4.0,Not high quality but perfect for our Great Gatsby Anniversary Photoshoot! :)
4.0,It didn‚Äôt fit my umbrella pole to extend it. Only to replace the lower pole. I needed an extension.
4.0,Lightweight and easy to breathe
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. It is NOT as long as it looks in the picture though. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and the bottom hits above my ankles. I‚Äôd say it fits true to size. I should have ordered a large but I‚Äôm going to keep my medium. I‚Äôm a very curvy Latina with a tiny waist and wide hips, this comes in snug around my waist which I like. I don‚Äôt have a large chest so this has enough room for my B cups."
4.0,I would love it if it had just a bit more stretch in the arms.
4.0,It‚Äôs good for the price! It changed color in few months.
4.0,The pearl ear cuff is nice and it bends easily to fit your upper ear.<br />My kids thought I got more piercings
4.0,Every female needs this in their closet üòçüòçüòçüòç make sure to size down tho so the bands can hold the girls up properly
4.0,"The fabric is great for summer, the item fitted as expected and the colors look great!"
4.0,Had mixed feelings about this item was very disappointed it was way too small however it is beautiful and well made forget if you're plus size.
4.0,"This is just an ordinary sweater. It is not a slim fit cutting and also it‚Äôs not lightweight. The knitting quality looks good and very dense, but it‚Äôs not stylish. It doesn‚Äôt have the good emphasis on the shoulder and the body curve taper to the waist. It doesn‚Äôt have that fashionable fit and feel style."
4.0,"Very cute and soft, however are a bit thin,"
4.0,Wife likes how it looks bit says it's to short
4.0,"I had to play with this a bit to make it wearable, but it's really cute for those days when I'm sitting outside and need a little more sun protection."
4.0,My son loved the color (he picked the orange ones). We bought him an 11 little kids or toddler and they fit perfectly he is almost 4 and in 3T & 4T clothing.
4.0,"Item sets off a motorcycle vest, heavy gauge chromed steel"
4.0,"Usually I buy a size large, in this case I did not and bought an XL instead. When I put them on they felt great! Sizing was fine, a little loose on the waist line though. Main Issue: The ankle area is way too big! Therefore, it rides up. I try to pull them down but they just come right back up. SO overall. They're good leggings, but maybe I should have gone for a tighter fit to fix the obnoxious ankles."
4.0,"Grandson ""loves"" the fit and style of these shoes! Only gave four stars because he has not officially worn them yet. School starts in 3 weeks, that will be the test."
4.0,They run small but they are very cute. It fitted me as expected.
4.0,"Cute, but not a big hit like I  had hoped  for, maybe  my granddaughter  will warm up to it in time. Oh well you can't  win them all !"
4.0,It works great dies the job but order a size bigger but figured that's the was suppose to fit little snug
4.0,My grandson's favorite character at the moment.
4.0,Very comfortable and perfect for night time or lounging.
4.0,Tengo el paquete no se Perdi√≥
4.0,"I got this as a Spring outfit. I'm 145, 5'4, and bought a medium. It's a bit too tight around the upper area, so I can't wear it without a jacket, but it's still very cute. The material is fresh, but it sticks to me because it's tight. It's my fault for getting the wrong size, although I'm usually medium/small, so I thought it would fit. I'm still keeping it because it wouldn't be worth the price to ship it back, and for the price it's well made and fresh for Spring."
4.0,Enjoy variety
4.0,"These tights are pretty good! They are incredibly soft with a good stretch/tightness. They are relatively thin, so I‚Äôm a little concerned on how long they will hold up for, but are at least nice and are not see through at all. The pockets are great and easily fit my smartphone without it feeling like it‚Äôs going to fall out or pull the leggings down. I usually wear a medium in tights and these were true to fit. The high waist actually does go up high and the length of the leggings hit just above my ankle bone."
4.0,"I like these pants but they don't stretch, fabric is ok."
4.0,It‚Äôs comfortable to wear and has a good material
4.0,Wider than I expected but appear to be good quality.
4.0,These work pretty well. I wish they weren‚Äôt so ugly and awkwardly yellow haha. But they do the job for me when I‚Äôm driving at night (I have a hard time seeing with bright oncoming headlights in traffic )
4.0,Very cute and different than the normal cat ears!
4.0,They are very soft and the fit is good
4.0,"Was very pretty, but was not attractive on my body.  Great for someone younger though."
4.0,I purchased  for my daughter who asked for the Armor of God Shield necklace.  It is smaller than I thought it would be.  It is easy to read the writing.  The chain looks good.  It is pretty to look at.
4.0,"It's a good sturdy ""toy"" would not think of it as jewelry. Too heavy.  The knobs on the sides don't turn the rings like they do in the movie but it will still be fun to play with. The first pictures are a little misleading so go by the last picture. It's more accurate."
4.0,Comfortable and cute costume.  I ordered a medium (I'm a tall Size 4/6) and it was a little large on me...wished I had ordered the small.  I loved the furry boot covers...definitely &#34;made&#34; the costume.
4.0,Really like this shirt.  Bust area looks great.  Bigger than I normally am by who it fits.  Will buy a little larger size next time just for the length.  But I've worn it several times and it's cute and comfortable
4.0,"My husband loves these for running because he can use his phone for music and keep it from bouncing around by using the thigh pocket.<br />The shorts also have a zippered pocket in the back, right side.<br />He has a 36"" waist, thick legs and is 6' so the XL fit great.<br />Remember to tie the drawstring before throwing in the wash so the laces don't slip back into the drawstring holes and get lost in the waistband.<br />He just ordered a second pair!"
4.0,This is a model for kids. It's a good choice.
4.0,These are the bras that the manufacture screwed up on but we're still good enough to wear
4.0,"Looks nice but it was too tight for me 5'6"" 140 32D. I gave to friend and she likes the compression/support."
4.0,"I love these.  They are funny and comfortable and fit as they should.  They do feel a little cheap like walking on foam but still very comfortable.  I am not sure how long they will last but honestly, I am just so excited to wear my Fish Flops to the lake this summer!"
4.0,Some in the pack slip down off the ankle during the day and were a little annoying... I work in the medical field so on my feet awhile.. to stop and adjust was a little annoying.. other then that the rest were great...
4.0,"These shorts came today and the husband was eager to try them on. He really liked the retro palm tree design on them and was looking forward to wearing them to our pool. I prepared him for the fact that they DO NOT have a mesh lining and he said he was willing to try them.<br /><br />He normally wears an XL or sometimes a 2XL. Per suggested, I bought him the 4XL because of the size conversion. He's a bigger guy and even when he was younger he had bigger thighs. That being said, he loves that the shorts have pockets, but they are so snug that he can't really put anything in them and they gap a little. :( The length is good and as I said, he loves the pattern, He likes that they have an elastic waist fully through instead of just the tie at the front and he also was happy to see the side velcro pocket. They seem well made and not like he'll have a &#34;see through&#34; issue when they are wet. He hopes to lose a few pounds and they will fit better.<br /><br />Overall, decent shorts with cool designs. If you are one of those people who gets fixated on sizes they may give you a complex (hubs got a little offended by the 4X tag), but if that and the lack of mesh lining don't bother you, I say go for it!"
4.0,I am very glad that I purchased this item!  It was well worth my money!
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): This is a soft and comfy t-shirt.  It runs true-to-size.  The leaf graphic is a nice addition to a basic t-shirt.
4.0,They hav a lot of adjustments options i have a wide head and they fit me almost perfect and even with the regular ear peace thay hav never fallen of my face but they do get scratched easily and I is a little worried about how they will do in the long time
4.0,"I don't like the white on the sleeve, apart from that a small fits me just right. Hight 5f 3in weighing 140."
4.0,"I enjoy this backpack, no issues, its great for what it is and the price - however, I'm not a ""boho"" bag type of person, where the bag or backpack is flimsy / doesn't have much structure.<br /><br />Instead, I went shortly afterwards with an all black Loungefly backpack and that has suited me better just based on my preferences of structure. I still have this backpack, and will definitely keep it, just more of a preference thing."
4.0,I love the look of this shoes! It is so stylish and can be worn out at night or to work.  Ordered two colors! If you have long toes I would be cautious but I have small toes and they fit great.
4.0,Due to military life we are away from our son for some time. He loves jewelry and this was really special for him to wear daily to remind him even though were far apart his mama still loves him.
4.0,Product is fine but this color is considerably more green that the picture shows.
4.0,I love these glasses though I wish there was white all the way around the gold kind of breaks it up a little bit and I think that takes away from the white look I was going for. I do have a white face and they fit me pretty well so I do like them I like the design on the sides are very pretty and so they seem a little flimsy I'm going to try them out longer and see if they last. They came in a little bag to keep them from scratching so that's nice though I would've preferred a case. So far seems to be worth the price I paid.
4.0,Long. Comfortable
4.0,They are exactly what you expect I wore mine for a halloween costume and it looked just like the picture it worked perfectly
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and 140lbs and the S fits me perfectly. I would be comfortable wearing this dress out to a social occasion as-is, but it is a little on a short side for business wear; I will pair with tights and boots to wear to work. The material is thin and is made from an odd polyester blend, so it is slick and easily wrinkled as noted in other reviews. It is loose and boxy and probably not a terribly flattering cut for everyone, but it looks cute on me as long as I use a belt to define my waist. Very hit or miss dress, but I like it."
4.0,Love the dress. Only downfall is the chest area. There is a flap under the buttons that doesn't quite cover even with smaller chest. I wouldn't order a size up though
4.0,Everything fit good the material in the crotch area is a little misaligned
4.0,I enjoy large jackets; especially when I catch the chills often.  I shall purchase a few more in the future.
4.0,"Purchased for a Day of the Dead Halloween theme costume. It fits well, glad I sized up. Although it is a little big in the chest but I have not fully adjusted the back, it appears that it could be tightened enough to be snug during the evening festivities. Pretty pleased with this purchase. I can see re-using this as a saloon or witch costume in the future. Not sure I would wear it for any other event."
4.0,wore these with a go go dress for Halloween. Nice Fit. Love them. I have small calves and they fit
4.0,great fit and so comfortable
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute Christmas hoodie. Get a one or 2 size bigger eg get close if u wear large there a bit tight
4.0,Product is good itself..but thr discription and pictures differ..yellow rotor useally comes with the watch price  arround $ 90
4.0,Lovely dress. Nice fabric.
4.0,"Went a size up and it fit great! I wore it once and received a lot of compliments , it is a bit lighter than it said but I loved how it looked , the sleeves have a &#34;fringe&#34; look to it like its pulled back and that made it even better! definitely recommend."
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my daughter who loves polka dots. These scarves are very light weight and probably are best for spring. She did say that they have a strange/unpleasant odor but I assume that will be resoloved by washing them. A great value!
4.0,Cute shirt! Nana will love this!
4.0,My son loves his new mask.
4.0,Super cute and I put in inserts to make them more shoe like
4.0,It is somewhat thinner than expected. But i like the logo and it fits our grill nicely. We have used it for a couple of months now with a couple of rainy/windy days and it has held together nicely. I would buy it again.
4.0,"These are lovely shoes that I bought for my 3yr old daughter. Unfortunately they are a little on the big side. I guess sizes vary from shoe to shoe. On a positive note, she'll be able to grow into them."
4.0,This ran a little smaller than I'd hoped but regardless it a beautiful color and beautiful dress.
4.0,I like the design of these cuff links. It looks good on any suit I put on. I typically go for that classic look because that's my style and it does well looking classy.These are high quality made. They don't break easy get bent or scratch off. I'm happy with these cuffs looking to buying more in near future.
4.0,I like them  - the post seems longer than usual<br />But they really are tiny
4.0,Great grandson loved it! Wore it to watch the DVD's they got with it.
4.0,It was a little long but love it!!
4.0,Exactly the fake glasses you want.
4.0,"The red is bright I love the color, I'm not too crazy about folded sleeve but overall cute shirt if you want a longer shirt order a size bigger"
4.0,"Really long, but looks just like photos"
4.0,Super cute. I bought this dress months ago in a Medium. I am 5&#34;0&#34; tall and curvy thought it would fit like all my other Medium dresses.  I ended up returning it as it was too big.  I figured I would try again as I have recently lost a ton of weight.  This time I bought a Small and it was perfect.<br />I am short waisted so I thought it would bunch up and not lay correctly and it does look great.  The fabric is super stretchy and kind of thin. I have no idea how other colors other than black wouldn't be see through.
4.0,Works well a little tight to open and close
4.0,"Fits more like a B cup  than a C,  but they fit my daughter perfectly , I wanted to order a D cup but they don't have any in any design. I would ordered many if they did, great value."
4.0,"Good quality shirt, happy with fit. Only reason not 5 stars is it holds wrinkles, even if removed from dryer immediately"
4.0,"Good pair of tights, lasted through wearing and are in good shape to wear again."
4.0,The lives of the road day I had of schedule everything I needed to install the lenses into the frames was in the package nothing was scratched it comes with his own felt case but is also big enough for you to put the sunglasses in everything fit perfectly of the lenses are a little bit Ficker then the Oakley lenses but you can't really tell that it's Bev the edges are beveled perfectly so it fits right into the frame.
4.0,I had to return it it was too big.
4.0,"Like previous reviews, broke all pin removers, but have my own, fits great now , after some work"
4.0,"Totally cute, but not for the larger busted."
4.0,Loved it for the occasion üëå
4.0,"It fits well, it is the right length, nice fabric. The colors are vibrant and it is going to Italy with me next month"
4.0,Dress fits true to size
4.0,Very thick quality. Seems sturdy so far. Haven't pinned it on yet but it came with 4 golden Bobby pins. Very pretty crown.
4.0,It is shorter than I expected/ More tunic length than dress length. Not generous in size by any means but not small either. Overall Im happy with it.
4.0,Good shirt at an ok price. A little cheaper than in stores
4.0,"Nice, but a bit thin."
4.0,"I haven't had the opportunity to use it for my son yet, but it is very soft. I like the quality. I think it will help keep him warm."
4.0,"Fine top, looks good.  Way more spandex/polyester to suit me since my search was for white cotton tops.  But is works fine."
4.0,A bit smaller than picture portrays but overall is exactly what i wanted. Same color tone as picture. Usually i get a shade darker or lighter than described but this one is spot on
4.0,I loved it...as others have reviewed definitely a dress for shorter people...unless you plan on wearing leggings. At 5'2 this came up to mid thigh. Print is as pictured..nice dress
4.0,"I ordered an xl even though I have a 31&#34; waist.  The skirt sat nicely, but the elastic was not snug at all, and a single tug from my toddler or brushing too hard against the crowded seats at my daughters recital would surely have made it fall off. The fabric is comfortable and absolutely gorgeous, and the skirt is well-made.  I definitely would have tried sizing down, but they were sold out of the color I need in smaller sizes.  I would suggest trying about 2 sizes smaller than you would expect to need unless you're planning to stand perfectly still away from all people when wearing it.  But definitely worth trying to find the right size because it's a lovely piece.  If I needed one of the other colors at some point, I would try again."
4.0,"quality isn‚Äôt great, but thats to be expected. you get what you pay for!"
4.0,A little big but okay with inside shirt
4.0,"Knocking off a star due to the left pocket being funky, there's like an extra sheet of material in there or something.  Still functional, not worth returning.<br /><br />The pants are extremely comfortable, hands down my favorite style of pants right now.  I've worn them several times already, washed them in between, and they seem like they'll hold up.  I am 6'2"", wear a size 36 waist in jeans and the large fits just right.  I may order an extra-large next to see if I like the extra room."
4.0,"Eas a gift for my mom, a diamond piece came off."
4.0,Nice enough for men or women.  My husband and I have quite a collection of holders and we share this one a lot
4.0,"but this is actually a good product. It's cheaply priced and you're getting a whole set. The earrings and the necklace all look perfect, but the rhinestones on the bracelet had a couple that were jacked up. I easily ripped them off and glued them back into their proper placement and it looks beautiful now."
4.0,"Bought this for my toddler, but the sole is so tough he can barely run around in it. They are super cute, but unfortunately had to be returned. This doesn't take away from the fact that they are very well made. I think I will get them when my son is older."
4.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and got a medium based on the size chart.  I felt the inseam was too low and the seams pulled (did not tear) when putting on, but everything else fit well. Please note, it is spandex and NOT spanx.  There is almost zero forgiveness.  Still overall fun experience and my children loved me dressing up."
4.0,My son loves it. It took a couple of weeks for it to be delivered but it was a nice gift. I will mention that the hat we got wasn‚Äôt the same as the pictured one or like the pictures that other customers received. Consistency is very important.
4.0,Nice looking dress
4.0,Nice fabric and well made. Maybe just not my style as much as I wished it was.
4.0,"I bought both the green and blue.  Of the two only the royal blue fit my tiny wrists securely.  Even on the last hole, the green still had some &#34;play&#34; on my wrists.  However for those with regular sized wrists, you should have no problem.  Had to tap the face a couple times the first time I wore it to get the minute hand to work, so I am not expecting much in terms of it keeping good time, at least until I maybe change the battery to one of better quality.  That said though, this watch is very stylish and the colours are very vibrant and eye catching."
4.0,"I purchased this with the intention of creating a really strong gold necklace as a halter to carry the heavy weight of my wedding dress.  I knew titanium could be anodized gold, so I was really looking forward to this.  I must have missed the part in the description where it said this was a titanium ALLOY, so the failed results are my fault for not carefully reading.<br /><br />The necklace is very well made.  Great quality of workmanship and a beautiful variation of a wheat design.  As other reviewers have stated, the tight weave of the chain has a tendancy to kink, but not anything a little patience can't work out.  You'll want to hang this when storing and not leave it in a puddle.  The links are smooth, polished, tight, and well constructed.  The color is a darker grey than the photo.  This won't pass for a silver necklace and the color is closer to a darker steel.<br /><br />Since I ran electrical current through this necklace, I can tell you some science-y things about it.  This alloy is pretty consistently even throughout the chain.  No high or low concentrations of material.  This is an indicator of good workmanship and let's us know that the strength (and any other properties) of the necklace will be consistent throughout the chain.  At 125V the anodized color was a light blue/green - I would say about equivalent to 40V color on pure titanium.  There was some heavy bubbling and I could only anodize about 2 inches of chain at a time, so I would guess the titanium content is higher than 50% (because you can't label a chain &#34;titanium&#34; if it isn't a majority component of the alloy) but not a lot higher.  My guess is steel is the second highest component of the alloy.<br /><br />The clasp is not titanium at all.  From the reaction in the current bath, I would guess stainless steel.<br /><br />Overall a very nice necklace that could absolutely suit someone who isn't planning to make a gold colored necklace. :)"
4.0,"Formless dress flattering. Who knew! Loose at stomach. Yay<br />Material super synthetic and shiny but stretch bounces back into shape.  I ordered a S and am 5'3"" 160 lbs."
4.0,Its really cute and it feel good on your skin but the material is too hot for it to be a swimsuit cover.
4.0,Perfect! Only downfall is the white is a little bit see through.
4.0,Used for Halloween Costume of Sadness from Inside Out!
4.0,"This is really cute and really comfortable. Nice material, length, and overall fit.<br />Please note, the color will bleed until you wash it."
4.0,"What attracted me about these sunglasses was the turtoise-shell color, which is true to the pictures online. The frames fit me comfortably: note that I have a small head so judge accordingly. The integrated plastic nosepads are comfortable for my nose and face, and the length of the side pieces is right for me.  They come well-packed and include a microfiber cleaning cloth for the glasses, a tiny screwdriver (a nice touch because the hinges are metal, not plastic), and a microfiber bag.  They are fine and fun for the price."
4.0,"Great bright white color and washes well.  But, the collar does that creep up thing so I can only wear it with sweaters.  Fortunately, that is why I bought it!"
4.0,"I bought this for a comfortable, but stylish, travel outfit.  I have about 24 hours of flights and layovers coming up in the next 2 weeks, and I didn't want to wear something that was binding... but I also didn't want to wear something that looked sloppy (like pajamas).<br /><br />I was hesitant to grab this Allegra K Romper, because the reviews were mixed.  I'm glad I went through with the purchase tho!<br /><br />Yes, the fit is a little loose.  If you don't like the look of a loosely tucked in shirt, this isn't for you.  However, the shorts fit perfectly, and the fabric is surprisingly soft.  I could have probably gone one size smaller and still been comfortable (I purchased a size large, and I'm 5'3&#34; wear a size 10 and a 36DDD bra)... But this is so comfortable that I'm just going to keep the size I originally ordered in.  The pockets are convenient, the cut is very relaxed, and it allows for a great range of motion (something a lot of other rompers don't allow).<br /><br />It's supposed to hang loose in front of you.  Even the model in the picture is wearing it loose.  So if you're looking for something that has a more &#34;fitted&#34; cut, this probably won't be the best choice.<br /><br />It sits well on my shoulders, the sleeves make your arms look great, and the scoop is a bit lower than I expected, revealing a healthy amount of d√©colletage.  I love the studs on the shoulders‚Äìit's a very cute and oddly feminine detail.  The zipper is pretty good quality and easy to use by yourself.<br /><br />I highly recommend only washing it on delicate and letting it air dry.  Because of how light the fabric is, I would venture to guess that the studs will easily separate from the romper.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, is because the sizing isn't 100% accurate or easy to choose from.  Otherwise, for $16, this is seriously a fantastic deal for a casual and comfortable wardrobe piece.  I plan on wearing this through all of my heavy travels in Europe this summer."
4.0,This bracelet is quite lovely. I gave it as a gift. I was a little nervous about the gems being loose but they were secure. The clasp was very secure.
4.0,Although this is a lovely necklace the chains tangle easily and the knots time a lot of time to undo.
4.0,"These gloves are made from a beautifully supple leather with a soft and warm Thinsulate lining. They're just what I need for a cold winter. They come in a range of sizes, so it's easy to get a proper fit. The only reason I didn't add the 5th star is that the fingers are too long. It won't keep me from wearing the gloves, but it does present a problem if I want to pick up something small without removing my gloves."
4.0,"Super cute, comfortable heel, but they gave me a blister on both big toes; the plastic felt like it was cutting. I must find how to cushion the strap other wise they are to be work for very short periods"
4.0,I'm a large girl so I know these weren't ment for me the bottoms fit great the top how ever is quite large so much so it covers my he and. Other wise there really great. There comfy and wash well.
4.0,"The look very nice. The only issue I have is they are hard to cuff on ear. If I don't get them tight enough, they twist and hang on my ears."
4.0,These masks are perfect for small children. They loved them! I ordered 2 packs and only one mask was not finished. Would defiantly recommend for children around 4-6 years.
4.0,"I wanted a slim RFID pocket wallet for my front pants, and this fits. It's larger than I prefer, but you get used to it. There is no packaging information that what I have is actually RFID, and no instructions, no guarantee information, and that was disappointing. I think it could be a bit smaller, but it'll do."
4.0,"i bought a size bigger so i could wear, a warm glove incert or a metal mesh incert butchers gloves.<br />  so anyone with a problem, these days i might be able to take a sharp object from them. and leave them with a surprized look on their face.<br />  that is why i bought, these gloves. and i have metal mesh butchers gloves inside them  no joke."
4.0,Good to keep in second car.
4.0,Great suit! Fits well and flatters.
4.0,Bought for my husband but he has not tried them yet!  Hope they meet expectations. They come in a beautiful case!
4.0,A christmas gift have not opened yet.
4.0,It came as expected
4.0,Would likevmore abdominal support. Ala in all good
4.0,So surprised how good these leggings feel.  They are very shaping without being too tight.  This is a rating of 4 only because I prefer the high waist band to be the waist  band. These have a smaller elastic at the top to be the top of the waist band.  In most cases that type of waistband will self twist.  The leggings themselves are outstanding. Still surprised at the price of 9.99. My best Amazon discovery!!!!!
4.0,Pretty earrings that were a lot smaller than they looked in the photo. Great for young girls.
4.0,"Fit is good, but the color came off the leather rather quickly"
4.0,"Very nice just hard to close since the part that screws on is on the back but most plugs are this way, just a few I've seen close through the front part ."
4.0,"My husband really liked these even though they didnt fit as the picture His shoe size is an 11, these were a little shorter than the pic and the heel line was shorter than his heel, but he says, &#34;they work&#34;. A little thicker but thats nice for buffalo winters."
4.0,I am an XL but I read that it runs big and the large fit me but I will need to wear tank top underneath and spanx as I am a size 14 pants and this dress is somewhat snug but the length is good I am 5'3. I bought this for a beach wedding where I have to wear a peach colored dress. This is not fancy at all and the fabric is breathable and thin I might need a slip as well. I might buy a print in the XL for the price $10 because I think I won't need as many undergarments and may be a little more loose. This color is just very light so somewhat see through.
4.0,"Its a tiny bit shorter than I prefer, but it still covers my belt loops and is still cute. Fit as expected other than the length."
4.0,Comfortable! Light and soft!
4.0,"Very cute dress. Note... the strips of tool are not all pink like in the listing, but rather a mix of pink and white."
4.0,I bought it for my guy and he seems to like them.
4.0,"I bought these earrings as a gift, and the person has fell in love with them. They are very noticeable when your wearing them, they‚Äôre a good size and they flutter."
4.0,little bit tight<br />i am 178cm tall
4.0,"I love this dress. I ordered an XL based on the reviews and had to return it for a L. I am 5'4&#34; 150lbs with 34DD chest, tend to have a large rear. The extra large was way too big across the shoulders. The Large is a little snug across the rear. I am a pretty conservative and will not wear it in public until I've lost about 10 pounds. I bought it for a speech I have to give at work in July. The material is sturdy so the microphone can clip to the collar. It looks professional and I can dress it up with red shoes and accessories for other functions."
4.0,"The tail was nice and thick, especially for the price. I just didn‚Äôt like that the tail only has a loop at the end, so you have to figure a way to attach it. The ears look like the picture."
4.0,"These are very warm, but if you have a cat with a foot fetish like I do, they won't last long.  My cat constantly reaches out and puts his claws on my feet while I am wearing these.  They snag very easily.  My first pair only lasted about a week.<br /><br />My second pair is still around only because I put a tougher sock over them to protect them."
4.0,Zipper and overall material is ok for the price.
4.0,"i'm 4'11"" and thin body size. this is really warm and cute! though wash cold or it'll shrink!"
4.0,Bought this for my granddaughter who is petite.  Ordered the 2T-3T.  Ran large.  The top was like a dress and the bottoms were quite long.  Outfit was adorable and she loved it!
4.0,This is a good quality mask and it has the grinch on it! Kinda hard not to like it.
4.0,material is cheap but it works well
4.0,Looking good for the price
4.0,"So I got this romper today. I haven't had the chance to try it on yet, but it looks amazing! It looks like it would fit. I normally wear a medium but I got a XL bc the comments. It's a little see through. But right now, I have no bad comments! So cute!"
4.0,Very nice with the exception that they added so much sizing it's very stiff.  I know that it will wash out after a while and am looking forward to wearing it more after that happens.
4.0,"These are cute ‚Äúmules‚Äù that can spice-up an outfit.  The heel is about 2.25‚Äù high.  There is a thin rubber sole.  There is a slight bit of padding on the footbed, but not a lot.  Not the most comfortable shoes if you have to stand a lot or walk a lot.  They look to be well made.  Though I don‚Äôt see where they are made, I can only assume China.  The strap on top is a bit ‚Äúhigh‚Äù / ‚Äúloose‚Äù. . . but. . . if you have a ‚Äúthicker‚Äù foot, then they will work."
4.0,"nice dress.  just took a long, long time to arrive"
4.0,Cute for a night out on the town.
4.0,Reasonable price. Fit well. Look like Melania's.
4.0,"I was drooling over these shoes online so I had to buy them. Got them and I was drooling even more. Shouldn't have because as soon as I put these babies on, I fell on my bum. They have absolutely ZERO grips. so either it was  I keep sliding my way around or just spend a few bucks and add grips to a pretty decent shoe.<br /><br />It fits true to size, no pinching between my toes , so overall good shoe , good price"
4.0,"Tried it on in its wrinkled, just-out-of-package state and it still looked good. It was too long in the back for my taste so I cut and hemmed it to match the front. I am 5 ft. tall and a hefty 151 lbs (after a SUPER salty CORNED BEEF weekend feast) and it covered all my imperfections while still achieving a flattering look. On me, the sleeves came right to the wrist. Plan on ironing the blouse today for a better inspection but so far I am satisfied."
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet! Arrived as promised and described. A bit tight on my wrist, but got many compliments when I wore it! I bought one for my friend for Christmas. I'm sure she'll love it!"
4.0,MY GIRLFRIEND LOVED IT
4.0,"quality top grain leather with good color and solid hardware. the second strap keeper is too large, so it doesn't always do the best job but I'm sure it's not like this for every strap. I would buy again."
4.0,"Beautiful watch, nicely finished with no flaws. I had to deduct one star as the nice gift box was taped across the top and sides and not usable. The watch however keeps perfect time and easy to set by pulling the stem upward and pushing the smaller button in the stem releases the spring loaded cover."
4.0,Good sweatshirt and value. Does run a little large but that is ok.
4.0,me quedo demasiado ajustado.
4.0,Nice Design
4.0,I'm completely satisfied
4.0,Beautiful but smaller than expected.
4.0,"The small is a bit too big for a woman with small hands, but still usable (though clumsy) for<br />taking the dog for long walks. However, my fingers were getting cold when it was in the 30s *if* it was a damp day. A non-damp day, they did a pretty good job into the 20s."
4.0,looks  better  on the  picture. nice dress if you have  nice figure.
4.0,"The material is hard plastic with a matte feel to it. It's light and even though it's a little big on my one-year-old child, it does not fall off. We don't really use it that much becauseshe tends to take it off but so far I have no complaints regarding durability nor fit. However, it has become discolored and I take really good care of it. I only put it in the case it came with and it has not been scratched in any way so I'm a little disappointed in that, hence the 4 stars but otherwise we really like it!"
4.0,I like it. It is fun looking and still very functional for my needs.
4.0,A little long but it's as shown
4.0,This is a nice vest and my daughter loves it.
4.0,"Pulled it out of the packaging. No receipt, nothing. Just a blank bag. Opened package. Smells like a warehouse, not strong, just slightly. Has deep pockets. Bottoms are slightly belled out compared to what we used to wear in the ‚Äò90s... and a little shorter than I expected. I stand at 5‚Äô4‚Äù and I‚Äôm a curvy mom-sized 3. I guessed on the size, medium, and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs correct."
4.0,The dress is cute. The sleeves are not meant for anyone with any meat on their arms. They're so tight. It gives me little arm muffin tops. The only reason why I still like the dress is because I'm a seamstress and I was able to loosen and resew the elastic.<br />The pattern is cute and the dress fits great otherwise. I'm glad it wasn't a total loss for me.
4.0,The only thing the husband didn't like was that the nose pieces fall off. We super glued them
4.0,"For what I paid for it, this watch looks nice and works fine.  My only complaint is that the clasp on the back is NOT matching rose gold; it's silver. Not a huge deal,  but also not a classy design move. Glancing at it quickly (I'm a teacher) I also wish the minute and second hands looked more different. But I'm satisfied for the price."
4.0,"This is a very cute purse.  The vegan leather does not look cheap or plastic, the tan color is attractive .  It will hold the basics (cash, change, a few cards, lip gloss, my phone, & my keys).  My only complaint is that the zipper sticks a little bit.  Overall I would say this is a great wristlet and at a nice price."
4.0,"Was larger then I'm used to wearing, but still nice. It was also worth paying only about two dollars instead of fifty or sixty."
4.0,"Beautiful, but had to return. Runs small"
4.0,"Awesome glasses but it looks a little fragile, especially the noise piece."
4.0,"The fit is ok, true to dimensions.  The material this is made from is not breathable at all, and when i put on these leg warmers, they feel like a plastic bag wrapped around my legs.  my legs get warm in them."
4.0,"I like the pin, but it is so small."
4.0,Very comfortable material with overall great fit.  Disappointed that when I took the shorts out of the package I noticed that the decorative seam in the bottom front of the leg was coming apart.  I'd like the seller to contact me regarding this as I'm concerned the seam will continue to unravel
4.0,Pretty. This will be a gift for a teen.
4.0,Looks too tight on the bottom if you have long legs.
4.0,"I listened to all of the reviews and sizes up to a large and it was so big and frumpy. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 140lbs. The smell of the material was also awful. I‚Äôm debating on trying for a smaller size. Will update if so!"
4.0,"I think I should have ordered one size down (my fault, not the seller's).  I found the smaller size at my local Costco, and it fit better. Although the suit is very nice, it doesn't provide much support for a large bust (I am a D cup size) and looks &#34;floppy&#34; on the side where the wrap goes under the bust. (For me this is true for both the larger and smaller suits.) Women with cup sizes smaller than a D may love this suit - it is constructed very well, is made of nice, sturdy material, and is very comfortable."
4.0,Nice sweater so far. Good price and seems to fit well.
4.0,A bit short! Great sleeve.
4.0,This dress fit well. The colour is vibrant against the black. Comfortable to wear. I bought this dress in black and red.
4.0,Cute sweatshirt. Ran way too small
4.0,"Pretty, I needed more room in bust area. Had to return"
4.0,"These fit really well, true to size. The fabric is really soft and stretchy, the waistband is wide and really soft as well. The only downside is that they tend to ride up derriere."
4.0,They seemed to run a bit small compared to other swim trunks I have that are the same size
4.0,"It is pretty? Absolutely.  The chain is one of those kind that a stiff wind will put kinks in so I do not hold out a lot of hope that it will be long lasting.  However, I still would have given it a 5 star because just look at it....of course it is going to be fragile.  The holder for the fitbit however is not flimsy and will hold your tracker securely.  The star off is totally due to the lack of directions on how to open it.  I had to come back to the Amazon site and read it from other reviewers."
4.0,"AWESOME, FABULOUS!!!!  the only reason I don't give it a 5th star is that the front could use a thin layer of lining to make it perfect."
4.0,Needed an emergency Halloween outfit for my son and this was affordable and arrived quick. It was a little too large for him but it looked good in his photos.
4.0,The snowman was a hit at the church Christmas party. This would‚Äôve been a five star review had the head of this costume fit better.
4.0,Love this shirt but size runs small. 2 X fits like 0x or extra large.
4.0,Fits ok. Adjustable.  Does slide sometimes.  The attachments are plastic.  Looks cheap.
4.0,fit perfect for a large.  Not to small but not to big either.
4.0,I am really happy with this shoulder bag. Love the color. Has plenty of pockets so that I can fit everything and the zippers seem to be really sturdy so they should hold up to constant use. Would definitely buy another one of these.
4.0,"Love this skirt. My only complain is that it runs small, so size up. I ordered Small, I would be happier with a Medium."
4.0,"Fits WAY small.  I ordered one size large, but wish I had ordered two sizes larger."
4.0,Size fit just right
4.0,Love the wider band it doesn't roll up on me
4.0,I used this cap for work to cover my hair it is light weight.
4.0,Nice  item
4.0,better be a body builder these things are strong
4.0,The band was above my expectation but the snap is very flimsy and I fear will break soon.
4.0,I bought a bunch of different patterns and this was the only one that ran small.
4.0,I bought it for my brother in law. He too is into watches like me. This is a very beautiful and decent watch for its price. He loved it and wears it everyday.
4.0,Pretty and lightweight.
4.0,"I've never worn a watch like this. I'm more into smaller ones than huge monsters like this. But I really like it.<br /><br />It even passed the ""wife"" test. I put it on and showed it to her. She said it looked really sporty and she liked it a lot.<br /><br />So far, my only problem is that I ordered a SKMEI and was sent a YFWOOD. My understanding is, they are the same company. It was just that it wasn't what they advertised, so I removed a star.<br /><br />Still a fun watch."
4.0,Super cute...pants was tight at the waist tho.. he is a skinny 5year old and I ordered 5T..
4.0,"Received this on time as expected. Material is really thin, see through, an not much shape to it.  It's very lightweight. I will have to wear a tshirt or cami under it. It's ok and I'll use it but I expected more shape and thicker material."
4.0,"Comfortable, nice."
4.0,"Good basic shape wear fit. A bit snug going over the hips, but once in place it is comfortable. No muss, or fuss; the way I prefer it."
4.0,"I thought the value was great, but too many earrings for one person"
4.0,"The black was looser than expected. The navy and slate were as expected. However, all three fit differently. Ordered size large."
4.0,"Good gloves, need to order at least 1 size larger, they draw up when washed."
4.0,I needed the longer band for my wrist.
4.0,I'm a very plus size woman and I really could have sized down maybe 2 sizes. But it's super cute!!
4.0,Fun costume accessories
4.0,These are cute pair of earrings. well made. Stones have not fallen off. My skin did not get any sort of allergic reaction yet. And it goes well with any kind of outfit.
4.0,Good product.  I suggest ordering a half size down
4.0,It was a gift and the recipient liked it.
4.0,Love the sunglasses! Comfortable. Bought in bulk for party favors. Did not give 5 stars only because a handful came with scratches or blemishes.
4.0,"They‚Äôre cute! Bought these for work, they‚Äôre comfortable too but definitely NOT non slip."
4.0,Very good quality. Surprisingly comfy. Looks just like photo.
4.0,Good sandal for shower rooms/pool areas. Fit just a little bit smaller than expected.
4.0,"I ordered green and it was not green.  It was blue.  Blue was not offered as a color.  I ordered up a size as everyone recommended and found it to be large.  I probably could have used my normal Med size.  The sizing seems to be all over the map from the comments I've read.  Glad I ordered it, thought as it really is quite lovely."
4.0,"They are comfortable and well-made. I live in Arizona and more layers mean more heat, but the covers breathe really well. I wish they had a thumb hole, however, overall no complaints."
4.0,"The neck is a bit wide for my taste, as a T-Shirt underneath shows more than just a collar.<br />The quality is good, I love the pattern and the colors. Washes and dries normally, without shinking. Just the neck is to wide."
4.0,I do wish the brim had a little stiffness to it.  It is always falling down into my babies eyes and she can't see anything.  But it is a very cute hat.
4.0,Love the color but I am tall so a little short in me but otherwise great.
4.0,"I was expecting these to look cheap, but they actually look really nice! and the white dangle part is removable which is great too in case you want to make less of a statement"
4.0,"Just what I was looking for, and as expected, good value, love them, fit very well as others said"
4.0,Seller claims this was manufactured in Italy the original Kirkland pants were manufactured in Italy however these were remanufactures in Mexico would‚Äôve been nice to have the Italian But it‚Äôs Hardly discernible in the quality
4.0,"This dress is cute, but it is very short. I am 5'3 and I have to wear leggings underneath it to be able to go out in public. More of a tunic than a dress. But super cute and comfortable."
4.0,"I usually wear a size 8 in every brand of shoes. I ordered a size 8.5 because of the reviews about these running smaller. I am glad I went up a half size. The fit is perfect . I wore them for 3 hours out of the box and thought they were comfortable , no rubbing on the heels or sides. My socks were a medium weight, but I think a thinner sock will be fine with these too.  I read a review about these shoes being fake. I don't know about that. I do know they look good, feel good and I am happy with them."
4.0,My wife was pleased with it.
4.0,"I,wish the seller would make it with a stronger band..."
4.0,I contemplated in contemplating on whether I should order this dress or not based on the reviews because I love the color and the look so much I went ahead and ordered it it does run a little large. I saw the reviews showing how it came with stains or holes or from China I can sell you mine did not come from China it shipped and I got it within 2 days is absolutely beautiful now I haven't washed it yet I bought it for a wedding. I will give my height and weight that way people can figure out what they think because the reviews that don't give their height and weight and sizes of the dress they ordered are not helpful. I am 5 foot exactly I weigh about 170 I ordered the large dress in pink I absolutely love it but I will give another review Once I wear it and wash it to see how durable it is that is the only thing I'm concerned about the lease is very thin and don't know how long it will last but for only $23 it will be great as long as I can get to where it's at that wedding or my son my five-year-old son the graduation it's absolutely beautiful for the price
4.0,This belt meets my needs. I can wear it with dresses and slacks. It's a good belt for work clothes.
4.0,"The blazer was too big & 2 buttons fell off. No lining, which I prefer.  I just made the repairs.<br />It‚Äôs a beautiful set."
4.0,"This ring is everything you want. Blingy and heavy, it immediately made my father-in-law jealous to behold it. I only docked a star because it's their only ring that's not prime eligible and it cost me an extra $11. But shipping was pretty fast. Highly recommend!"
4.0,It looks very cute on!
4.0,"1.  The real deal, GI issue<br />2.  Does the job - totally waterproof and windproof, and very lightweight and packable<br />3.  Not really a parka, more like a rain shell.  It has no insulating value whatsoever.  Pair this with the ECWCS fleece or the M-65 liner and you're in business<br />4.  There are no, zero, nada, nil pockets (lost a star for that), not even a shoulder or breast pocket.  There are two zippered openings for ventilation and to allow access to whatever you're wearing on the inside.<br />5.  Even without the pockets, it's an excellent piece of kit."
4.0,"7-1/4 "" head size was too small - even with adjustment strap all out.<br />It looks great on my wife!<br />Manufacturer should look at Roth Co's size range for this type of cap and adjust their product accordingly - to expand its marketing opportunity."
4.0,"It depends if you have a stomach, you might not want this dress because it make it look bigger. Thanks Amazon"
4.0,Its a little thick and I wish it had more card slots. It does look great and feels like its built to last.
4.0,Fits good! Good deal for the price!
4.0,I like that it fits and hides my belly. It runs just a little large but it works and looks great on.
4.0,"This is a beautiful boot, but it's just not the right cut for my foot."
4.0,This nightgown is very true to the color in the picture. It was a little shorter than I expected. I also ordered my true size and it fit. It‚Äôs also comfortable and soft.
4.0,Pink floral prairie dress was too big for me. (I‚Äôm 115 lbs and 5ft 3in) I purchased a medium. I think a small or even extra small would‚Äôve been better. The quality is great though!
4.0,"Really like this dress. It is a little too long for me, I am 5'4 and I did where 2.5&#34; heels with it and it still dragged the ground. However it is very comfortable, cool and flows nicely."
4.0,It is just as pictured. It's cool for a chick (when put on a cooler chain). It would be a bit girly for a dude to wear this charm necklace.  He'd appear to be whipped.
4.0,Small and pretty
4.0,"I like the skirt, but I'm giving it 4 stars because there's no lining and the white is pretty thin and see through. I'm 5'4&#34; 34-27-34 and I ordered a large. The skirt hits right above my knee and fits perfectly. It doesn't ride up."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:2175e739f481f0ad3a3a25e699ccd395]] This outfit is a whole new level of hot. From the front it's just a short blue mesh mini dress....and then you turn around and it's ridiculous how sexy this is!<br /><br />As I said the front is a see through blue mesh material and that's pretty hot, but it's really the back of this outfit that makes it stand out.  It has these two triangular pieces in the middle that connect the straps on the back together for a really sexy look.<br /><br />The one thing is that while this says one size, it will definitely work better on smaller frames. I'm a size 12 with a fairly large chest and this was more of a mini shirt on me than a mini dress. I was able to wear it and my husband was a fan, but I think I would love it if I were smaller frames. Overall, it is a super-hot outfit, just be aware it is smaller, which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,"Nice quality shirt, great design, sizing does seem to be a bit small though. Ordered a large and fits closer to a medium."
4.0,"Kind of thick for summer wear, but breathable. Ear straps don't have any elasticity to them, but they fit me fine you might have to use the straps that come with them if not. Wish they had adjustable nose wire so I could use them for work, but they work fine for every day use."
4.0,"Nice fit, comfort. I wore the socks to work for 12 hour shift. Fantastic feeling on my feet"
4.0,"I like this swim bottom, but the leg openings are small."
4.0,"I love how good this looks on me. The red is a nice, dark wine color with navy trim. I went a size down because it seems I was between their sizes. I typically wear Large &#34;normal&#34; shirts and XL women's cut shirts; my 38Ds fit a little snug in the Large top but a bit small in the XL. I typically wear a size 14 pant (sometimes 12 depending on the brand); the Large bottoms seemed to fit better than the XL. It would be nice if you could order different sizing for top and bottom, but I can't complain because it's an excellent price for both pieces together."
4.0,"I was looking to replace some of my exercise shirts, these more or less fit the bill. Tiny bit smaller / tighter than what I personally like, but not enough to be a deal breaker. All in all, I would order again, just up one size."
4.0,Got on a sweet deal.
4.0,"Suit seems just a tiny bit small but it works.  Delivery was prompt, which was appreciated.  My daughter loves the unicorns."
4.0,"This product was great!! It was very comfortable!! The only downside was that the lenses did fog up a lot so I didn‚Äôt wear it for very long, but it‚Äôs great!!!"
4.0,they fit ok... but they aren't comfortable all day- I ended up buying red wings and am much happier...
4.0,I love this top smaller chested girls size down.
4.0,Does not have a long enough pin in the back to be a tie tack
4.0,insurance card needed trimming
4.0,arrived the other day...works with my pendant.  Thank you!
4.0,"Not made especially well, but it‚Äôs a beautiful dress and close to what I‚Äôd been looking for for my elopement. I had a seamstress tailor it to me, line the entire top, and re-do the crooked seams and buttons. It turned out perfectly by the time she was done with it. So for less than $30 it was still worth it to me. I felt beautiful wearing it for my wedding and received several compliments on it."
4.0,Super cute and looks better than the picture. Only negative was the part that goes on my finger was slightly warped. But not to the extend that it was uncomfortable
4.0,"I love that they are made in the USA. They fit as expected and appear to be of good quality. They are a little bumpy feeling when I have shoes on, but really okay. And they are SO fun to wear!"
4.0,"Looks great, with fantastic workmanship.  However runs a little small.  I ordered a half size bigger than I usually need and it was still too small.  My suggestion, order it a little big then when you get it decide what finger to wear it on."
4.0,I like the color the pockets are good I am a size 16 and round so it shows the lumps somewhat I will wear a fitted slip under it
4.0,"I like the quality of these Jeans - they are rather on the tight side, but the material is definitely stretching. The sizing of the jeans is right in my case. I just wish they would not have the really worn out look as in the picture - where most of the front area above the knees is almost white. It looks even whiter than the Amazon pictures. If you are OK with this, then the jeans are a good deal compared to other brands."
4.0,"I received this item a couple weeks ago, and pretty much love it. I did notice that wearing it for long periods of time can be extremely uncomfortable, but that's with most earrings. Another thing is that i noticed the color coming off, not a big deal because only i can see that but still, cheap paint job. Other than that i love it and have received so many compliments on it."
4.0,"still have not used, but converted to match with buttons on pants.<br />Wish was all with buttons, not hybred with clips, would look better."
4.0,Pretty and easy to match to your wardrobe. Love supporting the cause.
4.0,"So far, so good!  I'm hoping that the gold stays because I often have trouble with non-gold earrings.  They are cute -- good size!"
4.0,"I got a small, and I have tone/athletic arms, and I didn't feel constricted at all. The arm length was also comfortable."
4.0,"Decent, but there is very little stretch to the material. The fabric honestly doesn't seem like it will last for long. There were already a few threads loose. You get what you pay for I suppose."
4.0,the grip is coming off on one sock the more I do yoga. But they're cute & I would order again. I like the grip & look of them.
4.0,"Adorable, great detail."
4.0,"I love the shirt, I used it for a promotional dance photoshoot. The straps were way to long so I had to shorten them by sewing them into the back, to give my boobs support other than that... LOVE THE SHIRT"
4.0,"I was expecting these pants to fit me either a little too long or too tight. I am 5'1 142 lbs and have wide hips and a big bottom. But I went with my usual size of 10 and they fit great on the legs too. They are tiny bit tight on the waist but will loosen with time/weight loss. My only complaint if you can call it that, is I am short so these are somewhat long on me. I can hem them myself though. Which is why I hope they offer different hems. More colors would be great too!"
4.0,It came a day after the guaranteed day for amazon prime and a few of them run on the elastic already.
4.0,"Too cute. Zipper at bottom for easy diaper change. A little smaller then I would have liked but stretchy and both my son and I love it!!!! He calls it his big, bad bunny pj. Would recommend but go a size up"
4.0,"The item was much too small!!! However, it was a very pretty piece!!! I initiated a return but then tried the XL shirt on my 9yr old daughter and it fit her perfectly, so I cancelled my return. But beware of sizing!!!"
4.0,A little thin but it fits perfect and is soft. My 4 year old loves it !
4.0,"It is a very thick nato. It feels super durable. The only downside is since it is thick, it takes some time to break in. Don‚Äôt get if you like a thin flexible nato. Get if you like a thick sturdy feeling one."
4.0,I love this bag. It is big and can hold all my stuff. I hate the smell though but I guess it will go away over time.
4.0,Product is long and the perfect brown. It is tee shirt material.
4.0,"I LOVE this bag!  It is gorgeous!<br />It is perfect for a night on the town, with plenty of room for a modern (huge) phone, hairbrush, makeup, whatever; and still stylishly small.<br /><br />I love that it comes with TWO hanging options:<br />- A very sturdy silver chain, and<br />- A beautiful pearl adorned short leather strap<br /><br />I wouldn't put too much weight in the purse when using the short strap, as the pearls appear to be attached with only one thin wire.  Eeek.<br />This is a gorgeous purse and I hate that they chintzed out with the insufficient pearls attachment.<br />I'm still going to use the short strap though, and pray that it holds up.üôè<br />If it breaks I will just re-string those pearls and keep using it.<br /><br />The silver chain clasps are a little under-sized for the receiving loops on the purse; but definitely do-able!<br />It is nicely lined, and there is an inner pocket; good for emergency money, chapstick or feminine protection.<br /><br />The price at time of review is under $12, and an extremely good deal in my opinion, especially considering you get two wearing options with that.<br /><br />Great evening purse at a great price, I love it!"
4.0,"I had to buy a little bit of fabric to add to the section at the breast because it is see-through. Once I added that fabric, the dress was nice. It is well made for the price."
4.0,"Fits really nice. I am 5'2, 159 lbs and ordered a large."
4.0,So I am 5‚Äò8‚Äú and the shirt is a little bit short for me in length as well as sleeves. I do wear it so I give it credit for that. It is best worn with the sleeves pulled up to the elbows. With an undershirt just because it is short
4.0,Nice for the kids while ice skating
4.0,"Perfect shoe - color, fit, etc."
4.0,"It's hard to say this item fits as expected, or somewhat small, or somewhat large, because all three apply. First, the drape on this cardigan is very nice. The material is soft and comfortable. However, the cut through the upper arms is a bit restricting and is not what I expected. Additionally, the length of the sleeves go past my hand. I normally have a problem with sleeve length -- usually sleeves run short on me. I don't think the sleeves are cut proportionately on these cardigans, so be aware of that. I decided it doesn't bother me too much and will be keeping. I ordered the black, dark gray and heathernavy. All three shades represent well online."
4.0,Go quality and very comfortable.
4.0,"If the latch holds and I do not loose my watch which cost 20 times more than this band I will be happy. If it holds, it will do the job since it does look nice and well made and does not distract from my vintage watch."
4.0,Beautiful piece. Bought for a Coraline cosplay and sadly had to return as it was too big. I did not think the pin was going to be as large as it was. Still beautiful nonetheless.
4.0,"It‚Äôs adorable, but the patterns are random, so I ended up with a duplicate design that was not so cute (drooling design). It is very thick and warm. Not so very comfortable on warm days. There is no nose clip, so you can‚Äôt form it to the bridge of your nose. It feels like wearing a sock on my face."
4.0,Hangs nicely. The pleats are well done. It did have a seam that was coming apart a bit on the shoulder but it wasn't a deal breaker. I just shored it up with some thread(and I'm no seamstress!). And it's a pretty blue/purple/gray color.
4.0,Nice kid ‚è∞
4.0,"I reeeeally liked this ooots, but had to return for a bigger size, they run small"
4.0,I bought this suit and have worn it about 5 times it fits perfectly and every time I have used it the camo blends in white well
4.0,"Wish it came in half sizes, lost 1 because it was too loose."
4.0,"Love these! The flares are a bit small at the ends, so sometimes they fall out in my sleep, but other than that, they are gorgeous and very comfortable to put in and take out"
4.0,Fabric is great weight and softness. Very comfortable.
4.0,"This maxi is as comfortable as wearing a t-shirt. The fabric is lightweight and stretchy. The empire waist can be accentuated with a thin belt. The pockets are fairly deep. The fit is true to size. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,But I'd LOVE it if the arms were just a tad larger.  Very snug.
4.0,Me and my friends dressed up as gold diggers for Halloween. This went great with a skirt and Money chains. It fit true to size and was comfy. I have not wore it since. I would by again for a costume!
4.0,"(Pardon the red ear, I had to wrestle to get my starter earring out) I bought these specifically because of the reviews saying they were a bit small. They work very nicely on an auricle piercing! It's hard to find cuffs that don't droop when the piercing is so close to the edge. It's not perfect, but if it was, I might not even be able to get it on! And I'm pretty sure this is as close as I'll get to finding one that ""defies gravity."" I'm very happy with this purchase.<br />Edit: I ended up getting a nasty skin reaction to these with hard bumps and flaking. I'm not sure if it was the metal itself or if my piercings hadn't healed enough or both."
4.0,"Whether you like the cold or not, this sweatshirt will keep you warm and comfortable. My husband is on blood thinners and is always cold.  This is the sweatshirt is nicely made and worth the money!"
4.0,The black kittie necklace is very cute. I know my neice would wearing this necklace. She will feel really pretty wearing it.
4.0,unfortunately i had to return them because they were al least a half size too large. but they were well constructed with multiple layers of support
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:139c2b0514860b2c13c44ad20cafff20]] Wore it for a neon themed night out for a friend‚Äôs birthday and got tons of compliments! It fit perfectly at the waist but the top was a bit snug, but overall it looked stunning! The fabric is a bit scratchy but the outfit had no issues when dancing and moving around. Loved it for a one night wear!"
4.0,It seemed very well constructed the only issue was that it took over a month to arrive.
4.0,"Had to get an extender because it was a bit short but other than that, very cute!"
4.0,"Very pretty, but definitely not made for girls with a larger chest, so I sent it back. Beautiful print, though."
4.0,I liked the idea of this dress being reversible but it just didn‚Äôt work for me.  Maybe my boobs are too large for a medium dress?
4.0,"This striped, floppy paper straw hat is light and airy. While it doesn't have a wide brim, it does offer some sun protection.  It also has an urban casual look - the black stripes/coloring makes it a bit unusual."
4.0,"This is a very lightweight scarf with beautiful and vibrant colors.  I can't imagine anyone receiving this as a gift and not being impressed with the beauty.  The edges are rolled, so there is a faded look on the rear side of the scarf, which is why I pulled this down to a 4 rating.  However, with proper folding you can keep this hidden and I am sure the scarf will draw attention.  Beautiful color!"
4.0,"I have enjoyed wearing this skirt for walking in town, hiking, and while standup paddleboarding. Wish it had pockets."
4.0,The overall fit is good however the arms are very tight.
4.0,Size is great 170lb and 5'1 tall. Dress meets at the knee. The dress is way cuter in the picture. Material is great the stitching in the front could be better.  For the price it's so so.
4.0,"Way to small for my head, but my wife loves it!"
4.0,"Wore this on a vacation with some friends. The bottoms fit and shaped like a dream, but the top was just a little too small in the cup area but still worked for me. If you have a larger bust I would suggest trying something else, or having a back up plan for your top."
4.0,Beautiful love them!
4.0,I gave it to my mother who loves jewelry of any kind.  I did not care for the gold color.  Looks kind of cheap.
4.0,"If you are a 36 order 38, otherwise awesom"
4.0,One ear ring slightly bent. Easy fix though. Love how they look.
4.0,Smaller than my others in the same size. Cute pattern though.
4.0,"Wonderful robe.  Description is very accurate.  Cute, soft and cuddly. I generally wear a size 10 and the perfect size of this robe would probably be between the two offered but I elected the small as I didn't want it too big.  It fits well but the hood is heavy enough that it pulls the top back a bit and I believe I will add a hook and eye to the upper front so that it stays in place a bit better. Robe is so cute that you don't need to be embarrassed if accidentally seen by someone!!"
4.0,"For the size I expected a bit tighter of a fit and a bit more stretch in the material. I am a tiny person and sizes are subjective, but I think this is on the large side of small."
4.0,"Super cute, it's my daughter's favorite. I would say it's kind of thin, but still does the job ."
4.0,"el collar es muy lindo, luce muy bien y da la apariecia esperada<br />sin embargo no funciona bien. hasta elk moemnto no he podido cambiarle la hora y ajustarsela a la hora real"
4.0,"I do like  it, but to me the inside color should be of a more matching color."
4.0,Much smaller than I expected. Very tiny bows and the stone is more pinky than reddish. Sweet though and I will keep them.
4.0,The is a beautiful and meaningful necklace my sister loved it.
4.0,I received this birthstone and it was everything I expected. Great buy for the money and fits my Pandora bracelet.
4.0,"It was a bit thin and shrunk a little when washed, but not enough to not fit anymore."
4.0,They are hard to fit on regular glasses as well as reading glasses. My doctors advised I get some to cut out blue rays emitted from TV and computers near bedtime.
4.0,Runs a little  too small gave it to my sister
4.0,Fits my watch but is short for my wrist.
4.0,Somehat small and tend to cause swollen ankles
4.0,This blouse for the price was a surprise. Great fit good quality. Ordered 3 more colors.
4.0,"The size is great. But the quality, even with 925 sterling stamp visible is not highest quality of silver but to be expected with price."
4.0,"Great material,  Jetlag quality, end of season pricing,  fair value."
4.0,Fit a little small which I expected from other reviews. Order a half size up like I did and they'll fit. Decent quality for the price. You definitely need to wear them a bit to break them in.
4.0,"Despite being 5'8"", I ordered an extra large size because I prefer that my cycling clothes not be overly tight. These bib shorts just barely fit, but are surprisingly comfortable.  The chamois is far more comfortable than one would imagine from an initial examination - and that is the most critical aspect of cycling shorts, of course."
4.0,I'd order a size up so you won't have the cone look
4.0,"well made.  just a little too small to fit my wallet.  If it had a wallet or pockets to hold what would be in a wallet, I wouldn't haven given away to my granddaughter"
4.0,I have super tiny wrists and this band does fit and looks nice. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs user error but the clasp randomly opens :/. I have to keep an eye on it. If there is a suggestion for this I‚Äôm all ears because I really do like the way it looks
4.0,"I love the look of these pants, and the colors.  I also really love the length.  The waist is a bit tight but I am hoping it might stretch just a little bit.  I am very happy that these pants have pockets.  Very soft material and comfortable.  You can roll up the legs or leave them down.  Cute pants."
4.0,"very cute, but very small. order a size up. expect the leg warmers to shed...a lot."
4.0,"These earrings were pretty but a bit heavy for my ears, but then I have thin lobes. Not bad for the price."
4.0,Simple well made fits well. A bit large but chic.
4.0,"The laces are thick and seem durable. They were longer than expected using the eyelet count, I recommend measuring your existing laces  instead."
4.0,"Very short rise. Bend over and......opps! A breeze....... It would be a good look on younger, slimmer women. I had to return and order an extra large which the jacket is still too short and tight. I have to open the waist band on the pants and resew to make the rise longer.<br />They are very comfortable and wash beautifully. I will really like them after I fix them."
4.0,Ease And comfort
4.0,Love the bands only had a week but so far so good they only thing is I ordered a small because that is what size Fitbit band I have and these are just a little smaller which is perfect for me with small wrist
4.0,"Love this dress. Not the highest of quality, but I love the way it looks!"
4.0,"The band works well and unlike other types of watch bands can adjust precisely to fit your wrist. The magnets on each end of the straps hold securely bit allow for adjustment while wearing.<br />The part that secures the band to the watch body (mine is a 42mm apple watch 3) on one strap is perfect.  On the other, it is about a mm too big and sticks out of the watch case.<br />There are no sharp edges and I doubt it will catch on anything, but it doesn‚Äôt look right.<br />This watch band works very well, fits better than any other I own, is priced right, but it has one small flaw."
4.0,"I really wanted to wear these pants for my birthday (gotta stand out!). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and bought a medium. They fit perfect (high waisted, stretchy waistband, not too stiff, real sequins, good quality, but I needed to wear them with heels because they were pretty long which that‚Äôs what I intended to do. I had to return them because there was a pull at the bottom that couldn‚Äôt be fixed (-1 star). I ended up buying something else so I didn‚Äôt repurchase them."
4.0,"I removed the insoles and put in my orthotics and they work great.  My only complaint is they are a little big in the ankle area and heel cup, but the feel so nice on my toes which need lots of space."
4.0,"This is my go to suit for training. It is comfortable and looks a little more flattering than a speedo suit. My only complain is how much it faded, just one the boobs. I expect fading but it would be nice if the fading was a little more uniform. LOL"
4.0,I got this for my 14 year old daughter last year. A lot cheaper to the brand name out there and does the exat same thing. She loves it and it's the perfect size for her.
4.0,"I got the hunter green/white polka dots dress, size L. The color and fit of this dress are great, the only issue I have is that the pockets gape open. I'm not sure why they do that or why it bothers me, but it does. I wish they laid flat.<br /><br />I snagged this dress when the price dropped to $5.61, so I kept it because it was such a deal."
4.0,"Fit perfect, a little loose from shipment. But extremly fast shipping"
4.0,These are comfortable and easy to wear. Real cute.
4.0,It is a nice hat has lok and feel of being worn.
4.0,Nice shoes.  I‚Äôve been wearing them daily for a month.  Not too warm for indoor use.  I wish the tongue was gusseted.  Great value for the price paid.
4.0,It‚Äôs okay. Was a simple gift for a friend that‚Äôs a fan of attack on titan. Rubber and bendy. We will see how the wear and tear lasts.
4.0,It's cute and swingy.  Upper arms were a tad more snug than I expected.
4.0,Shipped right away. Packaged correctly. The items are a little snug. I'm a woman not a teenager.
4.0,"These booties are very cute. They run a little small so order 1/2 size larger. I did not have any issues with ""smell"". I am exchanging them for a larger size because they are so cute and comfortable!"
4.0,"I bought these to wear under scrubs and hesitated once I saw them and felt the material.  The hesitation was not needed.  They look small, but, fit great- especially when tucked into the scrub bottoms.  Seem like a good fit for anyone that might sweat while working- or working out."
4.0,"Beautiful concept, just a little stiff."
4.0,Got this purse on Monday ... the handle broke on Thursday! Such a disappointment too. Otherwise the purse is really cute! I was so happy with it until it broke! :(<br /><br />UPDATE: ZENTEII  offered to replace my purse. They said it would take about 6 weeks for shipping but it arrived much quicker than that. I really like this purse! I get lots of compliments on it. I appreciate how quickly ZENTEII responded to my concerns and that they replaced the purse free of charge!
4.0,I ordered a couple pairs. They are cute and fit nice enough. They are not the softest but will do for autumn. I washed them once and already have pilling of the fabric and holes inside of the pockets. I walk my dog and wear sweats and want the pockets to carry things and now I can't use the one side of the one pair. These should be $10 tops. I ordered a large.
4.0,"These are true to size and look just like the pictures. The one thing I didn't know before ordering is that these jeans are push up capris (i.e. butt shapers/lifters). I'm not really sure what qualifies as butt lifting because there doesn't seem to be anything special or different about the backside other than the stitching curves upwards, but that seems more decorative. It doesn't really matter as I don't have much to lift in the first place, but if I did, I'm sure the butt lifting &#34;feature&#34; would be an added bonus.<br /><br />I ordered these in a 1 and 3 and found both to be very true to size. The cuffed bottom on this is stitched up in place. The bottom of the cuff isn't finished (just surged) so even if they weren't sewn up, you still wouldn't want to unroll them as you'd see that unfinished edge.<br /><br />Out of all the pairs I ordered to try, these fit the best. I'm 110lbs and am 5'7&#34;. I'll return the 3s and keep the other size."
4.0,need several at home
4.0,"This is a lovely ring.  I like that it‚Äôs easily adjusted to wear on any finger I please.  It‚Äôs substantial enough that I‚Äôm not concerned with it weakening from repeated resizing.  My only complaint is that it darkens if I don‚Äôt wear it daily, which I don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs not much of an issue though because it polishes right up with a tissue or paper towel etc..  No silver cleaner or special polishing cloth needed."
4.0,This shirt is running small!
4.0,I could have done without the cannabis leaves symbol.
4.0,I use these for fishing...the polarization is pretty good for the price and they're comfortable. The only complaint I have is that they're kinda small and let a little sunlight through the perphials.
4.0,"These are great hats., especially if you have to be out in the rain or snow<br />I bought one when I was out in Oregon a few years ago, have worn it many times, and it still looks great.<br />Also, when I bought mine, there were several sizes to chose from and I bought the one that fit me best.<br />This hat was for my wife and it is just a bit too small."
4.0,"I ordered this for my husband for valentines day, it arrived on time and it's good quality. He put it on the sizing was spot on. He wears it everyday!"
4.0,It works well as expected. Very handy to have around.
4.0,Great arm protectors.  I would have given a five star but the top part of the sleeve is too large and they keep slipping down.  I really like the back of the hands protection from the sun.  I play golf and my skin has become sun damaged especially on the back of my hands.  I wear one glove on the left however the right hand has had more sun.  After having a keratoacanthoma on my neck I am much more careful with sun/skin exposure.
4.0,"Gloves fit a little on the small for size chart, but they are good work gloves. Forget about the touch sensitivity, mine wore off in no time. I'd buy again, only one size up."
4.0,"I bought these for a trip with 5 to 10 miles of walking a day.  They were fantastic for the trip, but a moth after, the sole was so worn (the upper was fine) that they no longer gripped.  That said, I'd totally buy them again for a nother trip like this.  I know not to expect them to last a year, and that's ok."
4.0,A little bit to Big. I bought this to my Brother and he loves it
4.0,"My wife really liked this piece, and its a terrific deal. There are some minor irregularities, but your not spending $100 here, are you? It looks like a much more expensive necklace."
4.0,I like this shirt a lot
4.0,This is a cute boots but it‚Äôs too big for me so I had to return it.
4.0,This top is absolutely beautiful. It can be use as casual dressing and formal as well. I really love this blouse.
4.0,The mirror
4.0,"I love the way it feels, so light and airy! So many compliments!  Besides it taking FOR-EVER to get here, the only negative thing is that it's dry clean only. I must've missed that in the info."
4.0,Shoe looks well made and is easy to get on and off. It does seem to run a tad large.
4.0,The  product fits just perfect üëå! They can actually pass as a nice pair of shorts! Lol üòÜ!
4.0,This was really cute but just didn‚Äôt look right on me. It was on the larger size so I may order down.
4.0,"I ordered this top when it was a deal of the day.  Ended up going with the lilac color.  It is VERY light lilac, almost looks grayish/pink.  As far as fit, I ordered a large, which is my typical size.  You can see in my photos I have a much bigger chest than the model :-) but otherwise the fit as a little loose is similar to the advertised fit of the top.  The sleeves are longer than I'd like - by a good inch.  The material isn't my favorite, not very breathable, but it IS soft.  I like the pattern.  Love the longer length.  Overall it is a keeper.  I may have given 3.5 starts due to sleeve length and type of fabric but since I had to choose a whole - I think it is worth 4 stars, especially for the cheap price."
4.0,"These booties are very well made and are true to size, but they lack padding and support. You can feel the seams on your feet and achilles tendon.<br /><br />That's not all bad. You can kind of personalize them with your favorite insoles and/or mukluk liners and/or socks. The pine green is as pictured and more versatile than I thought it would be - it's low key enough that it doesn't give the appearance of a shorter leg with jeans, but it still pops a bit with shorts or a skirt.<br /><br />I do recommend waterproofing them."
4.0,"Yes, they met my expectations as far as quality. When I tried them on my daughter who is a size 2 they were too tight. My suggestion to anyone if ordering make sure and order a 1/2 size up or a full size up. Otherwise quality was great."
4.0,Order larger than you need
4.0,"This is the perfect mommy suit. I just had my third child and this suit fits amazing. I am 5'7,180 ibs and a DDD. I ordered a XXXL and its fits great. The cup size runs a bit small but it will still work!"
4.0,"comfy, but a half to one size large"
4.0,I am 5 ft 2 in. 115 lbs. I ordered a medium bc I like them a little loose. They run quite small and fitted. I can't dry them for fear of shrinkage. They are cute! And comfortable!
4.0,"It doesn't adjust as Polar original watch band, however it's work as a good alternative"
4.0,The dress is really nice. I have worn it a few times and I always get compliments. I ordered it in an XL. I am 180 lbs and 5'3&#34;. Fits as expected around the middle. It is a bit shorter than normal maxi dresses. I'm a bit short and usually everything is too long. This dress hit me at about the ankles. It did arrive with a small hole in the front but was an easy fix.
4.0,It was good view
4.0,"Love this shirt, but it runs very large.  All my other fox shirts are a large, and this one fits more like an xl.  I had to return it."
4.0,Can‚Äôt answer the questions as it is a Christmas gift. I am worried about the size though. They are adorable and I‚Äôm sure my Grandson will love them but they sure look big.
4.0,look pretty
4.0,Very cute dress. I got a large. Its very stretchy. It would of been good to get a medium but the arms are to tight
4.0,"I have just arrived in the States, and forgot to bring a handbag from China. So I spent a lot of time, maybe two nights searching bags online. And at last, I chose this one. It is big enough to carry my 13'3 inches laptop, and looks great.<br /><br />The only thing that is not perfect is its leather. But anyway, it worth this price"
4.0,"Well made and tailored 5-panel hat. The snap-back adjustment type was a surprise, because 5-panel hats usually come with an adjustable buckle. Should be stated in the description, or pictured."
4.0,"Cool hat, fits as expected. Quality wise is pretty ok. Definitely not super amazing quality but then again you wouldn't expect it to be. Nonetheless it's not bad quality either. Makes for a nice and funny gift in my opinion. Had a pretty good laugh with my dad! He wears it to work every day!"
4.0,"It's true that monitors can certainly alter the colors or intensity of the actual item we purchase, and in this case, it is true. My monitor showed the sugar skull VERY bright yellow and orange, however the colors are dare I say, more a faded pastel. While that might be a kicker for a lot of folks and would return it, I am thinking I can work with it one way or the other. I like the series of these skulls and have several colors, but the yellow is the softest color.  All in all, a nice piece."
4.0,"Love it, one of my favorite shirts... Hippies Live on ‚úåÔ∏èüåà"
4.0,Ties take some getting use to but very comfortable.
4.0,"These boots have a nice soft fur like lining that make them feel nice on your feet.  I will need to wait until the first snow of the year to try them outside and see how they hold up to real winter weather.  They look nice and the design means they should keep your feet warm and dry.  I found they were true to size in length (I wear a size 10), but I had to pull the laces tight and they still seemed a little big overall for my narrow feet.  This would, however, allow you to wear super thick winter socks if you wanted to."
4.0,Gorgeous clutch!!
4.0,Nice blouse I love it
4.0,"I recently ordered two pairs, one for my mother and one pair for me. Unfortunately I had to return them because they were too small. I reordered a pair for my mother and myself.  I wear size 7 1/2 and my mother wears an 8. The second time I ordered,  (39 for me and 40 for my mother). The shoes are so colorful  and beautifully ebroidered and they fit perfectly!"
4.0,"Bought this for a vacation. Loved the frames, so stylish. It's a magnet for fingerprints so the little cloth they give you is a godsend. The end part of the earpiece can be a little sharp so be careful when wearing it."
4.0,Helped with glare of oncoming headlights.
4.0,Very nice shoe but they squeeze my toes.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 170lbs 39-29-40 and I bought a Large. Dress body fits well and flattering, color was as described but it‚Äôs not as soft, fuzzy and cozy as it looks. It‚Äôs more of a thick Soft T-shirt material than a soft fuzzy sweater. The ‚Äúneck line‚Äù is very snug around the shoulders and hard to get to stay there and looks forced and tight not loose and cozy. But it‚Äôs really sexy."
4.0,"Top fits, pants are large, but all cute and soft."
4.0,Cute but over priced for its size.
4.0,"LOVE THIS TOP EXCEPT FOR OPENING WHERE TOP BUTTON IS, IT GAPS OPEN MOST IF THE TIME...DON'T LIKE THAT. OVERALL THE SHIRT IS WONDERFUL, COLORING & PLEATS MAKE A NICE FIT"
4.0,These are really cute and my son loved them. However the description is misleading i wish He read through everything before we ordered them. You only get 10 of the fortnite ones not 30 like the headline states. So he was a little disappointed when only 10 came in. Especially for the price. We could have ordered a 30 pk from another company for less money. But lesson learned i guess
4.0,i like the reason these are made.  only gave it a 4 star because i would have preferred to have been able to choose the one i wanted-you have to take the one the company chooses for you.  it hangs on my purse proudly anyway.
4.0,This ring is great except for one important thing. It runs small!! I would encourage going up 1 size. I purchased a 6.5 and my daughter says fits like a 5.5. Luckily she can still wear it but it‚Äôs now her wedding band lol
4.0,"This dress is very cute and stylish but I had a few problems. First, the model appears to be wearing a gold dress. The dress is actually rose gold. Second, I got a US M which is a large with this company and it was too big. Maybe I lost weight? I am 34, 28, 40. I should have gotten a Small, but many of the dresses I own are at least mediums. Last, it is a tad bit itchy under the underarm part due to the sequins. Other than that, the dress is visually appealing, but next time I will do a US S with this company. The best I can do is just go to a tailor to have the top part altered."
4.0,"I paid only $3 for this necklace, and was pleased with the quality. It does occasionally fall off the chain, but not nearly as much as I expected. It's pretty and fun."
4.0,"Love this dress. Almost too short, but really love it"
4.0,Ordered white received a light pink.  It does fit.  Ordered xxl for a size large person
4.0,Good quality. Very stylish. Not easy access to pocket on the back. I only use the two front pockets.
4.0,Faster shipping than expected.
4.0,"The material is very nice and soft and comfy! The color was bright red and not burgundy like the picture shows, was disappointed in that."
4.0,Super cute boots! Normally wear a size 6 1/2. Even with thick socks they're still a little large.
4.0,One of my stones was missing
4.0,Such a pretty print and cute dress but it ran large and was not worth altering.
4.0,"Naruto Shippuden Jiraiya Headband - Worked for the Jiraiya Costume it was for, Quick Shipping, & Item As Described!"
4.0,"I Love Lucy is my favorite TV show so I‚Äôm always happy to wear clothing around the house that reminds me of the show.  I received these pajamas for Christmas and I‚Äôve been wearing them a couple times a week even after the holiday ended.  I wear a size small and they fit as expected. The shorts hit mid thigh and are very soft, and the top is a little loose which makes it comfortable for sleeping. The graphic on the top is cute enough for wearing outside of the house, and the shorts are great for wearing all December because of the Christmas theme.  I wish the shirt was softer but I imagine it will be perfect after 15 washes or more. Great present for a fan of Lucille Ball, even if you gift yourself!"
4.0,Bought this to use as a maternity top and it‚Äôs perfect.  It did ‚Äúpill‚Äù on the front from the friction of my Work lanyard.  Pockets are super helpful. I‚Äôm short and would only wear this with leggings underneath.
4.0,"Fits well, except a little long, no as pictures in the photo as above the knee. Actually below the knee. All in all nice!"
4.0,I use these gloves with large caliber hand guns (454 Casull).  Very painful without.
4.0,"I liked the dress but had to return it because it was too short. Other than the length, the fit was as expected."
4.0,"Very good, only a bit expensive."
4.0,Nice comfortable dress.  Looked just like the picture. I could have order 1 size smaller as it is stretchy and would have hugged me better but even with the size I purchased it didn't look too big. Great value
4.0,I have enjoyed this dress. It is a very comfortable dress yet does not lack in style. It fits and looks exactly like the picture. I would get a size larger.
4.0,Wish the velcro was a tad longer but it works
4.0,"The color is different with the picture, I am 5`5 and 132lbs, usually wear size small. But the small size is short on me, a medium one maybe better. The material is not the most comfortable one, but it is OK"
4.0,"Bought this for my niece for prom. She loved it! One complaint: got twisted and was difficult to untangle. Overall, it served its purpose for the price."
4.0,"The color and style are very nice, but the size is a little small for me."
4.0,"Little large for my purse, but good size to use alone."
4.0,It wears well and for the most part comfortable.
4.0,"I had to have it altered, but fabulous after that"
4.0,Nice Jeep Hat
4.0,Had to give half of them away because my ear was too small. They are really cool if your ears are big enough.
4.0,"Super cute and comfy, sometimes would ride up, but fit as expected. I wore it for Halloween but will absolutely wear for fun things too. Keep in mind the green one is VERY green, it‚Äôs not like a cute faded green. Also, a lot of times I will get a medium in Amazon clothes but I got a small in this! (For reference I‚Äôm a 4 in lulu leggings!)"
4.0,Excellent handbag but it did not come with Coach paper work so for that I could not give perfect score. It appears to be authentic without any imperfections.
4.0,"I love my new dress and look simply darlin in it!!  It‚Äôs also sooo appropriate for Pride month. Actually, it‚Äôs perfect for Pride EVERY day!!"
4.0,"First impression was that these things stink. After a hand wash it was bearable but still the filter charcoal made it almost intolerable. Not sure what to make of it. Aside from that, these are well made. One thing I would prefer to see is some padding where the nose wire is as opposed to having to stick a pad on (you only get two so I am not sure how long they are going to last)."
4.0,"Paid 20 dollars plus tax for 5 masks. made of good material, nice colors, adjustable elastic for ears. Come with like 6 filters to put in filter pockets. Would recommend this product."
4.0,"Very nice, the pocket is large with a nice zipper but hidden well.  The fabric is a nice weight.  It is a gift for my daughter so she has not worn it yet.  But I am pleased and would order it again."
4.0,"After wearing, it will probably stretch some. Overall, very satisfied."
4.0,"I really like these socks, but I have to wear a pair of lightweight socks underneath them because my feet are sensitive and the metallic thread next my skin is uncomfortable."
4.0,"As much as I like the brooch, I had to return it because the clasp was broken. It was too heavy for the paper it was attached to. The colors are nice though."
4.0,I couldn‚Äôt wait for it to come. It took a while. Now I can‚Äôt even use it because the end can‚Äôt reach the Velcro spot to stay on.
4.0,For the money it the shoe I needed.
4.0,39 out of 40 worked.  Button slide easy to use.  Perfect for my kid's birthday sleepover.  They come in a large bag with no display case (not that I needed one).  Happy with my purchase.
4.0,Its very well made for its price. I got the black one and the material used is more on the satin side so its a little shiny and soft. I use my steam iron to iron it as the material might not stand the regular iron.<br /><br />Got this product for free or with a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I do not work for this company nor being paid by them.
4.0,I love the dress. It is what was described. Yes I would purchase again if available.
4.0,The only thing that could make this pair pants better is if they had pockets.
4.0,Fun flashy would like antiqued finish on both side of product - back side of earrings show and look new whereas back looks antique would have prefer a faux stone that looks more realistic but at a distance it is a jangly head turner.
4.0,Still as cool as they were in the 80's
4.0,Exactly as we expected it.
4.0,Didn't look right on me was too big just decided to pass it on had a friend that likes yellow
4.0,My son use this for his Halloween costume.The ears are clip ons.  They can be difficult to get them to stay put if someone had thin hair.  The ears will slide off very easily.
4.0,I really wish the shirt fit because it is as pretty as the picture. I usually wear a size XL in shirts but this top was too small in the chest area. The fabric doesnt have any type of stretch so unfortunately I was not able to wear it. The product is as described and is a great buy.
4.0,Little smaller than I thought it would be
4.0,"I got a bronze or brown pair at clearance price because I could not pass up the opportunity to own another pair of strappy sandals.  This is my first pair of J shoes.  They seem to be a good quality and comfort level.<br /><br />The strap or lace up the centre serves no pupose other than to get in my way.  The heel is a nice height and width (stable but not heavy or clunky).  The shoe looks very attractive overall.  There are a number of elastics to keeps things comfortable plus 3 adjustable straps at the ankle to tighten or loosen things up.<br /><br />The part that covers my heel is my favorite part.  It's a nice detail and doesnt cause blisters.  Plus my pants dont get caught under my heel like they do with a slingback pair.  The inside sole of the shoe is an interesting texture, not quite like anything I have seen before.  Can't wait for the snow to melt here so I can wear these outside the house.<br /><br />The outside sole sticks nicely to a variety of surfaces.  The heel texture is a little less secure.  The patent shine to this shoe is a little more subtle than other pairs I have seen.  All in all, I really like the shoes.  I think they are very similar in quality and comfort to the Aerosoles pairs I own and love.  Happy Shopping!"
4.0,"I got the ""new black/silver"".  I'm not sure what the difference between the two black/silver options is, but maybe they fixed the issue with the posts?  I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I'm happy with it.  I removed one of the links so that it wouldn't flop around my wrist.  No issues with posts, but the compartment doesn't always stay closed (that's why 4 stars instead of 5).  It doesn't matter when I'm wearing it because there's no way it could open enough for the tracker to fall out, so I only notice it when I take it off to shower.  I will probably get it in brown as well."
4.0,"5 star for the look and the quaility. The outside looks smooth and classy, you can see the reflection on it. In the inside, the fur is very soft and warm, you can't feel a bit of wind wearing it.<br />How ever I take down 1 star for the touch screen function, it does work but the gloves were big that you can't text while wearing it, maybe accpept calls, take pictures and scroll some apps."
4.0,great for gift
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, the only issue I had is that one of the circle designs was entirely to large for me to tuck them properly into one another and I was forced to cut it off. Other than that the overall quality is good and I would purchase again."
4.0,"Was a little expensive for a necklace hope it lasts, otherwise love it"
4.0,"I did not see this first hand, because it was a gift for a secret pal. Hopefully, she liked it since I did not get any feedback."
4.0,Quality better than expected. Fits snug in chest if you have larger breasts so keep that in mind with sizing. Overall nice black dress that can be worn for various occasions.
4.0,"Good quality,  and arrived in a timely manner. Pretty happy with this buy."
4.0,"Okay so this is super cute and soft, I got the wine and it looks just as beautiful in person. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 140 lbs and usually wear size medium which is what I ordered. If you‚Äôre any taller than me I would not recommend this, it‚Äôs JUST long enough for me, I‚Äôm worried to wash it for it to shrink. But the width is perfectly baggy so I also would not want to size up."
4.0,Cute dress! Fit was as expected.
4.0,Nice lounging bra but wish the v was deeper as it hits in an odd spot like I would expect a &#34;girls&#34; to fit not a women's.
4.0,I work 12hrs a day outside in Arizona.<br />My feet didn't sweat and was very comfortable right out of the box.
4.0,Works as advertised and I am very happy with it.
4.0,"Cool bracelet (especially considering the price), I'm not disappointed.  I just wish the bracelet was a little larger in detail (not longer, larger).  Other than that, it's great."
4.0,Like the fit.  The color was not a true purple.  More burgundy brown.
4.0,"Slightly flimsy, as you would imagine for sheer material but nice and sexy! I haven't washed it yet...<br />Delivery was quick."
4.0,"Got this for walking the dog and chilly mornings going to work. It is a loose fit, but has the pockets, hood, and zipper and they all work."
4.0,Very good quality for the price. I was really pleased.
4.0,I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth the money
4.0,"Cute cover up, fits well but made a little more cheaply than shown.  Fabric looks higher quality in picture."
4.0,"This shirt is very convenient for a presentation, interview, or even to go out somewhere prestigious. its quite breathable and very elegant. It suits me and my style especially since I'm still young. The color is a nice and clean white. It also came with two collar ties (black & white). The only problem i had was the size. I ordered a small but it still fit a bit too big so i had it tailored."
4.0,"top was a lil weird in fit, but bottoms were perfect"
4.0,A little tight around the ears but it is bendable just be careful
4.0,"I love almost everything about this, except for the zipper. It stuck a bit. Once I oiled it, it worked almost perfectly though. I can easily fit my large phone inside the zippered pocket along with my case and a lip balm."
4.0,"So cute!  They are not very expensive, but they look good and glad I got them!"
4.0,Fit as expected and color was exactly as shown. Did not realize it was a silky material and not cotton.
4.0,Everything worked as advertised I bought this to take on a trip to the Caribbean and it worked so well that I may use it at home from time to time when I don't need everything in my regular wallet.
4.0,"Very nice dress...especially for the price. The only downside is that it is a little tight around the top, but I have to deal with that often."
4.0,I dislike that the bras rip up on the top
4.0,Bought these to cover tattoos for professional reasons. Fit as expected and dont feel too cheap.
4.0,Love this shirt but it runs small
4.0,"This is really cute and since this was cheap, I was expecting for this to be unflattering, but was surprised that it came out otherwise.  The quality isn't bad either!  You can't tell its cheap at all!  This is actually really cute on.  The only bad thing about this are the breasts pads, they're kind of too low.  But, to me that wasn't a big deal.  you can actually manipulate it and kind of move upwards to the right spot.  And, if you're talented enough, you can sew on your own, to the correct spot, bra pads on this! :)"
4.0,These stretch  so I will order the next size down next time. Otherwise they are great.
4.0,Slightly narrower than expected.
4.0,Nice quality. Not tight enough to exercise in.
4.0,"I really like the feel of these and the fact they're seamless.  However, they fit slight small.  Not much, but just a little.  I'm an 18W and easily fit on the sizing chart for 1x/2x, but I'm wishing now I would have gotten the bigger size, which may have made for a 5 star rating.  Other than that, love them!"
4.0,"Good, like it"
4.0,Fits small. Not the highest quality but cute style. I think on me it looks good with a Cami underneath. Otherwise it is too short in front. I am 5'4&#34; and have a short torso. So the &#34;one size&#34; may not fit if you are taller.
4.0,I got these all because my husband loves dragons lol when I wear them everyone notices my earrings great conversation piece. Of course my husband loves them . Thanks
4.0,I ordered in size small. It‚Äôs alittle bit tight on shoulders hopefully it would not shrink after laundry.
4.0,"Firstly, everyone was right. If you wear a Mens Medium then buy a Mens Large. Fits perfectly.<br /><br />Secondly, I ordered two oranges and a black to have my law firms logo embroidered on them. They arrived today when I have to send these out and while the two oranges see okay the black one has many many frays and loose/broken threads. It is too late (my own fault) to return them so we are at the pray stage lol."
4.0,These are great if you need space between your mouth & your mask. I use these religiously. They're great & they do serve their purpose wonderfully !
4.0,"I like the sandals because you can adjust the strap to fit your foot.  they are comfortable, my pain is not completely gone, but it is better"
4.0,I've had this ring in for about 2 months and it's starting to change colors a little bit. I still think it's cute just not as cute as when I first put it in. I'll probably just wind up buying another one because of how cheap it is.
4.0,These are class valentines Day gifts for my daughters class. The non candy item we were looking for.
4.0,"Cute, not made from the best material. Very thin material."
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt like that it arrived past the guaranteed date but the piercings are super cute and small, I love them and they look great on my nose."
4.0,This fits perfect. I suggest ordering up a size. My husband wears a medium. I ordered him a large and it fits perfectly. He really likes it. It's warm and comfy!
4.0,"Works great for my 1 year old. With all the COVID stuff and masks required, I feel it adequately protects her."
4.0,I received a lot of compliments on this jumpsuit. Such a great find
4.0,This sweater is lovely and cozy but it definitely runs big
4.0,"I like this product, just wish it had a little stretch to it. It fit as expected, possibly a little small...But overall, happy with it!"
4.0,"I really like this swimming suit, it makes me feel professional. It does fit a tad bit tight, but I think it will loosen up over time. Other than that, I love the colors and I think it will be just fine when I start my swimming lessons."
4.0,"My size medium fits great. I gave it 4 stars because it looks good with my black jeans however, it's not sweatshirt material and not very thick. The quality is good and I love the drawstrings on either side. Really cute!"
4.0,I love the shape! The color blue is not as bright as the picture shows.
4.0,Looks super fake but will work
4.0,This is an absolutely ADORABLE set. The diaper cover is a bit too small though. Left red rings around our chunky 3 month olds legs and tummy. Definitely wouldn't fit for 6 months... Size up.
4.0,These were very nice! The only downside is that they scratch extremely easily.
4.0,"I absolutely love these Dresses!<br />UNfortunately the breast area is WAY too small. I am a squishy 38 or 40 DD /ddd 190 lbs. 5 ft 7"" I am going to try to do something with the dress cups, will probably have to add more fabric, and completely reconstruct,not sure yet. There is no stretch in the cups, but elastic in back which is nice. The length is a bit uneven, but its ok, the fabrics are all gorgeous. I'd say if you a firm D or smaller you should be fine. I'm bummed it doesn't fit me right. I love this company and have ordered pants from them, which are GORGEOUS."
4.0,"Great quality and likeness to the adult glasses, just very small. We ordered for our 8 year old and they‚Äôre too small for his face.  I‚Äôd say they be best fit for 2-6 years old. We tried them on our 2 and 6 year old. Perfect for 2, and slightly small on 6."
4.0,"I received these items at a discounted rate in exchange for my review.<br /><br />These rings do fit well (get your correct size as if you get them small there's not much budge in them), and the rings don't split or have layers rub off like others I've purchased in the past.<br /><br />These are great for the lake, mechanics, soldiers, anyone who gets their hands dirty or is around electricity.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great sizing<br />Sturdy construction<br /><br />Cons:<br />My fingers got sweaty after prolonged wearing of them (could be because my ring fit snug), but one ring was a little larger and it was much more comfortable<br /><br />Overall 4/5"
4.0,"I have never had shoes like this before. Of course they are made for a special purpose, so I understand that. But if you get them for ordinary use, and even for the purpose for which they are intended, they can be dangerous, especially to older people with vulnerable bones and joints. When I first tried them I was very impressed. They were so unique! The added external rear supports give the shoes capability to spring you up almost off the ground. I liked that at first. The added supports in the toe area, however, gave me a mixed reaction. At first I noticed they made my feet easily turn to the right or left almost without my telling them to turn. In short, they are quite slippery! Watch out! My initial reaction was, ""This is so unique."" And I really liked it at first. But I soon noticed the extra maneuvering that both the front and back supports provide caused me too many very unexpected twists of the feet. Whoa! I'm sure some cyclists would tell me that's the way it's supposed to be, but if so, that doesn't make them any less dangerous!"
4.0,"perfect fit for my glasess, it will be better if they show picture with shield dimensions so you can compare. first set I bought in a store and got lost so I knew which model fit my glassess"
4.0,The pins Back out of the buckle
4.0,"This Nike shirt is made well I ordered an XL and washing up really well, holding it's beautiful color and fit. The fit was a little snug so I would suggest to size up. Nike is super expensive so I would say this shirt is worth the money."
4.0,"The mid section is not lined, therefore you can see your crotch. Be careful."
4.0,Very nice dress for the summer
4.0,Product has a good fit and can be slightly adjusted to fit your wrist comfortably.
4.0,Looks like the picture. I get plenty of compliments. They are comfy and hold up well enough for the price.
4.0,I love it ...!!
4.0,Fits really well. Comfortable and not as tight as the picture makes it seem.
4.0,"Otay, I've only had the two pair of glasses not even a day, but there's something about them that screams ""Quality, even though I'm plastic, and the anti-blue coating on the lenses seems pretty tough, but we'll see as time goes by.""  I am particularly rough on glasses; it's a guy thing, I think - you know, we're clutsy compared to women, and bending and breakage just happens. Dambit.  But, there it is.  I clean lenses often, since they always seem to be dirty, but with these,  I'm going to make sure I use the soft cloth squares I have instead of paper towel/Windex. 'Sides, Windex belongs on your elbow, or perhaps...zit.  Yuck. Anyway, these two pair appear to be of very good quality, and I like the spring-assisted hinges that pop closed very neatly.  So far, it's five stars. I'll get back later with a review founded on more experience.  'Tay, see ya.  bioman out.<br /><br /> Here I is,was, shall be on the writing path again. I'm going to downgrade my score on these to a four star rating, the reason being it took not much time for me to permanently scratch, or wear a spot on one of the pair as to make 'em useless; the spot is right where I need to see on the right lens and it's very annoying to try to see over it, or under it; just seems that it was easier and more damaging that other pairs of glasses I've used. I don't use kid gloves with my glasses, yet I don't coddle them either.  I have a few pair from the dollar store that are in better shape having been through a lot more than this pair have been...by a long shot. So, kudos to the overall quality of these glasses, yet it was too easy to damage the lenses.  More scratch resistance, if that's available, please."
4.0,"Good looking, cute piece"
4.0,"It is hard to see the eyes on this from the picture.  It is a cute ring and I get comments on it all the time.  It is a bit bulky to wear daily, but it is still cute and fairly comfortable."
4.0,Great deal in the costume made fairly well can't complain. Came in really quick and my son loved it. Compared to the same one at the store it held its own
4.0,"Nice top. Good length, thick enough do you don‚Äôt see a bra through it. I just really like it in white."
4.0,Nice it was a gift and I love it
4.0,Love this shirt-but make sure to order one size larger than what you wear.......otherwise wash in COLD water too-the color will tend to fade onto the white I would think
4.0,"Good fit, looks good , only problem I've had was the die is coming off on the edge, besides that I've had no problems"
4.0,"Love this swim suit/ looks just like the picture, the quality of it is great only thing is you want to order a size up from what you were originally going to order. Because of how the swimsuit is made and cut out if you get it too small you wont be able to stretch the bathing suit to tie it around your neck or back especially if you have a long torso. other than that if you get the right size you will love it. I'm going to sell  the one I have and buy another one"
4.0,"My granddaughters loved them.  Nice colors, not cheaply made.  Good purchase."
4.0,"It's great for the price, but it's actually bigger than I wanted, making it look a little gaudy."
4.0,Haven‚Äôt worn the earrings yet. They look good though.
4.0,Loved it just so tight
4.0,Beautiful fit and feel but it is way too long for me. Definitely worth getting it hemmed to show it off.
4.0,Metal is thinner and more fragile than what I was expecting but design is nice.
4.0,Thank You..
4.0,Nice quality. My husband wears them. Masculine-made enough.
4.0,Very pretty..love it
4.0,"I put this on my new house key. It's larger and bulkier than I expected, but very cute. I'll see how long it takes to get used to the size."
4.0,"A little bit smaller than I thought, but still super cute."
4.0,The purple option was a beautiful shade and it perfectly.  Deducting a star because I don't know what went wrong but it shrunk when I washed it.
4.0,"Nice, strong plastic and construction. The only gripe is the strap could be softer against your neck. Otherwise, perfect for a stadium concert or other event!"
4.0,It was for my daughter fits nice.
4.0,"Fits great everywhere, except the feet are huge!"
4.0,"They look good. Fit more snug than other Oakley, but still look good. High quality good glasses."
4.0,fits good but weather is to warm yet to wear I live in florida
4.0,"This were perfect gauge size but like the other lady said they are small. Came fast, cute colors, no errors just fits small but another consumer warns of that. Wish they had gold. So I put it in forwards and backwards, and just pulled a little bit to make them fit my nostril size more comfortable."
4.0,"Cute earrings for any occasion. Nice inexpensive ""just cause"" gift."
4.0,"Really like this sweater. Fits well, a tad on the big side but washed and dried it and it seems to have improved. The material is a bit stiff and scratchy. Not really soft, sweater material, but not uncomfortable. Perfect for cold days."
4.0,"Love this, the only reason I'm giving 4 Stars is because in the picture it looked like leather and it isn't leather."
4.0,Loved it. Only problem it doesn‚Äôt come with a funnel to put the ashes into the jewelry
4.0,"They are cute and light, but I was hoping for a bigger set."
4.0,Love them but have to pull them up often
4.0,"Cute top but runs small. Had to order XL. I'm 5'2 115 pds. Normally wear medium. Unless you want it to be tight fitting, I would recommend ordering 2 sizes up."
4.0,love 925 quality sterling
4.0,"The dress is very beautiful, comfortable and casual. looks great. Not tight at all. The only thing is that the middle knot looks a little wierd, not like it looks in the photo"
4.0,"Let me preface this with the fact that I love this bag. it is what I was looking for in size, material, and feel. The only thing I wish they would have done is add some additional compartments for some toiletries, medicine etc.. I know most are probably going to use this bag for tools or uses not so much related to being a suitcase. After weeks of searching for something, I finally went out to see what I could find in store somewhere. This lead me to Dicks Sporting goods website. I saw Carhartt and wound up driving out to my local store to see if they had it in stock, only to find that the site seems to be more optimized for mobile browsers than desktop since my phone ultimately showed that they didn't sell them in store. I hadn't even thought of Carhartt, but fund the bag on Amazon for the same price but with prime delivery.<br /><br />Pros: The bag is spacious enough, feels durable, and is handsome without being flashy. The heavy duty Zipper and strap connections are a great touch. It should be able to easily handle a few days worth of clothes. The size of the 23 inch bag easily swallows a few standard pillows.<br /><br />The only Con I have is the lack of additional compartments, which led me to purchasing a toiletry bag to put in it, but in reality that's probably a good thing.<br /><br />Another note, don't expect this to be a soft or luxurious to the touch bag, it is built to stand up to abuse."
4.0,Nice fabric.  Looks just like the photo.  The length does run long though.
4.0,It‚Äôs too hot for me
4.0,"I love the silver one, have two of them. Recently bought the gold its cute but like silver better."
4.0,"Too snug. I would definitely size up. Very cute but it‚Äôs very thin material. Exchanging for larger size.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Large fits great, it‚Äôs actually thicker too.<br />But big thing is the photo looks black on bottom section and it‚Äôs brown. I might return bc it‚Äôs not really pretty or something I would choose."
4.0,I‚Äôm 5ft 136lbs . And usually wear a small-medium on top and medium - large on bottom . Chose a medium so that it wouldn‚Äôt be so short . But I think I should have went with a small as I like dresses a little more fitted .It is a loose fit I think .  I will be keeping it because it‚Äôs only for a few hours or so . Not worth replacing to me . It will do the job.
4.0,Just what my husband was looking for traveling
4.0,"Good, vibrant colors, enough to match most outfits. Hold is okay. Comparable to others out there. Have yet to find chains that do not loosen and slide down, but these do keep my glasses handy, especially when shopping."
4.0,My wrist was too small but passed it on to a friend
4.0,"The fit of this dress was perfect.  And I loved the style and the color is true.  The only downside, hence 4 stars, the fabric hides nothing!  So every little bra cup, hook, strap was visible.  I made it work after trying a couple of things but it did stress me out a bit."
4.0,Pretty and a little sexy! Quality was a little less than expected. I wear a 36DDD.
4.0,Unique and I like that they are high weisted and not too long.
4.0,I hated the way the light on it blinked and it fit kinda snug but other than that I can't complain.
4.0,"Thought it would be bigger, but still like it. I will buy 2 more to get the effect I want"
4.0,"I love this bracelet, I wear it a lot. With that come a great deal of abuse. I give it 4 stars. This bracelet will stretch. I recommend anyone who purchases this bracket to pinch the black breads closed.<br /><br />After one week of wearing the bracelet broke. At this time I removed one bead for a tighter fit."
4.0,"I have pretty small wrists so the adjustability was nice. This watch came with a little tool to help you adjust it which other watches I‚Äôve ordered off amazon with a similar adjustment system did not. The free bracelet it comes with is, well, free: it‚Äôs not super sturdy, feels very cheap in the hand like it could snap any minute and I honestly couldn‚Äôt say for certain if it was metal or a hard plastic. But, this is about the watch because that‚Äôs what we really ordered here. The watch is lightweight without feeling cheap, the metal looks durable and not like the rose gold metallic will chip or anything. It was easy to adjust and seems like It will hold up well especially for the price."
4.0,"Very cute and worth the $2 I spent on it, even if it turns my finger green after a day. Just make sure to put some kind of protectant, like clear polish, on it before wearing."
4.0,They‚Äôre perfect!  Wish there was an option for a larger pair
4.0,"Cute style, wish the straps were adjustable"
4.0,"Fits well, very comfy, thin but thats to be expected for the cost. We will see how this wears over time, but for now, its exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,"for what these are used for they work fine. i am not trying to correct a vision issue,just wanting to enhance that small print which is not as easy to read anymore. i dont like carrying two pairs of glasses if i don't have too. this eliminates the need for reading glasses and allows me to use them indoors or outdoors."
4.0,"Holds all my cards, but would be perfect if just a little wider to include my paper money."
4.0,Beautiful skirt. The colors are beautiful!!  Fits wonderful and it has been washed with not change in size.  Good quality
4.0,"Love the quality of the dress, but the crown needs some help, and one of the jewels fell off"
4.0,It‚Äôs exactly what we were expecting. Only took off one star for the shipping. It took forever to get here.
4.0,"I feel, think, there about 4 types of polish.  The cream, deep penetrating for soft shoes to condition.  The stain polish to bring color back to shoes I have scuffed, but which have a high polish.  The regular paste polish with varying amounts of carnauba wax. And Parade polish for an extreme spit shine on formal shoes.  This is a stain polish that makes abused shoes come back to an acceptable level."
4.0,I am usually a 5.5 and I found these to be a bit big. Nothing a cushy insert couldn't cure.
4.0,Nice sunglasses. But not a lot of give when putting on. Feels like they might break. Just be careful.
4.0,"your getting what you pay for, but its cute and you can form it to your finger"
4.0,"i received the earrings ok,  on time for chistmas day, in a beauty box  ready to gift.<br />but the size is smaller than the picture. i was  thinking  the earings was like standard size  but  those looked like baby earings...<br />finally  they fit to my girl  and liked !.<br />i'll shop again this brand."
4.0,Cute but flawed. They don‚Äôt lay flat because the back is so rounded. If the back was flatter the owl would fall nicely.
4.0,"These shorts have a great image on them and are super cute! Great length and super soft! Warning though they are quite thick. We live in the south and unfortunately, I don't think my son will be able to wear these outside in the summer, but they are still great shorts! They would also make great pj shorts too! Overall, my little guy loves them, and they fit great!"
4.0,"Me agradaron los colores, es muy muy delgada, ten√≠a hilos colgados de las mangas que tuve que cortar, en las fotos parecer√≠a mas gruesa sin embargo son extremadamente delgadas, no creo que duren mucho. Muy larga hacia abajo."
4.0,"You get very much what you see: rough leather (cow), nicely stitched, looks good.<br />Inside, there's 4 credit card slots and a partitions for whatever else one may want to carry. The smell of processed leather is quite pungent but I am quite sure that it's going to fade and almost disappear in time."
4.0,I wore this to a wedding and everyone loved it. I just wish the shoulder drip would have been a little more dramatic. It doesn‚Äôt stay off the shoulder. I had to keep pulling it down for pics.
4.0,"Really nice, but the size wasnt a small. I mean, the tag said so but it didn't fit well."
4.0,"Used for my 4 year olds Halloween costume. Bought size 4-6 and it fit nice with room to spare. She is slim and a little bit tall. Comes to her lower calf. She'll be able to wear it for dress up for a couple of years. It's a nice ,classic, age appropriate Dorothy costume dress. Seems well made too."
4.0,The dress is very pretty. I had to return it and get a smaller size. Love the color
4.0,Good looking watches for the price you pay. Light and comfortable. But after a year of very rare wearing started fogging up in center. No damage. Rate btw 3and 4 stars.
4.0,I'm short and had to have the length taken up. Had the sleeves shortened to 3/4 length while I was at it. Good dress for the money though.
4.0,Beautiful ring but I lost a stone already
4.0,A little shorter than I had hoped but it is cute
4.0,Fit my 3 year old toddler who is 38 inches tall. Had to cut off the glove part as the left one was sewn on backwards.
4.0,These were a tad too big and heavy but I loved the look! I wore these on my Mexico trip!
4.0,Wish it had more pockets. But love it
4.0,loose cover
4.0,"Really pretty, but it's for a big-boned wrist, and you can't put extra holes in the band. Sadness. I haven't been able to find a replacement band for this watchband because it's so thin."
4.0,"Good size, and good price."
4.0,Difficult to insert the slack of the adjustable band into the latch after it has been latched. Color is bright. Nice to have the tools included !
4.0,I love this shirt. Fits perfect everywhere. If I could change one thing it would be the color of the wording. You can‚Äôt really see the mamma bear on it unless you are up close. Other than that I LOVE this shirt.
4.0,"After listening to medical advice about masks, these are definitely mostly for looks."
4.0,Brought it for my son he loved it !
4.0,I really like these bracelets. I put some peppermint oil on one bead and the smell lasted.
4.0,I have a big face and it fits great.  It‚Äôs pretty thick material so it‚Äôs too hot for me to wear in the heat.
4.0,Very comfortable! Looks great with leggings. Fits a little big but so comfortable. I wore it to a movie date and it was perfect.
4.0,"Cute top, it's very comfortable and the style is figure-flattering.  You might want to size up on this one if you prefer your clothing on the looser side. I would also suggest wearing a cami underneath for obvious reasons."
4.0,Perfect souvenirs
4.0,Nice lightweight comfortable shirt
4.0,cute but too tight so I returned it
4.0,"I ordered this for a cocktail holiday party but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt fit and had to return. I normally wear a 14-16, so I bought size 16 and it was very snug. I love style and cut and the material looked sturdy. I just wished it was true to size."
4.0,"Cutesy and fun. They all even work! Not that I was too worried about that, because really I just got them for the cuteness. Definitely a nice little gift for a younger sister or niece, or even to wear yourself if you wish. They look just like the picture and I really love the dark green one."
4.0,It was a little too glittery for me but all in all very pretty
4.0,"I am a 36D, with a tummy. I got the large, as a gift, cause that's the size I gave. I should have gone with a medium. However, I'll keep it cause it's comfortable and I will be getting more of these."
4.0,"I've had past disappointing experiences with buying swim suits from Amazon (mostly because I didn't read reviews or there weren't any to begin with), and this one is a total game changer. Of course I learned from my mistakes and read the reviews (more times than I'd like to admit) before buying this suit for its cheap price. When I read the reviews I saw many people advise to order two sizes up, I was a little skeptical and a little nervous to order a large since I'm a size small. So instead I got a medium, it fits pretty fine except for the boob area. I'm 5'2&#34; with 34A cups. The only problem I had was the boobs, and it's not even that big of a problem. It's just a little too narrow and if I move a great deal I'll probably suffer from a nip slip. However if you're a pretty lean build, short as in like 5'3&#34; and shorter, and naturally a small/xsmall with smaller breasts, medium will be perfect for you. Also the material is amazing, I'm no expert but as a competitive swimmer it feels like any other practice suit material."
4.0,"I bought the black and white necklaces. I like the white a lot more. I agree with other reviews, the black stone is a flat black with no variation so it looks like a piece of plastic (but it is a cheap necklace so I didn't expect it to look amazing)The white stone looks much better as you can see in the picture. For the price, they are good necklaces to accessorize an outfit."
4.0,"So I really like this product since I'm allergic to silicone bands. But it loosens over time, making it slide all around my wrist. That is the only downfall I see, another wise I would recommend it."
4.0,"I've ordered and reordered these clip-on sunglasses. I like them because there's no huge centerpiece clip and because they're available in various sizes. My glasses are pretty wide, so it's not always easy find a product like this that fits. The price is modest, so replacing a lost pair is painless. Delivery is extraordinarily fast."
4.0,These sandals are true to size and they fit comfortable. That‚Äôs a plus due to my wide feet.
4.0,"These ran a little big on me, but they are soft, fit nice, and I would definitely order them again!"
4.0,"Loved it! Just, it came in pink & the picture shows as white so I was expecting white! If it came as the color as shown it would be 5 stars.."
4.0,"I ordered the Navy blue and recieved the Pink. TWICE. That being said, the dress fits nicely. It's comfortable, it's flattering. I decided to keep the first pink dress and attempted to purchase the navy blue. I got a second pink. I spoke with CS and they think it may be a link issue. I am hoping this is resolved. I'd really like to have the correct color. CSwas very helpful. Just know if you're ordering now (July 2017) you may not get the color you want. But it still fits great :) good luck!"
4.0,"I ordered these in black and just love, love them. The calf has a strap around it that is adjustable! After reading reviews on this boot I was concerned about where the heel sits under my foot, some reviewer‚Äòs said it hurt their arch but I don‚Äôt find that to be so. These boots are very comfortable and very attractive so I would recommend."
4.0,"Very beautifully made. Fits as expected per size description, since I'm an xl top and 5'8&#34; it fits like a long cardigan instead of a flowy coverup. I ordered the red, but it's more of a sunset orange. Pretty color though. I'm keeping it. Only giving it 4 stars because I wish there were larger size choices rather than the &#34;one size.&#34; In order for it to fit as pictured, you would have to be about 5' and an XS top."
4.0,it's a nice bag
4.0,"Had to return the first one, the stitching where the bottom zipper was incomplete.<br />Received the replacement and so far so good. Thick quality hoodie I like it."
4.0,"The smaller guages broke near the end of the plastic, but this is largely because they are so small and pointy and easier caught in my coat. And hair. Otherwise, perfect for my needs. Would be better if they came in seperate sized bags and labelled. Had to do my best to figure out the proper sizes and the progression by visiting a few places and sites to confirm gauges. - really inconvenient but really, a first world problem."
4.0,I was looking for a prayer shawl that doesn't cost a whole lot. This one is a good value and suits my purpose.
4.0,I will admit that I took the sellers advice and ordered a size larger than I normally get.  After washing its perfect.  Nice fee.  Soft.  Good weight and stretch without getting stretched out.
4.0,Bought this for my son for his birthday ( he's 32  lol) he loved it and he received many compliments when he wore it. Gave 4 stars because it's kind of hard to see the picture on the face.
4.0,"It is very fine quality at a very reasonable price.  It may be a little larger than I expected, but that may just be because I haven't wore anything around my neck before.  I'm sure I'll get used to it.  I certainly did not want it to be too small and dainty."
4.0,Snug but in the right places.very sexy
4.0,Good quality<br />Came sooner than expected
4.0,Real size and hurts when smacked.
4.0,Great stretch for yoga practice
4.0,"Super cute little necklace for my nieces ages 4, 5 and 6 for Valentine‚Äôs Day. It is teeny tiny, but it‚Äôs the perfect little treat for little kids. I think they‚Äôll love it!"
4.0,"Love, love these pants....feel great, fit great, live the side pockets and affordable."
4.0,"I bought these agate slices for a craft project making a windchime with hanging agate slices. These worked exceptionally well and were very reasonably priced! The pre-drilled hole was consistent across different specimens and made my life a lot easier when trying to tie these things to fishing line. I received all pieces in tact and a little certificate of authenticity. My only criticism is that about half of the agate slices were over-dyed and almost opaque blue, with little variation or interest. I would certainly order again for any project I need these for."
4.0,Looks great... but my heads to fat lol
4.0,"The only thing is I don't 100% like is that the buckle on the ankle straps are just for show; the ankle straps actually catch on the metal part, they do not buckle closed.  That being said, they do not always stay together.  And I did have to make additional holes for the buckle in order for them to fit  Otherwise, they are cute and pretty comfortable.  I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,"This is a cute little dress, Fit is true to size, material is flowy & not clingy, has a good amount of stretch as well. I am 5'8 and 170 and xl was a little loose but I wanted it that way, probably could have gone with large for a better fit."
4.0,Very nice purse and roomy. My only criticism is that the inside pocket is to shallow for my cell phone.
4.0,Love this top.  It fits as expected. My only complaint is that the material itches and irritates this skin.
4.0,"Really liked this shirt however, it does run small. I would suggest buying one size up from your regular size."
4.0,gave them as gift but look nice
4.0,Cute bag. Very roomy
4.0,"These are great for the pool, the beach and in general sunny days. The fit is good for my 8 and 10 year old boys.<br />Don't expect $150 quality, you aren't paying for that. But they are great kids, who tend to lose things! The replacement price is cheap.<br />We buy 6 pairs in the spring and by summer end they have all but disappeared. lol<br />But because of the price we don't sweat it."
4.0,"This top is very comfortable and true to size, but I gave it 4 stars because for a tunic it is not long enough. Would be great if it was a couple of inches longer and fell over the hips as a tunic should"
4.0,"Liked it a lot. Very delicate and light, but well made and nice looking. Got it as a gift for my godmother."
4.0,"I love the earrings they really look nice when you wear you're hair up, Love them."
4.0,Came with a large variety but I ended up giving some away because I didn‚Äôt like some of them but they only last like one wear and I usually change mine every two weeks then they broke while cleaning them
4.0,Glasses are great for glare at night. Not a very robust frame though so deducted one star.
4.0,"I love the looks of this hobo bag.  The color and exterior design are fabulous.  And it does hold a lot.  I also like that the strap fabric holds onto my shoulder.  But 4 stars because the interior design is confusing; it's too easy to lose things in the pockets upon pockets and zippers here and there.  And the fabric on the interior is cheesy; doesn't go with the exterior at all.  Also the strap color doesn't quite match the rest of the trim.  Finally, it's big,  I knew it was, but it's less useful than it might be because it's so large; I only use it for travel.  (But I do like it.)"
4.0,"I didn‚Äôt actually see this item in person because I bought it for my teenage niece who lives 1,200 miles away. However, she loved it! She said it is ‚Äúbeautiful!‚Äù It arrived a day earlier than anticipated."
4.0,Lovely but broke before I could even put it on my neck
4.0,"It is a quality product, acceptable at this price."
4.0,"Comfortable suit, no worries about &#34;hanging out&#34; while snorkeling. Would prefer it to be a tad longer and maybe a little less full around the rear, but overall its cute. Would be perfect for women with larger backsides."
4.0,I like my Nurse Mates compression socks even though I'm not a nurse!
4.0,"Just as described , very happy with the purchased , would rebuy if needed in the future. recommend this product to others."
4.0,I really like this product. It is perfect for what I need. Although they do fog up some. Very easy to adjust and Fit well
4.0,My daughter loved the kitty earrings!
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on it's appearance. To add, it's roomy and essentially my go to handbag."
4.0,"Chain is rather cheap looking but for the price, it's worth it!"
4.0,Great bag but returned it . Too tall fir my size.
4.0,"Nice and comfy, fun colors"
4.0,Great stocking stuffier made out of good materiel keeps your hands warm in the cold these are very stylish and the size fits great on most men
4.0,"I am so glad I found Rialto's on Amazon- I have such a hard time finding comfortable and affordable, basic, black flats and I had a pair of Rialto's back on 2015 that were awesome so I thought I'd give them a try.  This pair seems to hold up just like my original ones, thank you!  In fact, I'll probably buy more and stock up.  I've tried Hush Puppies and Talaria Flats and they were terrible (cheap feeling, but more expensive and painful).  Lesson learned- don't leave Rialto!"
4.0,we're learning
4.0,Cute. Although I wasn‚Äôt excited about the shiny fabric.
4.0,Very good quality.  Material an upgrade over some previous socks i purchased through this seller.
4.0,Have to order a size up but it was just like the picture
4.0,Ok but doesn't lay flat
4.0,"This ring is very attractive. It fits well and runs true to size.  Can't speak on long term durability, but I have gotten mine wet and the paint is still in tact."
4.0,"It‚Äôs the ultimate ‚Äúbeater‚Äù watch. I picked it up for $13, so I can‚Äôt complain at all. I mean look, the light sucks. Everyone knows that. But that‚Äôs really the only negative. It‚Äôs super light and really easy to wear. I find myself reaching for it every day when I get home from work. Or if I‚Äôm working in the yard, or camping‚Ä¶ stuff like that. Good watch from Casio!"
4.0,The belt is really durable and should last a long time.  The buckle is a tad heavy but very easy to use and beats having<br />to thread a loop every time. It's really easy to adjust to your exact waist size.  The one drawback is that the belt's buckle is fairly wide so it is tricky to get it through the belt loops on some jeans and shorts.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift.  It is really sweet and the description provided insofar as size was accurate.  I wish the pendent had been a littler larger, but the person who received it loved it.  It was worth the price I paid for it."
4.0,"So cute. Really comfortable, no headaches like I get with a lot of headbands.The only thing is, they are so wide that I kept hitting them on doors."
4.0,I Like this Ring Its very good quality item its size came same as my finger :D<br />i advice to get one
4.0,I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday. She loved it. It went on immediately. The box is adorable and the necklace itself was perfect for her.
4.0,You practically need a magnifying to use these but the work well.
4.0,"I love this swimsuit. I'm only giving 4 stars because it was kind of big at the bottom. I ordered an extra large, so I'll order the black one in a large"
4.0,"I liked the lightweight, cool fabric and the sober khaki color.  I normally wear an US Large (44 chest, 36 waist) and ordered an XL, but it is small and very tight at the waist.  But I really liked the jacket, so I am returning the XL, and ordering an XXXL (3X).  Love the jacket, but recommend 2 or 3 sizes larger, if you have a nice southern gentleman's figure like me!  :)<br /><br />PS.  Update:<br />Received the XXXL (3X) in beige today, and I really like it.  I normally wear a US Large (44S) and this 3X is very similar to that size, except the sleeves need to be shortened for me. I am short and fat, I guess ;)<br />This jacket is very good value and perfect for casual summer get togethers.<br /><br />PPS.  More update:<br />My seamstress said that the 3x (XXXL) was too wide for me.  So I returned it and got a 2X (XXL).  This one is just right for me.  Sorry for the multiple edits, but now I know I got what I wanted!<br /><br />In summer:  This jacket is very light and cool, well made, the color (beige) is very sober.  I normally wear a US  Large; but here the 2XL - fits just right.<br /><br />The jacket is excellent; I strongly recommend buying one size larger if you are slim, or 2 sizes larger if not."
4.0,"These are easy to use, slide style, bracelets/anklets.  IF you have small dainty ankles then you might be able to use these as ankles.  However that won't be the case for everyone so most of us will be delegated to the bracelet category.<br /><br />The threading material seems to be coated with a bit of wax material so they are a bit water resistant.  No tarnish markings from wearing and super easy to put on/take off.  At just over $1 per bracelet these are great small gift bag items / summer outfit adders."
4.0,I like product but the quality isn't what I expected.
4.0,Was a little bummer then I thought it would be but good quality for price
4.0,"Bought this knowing it was small and it certainly is.  Might take some getting used to, but I'll appreciate the less space it takes in my luggage.  Bought some smaller size toothpaste, etc.; should work fine.  Point is, if you want a regular sized one, get a different model.  All that said, the Dopp itself is great.  Clearly well-made and will undoubtedly be durable.  Functional (like the plastic lined pocket inside) yet attractive (for what that matters).  Completely satisfied."
4.0,super thin and lightweight. very comfy.<br />I'm a 6' tall 165 lb dude and they worked OK. I did blow out the crotch while at burning man. Probably dude to getting on and off my bike.
4.0,"great product, great price timely delivery"
4.0,liked the whole package
4.0,The apron is well made with fabric that will repel spills as long as the liquid doesn't just sit there. The fabric makes it easy to wipe the apron down after cooking so that the next time you use it it will be clean.
4.0,Is loose when you walked. I guess the straps stretch and no so comfortable.
4.0,"I was worried about this dress feeling stiff or itchy but it's very soft. I'm 5'6 145 lbs and ordered a medium. It feels slightly large, I probably could've gotten away with a small but better safe than sorry. The tie around the center is very slimming. It hits me right below the knee, which is nice as I'm mostly legs and that doesn't happen very often.  Material is not see through unless you really stretch it."
4.0,I wear a large and it's a little small - otherwise they're a perfect accessory! It unclips from time to time but looks great.
4.0,Nice shirt. Fits well.
4.0,I purchased this cute little dress for my trip to Jamaica! It was the perfect length for walking on the beach! It was also cute enough to wear while dancing and enjoying the Jamaica nightlife! The evening got a little chilly so the sleeves came in handy to be warm and still sexy! I love this dress and will try to order another one in white!
4.0,"The quality is okay, but otherwise, it looks great and it arrived much faster than expected"
4.0,Holds tight enough as intended.
4.0,"My niece calls it &#34;elegant,&#34; and she is the envy of all her school girl friends for it. The detail is nice, and it's sturdily made."
4.0,Got this for my fiance's watch and she loves it! Only problem she has is getting it to be tight enough on her own.
4.0,Had trouble velcroing all the way
4.0,"Update:  V-Moro contacted me to offer a replacement band after improving the product clasp.  I was skeptical, but agreed to try it.  Initially, I put the band on and tried to pull it off again.  It was locked on tight.  I put the original band back on and tried it as well.  Both were equally solid.  I've worn the band for three continuous days being extra cautious so that I don't lose the tracker should the band come off.  It hasn't had one single issue.  This is definitely a better product than what I was originally sent.  It's worth the try now.  Thank you V-Moro for listening and making improvements.<br /><br />ORIGNAL REVIEW:  I immediately returned the band.  The locking mechanism wasn't secure and I could remove the band without using the clasp.  I was afraid I'd lose the tracker if I used this band.  Perhaps, I received a defective strap.  I just wasn't going to risk it."
4.0,"Amazing, product great gift."
4.0,Dress Is Very Very Very Stretchy Meaning I Would Order One Or Two Sizes Down Just to Get Perfect Fit But Is A Nice Dress If It Fitted.
4.0,"I always have trouble with hats being too large, but this hat is adjustable, so it twas perfect for me.  Is lightweight so great for hot day."
4.0,"I used the bag to run around theme parks for a few days.  It was perfect! The only reason why I gave it four stars is because it takes a little adjusting to get it to hang evenly.  It had plenty of room for a water bottle, light sweater and several snacks.  I really liked the pocket for my phone.  It hung right at/below the front of my shoulder; it was very convenient and secure.  To clarify what other people wrote about it being flimsy...  This feels light and thin like a string sack not sturdy like a backpack.  It is a thin nylon material with a very sturdy strap.  Bonus, I got it as a lightning deal! Now, I will use it to take the dog on long walks and to the dog park."
4.0,"This is such a pretty and feminine addition to my fashion jewelry wardrobe. They are a bit large on my earlobes, but stunning and shiny. The pink color is much much lighter than the picture. They almost resemble morganite rather than CZ or diamond.<br />Pear shapes are timeless, and it is not something you see every day either. I would probably not buy them for a younger teen, but maybe for an older teen. They could be the perfect gift for a woman of any age. Any woman would feel like a princess wearing them. I do.<br />I bought them for myself to commemorate a special milestone in my life, and every time I wear them, I am reminded of that special day.<br />They are special earrings. Love the bling factor. Very sparkly. They are more for evening, but I'm the type of woman who wears them with blue jeans and fancy blouse.<br />:)"
4.0,"This is a really pretty watch, with a nice large face. I'm a woman who really loves wearing large men's watches, so I was very excited when I saw this attractive watch at such an affordable price!<br /><br />The watch comes packaged in a cook cardboard box, which says, &#34;frustration free &#34; on it, which it is! I did not have to wrestle with any hard plastic packaging. I also really liked that the packaging was recyclable. Everything was nicely wrapped, so the watch arrived unscathed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the watch doesn't come with directions. I had no trouble figuring out how to set the time on the watch, as it is one of those &#34;pull out to set time&#34; models. I eventually figured out that having the knob pulled out half way will change the day of the week. I didn't figure out until this morning how to do the date. Initially it was just one day ahead, but this morning it is right on. I think my watch is twelve hours off, and that by 8:00 tonight, it will switch to the next date. If my theory is correct, then I just have to keep twirling the time until I get to the correct date. I will update once I know. It is the lack of directions (in the box or on the Internet) that caused me to remove one star.<br /><br />This has kept time very well, and looks great! The ticking is not extremely loud. The band is very comfortable and easy to buckle. This is a good watch for men or women, at a decent price."
4.0,It is a shame that it's copper so if you wear it for to long it will turn your skin color green. But other than that I love it.
4.0,"These pants fit incredibly well for an online purchase. I like the material, not so much a denim but certainly sturdier than a legging. My butt does look great in them. They are true to size. My only complaint is that I cannot for the life of me understand why we keep making women's pants with fake front pockets. The back ones are functional, but I don't want to have to carry a purse for my keys and phone."
4.0,The product arrived quickly and fits as expected. Happy customer.
4.0,"This swimsuit is really pretty...  I'm a 36dd and there's not a lot of support and it's kinda small in the breast area too ... other than that,  it's nice ... maybe for someone with smaller breast.. I just wished it was fitting for me."
4.0,"Very cute with a bit of ironing.  The material feels a little stiff, but it looks cute."
4.0,"This dress is super cute! It &#34;lays&#34; nicely on me, and I have large breasts. I have a waist belt, but my boobs look ridiculously huge with it on. The dress was a little underwhelming when I took it out of the box. The armpit area is a little tight. But I'm definitely going to be wearing this a lot! One reviewer said it was see through, but I don't have that issue."
4.0,Really like the color and material...wish the jacket was longer
4.0,"No kid wore one for more than 15 seconds.  But hey, it‚Äôs a flat piece of card stock with an elastic string.  They were appreciated"
4.0,For the price it is very nice and just as pictured on website.  I do not know how it will last but do not intend to wear often.
4.0,"The V is deep which is fine, but I was wearing it to a wedding and wanted to dance without concerns (Mother of the Groom) So I pinned it. I got lots of compliments on how flowy/pretty it was. I did add a crop shoulder &#34;sweaterlette&#34; over it."
4.0,A couple of these look cheap but overall they're super cute and look really pretty on
4.0,Returned too small for what I wanted for work (pocketbook and tote combined).
4.0,It‚Äôs the perfect key ring for my 72 fastback.
4.0,I like that they fit perfectly and are slip resistant. Very waterproof. The insoles could be more comfortable
4.0,Been wearing them constantly for a week and have had no issue with tarnishing or discoloration. The engraving is deep and dark and the fact that it's a bit adjustable is nice. I just wish the inside message was on the outside like on the bottom of the ring.<br /><br />Update:  had my ring for a while now and discovered the black had started to come off.  The wording is carved fairly deeply so if it does dissapear completely you should still be able to read it.
4.0,"Fabric is lovely, very comfortable, dress flows smoothly and drapes gracefully. I have long arms and the Sleeves are just a little short for me, Runs slightly large, but belt takes up the slack."
4.0,fit me like mid shorts length which I like it that it‚Äôs not too short for me. The cross sided helped me hid my tummy. I bought this for a beach vacation and I can‚Äôt wait to wear it. I still haven‚Äôt washed it so I don‚Äôt know if material will remain the same shape.
4.0,No arch support! Poor quality. Thin.
4.0,This is very comfy to wear all day. Thin materiel but not see through. The chest area was loose? I need to wear a tank top under it & will be perfect. I had to pin the dress to my bra to keep it from showing more then I wanted.
4.0,I like it but I bought it for my mother in-law and it is too short. I which you can make it a little longer with the same closure
4.0,I love the colors and the emblem but I have to say I really wish it was longer and thicker. It's really quite thin.
4.0,Great dress for the price! A little shorter then pictures but not too bad.
4.0,"Just a tad bit heavy, but seem well manufactured. 'IF' the lens doesn't easily scratch I'll have these for awhile"
4.0,"form fitting, very high thigh slit, still not sure what to do with the ties."
4.0,"This skirt is super cute but it was a little bit loose in the waist and also a bit longer than I was expecting. Great quality! I think that the color is a bit lighter than it is in the photos, which is what I was hoping for."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress, it just didnt fit me."
4.0,"love this dress but my granddaughter has to wear a tank top under it because the waistband itches her. other than that, it looks great!"
4.0,I got this for my 9 year old for Christmas and another for my 5 year old. We‚Äôve made many trips to Lake a Michigan for Rock and she‚Äôll hunting and I thought these were so awesome. They both loved reviving their necklace and have worn them on multiple occasions already. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll have them on more often once warmer weather gets here. Over all I highly recommend these for anyone that loves aquatic things like this.
4.0,"Very nice traditional-style leather dopp kit.  Lightweight, nice lining, rather pricey but feels more upscale (despite somewhat thin leather) than cheaper ones.  Will it last?  Aside from a little higher-end feel and look, whether it lasts long will be the real test."
4.0,"I like it very much. It is delicate and lovely. I wish both sides were polished. One stays darker than the other which is not great when it turns over on its own sometimes. I tried to polish it, but it did not work."
4.0,"SUPER CUTE. Fabric is nice.  Looks like the picture.  Bottom fit a little big but top is somewhat  too small - I got a medium, I'm a 34D. Normally, I'm 4 to 6. The bottoms don't bother me but I'm a little self conscious of the boobs busting out"
4.0,"I really love the quality of this item except the sizing. A lot of reviewers are saying that the item's sizing is somewhat small but not to me. I usually wear a size XS or S and this is just bit bigger for me. It is lose on the top but i can get away with it if i wear a padded bra but my main concern is the hips area, really meant curvy women and being Asian with a skinny dancers body, this didn't work out for me...but i would recommend to others who are on the curvy side."
4.0,Straps are a bit big
4.0,Good flexible loose fit for the gym. Perfect for yoga and are just long enough in the legs to not create a public spectacle when spreading you legs.<br /><br />The material is what I call 80s mesh and I was a little surprised that they weren‚Äôt more high tech. I‚Äôm not picking though.
4.0,Red part of the hat is made of a tightly woven shiny fabric that I don't like that much. Other than that it's great
4.0,"I really like these bracelets. The black string bracelet is very thin. There is a bead that secures pushes up securing the bracelet. It is not a good mechanism as it comes loose pretty often. I have found the bracelet on the floor after taking off my jacket. It gets caught in my jacket easily and the clasp is not strong enough to secure it. So, be careful and mindful.<br /><br />I love the fact that the message is in Morse code and therefore not a whole lot of people will know what it says. It makes for a great gift. The beads are gold plated in 14k gold.<br /><br />The bracelet comes in a ready to gift box.<br /><br />I think any aunt would love this (I do), especially a new one. I imagine this would be a great reveal gift for a new aunt. Telling her it is Morse code and she needs to figure out what it says."
4.0,Cute dress and nice fabric. I'm nursing a baby and currently have a little bit of a fuller bust. The dress gapped a little too much in the bust area so I had to return it.
4.0,"The earrings are really pretty, but a lot smaller than I anticipated.  They are still nice for everyday wear."
4.0,"Much nicer belt than I expected.  I was pleasantly surprised to open the bag and smell the new leather smell.  The prongs on the buckle down seem a bit too slim, thus I'll deduct one star."
4.0,"Very pretty. However, I've been wearing it for 3 hours, and already a pearl has fallen off. One was already at the bottom of the package.<br />I recommend everybody superglue or hotglue gun the pearls in place before wearing it anywhere."
4.0,"Very comfy material, not see through, fits pretty well but the legs do seems to ride up into my knee. I'm 5'10&#34; so I refer Capri length and overall I'd recommend these."
4.0,Really tiny but good for my 10 year old.  Seem to lock securely.  Not sure yet if they will cause irritation or tarnish.  Will update review if they do.  Arrived quickly and we're packaged well.
4.0,"Really pretty. The neckline is slightly higher than in the picture/ I expected so it has a little more of a modest look, but all together it‚Äôs really pretty and I am happy with the purchase especially considering the price."
4.0,"I bought these gloves because I walk outside and my hands were really cold in regular winter gloves. I walk in the cold for at least 30 to 60 minutes at a time in 30's to 40's temperatures. They have been keeping my hands warm. I didn't give them 5 stars for several reasons.  Once my hands got cold wearing them on a windy cold day after about 20 minutes and the touch screen doesn't work very well. Although they keep your hands warm, not for me up to -30. I only got them slightly wet from rain once so I didn't rate the water resistance. I am a women and they are a little bulky. I am happy with them."
4.0,"I got the flowers and butterfly pattern. The colors are just as pictured, very vibrant and pretty. The material is soft. The fit against the stomach is perfect, it looks like a fitted look but still somehow manages to be flattering and hide problem spots. (I'm 5'2"" and 120 lbs and got a medium.) The only issue is the breast part, I'm not sure if it's because of the underwire and I'm just not used to it, but there was something off about it. I think adjusting the straps may help or, I may need to go down a size and get a small. Overall, for the price, I'm pleased with it."
4.0,Product is good. Delivery timing sucked.
4.0,"It‚Äôs perfect for lounging or making errands, but for us girls with thick thighs it‚Äôs a little bothersome. I used these a lot at the gym, I enjoy the comfort and stretchiness. But hate that it does start riding up half way through a set of whatever exercise I‚Äôm doing, or if I‚Äôm on the bike, elliptical, stair master, rowing machine, ect. It‚Äôll ALWAYS ride up so I have to stop and keep readjusting every few seconds.<br /><br />I did get what I paid for I suppose."
4.0,Super soft and cozy.  For them to wear around the house.
4.0,"Love the suit. Very comfortable. Looks great on except the top is a big and feels stretched out. The pads are very small, I replaced with my own, but not supportive."
4.0,"Super cute. Definitely calmed my curls, less frizzy and more definition. The only thing is that it has fallen off at night. Could just be my tossing and turning but it's a bummer."
4.0,I love the sunglasses. but it does make things look weird. it has a slight orange ish tint to them. I would have to say the only down side is that while driving the color distortion. red lights are well really bright red. yellow lights look lime green. and well green lights don't exist in the sunlight. I have not tried them at night or during low sunlight conditions. but they are nice. also doesn't seem to matter how bright it is outside. you never have to squint. it looks the same weather its sunny or cloudy.
4.0,"The product was very good in itself. My daughter loved The reason for 4 stars is that on the second use, the stitching of the ear came off from the strap and its a flap now."
4.0,Brought for my 8 year old child.
4.0,"This didn't fit me all flowy like the picture, but that might be my body type or I'm just too big for the dress. I still wear it because the fabric is comfortable. I layer it with something else on top. On me, you can see the bunched up pockets because the dress is too snug on my body. If I were smaller, this might fit me better. Order bigger and you will likely be happy."
4.0,"It was somewhat large compared to the measurements, but I'd rather have it be too large than too small. The construction is pretty good for this price and materials are pretty decent and opaque. There was not much of a waist even though it looks like there should be in the photo; it's pretty boxy at the top. The red of the skirt, however, is NOT the bright red I thought it'd be. It's more of a bright pinky-orange color. Not a bad color, per say, but I had wanted red."
4.0,Good strap for the price
4.0,"This dress was a great deal, especially being made to my measurements at no additional fee. The designer was in good communication with me but unfortunately since I just had a baby two weeks prior to measuring/ordering, the dress was still a little off. I had to tug at my straps most of the time that I wore it and it wasn't able to be altered once arrived without re-doing the whole bodice. It's not really the fault of the person who made the dress, so I would recommend to others!"
4.0,This is a very nice dress. Nice material. Good quality. The sizing chart is no where near right! According to the sizing chart it runs big...NOT! Do not size down according to measurements. Otherwise...very nice purchase!
4.0,"I liked that is lined and that it had a hoodie. The problem is that I can't use the hoodie because it runs small. It only comes up half way to my toddler's head. Nice quality, I should have ordered a size up."
4.0,"Love them...well made. A bit pricey, but I still purchased them to wear to a race."
4.0,Fits my 1 year old daughter perfect!
4.0,Bulky.
4.0,Gave these for Christmas and my brother loved them! Said they worked &#34;bad ass&#34;!
4.0,Great fot and perfect for hair protection!!!
4.0,"Would have been perfect if I hadn't got to the second row of hooks at my first go. Still, great material."
4.0,"Beautiful costume jewelry. Not meant for everyday use but prefect for occasional use (will tarnish if wet). Caution: the smallest chain is meant for small, thin neck sizes. It may not fit you if you have a chubby neck."
4.0,"They are pretty comfortable, despite the fact that they don‚Äôt fit me and kinda fall off half of them time. They‚Äôre still really cute and I love them a whole lot!"
4.0,The original photo makes trim look like it‚Äôs gold but it‚Äôs really a taupe color. I am ok with it!! I thought the fabric would be a little heavier.
4.0,"Great running shorts for the price. I‚Äôm personally not a fan of mesh-lined shorts. However, the mesh in these isn‚Äôt too bad."
4.0,This is a very cute one piece jumpsuit. Fits my body very well except sleeve length is mid arm. Very stretchy and soft material.
4.0,"I received my mittens yesterday (really fast delivery with Prime. I wore them for the first time today. I have to say they were super soft for faux fur and gripped the wheel better than I thought they would. I thought the lack of ""leather"" on the palms would make the steering wheel slippery, it wasn't. I only gave 4 stars because they are so new to me, the 5th star will be earned if they hold up to every day use. Additionally the temp was a mild (New England) 37 degrees, so not sure how they'll hold up to the true cold yet."
4.0,Stone is larger than expected but so beautiful for the price. Would recommend 10/10 ! This also comes in a cute little box as well.
4.0,"The only negative I have found is that the lenses don't quite cover "" my "" lenses , but that isn't due to the design of these sun glass lenses .  It is because of the way the top of my prescription frame is designed .  There is a bar across the top of my prescription glass frame that prevents the sun glass lenses from resting where they are supposed to on the frame . Other than that , they are pretty decent removable sun glass lenses ."
4.0,"We bought a medium for my wife who is slender but she could not even zip it up.  We exchanged for a large and it's still pretty snug.  I know it's supposed to be aerodynamic so just watch your sizes.  It is a very cool jacket, especially with the thumb holes."
4.0,Was a little short but good
4.0,This jacket it quite warm for a lightweight jacket. I'm very happy with it and like that it takes the ridgid batteries. I would give it 5 stars if there were heated areas. They are only on the chest and back. That being said the existing areas get super warm and the battery lasted well over 3 hours on medium heat.
4.0,"This bag was really cute and well made, but a little small.  The bag made a perfect gift because of what it said."
4.0,good quality fun tshirt.  I thought it said Rockin' it at bottom - says Rockin't it.  Thought was misprint when tshirt received but that is what it says in the picture.  Rockin' it makes more sense to me.  Still fun though!
4.0,I absolutely love these pants! The only problem I have with them is the fact that if I fold them the print will stick together and it'll mess up. Even when I received the item the print was a bit cracked and sticked together. But aside from that they fit perfectly.
4.0,Material is good. Dress has a a lot of stretch and  very comfortable. Not see through.
4.0,I like the style of earrings. very comfortable and light.
4.0,"Fits snug on a man with a normal size head. Would be careful if ordering for someone with a larger head. Good quality, but a bit thin for the price."
4.0,"This is a very pretty ring! Ordered it & then was afraid to wear it as I worked in the receiving department of a big box hardware store at the time & was afraid the top of the stone would get scratched. Didn't have it long enough to see if it would, because unfortunately one of the smaller stones around the garnet fell out after wearing it for less than 6 hours, so I didn't have worry about scratching the large garnet stone. Contacted the company & sent it back almost immediately, which was a shame because it really is a gorgeous ring. Due to where I worked, I opted to replace it with a ring with a smaller stone, which isn't as pretty overall. I would definitely order it again & hope for a better outcome now that I no longer work in a hardware store."
4.0,Beautiful. Just the long shirt I was looking for.<br />Can behave somewhat static.<br />Can be used as casual or dressy shirt.<br />I wish they had more colors for a winter skin personality.
4.0,Yes material is nice sleeves were a little short but other than that it's ok
4.0,"The skirt was very cute and the colors were very saturated and vibrant, but it was just way too long and too big round the waist for me. I'm 5'2&#34; and to have it hemmed would've ruined the lines of the skirt."
4.0,"This swimsuit is a nice addition to my wardrobe. I love the colors of the one I got, black and green. It fits my style perfectly and is different than the other swimming suits that I own.<br /><br />The v in the front is rather low so you need to be comfortable showing off a little skin while wearing this swimsuit. The skirt is super cute and helps cover up your but and hips if that is something you want to do. It is held up with ties at the neck and back so be careful if you have children or friend that like to untie things :)!<br /><br />The only think I did not like about the swimsuit is that the padding in the breast area was a little off and too thick. It made getting the fit a little difficult. I will wear this swimsuit, but I just wish that the area was improved.<br /><br />I was given a discount on this product to provide an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Super cute on. Have worn it to a wedding and work. Its a bit wornout where my keys rub which stinks. But overall I love it.
4.0,"I really like this swimsuit, like REALLY LIKE IT.  It seems to be good quality material.  I'm usually between a L and XL in American sizing, and after reading the reviews where some people suggested sizing down, I went with the XL to be safe.  I was *technically* able to get it on, but it's still too tight, even with all of the laces loosened.  I've already began the return process, but I would order an XXL in a heartbeat if they had it for this price."
4.0,These are a little snug.  Otherwise they're great.
4.0,"Fit was good, baby can still remove them though."
4.0,These hats are great but you have to assemble them yourself and the string is quite a bit too tight for adult heads. Other than that they are perfect!
4.0,It makes a difference
4.0,Well made! Gorgeous pattern. True to size
4.0,Wife liked them.
4.0,Honestly so much more flattering than I hoped. The deep v is a perfect length on my body and I love that there is a defined waist while still being flowy and maxi length. The blue is a bright robins egg blue which is fun for a summer aesthetic.  The puff sleeves balance out the whole look without looking uneven or like they're broadening my shoulders. Love love love!
4.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful set but it runs small
4.0,bag is pretty decent size.  the only problem is the zipper on the top.  Sometimes it is stuck because of the lining that in inside the bag.  The outer two pockets didn't close or button properly. It didn't snap.
4.0,"I like the pockets and the arm holes aren't too big, which is nice. But the fabric is pretty thick. And it faded pretty quickly. The pockets are nice."
4.0,Super cute dress ! Love the wrap design so u can adjust for a perfect fit. This is a thin material but not really see through. Perfect for work and hot days. It is a bit long but I just wear heels with it
4.0,Came a tad crooked but still really nice & sturdy glasses ! Looking forward to wearing them
4.0,I had a few dozen of this type of storage box.<br />I wanted to get more and I had made a few shelves and dividers for what I had<br />these are well made ..but smaller then the stated size .
4.0,I love almost everything about this dress. The fabric is soft and the color is üòç. Perfect for spring even summer. The only problem is this dress is a little big so order a size down
4.0,Love this dress... i am 5&#34;1 and 116 lbs.. good thing im a bit cuvry in the rear for the dress sake.. im dlat chested so top part is a bit loose.. but over all fits nice could be tighter in chest area...
4.0,"I purchased this dress for my niece - birthday bash. Size 4. She's 5'7 - 125lbs, 32-34 bust. She has a great model shape at 15. The dress fit but the top part was too large since she has no boobs. Also, there was a small seam on the side that had open. Besides that, the dress is very pretty and fit the birthday theme party. I was happy overall with my purchase. The price was also good and I got it quick with Amazon Prime."
4.0,I gave it a four but actually love these pants they're thin lightweight very stylish that's my favorite part! Appeared to be good quality Fabric and stitching!
4.0,Everything was good except the shoe covers was too small. Had to cut the back. I‚Äôm around 5‚Äô10 with an average build and XL fit me just fine. But was a little loose (easy fix)... otherwise GREAT costume. Quality is AMAZING though
4.0,"maybe I just needed to size up. the quality on this is fine, but i ended up sending it back because the crew neck is really tight. I don't like it when i feel like sweatshirts are choking me."
4.0,"Delicate soft styling , Chain was very nice"
4.0,"They fogged up.<br /><br />Update: I was sent a new pair of goggles by the vendor as a replacement for the ones that fogged up. The new goggles were perfectly fog-free the first time I used them. Since then, they fog up for about 20 minutes with each use before clearing up. These goggles aren't perfect, but I will continue using them. The vendor does have excellent customer service!"
4.0,It is a very nice neckless. Love it!
4.0,Great price but easily worn out if your baby is still new to the walking world.
4.0,Attractive design but is lightweight.. i would buy as a gift!
4.0,"The dress did not fit well, was very fitting to the body."
4.0,"Material is a great heavy weight, the color was exactly like the picture.  I would have preferred it a few inches longer, but it worked for what I needed."
4.0,"This bathing suite is so adorable. I am giving it a 4 star, only because it is a bit large. I purchase the 3xl as it stated it would be equal to a 14-16 in US sizing. However, I did order a new size, xxl (US 12-14)  which I believe will be a perfect fit. It is so adorable that I just had to order a new one. I plan to gift this one to a friend. I am a very curvy lady as well as modest (that is why I choose not to post photos).<br />Pros: Did I say adorable?!<br />The fabric is very soft, comfortable and flattering.<br />I have an hour glass kinda figure (curvy chest, smaller waist and hippy). This fits my figure to perfection. I am normally very shy about wearing a swim suite in public, but I look forward to our next pool trip for this outfit :).<br />I am a wonder woman fan and proud American (so this is the best color combo).<br />Bright and beautiful colors.<br />I am just completely in love with this product. I plan to review the smaller size when it comes in, so stay tuned for an update.<br />Cons:<br />FYI ( I am a US size 16 - and only gave this a 4 star because it is on the larger side)."
4.0,"The bottom is nice and cushy, pretty comfortable really.  The strap parts are a little confining.  Maybe because they are new or maybe because the top of my foot is fatter than normal people.  I like the color and the comfort.  I will just keep wearing them and see if they stretch out a bit.  I got them as a shoe to leave by the front door so I could just jump in them when I need to do a quick errand outside.  My folks are having a few health issues and live right next door to me on our five acres.  If they call with an emergency, I want to be able to slip my feet in and go."
4.0,Runs a little small. Nice quality.
4.0,I love these cuff links and they look good with my blouses.
4.0,"These are cute but much smaller than they look in the picture --they are about the size of a dime - but still cute nonetheless. Now that I know their size, I would buy again for a different use."
4.0,Love the jacket but I should have order a smaller size.
4.0,What I like is the fit and the easability of changing lenses- all colors of lenses work and are useful- what I don‚Äôt like is that the nose doesn‚Äôt stay securely on and pops off on one side- other than that they‚Äôre great
4.0,"I chose this little cutie because of the Rosette embellishment, but I love it for its functionality.  I'm not a big purse person, so this &#34;wallet on a string&#34; lets me have everything I need for a quick outing in one small package.  The pockets in the back are great for ID a debit card and couple of $20s.  Just what you need for an informal outing!  I get compliments on it all the time.  And the two straps, one short, one long, are great too."
4.0,the dress is nice but fits small. Junior size and the quality is not that great. but the seller was great and the dress came fast.
4.0,"My son loves this item ,,, he wishes it was more stylish but he says they are perfect inside his snowmobile helmet"
4.0,These are so comfy. Fits just right and look awesome. I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars cuz the pink is slightly translucent and I can see my bra under it but other than that I love these. I‚Äôm gonna order more I‚Äôm sure.
4.0,The other bridesmaids at the wedding ordered the same dress and theirs went down to their ankles but mine was above the knee and I got an XL. It was weird to me that it was so short on me and the others were so long on the other girls. Made the wedding pictures with bridesmaids look terrible!
4.0,"Get a side larger than you wear. It's beautiful, I'm curvy and wear a large. Needed extra, but it was beautiful."
4.0,But it's not for me.
4.0,"Very good quality fabric and well made. The top fits perfectly, but the bottoms are really big."
4.0,I love these but would like for the material too not be so attracted to fuzzies and fur magnets. The waist was a bit loose/baggy but not too bad that it was noticeable.
4.0,"Nice roomy wallet, but does smell bad inside.  Other then the nasty odor, I like this wallet.  The zippers do stick slightly..."
4.0,"Cute affordable dress, but arm holes are too big."
4.0,Love the flowers detail
4.0,"These pants are great. I love the bow tie detail at the bottom. These fall above the ankle on my (5'5"") and fit great in the waist. However they are a little baggy overall. I wish they were a little more form fitting, but other than that they are great."
4.0,"Daughter lover these. Very cute and the markers worked well. Her only complaint is that there aren't enough colors. The design definitely calls for yellow, and the marker in there is pretty orange. So I've got to go buy a yellow fabric marker now.<br /><br />Still, they are pretty cute and I would buy them again."
4.0,My sapphire fell out after wearing this for 8 months... I'm disappointed because this is my wedding ring. The prongs kept getting stuck on things
4.0,"The costume was really good.  My husband wore it on Purim and it looked just the way it should. Other than it being a bit flimsy, it fit well.  He put a small beach ball inside the hat so it would stay up.  The product's quality is definitely not intended for long term use, but is just fine to wear on special occasions once in a while."
4.0,"Awesome looking, works great !! fit and quality are top of the line, grey matches &#34;natural&#34; titanium perfectly"
4.0,"Coucot Yoga Leggings. Coucot claims they have newly designed these yoga leggings based on the anatomy of the human body, and their knowledge of leggings. They are 77% Polyester, 23% Spandex, made with bartack technology and ‚ÄúFour Needle six lines‚Äù, to create a brushed hand feel, four-way stretchy fabric.  The makers state that their leggings are thicker than most other  pants, thick enough to be squat proof, non-see-through. They add that the high waist elasticized waistline will offer some tummy control without discomfort.  Two pockets. They have  a 1-year replacement warranty. I find these leggings are attractive, fit comfortably, suitable for around the house or athletic wear."
4.0,Me llev√© de los cent√≠metros que dec√≠a all√≠ pero sali√≥ mas grande
4.0,"Almost 5 stars! These sit too low with typically pierced ear lobes. The post on the earring that goes in your ear lobe, is at the top of the elephant earring causing it to hang low and just not look right. They are, however, absolutely beautiful!! I got so many compliments when I wore them but a few friends did agree that they were sitting on my ears weird. I'll still wear them, though!"
4.0,i liked the color and it was only available in a small. i am 5' 98#. it is a bit large to wear out but more than comfortable to lounge in. will have to order a different on smaller.
4.0,They are very soft and comfortable and warm
4.0,Purchased for my teenage granddaughter. They are very petite and small so I think they are better for younger girls. It‚Äôs hard to tell that the earrings are cat faces due to the size. I love the box they came it. Makes it easier to wrap for presents.
4.0,"Wish there was a size chart to help determine the correct size.  The chart is on the box that the stockings came in, doesn't help at all when ordering for the first time."
4.0,"Too big, in the pic they look a lot smaller."
4.0,"I‚Äôm obsessed with the pattern.  The socks are warm & comfortable ‚Äî I‚Äôm not so sure about the long-term durability, but I‚Äôve only wore them once so far.  My only complaint is that I don‚Äôt like how the socks bunch up at the top of the sock.  They kept sliding down my shins, which felt a little uncomfortable."
4.0,"These socks fit nicely & the color is exactly as pictured. They feel like good, strong socks to wear out hiking or playing sports. They fit my 14yr old very well. They wash up nicely."
4.0,Cute shortalls!
4.0,"Quality is AMAZING. Only problem is that unless you have NO cheat at all, good luck even getting this on. Luckily my baby sister took the hand me down. It's embroidered so it looks great in person and not cheap at all"
4.0,This was purchased it as a gift for my grandson and he is really thrilled to have it.
4.0,"My husband likes it. It runs large. I wear a large right now, I'm usually a medium, size 9/10 women's and now I'm probably a 12ish because of Covid. So I bought originally an XL by accident, it was huge, so I returned for a Navy Large. I still feel it is fine/ a bit large (like a medium would hold the girls in a bit better, but overall a decent size). It's sexy, material isn't bad, a little wrinkly. It NEEDS POCKETS. Comfy, material isn't itchy, long enough to cover things. Overall, pretty nice."
4.0,"The band fitted nicely. It's keeping it's color so far. It has a nice heavy feel. It was a good buy, like it so far!"
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 140 pounds and have an athletic build. The large was a tiny bit loose and drapey but I think it fits properly. The fabric is light and breezy and comfortable.<br /><br />Like one reviewer mentioned the pockets make the hips of the dress flare out. I sewed the seams closed and removed the pockets and it is much better. The print is adorable without being cutesy and the cut is flattering.<br />The dress is very short.
4.0,"It is a loose stretchy cotton material and I wanted it to fit pretty tight so it was a little too large for what I wanted. I usually wear a size 14, but the measurement guide showed me at an 18 so that's what I ordered. I didn't know if it was one of those Chinese sized dresses that is super small so I went with what it said. It was an American size dress. I should have gone with the 14. It is a cute dress!"
4.0,"Love these charms, only thing is it came with a cloth in the pouch that REEKED of stinky perfume. Threw it away!"
4.0,Son loves his new shirt!
4.0,The color is great. The case is easy to put together. I have had this case for approximately 1.5 months and the  part that covers the on/off button broke. I am rather displeased but only on that one issue.
4.0,It's really see through. I thought the dress would be a little thicker. It's actually super cute and it's above the knee. I'm 5'0 so that was a plus. Will be great for summer.
4.0,Super cute. But I didn't know they were gonna be clip on.
4.0,"lightweight fabric, fits as expected."
4.0,The top is not like I pictured it. Well at least the bottoms fit. Husband loved it. I guess that's what counts.
4.0,"They slip off my glasses and have to be tightened often,"
4.0,"This is one of my favorite dresses to wear with leggings.  It is breezy and comfy.  I've washed it several times and it hasn't faded yet.  It gets really static-clingy when it is windy, but that is really my only complaint."
4.0,These are exactly what I wanted- super tiny.<br />The back is a tiny screw on that is really hard to put on.
4.0,Very pretty for Christmas outfit.  Looking forward to wearing them in a few months.
4.0,I used this product to display a hat with a famous actor‚Äôs autograph.
4.0,Nice and tight if that's what you like. I ordered a small.
4.0,This backpack is smaller than expected. However it is very deep allowing a 5&#34; binder plus small books. It would work better for elementary students than high school.
4.0,Too thin will not give much warmth....
4.0,"Besides the &#34;funny&#34; smell to this, customer is cute, wish the stars didn't fold maybe should have been rigid so the keep shape. Wonder Woman logo is too small, overall I lik it and grand loves it!!"
4.0,"Fit well, looked good at the work party. Wore with a tulle underskirt and it was a fun, pretty look. Wasn't spectacular or anything, but I was happy. Good quality."
4.0,I bought it as a gift. They really liked it but I was expecting it to be a bit thicker. It seems to be a little thin.
4.0,"These fit as expected and are very comfortable.  The only comment I have is that they almost remind me of wearing a sports bra so my girls are kind of just held down, which is great for comfort sake, but it does tend to make my shape look not as appealing in normal shirts.  Get them for the comfort, but definitely not to make yourself feel attractive when going out and about.  I'll likely wear these at home or if I'm not doing anything important :)"
4.0,it &#34;feels&#34; less comfy than I expected as the weave is sort of open. But I'm told it looks really great. I like a heavier feel to a sweater... but that's just me.
4.0,"The lock is sturdy. It is easy to set the combination. I did notice that it doesn't fit well on my Honda Rebel...needs to be just a tiny bit bigger, to work on the diameter of frame tubing, where I want to use it."
4.0,Cute summery nightie! Fits true to size. Washes well. Shorts are really short. Not see- though.
4.0,"The key pendant is beautiful, even though the leather necklace is way too short for something of that size. I ended up buying a 26&#34; silver chain and it look better."
4.0,"...so I took those off and will use them on other projects. The finish is very beautiful., but the best is the strength of the magnet clasp. It should hold a fairly heavy necklace or bracelet. Very nice."
4.0,Lettering very small
4.0,It was a gift for my mom and she loves it!  Red is her favorite color
4.0,Really is very comfortable. Looks better on than picture.
4.0,"Skinny was a little on the skinny side for me, real tight in the thieghs so if you got cyclist thieghs, maybe look for something else.  Really comfy tho and stretchy"
4.0,This is such a vibrant color top and I look forward to wearing it out during the month of October.  The material is not too light and not heavy at all that it is perfect for this early fall weather we are experiencing.  It is a little small (like an inch) for a 2XL size but It is not tight at all.  The design and colors are very nice and are on both sides front and back so it is an all over design.  The sleeves are as stated 3/4 right below the elbow.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes Halloween.
4.0,"Really pretty, but the shaft is too long for my ears"
4.0,Very flowy and comfy. Can't wait to wear it this summer.
4.0,"I really liked this wig, for what it was ... for an Egyptian costume.  The quality of the wig is so-so ... but, the texture of the hair and cut and so forth is exactly what it should be for an Egyptian look.  For the price, you can't beat it."
4.0,I would order a larger size in the future
4.0,A little big but looks cute and good material.
4.0,"XL fits like a Med/Sm bodycon. If you do not want it to cling order up. I usually wear a size 12 or a large, 36DD. The dress is pretty though. The material is on the thin side. I will order a larger size (like 2-3 sizes up!)."
4.0,"pretty good value. Classified as mid weight, it still seemed a little thinner than other products in this category, but it is a good value for the price, and has a good feel to it."
4.0,"Great fit, and comfortable all day long.  Easy to pull on and off, too.  Very pleased."
4.0,"if anyone thinks these are supposed to be tight, they're not, it's not that they're large, they're just not meant to stick to your body, i use them underneath a flowy black skirt because it's a little see through and thats the only use i can think of.. or you could like sleep in them or just walk around in your underwear but you can't really wear them underneath pants"
4.0,"I bought this for my sister. she loves it , but its a bit small."
4.0,"It's a really nice jacket, very comfy and flattering. I ordered a size up, and it's just right (if I had gotten my usual size, it would have been a little too tight for what I was looking for). My only complaint is that it didn't come with the cuff that pulled over your hands when you're cold, it was advertised that it's there, but it's not on mine."
4.0,"I disliked that it did not come with two new pins for attachment, most other bands come with new pins and are less expensive. This would have made it a lot easier to install as old pins had did not spring open or pop into place easily."
4.0,The hat is very cute. I got a lot of compliments on it and it was very sturdy and convenient when i had bad hair days lol. It wasnt expected to be anything fancy but it was what i expected.  Worth what i paid for it. Very trendy. Its worth the buy.
4.0,"I use safety pins to keep the chest area from dropping too low. This dress is comfy and cute and I wore it in Hawaii and loved it. My only warning is that if it's windy, the slit can open completely so be aware!"
4.0,It‚Äôs pretty but the eye part seems very thin and dainty
4.0,"fits me well and I'm pretty big in the bum and tummy region. Doesnt slip down so you wont be showing off your plumbers arse, thong or granny knickers depending on your day. Only complaint I have is that even washing in cold wash they didnt look that great after just one wash. Cheap looking"
4.0,Pictures or lighting on pictures so bright hard to see work
4.0,Beautiful set. It's brighter on line. A little darker than I expected.
4.0,Its the only sandal I could find that I could insert my own orthotics.<br />The inserts fit in well and don't come out. The shoe itself is quite confy<br />so far and I think will hold up well over time.
4.0,It‚Äôs a good quality bag and great for the price. But it really shouldn‚Äôt be marketed as a laptop bag. It‚Äôs really just a big purse that a laptop could fit in. I wish it had a designated pocket or section actually for a laptop to keep it from bouncing around in the purse. But otherwise it works.
4.0,Daughter loves it was on small side
4.0,A little see through but still so cute! The color sets are not see through though! Also the shipping took a long time but worth it
4.0,"This dress is such a cute pattern and cut!  I just wish it was finished a little better and with a slightly thicker material or had a liner. My daughter wore this on a hot summer day and she was cute and comfortable surely however once the kids started playing with the misters the dress became completely see through. Whoops!  The finishing within the inner seams also aren‚Äôt great which wouldn‚Äôt be noticeable except they are very visible in the arm pit area. I do really like this dress, and my daughter loves it, it‚Äôs just not the best quality."
4.0,"My daugter says, it is very comfortable, but it came a little bit smaller than expected."
4.0,"Being a 5 month portpartum mommy my weight is yo-yoing a lot. I still cannot wear my favorite jeans but that doesn't mean that I can't help boosting my self esteem by wearing flattering clothes in the meant time. The fact that this is cheap is great bc I don't want to spend too much money on clothes that I will not wear very long but anyways I know I will still be able to wear these after my weight goes back to what it was (if it ever does lol if not well I'll just continue wearing those). I like how it is a high waist legging, I feel that it is keeping my tummy flatter and doesn't roll down like I have experienced with low waist leggings. It also doesn't show your bottom when you sit down if you know what I mean they stay in place and are very cumfy. Not too light weight to see through but not too heavy. I live in So Cal and so far I don't feel too warm in these (thow it's still spring)<br />The only negative thing is that the printed holes really look fake as well as the waist button. I would recommend you to buy the one with no holes and wear a shirt that goes bellow the waistline to hide the top portion of the jeans.<br />Overall very satisfied."
4.0,"VERY HARD TO FIND CAPS WITH THE 7TH CAVALRY LOGO. GOOD QUALITY, BUT THE LOGO AREA NEEDS TO BE A BIT STIFFER."
4.0,Band gets loose
4.0,Good band for a great price
4.0,Runs small but very comfortable.
4.0,"This is a decent NATO strap. The hardware is pretty nice and the black finish appears fairly durable. You won't be able to scrape it off with a knife, like you can with some cheaper NATO straps. Overall though it wasn't terribly premium. No reason to order this one off unless you really want this color scheme"
4.0,"Good item, I'm keeping it."
4.0,"Very cute dress, fits as expected. The material was a little different than expected but for the cost it is a good value."
4.0,Cute style and great color.  Took off a star because of the way the edges are finished.  If they had turned the edge under (which I am doing) would have been perfect.  Nice fabric.  Top hangs well and is worth the price without a doubt.
4.0,"They seem durable. Pockets are a little weird. Reinforced knees are a plus. The back pockets are weird and pull across my backside. My hope is that they won't cause chafing. The material is a little rough. Maybe with a few washes, they might break in some."
4.0,"It was a beautiful scarf. I did return it though because I am still looking for a bright white scarf and, although it very much LOOKS bright white in the image, it was definitely OFF-white when it arrived. Shame."
4.0,No protection on back for the image
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute dress would like better had it been about $15 cheaper. pretty well made glad I bought it
4.0,"After deciding to just have a courthouse wedding, we were short on time. We wouldn't be able to get the band that matches my engagement ring in time. I found this one and ordered. It arrived before the scheduled date. It fit perfectly under my scroll cathedral halo ring. We've now decided to order a second one for either side, and hold off until our anniversary to get the real thing. I would give five stars if they offered half sizes. Other than that, I couldn't ask for anything more for this price!"
4.0,"It is the size of an Iphone 6 / plus. It is small. it has two pockets and a divider in the front little pocket. It is simple..It's Lightweight. Perfect for Your phone and ID, but  nothing more. Strap is a nice length. The material seems a little cheap, but it will work."
4.0,"These are super cute, love them.<br />only complaint is how often the loop piece that holds the belt down when you're wearing it falls off all the time."
4.0,"Nice simple watch, worked right out of the box, the leather is a bit tough so working it in takes time to correctly mold to your wrist. Just a nice watch to have."
4.0,"It's a beautiful color, it does fit a little large and hangs a little low. But I use it as a dance costume so it worked out ok."
4.0,Nice fit and I love the little shorts
4.0,the under layer is a little tight
4.0,"The fit is what might be called ""tailored"" I'd say.  Kind of slim, but in a stylish way.  It feels good, and has good movability."
4.0,"I really like this necklace, the only negative thing about is the white beads don't quite match the white of the larger bead or &#34;bubbles.&#34; I've worn it multiple times and it seems to be fairly sturdy. Overall, I would recommend it."
4.0,"Im typically a size 6-8 and the size ""regular"" fit but a wee bit odd. There was way too much room in the front and not nearly as much in the rearend. Not to the point of being unwearable but I felt like these were made with someone that had a longer torso and not much of a butt.<br /><br />The fabric while soft is not what I would call ""buttery soft"" as most of us know that is a nod to a pricey name brand in leggings. These are less cotton feel and more brushed ""nylon"" if thats possible, but they are still soft. They are thin although mine weren't particularly see through. However they are thin and not compressive so don't expect these to act like shape wear or to smooth out anything.<br /><br />For the price though they are fun and the print was a soft mosaic that I really like."
4.0,It was kinda short but it fit her just right around the waist. Very happy with it.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f6c8264471aa705f9d7c5bdbee945875]] For the price, this is a pretty good purse. I really like the color. Fairly nicely made. Did my best to video the details. It has a nice front pocket‚Ä¶the zippers work pretty easily. Quite nice for the purse."
4.0,comfortable but I would not call them compression but I am happy with them
4.0,"I love the look of this tunic. Material is thin, so be prepared to deal with that. You can see every bump and strap line. I wear with a sweater. Washes well. Fits one full size larger than expected. 4-stars only due to the thin material, and sizing issue."
4.0,"The low price being said, this boot is perfect for the casual users around the yard, and short hiking trips. The boot is very light weight and takes little breaking in time. I did go up half a size so as to accommodate thicker socks and an insole, and glad I did. Went from a size 10 medium to a 10.5. The inside has no padding at all with the exception of a little around the ankle area, so a thick(er) pair of socks is a good idea. Also, purchase an insole as there is no foot padding either."
4.0,Was hoping the hat would be a tad bigger but it‚Äôs still cute on my 2 year old.
4.0,"Bought size per my measurements, fits a bit small (snug). Straps are adjustable with hooks, come out easily - am going to sew them in place."
4.0,plenty long just not as wide as I hoped
4.0,It's pretty. Got it for granddaughter.
4.0,Not first pair...love these...good quality. Great I j s
4.0,"Fast shipping.  Unfortunately, the color is not quite as depicted.  It is more orange than brown in person. I would have chosen a different color."
4.0,I ordered it too big so it is kind of loose. You should wear a black bra underneath because it is going to show.
4.0,The shoe is comfortable<br />Due to my hammertoe I need to wear socks<br />It took a few days of wearing for the shoes to feel comfortable
4.0,"I bought three of these to mod for a steampunk con. They are easy to work with, rather soft, but can be sewn, glued or otherwise modded.  Inexpensive and wearable for my purposes."
4.0,This is great for for covering ur tummy and creating a defined waistline. It is very streachy I'd recommend sizing down. It's also a bit long I'm 5'3 130 ordered size med
4.0,Received my second set of tank tops and was very impressed with the style and mesh quality that will keep me cool and comfortable. I have a 50 inch chest and the 3XL fit perfectly just the way I like it. Its not tight or snug so order your true size if you want a perfect fit. Go one size smaller if you want a tighter fit. Will definitely order another set of colors.
4.0,"I ordered this dress in size Large and color Black. For reference I'm 5'1&quot;, 125 lbs and measures 34,29,35 and the large size fits me really well. I have to say I really love the fit, style and print of this dress. I think it looks very edgy and stylish. I love how it clings on my body and give me a little bit of shape. The best part is I love the print, it looks very slimming and flattering. Since I'm short, the dress ends a few inches below my knees which I love. It's like a midi length body-con dress on me which I prefer myself. I think this is more of a night time party dress because of color and print. I bet the multi color will look so cool in a bar. So style and fit, I think this is on point.<br /><br />As for the material, the fabric is on the lightweight side and feels like a swimwear fabric. I'm not too thrilled about it but it's not awful either. It's still breathable and actually very comfortable to wear. I'll have to wear a shape-wear when wearing this dress because it's very well fitted.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I'm a 36 D/38 C and I purchased a L. The blue one fit perfectly... but the white seems to be mislabed or incorrectly made- it too small. If I didn't like the blue one so much (and if I hadn't already cut off the tags...) I'd return them. But, considering what I paid for these (essentially 5 a piece), they're good."
4.0,"Nice shirt, light, breathable, moisture-wicking, fits nicely. Nice price. I like it."
4.0,Very thin but I‚Äôm ok with the product so may want to buy up a size
4.0,Gave as a gift. Recipient liked it.
4.0,"I had to buy the large because they did not have a medium. being 5'0 , 120 lbs it is loose but, I don't mind because I have a bit of a stomach from my twins. I still love the material, it is thick yet flows. The only thing is that for shirt girls like me you will have to hem the dress, which is not hard and worth it. Go ahead and buy it, the unique fabric and comfortable style is what we want in a dress."
4.0,"Amazing shirts for black on black uniforms. Light, cool and they do not fade."
4.0,"I really like the dress and ordered a size up, but it's still too small."
4.0,Fit as expected.  Good quality.
4.0,"I like the 90 degrees brand and am very happy with these pants. They are not see through and fit great. They are long (almost to my ankle and I'm 5'3&#34;) -- just something to keep in mind if you like shorter capris. I like these for lifting, but prefer shorter leggings for cardio days."
4.0,Beautiful jacket though. Looks just like the picture. I'm satisfied.
4.0,"After reading other reviews, I ordered 1/2 size smaller than my normal size.  They fit great with a heavy sock, but were real tight at the calf."
4.0,"The beanie itself is actually warmer than expected, sound quality is pretty good, battery life could be a bit better, about 4 and a half hours, not bad though. The only downside is the Velcro that holds the receiver in place cones loose making it loose inside, it don't move much, but enough to make finding the buttons hard to find. Great value for the price though."
4.0,"Color and clarity nice especially for the price.<br />I would say it's not only a good bargain, but also a lovely piece. Very happy with my putchase."
4.0,"These socks are great overall. However, my son is the younger age range for them and they tend to slide down throughout the day and bunch in his shoes. Hoping as he grows that this isn't as much of an issue."
4.0,"This shirt is so so so cute. If it my daughter perfectly, it was very true to size. Once I washed it, there was no shrinkage and I was even able to dry it."
4.0,"Just received my pants today. I will say, the sizing runs a bit small. I am a petite female, 5 foot 105lbs and I bought a 14-16 and they just fit. They are a little snug in the thighs but the waist has room. The length is perfect on me. If you are any bigger, I would size up. Very warm! Overall, great pants. I will be using them for skiing in the next two weeks. I'll update if need be."
4.0,"** Updated Review: I had to update because the seller sent me a new wallet and it was very nice.  Feel confident that if you purchase from them, any issues will be happily fixed.  They have excellent customer service.  Returning the broken one was very easy and I had no problems at all.  (Broken when it arrived so I had to return it. The zipper is really chunky too.)"
4.0,"Not the greatest quality on the chain, but really cute nonetheless!"
4.0,It's unique and I love it. .. its me!
4.0,super cute earrings. exactly what i was looking for but made my ears hurt
4.0,"Great pair of shorts for outdoor activities such as hiking. Made with cotton, the material feels great on the skin. Love the cargo pockets. The cargo pockets can hold snacks and other small items while on a hike. Recommended."
4.0,Bright and colorful.  I would like the strap a little longer.
4.0,"Beautiful soft leather. Not too big and not too small. Just the right size for me. Lots of slots for all of my necessaries. Well made, too."
4.0,"Large under the armpits, but fit as I expected elsewhere.  I really like the stretchy material and neckline.  Very pretty!  It is a bit shorter than I was expecting, so I will be returning.  If it were a little longer I would just pin under the arms :)"
4.0,This is so adoreable i wear it all the time! My only issue was the bar is a bit short but still I love it! üíìüíì
4.0,"Very light. Small.  Cute for the money.  Not the most expensive looking earrings, but it looks good with something casual or Sunday attire.  Not super fancy, but I didn't buy it for that.  They are really cute, and you will like them if you want something simple but still eye-catching."
4.0,Great seller. Top runs a little small but overall great color and nice suit.
4.0,"It's cute & fitting... but the top is kinda loose, so I'm not sure it'll be easy to keep the boobs in!"
4.0,"I really like this necklace and it is super cute BUT it really does not look very much like the photo, hence the 4 andnot 5 star rating.  The quality is what I would expect for a $13.00 necklace.  A fun piece of costume jewelry to jazz up a work outfit!"
4.0,"This is very cute, perfect cut for curvy bodies!<br />It's well made and even came with gel nipple covers!<br />It's adorable!"
4.0,"Love the style of the shirt, just wish the material wasn't so thin."
4.0,1st the color was nothing like i expected from photo shown; thesize way too big
4.0,it is one size wished I could adjust more.
4.0,"This  decent.  It holds certain things (cables, small tool boxes, flashlight) very well but some things slip out, like individual tools in particular.  But good for what I needed which was some organizational help in my bag."
4.0,I want to know if they come larger size 13 girl for a 4yr old child. Size vs age she have been the way to advertise the product
4.0,"Cute pattern and not too sheer to wear without a lining. Perfect for summer. The armpits flair out a bit but it‚Äôs not very noticeable, and the straps are the perfect length. Good value for the price!"
4.0,Very pretty. Fit is true to size.
4.0,Bought these to take my dogs on walks in the winter /  fall seasons in New England. They're warm enough with thick socks and don't seem to let much if any water / snow in. Great grip which is needed on the trail we walk the dogs. They are not the most comfortable or supportive shoes but upgrading the insole would def help.
4.0,A little bit tooooo small but it‚Äôs easy to put on your bag still love it
4.0,The pants are made of a thick plaid material. They are very comfortable and I like the pockets but they look more like pajama pants than casual pants as the description states. That is why I gave them 4 stars.
4.0,Super cute and fits great. Only downfall is after hand washing twice it‚Äôs fraying in places.
4.0,"So cute. Material is flown and breathable for hot, humid weather. The bottoms are a little wide, but I was able to get the perfect fit with slight tailoring."
4.0,"Fabric is nice and thick and the color is just on point just as it shows on the seller photos , metal is thin and all plastic crank and mechanism but like I mentioned before 'GEAT FOR THE PRICE ' even if it only lasts a season i'd be pleasantly satisfied ."
4.0,Light weight and perfect hold doesn't fall off during sleep
4.0,"The hat is super cute, the only thing is that the letters and the house are small making it difficult for people to read, and the reason I got it was precisely for other people to be able to read it. I guess it is my bad for not paying attention to the description of the product completely."
4.0,I love the bees on the band..the watch band is pretty just a little worried about the latch won‚Äôt last that long
4.0,"Cute dress.  A little more snug than the other size smalls I have purchased from PattyBoutik.  I wear it, but it is a hair snug in the shoulders and ribs."
4.0,I'm giving 4 stars because one of the sides of the shoe doesn't light up. This is what she requested from Santa and I didn't have time to return it and get a new pair. She loves it.
4.0,"This shoe was very nice. The leather was super soft and lived up to the Coach brand standard. Sadly, I had to return it because I need more arch support. But it fit nicely and the quality was really good."
4.0,Too cute!  I have had a ESPE wallet before and this one is similar.  Is vinyl so not expected to last forever
4.0,"Cute, basic denim skirt.  I sized up based on some reviews for other products by this brand and I'm glad I did because this skirt does run a little small.  It does have a decent amount of stretch, so people who prefer their skirts form-fitting could maybe get their true size, but otherwise, I would recommend going up at least one.  Midrise, with a length that strikes a good balance between frumpy and overtly sexy,  I admit I would have liked mine to be slightly less tight from the side, but for the most part, I find the cut and fit flattering.<br /><br />Looks like ""real"" denim but is comfortable because of its stretchiness.  I have seen a lot of stretch ""denim"" that has a denim-like look but ultimately looks fake and kind of tacky.  The hem is raw, which I do not mind because I like a distressed look, but mine looks like it was cut by hand with scissors and has some unevenness to it.  Luckily, it is not too noticeable, but I don't love that aspect.  I also would have preferred if the back of the skirt was not slightly longer than the front - I noticed a lot of brands do this, but am not sure what the purpose is.  Nonetheless, I believe that is how it was designed, so it is not a flaw, but I am still not a fan.  I like this skirt and think it is a neutral, comfortable piece that would be a versatile addition to many closets as it can be worn for a multitude of different style outfits.<br /><br />Women‚Äôs Mid Rise Short Denim Skirt, Frayed Raw Hem"
4.0,"very nice fit .and perfect with white leggings. Really light and cool, perfect for summer wear. Would love to see this style in other colors."
4.0,"Fit fantastically under my wedding dress, gave me the brig princess poof that I wanted with the dress, but also the added benefit that the dress wasn't sitting on my legs all night. Dancing like one should at their wedding, I found that this helped keep me a lot cooler than I could have been. The only problem that I had with it was that it did fit incredibly tight around my waist. I'm not the skinniest person in the world so I am not going to fault the skirt for that!"
4.0,"It does the job - kept me from getting all soaked while biking home. Sought shelter when it poured, then proceeded to ride about an hour under light but steady rain. It seemed waterproof coating is uneven - my torso was dry (had on long sleeve t-shirt inside) but arms were damp. Bright color also good for visibility, however, this material does not breathe at all - if you wear when not too cold and ride hard - you'll be soaked in sweat. It is really lightweight and easy to carry in your purse daily. Also, the hood (being somewhat large) goes over the helmet nicely. Great deal for this price."
4.0,* I received a discounted unit of this product for review and want to emphasize that all opinions on this review are mine and not influenced in any way.<br /><br />This is a wonderful bracelet catered towards the teen and young adult crowd. The quote etched into the metal plate is both inspiring and without any aesthetic defects. It's subtle while still being stylish and cute. The silver band is sturdy but I do admit is can be better. I feel as if the life of this bracelet will be short lived due to everyday scraps and bumps. You can adjust the band however to fit any size wrist that you have. I gave it to my mother and she loves it and wears it around the house often!
4.0,Super cute earrings.  I am highly sensitive to alot of materials and get blisters from most earrings except real gold or surgical steel.  These caused no sensitivity at all.  4 stars is because the back comes off way to easy.  I wore them a week before I had lost two of the earrings because the backs came off.
4.0,I am giving this 4 stars because it runs A little small but the other one I have purchased from the same line are true to size.
4.0,Nice red lining surprise! Well worth the price.
4.0,"Really fast shipping, one day away from Hanukkah! Nice material, i just wish the shipping was not more than the actual product, that feels like a let down, but really nice kippah. My sister ordered the maroon one as well and arrived one day earlier than the black one did. I guess color depends how fast it ships too."
4.0,"This is a very nice, well made shirt. Unfortunately it runs very small - European sizing, l so I am returning."
4.0,Like the way they fit little below waist very comfortable.
4.0,"They are very heavy, though. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of 5."
4.0,Very nice but way snaller than expected hence 4 stars
4.0,"It's a pretty cute hat, and it'll probably fit my one year old nephew for quite a bit, since it's pretty big on him now. Also, the company that sells it will bug you to review until you do."
4.0,"Fits a little small, so I can't wear it just yet, but I should be able to soon and expect it to work just as advertised. My other items have and I can't see why this wouldn't, same great quality"
4.0,"This is a cute jumpsuit...a lottle roomier thru the hips than id expected but im gonna get it taken in cause i really want to wear it. Nice and well made, just wosh it was available in a smaller size. Otherwise very nice.<br /><br />I recieved a discount for my honest review."
4.0,Good weight and thickness - no one would know it‚Äôs not real gold
4.0,I wish it was available one size bigger.
4.0,"This is the perfect size bag. It fits all my essentials and with room to spare. The strap is also a great length for me as I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and find most starps are too long. I do wish the strap wasn‚Äôt just rope, I thought it would be leather as well but I quickly got over that. Also, the wood bead and tassel are not adjustable. It doesn‚Äôt bother me but something I thought I would call out."
4.0,"This dress is so comfortable! I seriously considering buying another one in a different color! I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and bought an XL in black. You can dress it up so easily, and it‚Äôs cute by itself too. It was a little shorter on me that I would have liked which is why I gave it 4/5. Overall though, I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase!"
4.0,Very good wallet with a simple but nice design
4.0,These capris for will. The only thing I don't like is that the material is hot and heavy.
4.0,Buckles are average quality. little rough around edges.<br />Work great for non weight bearing loads.
4.0,It‚Äôs ok but get a sizes smaller
4.0,Looks very nice. I gave it a 4 star only because the middle stone kept coming detached. But this headpiece is beautiful.
4.0,"Beautiful coloring like pictured. I usually go up a size in cardigans so I got a large, but I would probably like a medium better. Keeping mine tho. Stay true to size. I'm 5'4 and 143lbs."
4.0,"The earrings come ready to gift in a nice pink box with a bit of ribbon.  Just take the outer cellophane off and you're done.<br /><br />However, the earrings DID NOT COME WITH BACKS!  I had to use backs from another set of fishhook style earrings in order to wear these earrings.<br /><br />I wore them for a few hours for a Holiday event.  They will jingle with every little move you make, which is fun.  They did start to feel a bit heavy toward the end of the evening.  I have sensitive ears, though, so your mileage may vary."
4.0,"great, just wish they where a little longer."
4.0,Very comfortable and looks like real jeans.  Plan to order another pair.
4.0,snaps a little tight
4.0,"These sock liners are great. The lace is pretty, the color variety is good, and they sit low so you can‚Äôt see them when wearing tennis shoes. My only complaint is that they feel a little tight on my size 6.5 foot. They‚Äôd be perfect if they were a little longer/bigger. But I still wear them frequently."
4.0,Beautiful dress but a little big. Will need to have it taken in and shortened. Hard to find dresses for shorties like me. Only 5 feet
4.0,"Very soft, very comfortable, and I can wear them out with a decent top and look much dressier than wearing leggings."
4.0,Gave it to my Zelda loving daughter for Xmas and it was the first thing to go up on the wall after she opened her gifts.  She loves it.
4.0,"Ordered 3 of these for my bridesmaids in light blue. The size guide suggests ordering one size down than normal, but I would disagree with that. The dress is very flow-ey but the arms, shoulder/underarm &amp; strap area fits true to size.<br />I ended up returning one of them to exchange for a size up because of this. However, I am impressed with the overall quality, fit &amp; color of the dresses.<br />Ordering one for myself as well. So excited!"
4.0,The material the cap is made from looks good the stitching and the ship all looked great
4.0,"I don‚Äôt love these joggers but I do like them a bit and as between these and another almost identical one I purchased on Amazon, I‚Äôd give these a C+ and the others a C-. Well I‚Äôll wear them both but I‚Äôll wear these more. The waist area is super sexy and flattering. It hugs. Without added layers. The material is nice. Really nice. But the butt is kind of tight and I felt this squeezed a bit too much in the crotch area. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3 and I‚Äôm short waisted. So that would probably be more true with my taller sisters. Also I‚Äôm not a big lady, only 135, and I‚Äôm pretty fit, I‚Äôd say athletic build. I have a very active job and lifestyle. But the snugness felt more like a traditional yoga pant and I was surprised it was not slightly looser. I ordered another pair from a different maker in size small and it was a little looser. Like I can‚Äôt really comfortably walk around with my hands in my pockets, as they are tight in this area. But I generally like the pant so I might actually order a size large in this pant in a different color for the looser fit! If it matters to anyone I‚Äôm 43."
4.0,"The hook latch is too large for common key shapes.  If you have a small hole on your keys or they are not round, the flat wide latch shape is troublesome. I have several keys I normally carry that will not fit the latch.  Otherwise well made."
4.0,very pretty worth the cost
4.0,40th birthday extra
4.0,These are great quality for the price point. They're the exact color as shown and they fit as expected. I would definitely buy more shoes from this seller.
4.0,"Took quite a long time for shipping, but the pants are great"
4.0,Little fitted but sooo cute!
4.0,"pretty decent shirt, sleeves aren't any too long but I'm 6'1&#34; and they are okay, I tend to cuff them up anyway, good quality shirt, will need pressed, wrinkles pretty easily in laundry, all in all pretty good though"
4.0,Fit well and definitely do the job! They are a little stiff and not as good as very expensive polarized lenses. However for the price they are very good and stylish.
4.0,Is on the snug side of a 3X but does fit. It is not like an Asian made 3X just the smaller side of the American 3X Very happy with the purchase
4.0,Nice look a little wider than i expected
4.0,Run super small but very cute... Thanks
4.0,"Very pretty, as pictured. Comfortable fit."
4.0,They were too big for me and fell down.  I gave them away to bigger faces.
4.0,"super cute, fabric thinner than expected"
4.0,Dress was perfect just decided to go with a longer dress. It was a litte tight in the arms
4.0,They looked cute although they were not made of good materials.  I love them
4.0,The Hook earrings in this set are great and well made. Some of the ear cuffs are great to but a few of them fell apart when I tried them on. The Pearl's fell off and one of the hearts popped off.
4.0,Beautiful just had to return it. Too large
4.0,"Just like the picture , I don‚Äôt like that you could feel the seems though"
4.0,"Got these for my daughter, she has them on her backpack!! So cute !! On complaint is that they didn‚Äôt have the catsa pin it said nasa"
4.0,"very nice design, just like my favorite money clip wallet - but now with RFID protection!!"
4.0,I rated it a 4 star because they are well made and they do clean properly. The only down side to washing dishes with it is that you really can't reach into crevices  or tight corners.
4.0,Wife love's them and you can't beat the price
4.0,Love this light weight necklace.
4.0,"These pants are very comfortable. They are a nice moisturize wicking material. From the online picture it looks like capris but not on me,  I am 5‚Äô4 and they are a little past my ankles."
4.0,"This dress is really gorgeous.  The lace material on top and the flowing material on bottom, its very elegant and I would wear it to a wedding.  I just didn't like that the waistband was slightly higher than my natural waist, and since I have a little belly, the belt kept riding above my stomach, which highlighted my stomach and wasn't so flattering.  Other than that, if you are skinnier, this dress would be very good pick. I am a size 14/16 and I ordered an xl which fit perfectly."
4.0,"It is nearly perfect for most athletic activities.  I use it for running mainly, there is where it is frankly, a question of balance.  That is it lacks storage for anything but a single key. I wish to have this with one rear zip pocket on the back."
4.0,These run smaller than 12-14. Probably should be labeled as size 12
4.0,"They are lightweight and breathable, also don't fog up glasses. But I have to wrap ear loops around the arms of my glasses or it falls down off my nose. Which is not a problem for me but someone that doesn't wear glasses may find it annoying."
4.0,"some have imperfections that look awesome, but imperfections on the neclace eye sucks  and 1 out of the 5 i ordered was halfcasted"
4.0,Very comfortable though a little heavier than i expected.
4.0,sizing chart runs large .  If expecting a closer fit like a T-shirt  - order one size down from the chart or order to size you usually wear.
4.0,The terry cloth underneath keeps it from slipping. If have long hair so that‚Äôs sometimes a problem.
4.0,"A little smaller than my standard shorts, just gets some time to get use to."
4.0,Like the lightweight material don't like how it is easily tearable
4.0,It's easy to use put on and take off as well as slip in the fitbit.  I think the bracelet itself is a little gaudy and the color is starting to fade a little but I've gotten more than several compliments on it so it can't be too bad.  I was actually thinking of getting another color just because of the simplicity of the bracelet.
4.0,"I got these because I live in Texas where in the Winter it is cold in the morning hours and warms up all through the day. Whenever I wear thick boot socks my feet are sweaty when the temp changes which makes me uncomfortable. That is why I love tbese warmers. You just slip them over your pant leg, then put on your boots and you can have a thin sock on or no socks but still have a great look. Super cute and a great price."
4.0,Adorable earrings! Always get compliments when I  wear these earrings.
4.0,"I like the fit, very generous and comfortable. Not as soft as I would like. Maybe better when I wash. Not quite as absorbent. Thought it had more cotton. 60%. Very lightweight, perfect for summer. Love the color. Gave 4 because of absorbency."
4.0,Very cute! Runs a little small. Not the ideal style for large breasts.
4.0,"colorful but the elastic is too long, stringy."
4.0,"I ordered them in black but they never came, then I ordered them in a print.  They were cute but I would have absolutely been IN LOVE with them if they were all cotton.  The print was a silky rayon type material/  I will probably order them again in black at some point, but not right now. I sent the print back."
4.0,"I love how well made these are. They have a slight platform boost from floor but I prefer it to more grounded slippers that get soaked when stepping in a kitchen splash or bathtub splash. They are very soft inside and out but hold on to feet well so no sliding while in the slippers, colors are vibrant. I appreciate the upper fold option on top of the shoe. My 1yr old loves these slippers... im adding this shop to my favorites! I would give them a 5star for a little easier or looser entry and if they came in more colors. Wish they sold these in adult sizes!"
4.0,Fit long fingers but overall short for medium size hands
4.0,"Super short on the front, good fit elsewhete."
4.0,"Cute, but stretchy enough that I had too dry it three times to shrink it and make it supportive enough for my B cups. Same style Ilana wears on broad city."
4.0,"...a sock that fits my wide calf (21.5"") but not too large in the foot (size 9). Good quality. A bit wider band at the top and doesn't dig into my leg. Very comfortable. My only observation is that they are just a smidge short so I need to hike them up good. If you are taller than 5'4"" these will probably not be long enough for you."
4.0,Not quite as high quality.  Gaps are much larger but pretty decent compared to the Uber expensive handgrey one.
4.0,Ordered a Medium<br />Specs: 5‚Äô1‚Äù - 29 waist - 38 chest<br /><br />In between sizes but took a risk and ordered a Medium. Fits perfectly. Just wish the neckline had a button to make it less of a deep neckline. Light fabric great for warmer weather.  Print is nice and not fuzzy.  Came in a nice ziplock packaging.
4.0,"I have a pretty small torso, so unfortunately this felt a little ""baggy"" in the crotch for me. Otherwise, it fit great! I loved the material, it wasn't see-through, and the price point was excellent. Bummed I don't get to keep it!"
4.0,I love the dress. The pattern is beautiful. Only thing I don't like is that it has no stretch and some of the stitching was frayed.
4.0,"It is a beautidul bag, the color is a nice shade.  Really like the feet on the bottom.  Have 2 agree wirh other reviews, it looks much more expensive in person.  Strongly considering buying it in another color.  Would like to know dimensions for larger size."
4.0,"I usually fit around a medium but I got a large based on other comments and I‚Äôm glad I did. The large fits me but there really isn‚Äôt much room to spare. I do like them a lot though, they‚Äôre very soft and stretchy and I love the color. They‚Äôre a little thin but not see through."
4.0,Super comfy! But was a little tight on the chest. I'm a 38 inch bust/chest and the XL I bought is not a baggy as I hoped. Otherwise I love it.
4.0,"Perfect sturdy material, great pleating and fits my size 4 perfect with a little room left over which I like so I don't feel like and have to hold my breath or when going out it like a bird! Lol"
4.0,"So, these are adorable! They have these little notches in them that make them kind of sparky. But, and I thought this was strange, the post collapses. It makes it difficult getting them in your ears because you have to hold it up and then push it in your ear. And then hold it up once again to get it in the hole on the other side. Other then that, they are great! Oh and they are good for sensitive ears!"
4.0,I originally purchased these for an elderly relative who likes gripper socks to avoid falling. She had been ordering hospital style non slip socks but they would lose their shape and get baggy. These are certainly much more stylish and hold their shape much better. I will be ordering a pair for myself soon.
4.0,"cute top, runs a little small order 1 - 2 sizes up, has no stretch to it, im a 34DD usually a size small/med ordered an x-lg and im glad I did I don't think the Large wouldve fit my chest. Have not washed it yet not sure of the fabric I wont dry it and will wash on gentle cycle."
4.0,"I love this necklace and would highly recommend! I had no issue with the clasp, but I have an issue with the color. It was such a beautiful rose gold when it arrived, and I couldn't stop smiling when I looked at it. However, after about a month of wear (purchased in late April), the rose tint has faded and now the necklace is just gold. It is still pretty and I still love it, but that was a bit of a disappointing twist. I would still recommend this necklace, but buyer beware! Admire the rose gold while it lasts!"
4.0,"I'm a size 8/10 so I ordered an extra large due to Asian sizes and this is pretty big.  It's not so big that I will return it, but I will order another color in large."
4.0,"I really like Wax jeans and for the most part they do fit me pretty well. These were a little too tight around the thighs. If you are a little bigger in the hips or thighs, I would recommend sizing up."
4.0,As pictured. Arrived packaged as shown. They are fully lined. Elastic waist-very stretchy.
4.0,"They're pretty. But not of the best quality, but still pretty. Worth what you'll pay as long as you're only paying less than $12"
4.0,"ordered a medium based on others' reviews, and it worked just fine even though i typically wear large in tops. the length gave me the drama i was looking for, but i'm a tall girl. thinking about ordering other colors."
4.0,"I originally wanted the Smith Serpico Slim Polarized sunglasses, but because I didn't want to shell out over $100 for glasses at the moment, the price has gone up $40 from last year when I ordered them, I decided to go with the Patrol glasses since they're also made by Smith for a smaller face. I've owned a few pairs of Serpico Slims and really like the lenses and how they fit my small face. I do like the Patrol glasses, the hinges on the arms are much better than the arms on the Serpico's, which were too narrow causing the tips of the earpieces to scratch the inside of the lenses. The Patrol's earpieces do not touch the lenses, which is great, but the plastic covering on both are loose which is annoying. Every time I take the glasses off the plastic moves, which is concerning since I'm not sure if the plastic is going to come completely off at some point. This started within 2 weeks of receiving them. Other than that I do like these, the fit is nice and the lenses are good, but I do like the fit of the Serpico better."
4.0,My son wanted this for Christmas. It looks nice and it fits well. Not much else to say about a phone case.
4.0,I like them....meow...lol
4.0,The holders on these are tight so the glasses don't fall out.  My wife likes to have the ends of her earpieces in the loop so it is smaller than the area near the glass itself so other &#34;leashes&#34; would fall off.
4.0,fun fun fun  easy to wear mixes well with clothing colors . can be very casual or more business attire. would surely recommend
4.0,It‚Äôs super cute and comfy
4.0,"I bought 2 for my youngest children...Bigger than I expected, but I like them."
4.0,"This mask honestly surprised me. I was expecting to open the package and laugh because it looks nothing like a real Michael Myers mask... I was wrong! For the price point I think this is a great mask. I have an $85 Universal Studios official Halloween mask, and compared to that, this is not bad at all. The only reason I deducted a star was because theres no ear holes, and the mouth is sealed shut. But other than that, for less than $30 this is a great deal!"
4.0,Love the feel. Like a real shoe. Great support. But run a bit big. Hope they stay on in the water
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e53c7557e8c23cf4f39f2a849f591626]] The only thing I didn't like is that it does come in a box or something to protect the hat when shipped, it came all smashed and affected the top of my hat"
4.0,"I like how comfy and breathable these leggings are! The only thing I would say is they fit a bit snug, I always use a small in leggings and these fit good but a bit snug. Overall these leggings are super cute and affordable and they come in so many color options! ü§ó i recommend buying them‚Äô"
4.0,Liked itüëç
4.0,This dress is cute! I love the sleeves! It did need to be steamed to get the wrinkles out upon arrival but honestly that‚Äôs to be expected with any online apparel.<br /><br />My only issue with this dress is that it could use an optional hidden button on the bust as if you have a large bust you‚Äôll be constantly pulling at the chest to make sure you‚Äôre not exposing too much chest. It‚Äôs fixable with a safety pin but ideally a built in option would be better!
4.0,"Good standard size for lip rings and the ones I got haven't lost their jewels, only real issue I have come across so far is some have been hard to initially unscrew and tops seem to only fit into the bars they come with(or at least they don't fit my old ones) so not really an issue just observation"
4.0,"Quality looks good, only time will tell how well it will hold up to my abuse. Way smaller than my last wallet (also a front pocket wallet). It will be good to get use to the smaller wallet. Holds everything I need."
4.0,Fits well and looks good ... the frame seems a bit delicate compared to my other glasses but I have bought worse glasses for more money! :)
4.0,"Stupid me dove into the lake, holding my glasses tightly in my hand, but this still allowed a lens to pop out of my beloved Maui Jims and sink immediately. Few options were available for replacement lenses, but I found Fuse all over Amazon, and at the great price point decided to give them a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was these were not as dark as the original &#34;neutral gray&#34; lenses I had (see picture, original lens on the left). I emailed Fuse directly to ask if they had anything a shade darker. Unfortunately this was the darkest they go, although you can also get some with a mirror finish. I tried a pair of these but was not a fan of the mirror look and they didn't seem any darker, so I'm sticking with the first ones I got and I am used to them at this point. The lenses are a good bit thinner than the original Mauis as well.<br /><br />But overall I am happy with them, especially at their cost, and the customer service was extremely helpful and responsive."
4.0,"Ordered this for my granddaughter who is about 5 ft. 1 1/2 and maybe 85 lbs.  Ordered an XS.  It fits OK but seems to run a little large...at least on her.  The length is much longer than she likes so we are checking to see if it could possibly be shortened....if not, we will have to return.  Amazon dresses for her all seem to run so long....and teenage girls do like their shorter lengths!  We ordered the green and it really is a sweet print and the style is cute.  If only it were shorter and ran more true to size.  We may have to return."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:63ac6f5343f7bbec8e0730c35dff772f]] The kids loved it! Simple and really cute.
4.0,My son was happily surprised by his gift. He loves turtles and will use as a key chain long after the inexpensive watch movement stops working.
4.0,"Love the feel of the material, just wish it was a little longer."
4.0,This snowsuit is nice and warm! We've had a little snow and plenty of cold temps and my baby has stayed nice and warm. My only complaints are that the material around the zipper likes to bunch up in the zipper so we have to be careful to avoid that and the hood is pretty loose so it doesn't really stay on her head. We just put a stocking hat on instead and that works fine. It's a little big for my daughter but I bought a size bigger than I needed because the clothes in her current size are a bit snug. So it's big but I do believe it's true to size.
4.0,"I wear a size 8-10/Large in the U.S. and thus the XL in this shirt fit perfectly. Looks great and at 5'9&#34; it still wears long, the longest tips reach my mid calves."
4.0,"Fits good, looks like pic."
4.0,"The fabric feel a little heavy, but that‚Äôs ok at lease I know it‚Äôs not see through but it makes it hot to wear"
4.0,It is pretty and soft. Not sure how it will hold up but it is beautiful. It fit loosely which I like and covered my butt. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 135lbs I am skeptical about buying clothes online but with reading others reviews I figured I‚Äôd give the one size fits all thing a try.
4.0,The material isn't as durable as its black and white counterpart but the fit is good.
4.0,Love the feel!
4.0,I usually wear a large and this was way to big for me.
4.0,"This sweater is super soft and lightweight. I love the color, feel, the length, and the semi-cold shoulder. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how I can‚Äôt wear a regular bra with it. As you can see in my photo, my bra strap shows. Not a deal breaker though. Would definitely buy this sweater in more colors."
4.0,"This was a gift for my son and he said they fit fine. The quality seems great, soft but not too thin."
4.0,love it but too small gave it to my daughter
4.0,Some of the balls were loose when I opened it but otherwise everything was fine
4.0,"These look pretty fabulous- they‚Äôre not tight on your wrists though, but they do stay on because they‚Äôre tight enough on the upper arm. My only real complaint is that the material doesn‚Äôt breathe so I kept having to take them off because I was over heating! But they were great for my Jessica Rabbit costume and I‚Äôll wear them again."
4.0,It is a beautiful belly button ring. The only issue is that the bottom jewel is no longer blue. It turned clear after I laid out in the sun.
4.0,"Although I do like them, I feel like they are much smaller than represented. More for a child as &#34;huggers.&#34; Super cute and seem durable though."
4.0,I always get compliments on my ‚ÄúCeline‚Äù glasses üòâ
4.0,"They don't stick real well, but I've never found a nail sticker that does."
4.0,Lightweight and good for layering. Fits true to size.
4.0,"I loved the largeness, over sized style, but I didn't like the cut in slightly at the bottom. I am usually a small/Medium, and I got a medium, I would order again but in a large."
4.0,"The watch is very nice and comfortable. The timing of the chronograph great. The band is very small and i don't think i have very large wrist. In my opinion there is a little too much &#34;bling&#34; on the band itself. All in all, for the price it's a great watch and for the summer heat the cloth material will be much nicer than a leather band."
4.0,These worked out perfect as a wine glass charm.
4.0,I bought this just to wear around the house to look cute but not dressy to help myself cheer up. It‚Äôs cute. I didn‚Äôt like the button as there is no seam to pretend there is a flap so I took them off. Nice casual cool dress to wear around the house.
4.0,Very nice bracelet . Wish it came in red for Christmas
4.0,"Really like this dress and the color. The belt is a bit flimsy, but it looks great with a black belt."
4.0,Get these goggles! super comfortable and no water comes in ever!
4.0,"This skirt is a lot longer than the product pic would indicate so I included pictures of how it fit my 5'3"" stature. The product description does indicate it is ankle length, but most people tend to pay more attention to the picture. The size small was a perfect fit, unexpected length aside, and the fabric it does have an inner lining so you would not need to wear a slip underneath during the day. It's a well made skirt with an an eclectic look. The fabric is chiffon with gold metallic thread stripes spaced 1/2"" apart. It has a graduated hemline that runs from maxi to midi length with a more bohemian styled vibe and would look great with a nice pair of sandals. This skirt would probably be appropriate for an afternoon wedding reception, perhaps on a beach, or lunch at a seaside restaurant. The footwear will determine how dressy or casual you choose to make this look and it can go either way."
4.0,They are supposed to be easy on & off but I am in my 70's and my hands are not working like I want so they were almost impossible to put on & take off. I am getting a new tool to help with that & am anxious to get it so that I can wear these socks since they were very comfortable.
4.0,Not what I expected but they work.
4.0,"Love the ring,  but the silver tone does wear off.  I like the effect,  so I am not put off by that,  but buyers should just be aware of that."
4.0,"The item comes in a plastic bag. The item comes with tags. On the tags are the cleaning instructions for the item, which is real helpful. The tag also provides proper use and care for the item. It is worth noting that there are restrictions on this item. The item is dry clean only as well as to keep away from flames as I think the mesh can burn in the see through regions. This is common to all products with mesh.<br /><br />I had ordered one size up based on the size chart I had seen on this item in the product description. The item is in accordance with this size chart. The item is a bit short in length but is dependent upon your height as well. It is a bit loose at the shoulders as well but can be slightly tight around the bust. But its based on each women and their bust size and shoulder length so use the chart to make your purchase. But overall the fitting was good.<br /><br />The mesh part of the item is a bit rough but since its mesh it will be rough. The nonmesh region is softer to the tough and thicker. The item comes with buttons as well to adjust the amount of buttons needed and for ease of wearing. I ordered the black version so they are all black buttons and one button in pearl color.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this item as my wife liked it and was reasonably priced. It‚Äôs a different style of wearing clothing and is nice to wear in summer months where it can be hot and also allows your skin to breathe through the mesh.<br /><br />I have received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for the product. I am in no way affiliated with the seller or product. I write reviews based on previous experience with similar products. I hope you find this review helpful"
4.0,The dress is gorgeous.  My only complaint is that some of the blue coloring bleed onto the white on the arms and on the back of the dress.
4.0,"I love tie dye, that's pretty much the only reason I got this. It's definitely a fun pattern, but I guess I wasn't expecting the slick jersey like material to fit so snugly. It's a good size knowing it probably won't shrink, but it's still a bit tighter than I usually prefer."
4.0,Liked the cut and fit
4.0,"While using these for gardening and yard work, they were strong, while giving me the ability to feel and have fine detail control."
4.0,Good product.  The light for night viewing basically is non functional
4.0,"Sweatshirt fit my father perfectly, pretty true to size.  It wasn't as thick as I had hoped, but still seemed like a good quality sweatshirt."
4.0,Delivered on time. Easy to use. Smelt toxic until after washing it once.
4.0,"Decent quality for the price, but it is super red, like a bright Christmas red.. not the maroon like the photo."
4.0,Really like it but wish it was pull on elastic waste.
4.0,"This yells ""Ole"" at you. And to be honest, I love the design. I like the embroidery and the tassels. They are nice and colorful against a white background. When you launder this, it is with cold water and it may even bleed the colors from the bright colors, I don't know yet. But, it is perfect for a day on the beach with a nice straw hat."
4.0,"Beautiful designs, a little snug for those of us with large heads."
4.0,They are a little tighter than I expected. Just too tight to be comfortable. Perhaps they will stretch out.
4.0,My 14 yo son hates his pants tight so he needs a belt to keep them up. This works great.
4.0,Just got delivered this morning! Delivered on date expected and kept me up to date wirh shipping. The fabric is very thin but i like the material. I wanted it to fit a little more loose so i should have ordered a medium. I'm 5'3&#34; and 130.  It fits just right and looks good i just wish it was a little more loose. The print seems good quality. It's not the cheap iron on letters which i was afraid of.
4.0,"My second order.  These shirts make the shoulders and biceps look bigger and hide the belly.  I take a medium and am 5' 5"" tall and 168 pounds."
4.0,So so soft! Perfect fit! A little on the thin side but super comfy and cute!
4.0,Love the button on this purse.  Just adds a little something different.  Also a great size.  The only negative is the rolled straps.  I carry my purses a lot on my shoulder and a flat strap is better for that.
4.0,I‚Äôve bought these for my grandson for years.  These shirts are soft & durable & will hold their color if washed appropriately.  I hang them to dry which helps with the overall sustainability.
4.0,"A little dirty when I received it, like it had been worn before. I didn‚Äôt have time to return it though."
4.0,"The gloves I rcvd resemble the gloves advertised - emphasis on &#34;resemble&#34;.  The gloves I rcvd do not have the elasticized seam near the wrists as those pictured in the ad nor are they quite as lengthy as those pictured.  That said, they perform the function for which I intended - so '4 stars' is my evaluation."
4.0,"The earrings are just what I wanted and not able to find at the usual department stores. The gold plate is shiny and looks like the real thing now, but I reserve judgment to see whether that lasts.  (The price is ok if they still shine a year from now).  I do wear perfume, skin lotions, hair spray and know that I need to put them on last to avoid wear and tear."
4.0,"Socks are very soft and thick, but only came with four members. (Jimin, Suga, Jungkook, and Taehyung)"
4.0,Very soft... Lots of nice tassels.... A little bulkier than expected for infinity scarf
4.0,"They are cute, but a little tight."
4.0,These socks feel great and stay up really well.
4.0,"This dress is your basic black dress, just a little sexier. Like I say often in my reviews, I'm top light and bottom heavy so dresses are tricky. At the time I wore the dress I was 175 lbs. Also I'm 5'8."
4.0,Very small. Couldn't wear it. Fits my 10 year old perfect though.
4.0,"Works fine but smaller than expected, suits the purpose for my dog stroller though"
4.0,Beautiful!- arrived on time great value!
4.0,"I really love this bracelet!<br />First of all, it is a very elegant bracelet: the rose gold color perfectly match with my skin color. Also, it is coming with 12 different color pad which can be used with different essential oils. I'm currently wearing the black pad (it looks really great) with Cinnamon essential oil (I separately bought essential oils from Botanicare --&#62; [[ASIN:B01G4LWT52 Essential Oils Aromatherapy Kit, 8 10ml bottles Great for Aromatherapy Diffuser Oil, Diffuser Bracelet, or making Bath Bombs. Perfect Gift Set Cedarwood, Rosewood, Wintergreen, Bergamot, Ylang Ylang..]]) and I feel it is helping my cravings for snacks. Because having the smell of the oil close to my nose all day (when you move your hand, the smell is very present), it really helps compare to regular inhalator I would use when I feel too hungry. So for me, it's a very good way to stop my food cravings (it seems cinnamon oil is the best for that ;)<br /><br />The only negative thing is the bracelet is already loosing its shine from one part (see the last picture enclosed) so I'm not sure it is going to look great for a long time :( It's why I'm only giving 4 stars instead of 5...  But it is completely worth buying it (I might change the bracelet later and keep for sure the metal box)."
4.0,"I like it, only wish it had more spaces for cards. Thanks"
4.0,These are a pain if you have to do it on your own! They have to be done one by one!
4.0,"Bonita, pero m√°s delgada y peque√±a de lo que pense"
4.0,"The colors of this purse drew me to purchase & are very accurate in picture.  Not as ""weighty"" as I normally prefer. However, nice purse & matching wallet. Will make a great gift."
4.0,I bought this to wear at a friend's wedding and initially planned to return it because it has a slightly chunky collar and a wide space between the lapels that I don't love.<br /><br />I ended up acidentally forgetting my other shirt and wearing this one after all and I got so many compliments! Everyone wanted to tell me how much they loved my shirt and even the photographer wanted to know where I got it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great design!<br />-It has a slight stretch to it which makes it comfortable to wear for longer periods of time (and if you end up having to crash at someone's house the night after a party it's not too bad to sleep in üòÇ)<br />-Comfortable and the fit was perfect for me! It has wider sleeves for anyone else that has a strong/beefy arm situation like I do<br />-Really cool button detail (a sort of mother of pearl art deco design) that makes it feel more appropriate for a dressier situation<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Awkwardly tall/chunky collar when it's buttoned all the way up (but not as noticable if you have it unbottuned at the top)<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy that I ended up with this shirt and I would recommend it for anything from a casual everyday option to a nicer dress up occasion.
4.0,"Cute little shoes, slightly heavy. Was a good price and fun for a little girl."
4.0,"Fit my tall athletic/muscular build in a XXL, adjustable waist went down tight enough for a 33‚Äù waist and the pants were long enough (with a little room to spare) for a 36‚Äù inseam. We‚Äôll see how they hold up after some use in the gym. Otherwise, great lounge pants."
4.0,"I went with a larger size based on the product fit recommendation, and it's a little large.  I still like it, it's good quality, I just should have gone with my regular size."
4.0,"My only complaint is that the eyes are a little closer than the hooks on my bra so I have to put it on carefully.  Otherwise, it is fine.  My bra is much more comfortable with the extended--I wish I had bought one years ago!"
4.0,I thought this item would also include a screen protector cover.
4.0,"I bought these for my two year-old daughter. She loves them. They appear to be sturdy, but we haven't had them long. The buckle is decorative; The strap is actually Velcro which is a big plus. She can take them on and off herself. The first couple times she wore them they rubbed her ankle bone a little, but with socks they were fine and now they don't bother her at all."
4.0,Bought it for my 14 year old daughter and she is very pleased with it!
4.0,"Super cute. It fits my 3 year old a little big, but she will grow in it"
4.0,Used this to cosplay Rey on Halloween. Went well with the outfit. Just hope it‚Äôs designed like a real gun holster...instead of a square shape.
4.0,I mistakenly thought the two parts of the bone could be place on necklace
4.0,The item is sort of stiff even after a wash. Possibly several washes will soften the fabric. And it's not as warm as I thought it would be the wind cut right through the fabric. Color and cut is on point though.
4.0,This runs small. I'm usually xlarg. I should have ordered 2x
4.0,Great price and you get 9 for the cost of one from the local boating supply store. It would be great if you could select the colors you wanted but they were all great patterns.
4.0,"Love the comfortable fit. It looks and feels great. However, I‚Äôve noticed that the color stains."
4.0,Had to return in exchange for DD which is unusual for me. The bra in itself seems quite nice which is why I opted to get a larger cup size instead of a different bra altogether.
4.0,"Todo bien excepto que corre muy peque√±o. Mi ni√±o a√∫n no ha cumplido los 2 a√±os y compr√© el de 2-3 a√±os y le qued√≥ muy justo, en un mes no le servir√°."
4.0,"Grandson loves it, it will be perfect for colder weather,  he needs to grow into it."
4.0,Could be a size bigger but otherwise I love it
4.0,"The pants are thick & fit great, my only issue, & this could have been my phone or something, was the magenta in the photo looks pink but in person it is more of a purple."
4.0,"Cute and well-made but also very thick.  We haven't used these yet because we're waiting until it gets really cold.  The price is fantastic, but I'm not sure we'll actually ever need so many pairs of socks this thick during our mild winters.  It's a shame, because I really like this style of sock!<br />I also like the fact that they are gender-diverse--we like to give our monster access to all of the colors, animals, and shapes, so this is a great variety pack.<br />Note that they don't have grips on the bottom, which is exactly what I wanted.  I've read that socks meant to be worn with shoes shouldn't have grips, which makes sense to me.  It's pretty hard to find such grip-less socks for tots under 3!"
4.0,I bought the set of 3 and absolutely love them. Bragged to my husband about them and now I am missing a pair!<br />Guess i have ideas for Christmas now!!!
4.0,"Wow definitely better than my last one. This clings to you, and does help reshape and reform your waist. I've gotten so many compliments from wearing it. It traps your body heat so it may make you sweat just a bit around your tummy when it's on but it's worth it. I don't know how long you are suppose to wear it, as in days. You do not want to sleep or lay down or nap or workout in this. You can feel the pressure on your ribs so you know it's doing what it's designed to do. I have notice my breathing is shorter when wearing it so please be careful."
4.0,I like the fitting. It‚Äôs good for exercise. Only issue is it doesn‚Äôt repel water and it doesn‚Äôt dry quickly.
4.0,"It's cute, the strings aren't straight like in the photo though. They're a little wavy. Haven't decided wether I'm going to keep them or not..."
4.0,Zipper pockets huge bonus for running
4.0,Loved the fit and style!
4.0,I am giving it as a gift. It looks to be about the right size as stated.
4.0,"Love the color. Little snug, but ok."
4.0,Needed a modest pair of bottoms to go with swimming tops for certain events and these were perfect.  Shipping was very quick and the quality seems to be very good.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute and I love the inside but the outside is a then plastic that will rip easily
4.0,"Pretty, but smaller than expected."
4.0,"The fabric is a little different from what i was expecting. I usually wear knit scarves, so this changes it up a little. Very warm though! It also shipped rather quickly"
4.0,"Nice hat but much darker than the photo, almost black."
4.0,I love them i changed the stud type with my many moods!
4.0,[[VIDEOID:cef9b7167cd7248e713285c26bf132ca]] Watch looks great but have returned 2 they both arrived and were not working properly
4.0,Was expecting slim/straight as described but got some legit skinny jeans.  These britches look like they are painted on!  For the 9 bucks I paid tho- They will be used for my Blippi costume for my 3 yr old and should work like a charm.<br /><br />If your into skinny jeans/super slim fitting these will be great for you. 98% cotton and 2% spandex.  I'm 6'2 and 200 lbs and the 33x33 were just right around the waist and down to the ankle bone.
4.0,"If you're wanting to buy this for turkeys it will not work. This is too small for a turkey. I have bourbon red hens and they can't fit this. I do think it would work for a large breed chicken, but it doesn't need to be sold for turkeys. It would have to be bigger and the straps longer to work for my turkeys. I do think that this is the best saddle you can buy for chickens. I've had my smaller down under saddle for over a year and it holds up very well. I was really hoping that this would help my turkey, but it was too small. Though if you had a younger turkey hen it probably would work, I think."
4.0,"The only thing I disagree with this product is the fact its light olive green when I got it. Picture shows a dark olive green. Fits good. I'll post a photo as soon as I put it on to go somewhere. LoL. I ordered it for my birthday, something slight and I didn't wear it when I went out... LoL. Arrived when expected , light & comfortable."
4.0,These rings all fit perfectly. Nice designs. Everyone who notices them loves them especially the little one that goes on the tip of the middle finger and ask me where I got them. I've been wearing them for about a week and my fingers have not turned green. I've washed my hands with them on plenty of times to test them and so far so good. Looks better in different lighting than the one I took in this picture. :)
4.0,"Nice dress, but should order a bigger size"
4.0,The skirt bottom is nice and long but the top fit fine but feels stiff ..<br />I ordered a XL in size
4.0,"I am a size 4 and this skirt is very tight on my waist. If you are over a size 4, this won't fit you. Otherwise, it's beautiful."
4.0,"Wore it for our simpsons Halloween costumes .<br />I would size up !! I wasn‚Äôt Comfortable too fitted wore body shaper garment but still painted on.<br />Size up at least one up . I purchased a large but would suggest an XL .<br /><br />I am 5‚Äô8 175 .. I did recently have a baby but didn‚Äôt think it would hug my stomach so tight .<br /><br />Saved it for the summer , hopefully could drop some pounds .<br /><br />Would suggest though!"
4.0,"Not long enough to go around my ankle, so I made it into a very cute bracelet (just added extensions)."
4.0,"It is cut pretty low under the arms, so I have to wear another shirt under the dress for work, which I don't love. For casual or beachwear, it is fine."
4.0,"Reviewed by my wife): This is a nice, basic sweatshirt that is perfect to throw over your t-shirt during the cooler months.  It is very warm and comfortable.  It is well-made and well-stitched.  It's fairly thick with a soft, plush lining inside.  There is a large, roomy kangaroo pocket on the front.  I ordered my usual size (medium) and it fits just right.  If you would like a looser fit I would suggest going up a size.  The fabric has a faded, pre-washed look to it."
4.0,Cute jersey that fits great. I especially like the pattern and the ventilated back panel.
4.0,Wish the red was a little brighter but overall a nice buy.
4.0,The shirt was somewhat small for the size ordered but it looks good on my wife.  She likes it and it wicks the sweat well.
4.0,Bought for a dance recital and worked great.
4.0,"I wore this bra to an outdoor wedding for about 7 hours. I was very nervous about it staying on since I have tried other adhesive bras/silicon bras in the past that didn't even last 30mins. I would say that it did stay on pretty well through the whole event with dancing and everything. By the end of the night it was definitely peeling off on the sides a bit. The hardest thing was positioning the bra to look good, I feel like the cup size I got was a little too big, but that did give me more area to stick to. Over all, it did it's job well."
4.0,"Love this bag..kinda sad I got the black bag with the brown strap(thought the black bag came with the black strap as shown) but other than that, it's am awesome bag. Strap is easily adjustable and the bag fits all my little everyday essentials."
4.0,Bought for my mother for a party and she loved it.
4.0,Slightly more shiny than my likings but overall it was a great buy
4.0,Nice! worth the money!
4.0,It is soft ant cute.<br /><br />I didn‚Äôt get one of those clip things on it. Which I really wanted to I could clip it on my purse. Thank goodness my new fob cover came with one.
4.0,"Very short, but so cute."
4.0,Well made.  It also a retainer for the bottom of the license plate so it doesn't scratch the paint.  I wish they would send a key to the foot prints.<br />This would help with all the questions.
4.0,I like it but i expected it to be a little longer..
4.0,Great for night time driving
4.0,Cute hat had to remove the gold band...but other than that...cute!!
4.0,"Very comfy! Wore with a crop longsleeve top - so cute! And loved that the fabric was susbstantial and structured. I took away a star only because it's not as wide legged as in the picture but still worked. I am 5'4"" 150lbs and the Medium was perfect...just baggy enough as the style should be.  Wish the BLUE had been available."
4.0,"This dress is a lot more bargain than I had expected.  Size large fits my 10yr old great with some extra room.  It's a thin cotton material and needs ironing but perfect for the Old Fashion Day we need it for.  My only complaint is that the dress arrived in packaging folded nicely but smells overly perfume like.  The exterior packaging was open and had a sticky substance on it that smelled the same.  The bonnet fits well too, however it a little more cone shaped in the back than expected but still you can't beat the price!  I ordered another one already for my other child."
4.0,Liked the dress fits well and is thick
4.0,"These shoes are huge, but I don't even care because they're so cute. My daughter looked like she had clown feet until she grew into them, but we put them on her anyway! The only complaint I have is that the bows come loose easily, but for just a few dollars... who cares?? These are absolutely worth it."
4.0,"So far I love these...8 hrs on my feet, metatarsalis and 6 hrs dance class each week kill me so i neeeed good shoes.<br />And these have been great.<br />Need more sizes and options there is not another single pair I can order n my size I like to have two so I can swap.<br />Vegan would be good too."
4.0,"Okay, this is a really really cute top. EXCEPT I had to make a couple modifications to make it a bit more user friendly....I took out the elastic out from the upper arm AND at the wrists - they were both a bit too tight and made the sleeve awkward  for me to wear.  I also sewed the collar connector to the inside of the shirt to make it a v-neck. Speaking of v-neck - it‚Äôs inherently SUPER low, which is fine if I wanted to wear a tank under. But I ended up seeing that up about 2 inches as well (so I could wear to Church you know).  It it‚Äôs stil a cute top - I just needed to make a couple changes so I‚Äôd like it better if that makes sense."
4.0,Great outfit that caused fun
4.0,Good sturdy reading glasses.  The only thing I didn't like was the case that it came with
4.0,Good fit in terms of body size. Would've preferred the sleeves be a tad shorter but they're not too long by any means.
4.0,"While I feel like these spandex leggings are like many other pairs of leggings I own and there is nothing technically wing with them and I did get them earlier than I had expected them, I only gave them 4 stars for the simple fact that these are less like mermaid scales and much more like Dragon scales. Not because they are red, I have mermaid leggings in red that look like mermaid scales, fishy as it were. These however, are sharp and shaded in such a way that they read Dragon. I happen to LOVE dragons so I don't mind it and I wear these often still but I know some people who are looking specifically for mermaid and would be put off by these not being fishy enough. I do recommend them if you are anything like me and love fantasy creatures."
4.0,Nice shirt but a little to big. It may shrink after a few washes.
4.0,"I love the look of the shirt but I think it should be taken for dry cleaning or if you‚Äôre gonna dry it, make sure you iron it too because the pocket in the front loses its shape if not ironed."
4.0,"This sweatshirt is more like a long sleeve shirt in terms of material weight. I was hoping it would have been a bit thicker. The fabric is 95% cotton and 5% spandex, but it doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot of stretch. The design is good quality, but I‚Äôm not sure how it would do when washed. I will say that it would be a good shirt to layer with. Overall, I would recommend this with the expectation of it being light weight vs. actual sweatshirt material."
4.0,Just wished it came in sterling.
4.0,You get what you pay for.  The cat charm broke off from the chain after wearing them 2x.  They were cheap and super cute.
4.0,"Muy bonitas, tal cual con se ven en las im√°genes üëç"
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful bag and craftsmanship. This will be my go-to bag this summer! I love the colors and the style. It zips up, which is a great feature. Colors are vibrant and it is exactly as expected. Interior has a nice pocket and really cute lining. If I had one critique, it would be to make the handles a little longer so it could go over my shoulder, but I can't complain. Shipping was much faster than expected; Amazon told me not to expect it for weeks but it suddenly arrived, well-packaged to keep it from being crushed during shipping. Great price on this adorable must-have summer bag! I love it!<br /><br />I review products as a hobby and am very careful to be thorough and honest in my reviews, as I rely on reviews myself when deciding what to buy. It is important to me to share my opinions, good or bad, and tell you exactly what I think of something so that I can help others make informed decisions. I received this item at a discount so that I may try it and provide my unbiased opinion. All opinions are my own and the discount I received does not impact my reviews in any way."
4.0,"It is pretty much impossible to find a magnetic silicone band with a color that is close to the Apple Watch rosegold color.  This band is the closest I've found.<br /><br />My wife has a white two-piece silicone magnetic band that she loves.  Since summer is pretty much over it was time to put away the white band.  She wanted another silicone magnetic band so we got this one.  Unlike her two-piece white band, this is a continuous loop.  You have to slide it over your hand to put it on.  It's not bad but it's not as easy as the two-piece.<br /><br />The band itself is comfortable.  The only issue she has is that the end of the band has a raised nub on the end of it.  I think it is there to prevent the band from slipping through the loops.  It looks a little odd and it tends to catch on things.  More than once she's knocked the band loose and it flips over the fact of the watch.  Just a little annoying.  It would have been better if they made that nub face down instead of up.  There is no way to reverse it.<br /><br />Other than that she is happy with the color and comfort."
4.0,"This is a really cute swimsuit.  Unfortunately even though I sized up, it was still too small."
4.0,Cute but change color easily. Can‚Äôt wear everyday without taking it off to keep the silver.
4.0,Nice substantial necklace. Lots of soft earth tones. Goes with a lot of different colors and I get complements every time I wear it. Also very comfortable.
4.0,Love the outfit and brand
4.0,"It came as I was expecting after reading all of the reviews. The blue is not as obvious as it appears in the picture, but still enough to be seen. That being said, it is still a nice ring. My boyfriend loves it and even loves the little sweetness written inside. To him that was a nice bonus."
4.0,Works just fine and fits well.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the light is weak and hardly bright enough to read the time in the dark.
4.0,"Like the fit, the feel and the colors. The pattern isn't dense enough. Too many white lines through it all."
4.0,Nice on bike or out discgolfing early mornings just before the warmth of noon.
4.0,"Nice material, good fit. She likes it."
4.0,I was nervous about the size due to some of the reviews but I should have stuck to my instincts and purchased my regular size (M). I bought a large and it was too roomy especially because the material is stretchy. I still looked lovely but if I were to purchase it again and in another color I would buy my original size.
4.0,"This is a nice set and super cute. Decent quality. The onesie was a little scratchy, but it softened up in the wash. The shoes were way too big so we didn't end up using them."
4.0,"i bought this for my husband, he really likes it, but said the cc slots are tight with even one card, i think it will stretch abit being that it is real leather"
4.0,"Listen, I love the way it looks on and it's pretty comfortable BUT don't dry this with other clothes. Because of the velvet material, everything sticks to it, including every little piece of fuzz imaginable. And the material did shrink a little, so take my advice and hang dry this."
4.0,"I bought these just to keep the snakes from gnawing on my lower leg while doing some heavy yardwork.  These are a sort of soft plastic, perfectly OK with an athletic sock.  The sole is very good, lots of grip.  I ordered a size bigger than the size I usually take, because of the other reviews, and one size bigger fits perfectly.  If you don't need last-a-lifetime quality I'd say these are pretty decent."
4.0,Most one size items run a little large as did this one. I love it though and would recommend it.
4.0,"The fit of the dress is alright, was a little longer than I expected."
4.0,"This dress twirls like a dream! Looks great with or without a crinoline. The ribbon belt was useless because the black of the ribbon clashed with the black of the dress, but the dress fits well enough to not need a belt. The halter ties were also way longer than necessary, so even with a nice bow they still hang down the entire open back of the dress. The zipper had a defect which makes it a little difficult to zip and unzip. Still, even with the faults of the dress, it is overall a great purchase and I expect to buy more in other colors."
4.0,The graphics are great. Rather thin and light weight. Really need something warmer. But I believe my husband's sister will like it.
4.0,"Know your body. Know your curves. I have too much meat in the middle for this swimsuit. It IS high waisted, but it's not made to hide your belly fat. Without my rolls, this would've been perfect. I'm 5'5, 175, 34C. It would've been rated 5 stars except it came with a rip in the top. I took pictures of it."
4.0,"Received these today, packaged nicely & they're all beautiful.. but I was instantly skeptical. They look tiny compared to the gauges I normally wear (the purple silicone & white ones in the pics), and yet they seem to fit perfectly?? I'll update after wearing them for a couple days."
4.0,"The hats were too small for my grandkids, but I ordered other hats  that worked.  We could not get together for Christmas but called them New Year‚Äôs elves."
4.0,My head is a little to big for this but my head is big so its expected i guess. Very comfortable and breathable and would recommend it others. Definately able to wear this beanie for an extended amount of time no problem
4.0,It‚Äôs somewhat big but its still looks great and came in just on delivered date.
4.0,"lovely, like it"
4.0,Wallet looks good
4.0,"kinda cheaply made, but works just for seeing if you'd look good with the real piercing."
4.0,Size was too big so had to return and unfortunately they didn't have my size in white.  So bought another color and I love it!!!
4.0,"Was looking for a cute inexpensive, small purse and this the best thing you will find. The only thing that I have to say is that the strap is already causing problems by coming apart every once in a while. Other than that I am completely satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"The size come in xsmall with is why i ordered, they were still too big, however the colors and feel of the material were good."
4.0,i love the most that these two necklaces are separate and not on one chain. i wear the necklace with the letter pendant on it just about every day. the shorter rope looking necklace is gorgeous as well but my hair gets caught in it unlike any necklace i've ever owned to the point where i have to rip out my hair numerous times a day it gets so tangled up. i rarely wear this necklace for that reason and stick to the other one in the set which i still worth the money.
4.0,"I love this case. It is exactly as pictured. I have yet to drop it and I really don't hope to :D But because of that, I don't know how it will protect the phone against a fall. The shipping was faster than expected."
4.0,"I‚Äôve been longing for black sequined pants to wear on New Years Eve for some time and was thrilled to find this at a reasonable price and with fast enough shipping to arrive in time. Woo-hoo ... I‚Äôm wearing these for the holiday party!<br />PROS:  These are lined, so they‚Äôre not itchy and not scandalously sheer are other brands. They're super stretchy and comfortable. But there are two big CONS:<br />1.  The quality isn‚Äôt great. You can see the stitching, and you can see definite lines where these were folded in shipping. I‚Äôm hoping the sparkle is sufficient camouflage.<br />2.  These run very small in my opinion. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 155 pounds, size 8 or M in pants. I bought the XL because that was the only size that would arrive in time. I‚Äôm a crafty gal with a sewing machine, so taking these in is no problem. However, they were not big as expected. They fit. I‚Äôm consistently a size M or 8, and a size XL would normally be enormous on me.  Yes, they are comfortably roomy and I could certainly fit in a smaller size, but they‚Äôd be snug. My normal size M - two sizes smaller than these - would‚Äôve skin tight.<br />Here‚Äôs my advice: if you want these skin tight, order your regular size. For snug fit, go up a size. For a flowy look (as I wanted) size up TWO full sizes."
4.0,Decent product however need some work to be better. It seems made quite generic way possible. Can't tell which is front side and which is back since the label and/or makers print is missing. Usually brands have label or print on the back side of apparel and this is missing in this product.
4.0,"I got a 50% discount to review this item. This is quite a pretty color combination. Firstly the material is waterproof and there are no labels to determine exactly what fabric compositio it is. It is a plastic material (like a raincoat material)but does not feel cheap at all. The straps and pocket finish is cloth. I think the highlight of this apron is the bright color AND that it is waterproof as I do get lots of splashes at the sink so this keeps my clothes underneath dry. Specification wise- Apron ties that tie behind are pretty short- about 17 1/2 inches. The blue apron length is about 31 inches and the width about 29 inches. I have included pics to explain the &quot;crossover&quot; band between the two shoulder straps, and that is about 7 inches. That helps keep the apron straps from slipping off your shoulders. The pocket depth is about 7 inches and there are two pockets. My conclusion? I am about 5'6'' in height an weigh about 137lb and this apron is a pretty comfortable fit with the apron coming just above my knees. Very comfortable"
4.0,I love this watch although it is a little too big.  Kind of cluncky looking on my arm maybe because I am very small boned.  But I have received many compliments since it arrived.  It is very eye catching.  Normally no one notices a watch but they do notice this one.
4.0,"This dress is unbelievably comfortable - loose knit cotton that flows beautifully and is super soft when it touches your skin. And it even has pockets! My main complaint is that the cut (even in burgundy), looks a bit... prairie or homespun. Kind of in the direction of the stereotype of someone who's been homeschooled in the rural midwest. (Nothing against rural or the midwest or homeschooling - I've done all three at different times;  it's just that this dress fits the *stereotype* of those). I'd recommend one of Lyrur's other dresses instead (my daughter has 2 others and they're both cuter than this one). UPDATE: the zipper head is also a bit weird. It's located a few inches lower than your armpit, and doesn't hide or lay flat--it perpetually looks like you have a string or something poking out, and upon further examination you notice it's a zipper head that belongs there. But it does look a bit weird."
4.0,"Fits well, and is an appropriate golf length."
4.0,"Shiny material, not as expected"
4.0,"These pants are lightweight and very comfortable. The pockets, however, are a bit small. If not for that, I'd definitely buy another pair."
4.0,"A lot of the keys were BROKEN when they got here. I was using them as a ""good bye"" gift for 75 students.  The keys were mostly very very small (less than an inch in length)..."
4.0,Eye-catching & comfortable.  Getting lots of compliments!
4.0,"*UPDATE: The collar actually stood up quite well and bonus! It help keep my wig intact all night. Pop that snow white collar!<br /><br />The overall quality of the costume is good. There are some things that were disappointing to me though. The collar doesn't stand up like depicted, it lays flat against your back unless you can finagle it to stay standing, even then there's no wire or backing to give the collar enough structure to stand. The waist is also not as cinched as I would have liked, I added another elastic band inside of the costume to come in more to my natural waist. Also the skirt fabric was too shiny for my liking, so I added a layer of yellow tulle over the skirt. The underskirt was too short for the dress and poor quality so I went out and got a different underskirt. This was a great base costume if you're looking to add to it and make it your own."
4.0,"Too Bulky for handbag , but nice to have on hand for the extra things u dont always want to carry with you."
4.0,"I found one of the two clasp to the band would not stay locked into the watch itself. So I ended up buying another set of clasps and all is well. The band itself is very nice, super lite, works well, matches the watch great, and can take being used on an &#34;active person&#34;. I wear my watch when doing dishes, cooking, cleaning, working on my car, etc. The band itself isn't scratching or having paint falling off, and the band locking mechanize has kept locked the whole time (unless I'm taking the watch off, of course)."
4.0,"Have had this tote for months now - very well constructed and sturdy. I generally can put my tablet, phone, noise cancelling head phones, wallet, etc in the large inner pocket. There is one small inner zip pocket and two small open inner pockets. I wish it had another larger inner pocket. I don't use the outer pockets much. This is good if you have to carry a lot of things around all the time - I use it on a commuter van for a long commute. But on weekends it's ridiculously too large just to go to the store, so I switch to a smaller bag for running errands."
4.0,"Exceptionally good price.  Material has the feel of a cotton T shirt; very comfortable.  Elastic is about an inch wide vs Hans or Jockey which is an inch and a quarter.  But doesn't affect is ability to do its job.  Just had a little different feel to it.  The negative is the fly.  Fly opening is 3 and half inches.  When you are trying to get to your equipment first you have to find the fly opening.  Its annoying.  Hans and Jockey fly is a 5 inch opening, which is much easier to find the opening and get to the trouser snake.  But for the great price I paid I can live with the smaller fly opening.  For those that care, my Chereskin boxers were made in Israel.  Yes!  Something NOT made in China."
4.0,I sprayed with conditioner and brushed to give it that pop.
4.0,"Nice lightweight dress!  Good fit or my hourglass shaped self.  Taking one star off as the fabric near the tag in the back had two small tears/slices in it. If I hadn't caught them, I'm pretty sure these would have caused runs in the fabric."
4.0,Fit very well for plus sized girl. Comfortable material and very durable.
4.0,These three pairs of Ldurian earrings are actually quite nice. They are each in a slightly different style and appear quite fashionable when worn. They are well made and look very stylish. They are easy to put on and take off.
4.0,Cute dress. Length is appropriate for work but the material is very thin. The chest area was loose too. I guess a size medium expects that you have huge boobs lol. I just had to put a safety pin there to keep it in place
4.0,"Dress is classy sexy.  Material is not thin but has a sheen so you can see a panty line. The bust in the dress is only decorative so a strapless bra is needed.  I love the purchase,  can't wait to wear it."
4.0,It is awesome! I wish I had got a couple more.
4.0,I love the fit and material.  A design improvement suggestion would be to add a wider elastic band around the waist pocket rather than the skinny elastic with a wide waist pocked.
4.0,Muy bonitos pero est√° un poco d√©bil al entrar en la oreja
4.0,This change purse is cute. Nice color and exactly as described. Good for change!
4.0,"It's a great workout shirt, but I am 5' 2"" and it was so long it looked as if I hada dress on. I gave it to my daughter who is taller than me! Nice piece though."
4.0,"I haven‚Äôt had it long so I can‚Äôt attest to durability but I really like it! I like the versatility of a cross body bag and backpack. For some reason my bags fill up fast no matter how hard I try to purge things. So for me this holds my stuff and my sons things (he‚Äôs 12 months old) but it is packed. The backpack straps also need the little pads, they can get slightly uncomfortable after a long while. Overall I do really love it though!"
4.0,These shoes are comfortable but the insoles come out when you slip your foot out
4.0,It's very long but extremely nice
4.0,I got the blue and black striped pants and I love the look of them. The fit is true to size for me. I was a medium pre pregnancy 5'3-130lbs. And am currently 145 lbs. so I ordered a medium and they are snug in the stomach area but obviously that's to be expected!<br />The pants do come up over my belly button which isn't my favorite thing ever. I prefer them to be a little lower but most workout pants are like that.<br />Overall I am pleased with my purchase. I would recommend them as its so scary to buy online usually with not knowing the correct size.<br />Also if they feel a little snug and you have a little pudge rolling over that's just more encouragement to actually exercise when you have them on rather than just looking cute in workout clothes.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.
4.0,I was very pleased with the jewelry. The.service was good. I will use them again.
4.0,Scorpion is larger than pictured
4.0,Simple but works. I wrap the tips with rubber tubes so they will not scratch my bracelet.
4.0,"Love the bag, just wish it was made out of better material."
4.0,"Good and practical, Helpful in the kitchen."
4.0,"Awesome dress! I am 5'3, 160 pounds, I ordered an extra large and it fits perfectly with one exception. The chest area is just a little bit tight. I wear a 38 b/c and it is a little snug but not too much that I cannot wear the dress. Price is well below the nice quality of this dress."
4.0,Best deal weekend shades.
4.0,"there is no indication that these are actually wool (all writing in Chinese?), and honestly at best they feel like a wool blend - if there is wool in them at all, but they are soft, and colors are nice, and are thicker than standard cotton socks, so our kiddo likes them."
4.0,"I liked this case.  In fact, I am ordering another.  Now that kinda sounds like it isn't durable like the previous reviewer found but I thought it did great for what it was.  It isn't easy to keep accessibility to the backside camera while still protecting everything.  Mine lasted a couple months before I dropped it just wrong (on the corner of the phone/case).  Every other drop was fine and kept the phone in good condition.  Considering how often I drop my phone, this was pretty impressive.<br /><br />You pay a little bit in durability for the perfectly clear case but I think the looks are important and the durability is acceptable."
4.0,"I would give it a 5 but for the reasons later in this review, but don't let that discourage you.  First let me say, very nice pants.  Stylish.  Arrived right on time and packaged very nice.  But... heed when they say get a size larger!  Unfortunately I wear either a 36 or 38 depending on the pant.  I got a 38 in these but they are too tight on the upper thigh, crotch and butt.  Not excessive but too tight for my liking.  They don't have a 40 but if they did it would likely be too large in the waist.  I'm 6'1 and a little under 210 but I work out a lot and have some muscle.  For a bit thinner person it would be perfect.  Good luck."
4.0,Easy to use and time will tell how well it preserves the cork on my Birks!
4.0,Fits large but I just exchanged for a smaller size. Only negative is the first time I washed it the seem across the back of the neck ripped so I needed to sew it back.
4.0,I LOVE my tank! It‚Äôs a bit snug for a medium. So DEFINITELY do not put in dryer! But i love it!!! And i never see anyone else with it. So big points on that lol.
4.0,"I have a black pair of shorts from this brand and wanted white ones. These seemed to be the exact make and style so ordered the size I currently have, a 10.  They do look exactly the same but the legs fit very loosely.  I have kept them and will wear but I prefer legs to fit tightly so they don't ride up when I'm walking.  Well made shorts."
4.0,"Looks great and feels great! Doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything underneath while wearing those. Size was a bit small to be tucked into jeans/ pants. Not enough to be a major problem,  but it is annoying to keep tucking it in.  A tight fit on my body but I don't mind that."
4.0,I wish the fabric was a little thicker. Some seams weren't sewn together completely and the fabric can tear easily. I sew and was able to repair mine.
4.0,"Haven't used it yet, but it looks just like I wanted."
4.0,"I was surprised at how much I liked this dress when I received it. I was so worried because many dresses that are less expensive are now in &#34;Asian&#34; sizes, which means they are ridiculously smaller than advertised. Even with some of the size charts on Amazon, you can still get one of those clothing pieces that end up being a total waste of money. This one is made of a thicker material, so it is not thin or see through. it is actually made very well. The scoop neck portion does not scoop too low, so if you are looking for a more revealing dress, this one does not reveal that much. It scoops down about midway between you neck and chest area. It is knee length, which is what I was looking for. It is not a short dress. It runs true to size but is a more looser fitting dress, so if you want form fitting you might want to go a size down. I liked my with a little room because the tie part does tie all around you, so when you tie it actually tightens the dress around your waist unlike some that are there for show the extra room from the material gives it a little fold or bagginess around your waist just like in the photo. It also has pockets which I though was great. This is more like a casual dress you can wear with sandals  just out and about. I wanted one to wear when I feel like wearing a comfortable dress out with my family. I am also taking a cruise soon and thought it would be a great addition to my wardrobe on the trip. Again I really like this one and I am really picky. I went with red, even though I usually wear black. I would say overall a great dress for the price. I would definitely recommend this one. I received this one at a discounted price to give my honest review and this is my honest review of this dress."
4.0,"The top fits great and the matching bottoms are also good but the white floral bottoms are rather cheeky. You know when you hold them up and you can't tell the front from the back, they are like that. Regardless, the suit is good the fabric is nice and I'm keeping it.I didn't really need two different sets of bottoms. However, if you are in your 20's and comfortable rocking the cheeky bottom you would be stoked. I have children in their 20's so for me they're a bit inappropriate."
4.0,"I'm 5'10 with a big booty and small boobs lol everyone is right when they say go up a size or two! I usually get a small/medium top and medium/large bottoms..since you can't mix match I decided to go with XL because I wanted the bottoms to fit best. The XL top fits pretty good, it's wearable in public although I would prefer a large. Overall love the swimsuit. If you like cheeky this is the right pick"
4.0,"I received the garment on time but when I tried it on was too big, it was just pointless to keep it, so I returned it.<br />The fabric was very stretchy and soft and it was really full of rhinestones. It is really nicely made and embellished."
4.0,"Like that is has the metal pin to hold the band in place. Extra band is tucked away nicely.<br />Takes a little finesse to put it on your wrist but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier."
4.0,"No pockets! Who in their right mind doesn't want pockets?! Other than that it's soft, cuddly and warm. It's not so oversized that it becomes a problem like other onsies"
4.0,"My husband wear size 38-40 and I got him a 2x, the fit was perfect!! I love the material, the shorts has NO lining for swimming! It's perfect for our trip, very satisfied!!"
4.0,"A little poofy, but good if you like that."
4.0,"Love this dress, however I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 210, I ordered an XL and it was about 1.5 in too long. I had to knot it at the bottom. I like my dresses long so it‚Äôs not a big issue. Colors and fit are spot on!"
4.0,"Substantial, a beautiful & well made just too big on me & decided on a different costume all together but this is a beautiful dress."
4.0,"i like these alot, very comfortable and fit perfectly.. i only wish the rusching was a bit more defined.  it kinda just blends in and smooths out, which isnt bad, but thats not what its there for!  lol"
4.0,Great costume.uch better quality than most costumes. Not real impressed with tiny hat with feather. Works more for saloon look rather than pirate but just used a different hat.
4.0,"I really like the wallet.  Slim,  color as expected.  My only comment would be that it is hard to see info on drivers license through the plastic."
4.0,La billetera era un poco grande. Para lo que yo andaba buscando. Pero es cuesti√≥n de gustos de cada quien.
4.0,"Im 5'5 140 34B, usually medium, ordered a large. I've been watching this dress from another seller, but found this one- same model picture and design for 17 dollars less, figured why not.  I have the short sleeved version of this design from that other seller in the same size and THIS sellers sizing seems smaller across the chest- it still fits nice and comfortable but doesn't have that blousey look I got from the other seller's.  Larger busted ladies may want to go 2 sizes up on this one. If you stretch the front there is no lining behind the buttons so it could be very revealing.  On that note the white isn't super sheer, but calls for nude under garments and confidence or a slip, which would be a MUST for more conservative situations. Pre-wash it just grazes my ankle bone, after washing I expect to lose another inch.  But that's where I like this style of dress, good way to show off cute sandals or wedges.  This color palette will be great year round, add a tights, a cardigan, wide belt, and boots- it'll be amazing look for fall!"
4.0,Nice jeans but constantly having to pull them up as they work their way down during my busy work times. Mostly b/c the panel for the tummy (which is perfect to allow growth during the entire 9 months) doesn't hold them up good & tight like I'm used to in non-pregnancy jeans. Would I buy them again? Yes! Maybe in one size larger tho' as I gain in the upper part of my thighs as well as the tummy!
4.0,This dress is adorable! I had friends ask if they could borrow it.
4.0,"Although it was late arriving, it was mailed directly from China, the price was so low it was worth waiting for.<br />Very nice material and adequately made. I have a pretty big head but the hat fits when adjusted to its maximum size."
4.0,"Good compression, comfortable. They will make for feet hot, but all compression socks will. Very happy with my purchase"
4.0,"Very pleased with this purchase. It is not a high quality material but I did not expect it to be! I really wouldn't want anything too high quality just so the phone does not get overheated. I am a special needs' school bus driver and I need something to hold my I.D. and a couple cards as well as my phone. I could also slip a half size comb in there easily. It's important for me to be be able to see if I have had a call or message come through when not able to respond. While I am driving, using the phone is not an option. But I have parents of students that may need to get in touch with me about their child for whatever reason. This allows me to see if someone is trying to message me. Having the window, I can see if the phone is flashing a light telling me so.<br />  My phone has a 4.5&#34; screen. It is not huge, but there is more than enough room in there for it to fit. It's very basic looking bag. Nothing fancy and it can fit easily inside most purses, if that is something you would like to do. I love this option when shopping. There are some times when I only want to carry the very minimal bag. I just grab it out of my purse and go. Very glad I purchased!"
4.0,"All the pockets are great.  I utilize for phones and wallet instead of purse while working.  It feels a bit heavy behind the neck, but another vest I tried did the same.  Not sure if there's a way to transfer weight to shoulders in a vest design.  Lightweight, easy wear."
4.0,The buckle stands out and makes the belt stands out as an accessory
4.0,Es co se describe. Y muy c√≥modo.
4.0,Good item. Looks great. The glow effect is not really that strong though and first must be held up to a light source. As shades works great though
4.0,I had it for about an hour and needed to use it . It worked fine for me and I'm sure it will do the trick in the future.
4.0,"Based on the size recommendations by seller I initially bought a medium but then reordered a large and am now satisfied. It is very lightweight and leaves room for layering. The description says &#34;detachable hood&#34; that is somewhat misleading, the hood can be stored in the zippered collar which is a very nice feature. The Jacket only has the two front pockets that are actually small, it would be nice to have at least one on the inside. I live in the South and have not had the need to wear it,  I mainly bought it to take to Europe in the spring."
4.0,"I bought this product as a simple watch for work watch and for the price I was very happy with it. The only downside is that it‚Äôs not very water resistant, after I wore it in a light rain moisture got stuck inside the watch but eventually cleared out. After about 6 months of everyday use the band snapped off of the watch on one side while I was removing it after work. I work construction so for a cheap watch 6 months is pretty impressive. Overall I‚Äôm still happy with how long it lasted for being a $10 watch and have seen about 2-3 people I know wearing the same one and were also happy with it. I just purchased this watch for my second time"
4.0,"I'm a huge fan of the brand.<br /><br />These shirts really are good quality, and I bought several of them because I liked the first one I got!<br /><br />Definitely suggest buying a medium if youre usually a small (up a size basically) due to shrinking if you do, or do not, place it in the dryer.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you'd like great quality shirts as a great price!"
4.0,"I like the full coverage of the fit, but it was delivered folded and came out of the package wrinkled. I put a little heat on it to unwrinkle with hair dryer, but as in the picture, it's still wrinkled and interferes with vision."
4.0,Ordered a men‚Äôs medium and it‚Äôs tiny! Go up a size if you order.
4.0,The shoes themselves seem great.  I wear a size 7.5 mens in Brooks so ordered a 7.5 mens in Hoka......WAY too big.  Luckily there is someone else in the house who wears a 9 mens in Asics and the Hoka 7.5 mens fits them perfectly.
4.0,Very pretty and sparkly.  I'm nervous it will fall off; doesn't grip my wrist.
4.0,"The bag is just as we expected. It also has a zipper, which was a pleasant surprise. However, it took 10 days longer to get here than originally stated."
4.0,Love the look but the waist is a little crooked around the back of the dress.
4.0,Overall great shirt! The material is very soft and breathable. The only reason for a 4 star review is that the print is sort of hard to read. It is a lot darker in person than the picture. Sweat also shows as white marks after a long night of dancing.
4.0,"I have liked this shirt for years but was living in Germany and they wouldn‚Äôt deliver overseas.  So now that I am back, I ordered it!  I do love this shirt!  The quality and design are nice.  I ordered an XL and it fits well.  He only reason for 4 stars is that the material was thinner than I wanted or expected."
4.0,"This purse is the perfect size for me. Fits my phone, keys, change purse, small wallet, credit card case, pens, and other small items in the main compartment and my cigarettes and lighter in the outer pocket. The zippers seem to be lesser quality than I would have hoped, but after a few months all but one still zip easily. The thing I don't like is the strap. If you use it as a shoulder purse it always seems to get twisted."
4.0,"These fit fantastically, and the little straw opening was a fun conversation starter. The only issue I had with them is something that other reviewers have already addressed; one side of the mask was upside down! It didn't ruin them for me, but I don't think it'd be that much trouble for the manufacturer to make sure both sides are rightside up. But still, besides that flaw, they are really well made."
4.0,Go and get it !
4.0,I use these as wheelchair gloves and so far they are great. VERY grippy! Actually too grippy for something‚Äôs. They seem fairly tough .  They do act ss protective armor for back of hand against walls. I really like them.
4.0,Delivered promptly and well packaged. Perfect beach cover-up or casual wear. Color is more of a teal blue vs denim blue. Material looks rayon online line but it seems like polyester. No tags on kimono. I love the print.
4.0,"Use it to ride bike, keeps the pollution from getting into my lungs. Would buy again!!"
4.0,"Love them, really disappointed that they're brown, not black. All day I've been finding them with loose strings. This concerns me seeing as it's only my second time wearing them and all I did was go to class."
4.0,"Takes up too much space. If not for the integrated shell it would be nice, but that dang shell is a space suck."
4.0,"I really like this jacket for the price. It doesn't compare to any of the big names in outdoor gear, but it is a fraction of the cost. It's lightweight and unlined - perfect for spring, summer, and fall rainy days. The design and style looks great while being worn. Overall, I am happy and would buy this jacket again!!!"
4.0,"Not heavy, but thin, silky material. Wide enough at the shoulders and stays in place well. Turtleneck stayed up and yet was not tight or constricting."
4.0,"These goggles look really cool! I generally buy whatever I can find in the summer section at the department store so this is new for me. It's crazy how the quality differs. Consider me a reformed buyer.<br /><br />They come with a great case that is reusable and works great for safe storage. When I opened them I was pleasantly surprised at how high end/professional they looked for the price. The mirrored look on the lenses simply add to this effect. They have a nice tint for when you're swimming outside as well. The straps adjust easily and I really like that they buckle in the back.<br /><br />I have a disabled daughter who is also asthmatic and has incredibly sensitive eyes. She enjoys swimming (ok, playing and splashing, who am I trying to kid here?) with her classmates twice a week through school. The chlorine fumes at the inside school pool is just too much for her. Her allergies flare up something terrible. These goggles did the trick. They have a nice seal and are comfortable. She has terrible vision (cataracts replaced at 13) but these goggles do not impede her vision any different than usual when she can't wear her glasses. Plus, big bonus here, she looks super cool in her mirrored red goggles! I've already given a link to her teacher who inquired for another student.<br /><br />So my review may not be from using them in the typical fashion, as an avid swimmer, but they worked great for our needs. I appreciate receiving them from the seller at a discount for my genuine review."
4.0,"Nice style and the cotton feels nice, however after just the first wash 2 of the buttons fell off so I had to sew them back on. For the price its worth it.  It looks like a nice casual t-shirt. I weigh 143lb and am 5.5 and the shirt fits perfect.  So because the buttons fell off I have it 4 out of 5 stars"
4.0,The socks are just what i wanted as far as the slogan but they were a lot shorter than expected. More ankle length than crew length.
4.0,"It is a very good wall item, never used it once"
4.0,I love the tongue rings but I thought they were gonna b all nasty words and sayings but I got a sponge bob n Tinkerbell one so not what I expected but love them ne ways
4.0,"Everything is perfect EXCEPT for the pink satin bow that was GLUED ON.  Someone else mentioned this as a drawback/annoyance, and I completely agree.  If you are going to add an embellishment (which isn't needed), for pete's sake...sew it on.  You can't remove the glued-on bow completely without damaging the slipper.  I always get annoyed when people THINK an embellishment is necessary.  What is wrong with just leaving the extra stuff off?"
4.0,Not bandana quality.  Way to thin.<br />Extremely uneven.  Poor workmanship.
4.0,It's a good product for plus size unless you have that high booty meets back type of body like me cause it constantly rollsüôÑ very annoying trying to workout but the arm wraps super plus pair this with lipogel or sweet Sweat for max sweet output
4.0,It appeared to have a tie in the front but the fabric was twisted. Liked the style till I got it on.
4.0,Ruching in front is almost non existent.
4.0,This dress fits great and I really love the pattern. You can dress this up by adding accessories and heels or dress it down with flats. I would have given it 5 stars but the material used for this dress is very thin.
4.0,Good material my daughter loves it!
4.0,"The print side was slightly scratched buuuuut the overall product, and especially the packaging was just....wow. Absolutely beautiful!"
4.0,I order 2 medium but it is quite loose. I have somewhat thicker hams and seems to be okay but the insem is definitely off.<br /><br />I didn't used them until today and i wish i would've done it sooner and order a small and medium to try them. Now I am stuck with a new one that doesn't fit.<br />3.5 starts.<br />Quality is okay for the price.<br />They will keep you warm in windy days and chill days.<br />They look great.<br />I recommend to get two sizes to try them and see which one fits best.
4.0,Really like the colors. Sturdy. Snap buttons hold well.
4.0,"Like most aspects of this watch, although the clasp takes a little getting used to. For the price you can‚Äôt go wrong."
4.0,Good quality materials and fit. Toe seam is a little high is my only gripe.
4.0,Like the appearance of the beads but wish they were a larger size
4.0,I wish a light cover up short sleeve option came with the dress. Long dresses I like but still haven‚Äôt found one that isn‚Äôt too long for my height. Looked the color and over all is nice
4.0,The product came over a month early! All the designs are very cute and match the original photo.  They even gifted us an extra black mask with a new design. The patterns looked stitched into the mask and all the masks fit my face well. The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because a couple designs weren‚Äôt centered on the mask. It made me a little sad cause they were cute designs but its so off center I probably wont wear those ones- but it happens and overall a great product
4.0,"Fit is good, but the halter strings need to be longer."
4.0,Good  but unfortunately coin rotates and difficult to stop. Other wise perfect fit.
4.0,The sleeves are a bit short but otherwise it's great/
4.0,"Beach wear, sleep wear - nice dress over all."
4.0,I love this suit. Very good quality for the price. Only complaint was the material is so thick it uncomfortable on the bottom. :(
4.0,"I bought these expecting them to fit and they are so big. My daughter is a size 6 shoe and almost 3 years old. They are cute, but I hate we have to wait to wear them"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a little itchy and the bust area is baggy, also you‚Äôre going to need a strapless bra to pull this off but the dress is really pretty and worth the price, I‚Äôm happy with it and it‚Äôs quality."
4.0,I love it.  Although I don‚Äôt think it lays right above my butt because of the bit of extra weight along my waistline everyone else thinks it looks so cute.  I‚Äôve received many compliments.
4.0,Good quality product. It‚Äôs a gift for my son.
4.0,Love the color and the look of this platform heel. The Pink is very pretty. My only comment was that the shoe is a little wide for me. This made the shoe a little difficult to walk in. None the less this shoe is fun and if you wear heels often you will enjoy this shoe.
4.0,"Watch itself is great.  Band not so much, but that's expected at this price."
4.0,Very cute<br />Over priced
4.0,My mother still trying to get this from me. She is in love with it.
4.0,I wound up returning it.
4.0,Muy c√≥modos tienen buena elasticidad y le gustaron a mi esposa adem√°s llegaron r√°pido y muy buen precio..
4.0,Really wanted to love this dress. It just wasn‚Äôt flattering on my 5‚Äô7 194 lbs curvy body. I definitely will be back to try again once I lose about 30 lbs.
4.0,"It is supper cute, but it is really fragile. I feel like if I bend it too much it will snap, so when my sisters asked to try it on I pushed them away.  If it breaks I have some supper glue to fit it. It is one of the cutest headbands I have ever had. I love it!"
4.0,"Definitely runs small, but looks as pictured and seems like decent quality, especially for the price."
4.0,"It's a little bit too tight in the shoulders, but I have wide shoulders. The pattern and fit are really flattering."
4.0,It's great. Stylish and smooth and comfy on my skin. If I didn't have to wear glasses I'd say it's perfect. But it's hard to get the nose piece set right with my glasses so there's no stream.
4.0,I like that I received a lot of different charms for my money its just that some of the butterfly loops were broke and I could not use to make charm bracelets.
4.0,Great costume for price. Just size down because it is a little big
4.0,"It was a little snug in the breast area, but I don‚Äôt count that as a flaw to the dress. Overall it was perfect!"
4.0,"Simple and sophisticated.<br /><br />The mask is better than I thought it would be for the price.  It is elegant enough for any level (formal or informal) of costume ball, and it doesn't scream &#34;look at this gaudy thing&#34;.<br /><br />Very nice."
4.0,"A 60th wedding anniversary gift.  Would have 5 stars but the chain is not sturdy. We had to order a separate new chain. Otherwise. Nice piece, and very giftable."
4.0,"very nice. arrived on time. good quality, Perfect for the dress I bought it for"
4.0,I bit smaller than I was expecting
4.0,"While initially intended for an international flight, ended up using them for a lengthy bus ride. All in all, they apparently did as advertised in preventing blood clots from extensive sitting with no physical movement.<br />I'd recommend them to anyone interested in such."
4.0,Seem like good sunglasses. Just a little worried about their long term durability.
4.0,I love this wallet. Only bad thing for me is that it‚Äôs a big wider then my old one (had a Michael Kors Card wallet). Does hold all my cards I use more than often.
4.0,Cute little piece to add..for the price I might buy again.
4.0,"Very  comfortable! Just a little shorter than I expected,but still entirely worth it!"
4.0,"Good quality for the price. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3‚Äù and it came knees, which was shorter than advertised, but still a nice skirt"
4.0,"Good quality shirt, comfortable and wears well so far.  It‚Äôs slightly slimmer than I expected in an XL, but I like the fit.<br /><br />Will probably buy more colors in the future."
4.0,These masks are comfortable to wear and are super cute! I get a lot of compliments on the sparkling it does in the light. They are to thick to wear with safety glasses though because they make them fog up because the mask comes up pretty high on the nose. This is my weekend going out mask!!
4.0,"Purchases this for my 4 year old's ballet recital.  The fit was a little snug (she struggled to pull the sleeves over her shoulders), but ultimately she got into this leotard.  I'm not sure if this will be able to grow with her though.  I likely will have to buy a size up next year."
4.0,"Great item. It arrived at a reasonable time. I have already begun to use it already. Will be buying another one, but I will choose one that is wider. I find the 22 inches is too narrow for me."
4.0,".<br />seems ok for the money.picture showed bag with black studs, it showed up with chrome ones.u get what u pay for"
4.0,"These slipper are so darn comfortable. The seem very well built. Your foot slides right in and stays put. No more walking out of your shoes. I've tried 6 or 7 pairs of slippers this week and nothing come close to these. The others, were cheaply made, not very soft and you foot falls off your feet when your walking. I have a very high instep, and one pair just cut right into me. They also come with 4 inserts or ""Spacers"" as they call them. you get two (Left and right. 1/8"" then you get two 1/16"" Spacers. They say they are for extra support or if the shoes seems loose on your feet or slip off easily. These shoes seem well made. I think $100 is a bit outrageous for a pair of slippers. But If I get 5-6 years. out of them, I would definitely buy another pair."
4.0,Size n colored stones
4.0,Holding up my pants.
4.0,"The naughty/nice stitching is not like in the picture, but it fits well and the necklaces were cute."
4.0,They feel funny on the bottom of your feet. If your feet are sensitive you may not like these
4.0,Cute but I ordered a large and got an XL... If I'd had gotten the size I ordered it would've fit
4.0,Looks good.  Can't wait to use them!
4.0,I use these but they should be made of wool to be authentic. these are made of nylon or other material. the lettering and design is very nice. the titzit or hassle should have a strand of blue thread. these do not so is not biblically (Torah) accurate.
4.0,Good for the price and tailored well.  Runs large so returned
4.0,"I was able to purchase when they were about $8 a shirt and it was an absolute steal. I think they are perfect for going to the gym or playing basketball in. I‚Äôve never wore a shirt like this before so it was an adjustment getting used to the back. I would have gave them 5 stars but the material reminds me of a cheap basketball practice jersey instead of a normal T-shirt. Otherwise, an exceptional buy."
4.0,"Adorable dress! Its verrrrry light material so I suggest a slip underneath as it's a tad see through but IT'S WHITE, that can be expected!"
4.0,"It's beautiful!!! On the small side though. I'm a size 8 and unless all 3 snaps were done at the same time it wouldn't close kind of a pain to put on, but it's worth it!"
4.0,Great quality dress! Just the same as if you got it at a bridal shop! But it does run small!
4.0,"I love the dress even though the shipping took forever. The size says ""3x-Large"" so it was hard to tell which size exactly. It fits as a 3x but not a true plus size 3x... Maybe a 1x. I can fit it but was looking for a more loose flow at 3x"
4.0,"It takes forever to get it. Typo you get items in a day or two, with this shirt you have to wait 2 weeks. It‚Äôs a good quality shirt but it does run large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and weight around 200 and it looks kinda big on me. I‚Äôm not returning it, I‚Äôm still going to wear it around the house and on my walks, but considering ordering another one in small or medium for when I lose some weight."
4.0,"Good lenses, just they are too fragile in the pins that grab the glasses.<br />If you drop them, for sure they are going to break, and they will be useless.<br />Just try to treat them as if they were a crystal box containing nitroglycerine when no using them."
4.0,The hoodie at size M was a tight fit but looks good because it has this stretch spandex like fabric.  The print is not as vivid as the pictured product and does not cover the whole front area. Overall very nice. Mean workout hoodie !
4.0,The color wasn't as bold and bright as I had hoped in the passion and purity print.
4.0,"I bought this because everyone said it was light weight and it seems more legit than the other cheaper brands. It comes with a cloth baggt, but for the price I think it should come with some sort of harder plastic case (imo). The style and functionality are great though. It gives a slight tint that is not bothersome and I definitely notice the difference when I don‚Äôt wear them."
4.0,Cute but not as large as I thought and you can see the glue on them
4.0,"Good quality on this rubber strap, i bought it to protect the original leather strap from sweat in the Texas summer, looks like an original strap from Tag Heuer, the only con is that the part of the strap that connects to the watch is a bit thick, took me some time to put the pins in position, overall good product"
4.0,"These are a gift for our 3 yr old granddaughter.  We won't know how they fit yet but look like the same size as her other shoes. I did buy the next size up ,as suggested in many reviews,though. My only concern is that the sandals feel very hard. We'll see what our granddaughter thinks. Otherwise, adorable sandals that look very well made! Take a shot, especially at this price! Donate them if they don't fit your child."
4.0,Fits petit peraon well.
4.0,"It was what I needed for the look.. I am a little scared it won't last long because it's so thin. But it's cute, long right and it fits.. it works."
4.0,"One area of this listing says polarized and the in the description it says non polarized HD sun glare protection. The latter of those two statements in s true. These provide clear vision but are not polarized and will not protect you from the brightness of the sun but will cut down on glare. They also keep your eyes safe being 100% UV400 protection. These are the kind of glasses you wear for fun and fashion purposes, not to keep the sun out of your eyes."
4.0,I really like the product but the right hand of glasses wasn't opening right and it made the glasses sit on the face weird but i was able to move it a bit and try making it work and it was fixable. I really recommend this product to anybody who happened to look for awesome shade for summer. Quality 100% O.k but honestly if i look super cute with them on I'm sold! üòâ
4.0,"Love the style, the crotch is looser than expected but overall fabulous"
4.0,Q and fit
4.0,"Warmest gloves I've had so far, but the fingertips are floppy and don't align with your fingertips, so you can't put your finger all the way in."
4.0,"Love the dragon egg itself. The chain, not so much. So we're looking for a new chain to put it on. Other than that, for this price point, she's super happy, so I am, too. :-)"
4.0,"Great people to buy from!!  The ring was mens size 9 but it fit me and i am a women's size 7.  They quickly sent me new rings.  So now it went from being just a gift for my husband, to us now having matching silicone rings!!  They are very comfortable!"
4.0,Love this set. Definitely worth the price. Packaging was nice too.
4.0,"It was for my granddaughter school dance and she loves the dress, the dance is not until this Saturday she has tried it on everyday since she got it. Yes very pleased with the dress and would order again from this vendor."
4.0,Lived the feel and fit if this pants. Only bummer was the pockets on the side are not really and bummed we out. It does ride up a little on the ankles so makes it more capris then pants.
4.0,Little bigger than I thought but it does the job.
4.0,"Sometimes catches on my scrubs and rides up, but otherwise good."
4.0,Smaller than I expected and took a little bit longer than expected.
4.0,Yes but the design started Peeling off after the first couple days of it being on
4.0,"very good googles, earplugs not so good!"
4.0,"I've only had these a week but I'm looking forward to putting them through their paces. They *feel* like they may be durable but only time will tell of course.<br />Pros: easy to wear (doesn't wrinkle easy)<br />*feels* durable<br />LOVE the built in D-ring on the back right side!!! (I do wish it was on the left as well or instead because my glove clip fits perfectly on it and I wear them on my left.)<br />Sturdy, wide beltloops (wide but not awkwardly so)<br />Cons:<br />HOT!!! These things will make you sweat just looking at them. Wear boxers or shorts under them or you will regret it!<br />They're weirdly proportioned. The front seam length is *perfect* and the leg length is pretty spot on but the leg diameter is weirdly large and (the part I'm really complaining about) the back seam is probably 3"" too short and gets shorter every time I wash them.<br />Washing - these WILL SHRINK no matter what you do. I usually wash cold, machine dry. First time I washed them I instantly regretted it because the back seam shrunk majorly. Second time I washed them I skipped the dryer and hung them to dry. AND THE BACK SEAM SHRUNK AGAIN!!! I have no idea how only one area shrinks but ... yeah. Maybe it's the way the fabric was cut? Not an expert dunno.<br />Neutral (?) Notes:<br />If you have sensory issues you may want to reconsider. These have a very distinct texture that may be disturbing to some people. They are also INCREDIBLY loud when you walk/move, so again if you're sensitive to sensory input, this may not be for you."
4.0,it‚Äôs great quality fabric<br />hope it makes the owner happy<br />just if it wasn‚Äôt for the tags I got the impression it‚Äôs dirt on it<br />but still will see with time<br />i do recommend for crazy swift fans
4.0,My teenage daughter couldn‚Äôt be happier! A little smaller then expected
4.0,This dress is beautiful and classy.  I haven't worn the dress yet but feel confident that the compliments will flow. I will shop this brand again.
4.0,"Adorable, but a little small... order a size up to have it last a wash :) otherwise adorable on my 5 year old :) a lot of compliments :):):)"
4.0,Nice one indeed!
4.0,"These are great! Some slightly irregular, rough edges but doesn‚Äôt affect the fit. Also colors don‚Äôt match but they are close enough. Thanks so much!"
4.0,Love these dress only thing is I had to sow the pocket as as soon as I got it
4.0,Fits good! The skirt is a little long for my liking but it‚Äôs overall great
4.0,"Good rear-end protection for skating. A bit large on my 9-year-old, but works like a charm to prevent injuries. I expect she'll get a lot of wear out of these impact shorts."
4.0,"I got this for my daughter to take on a church retreat.  This, to me, was definitely worth the money.  It is nicely sized and everything."
4.0,"We used to use these a long time ago.  Glad to see they are back.  Broke the ring out of the key fob to my truck so tucking it inside this holder makes for the perfect solution.  Also, having one or two keys out at a time makes it the perfect solution for a jumbled up mess of a key ring."
4.0,"Adorable watch, but shipping did take a long time. My Aunt loved the gift."
4.0,"Not too bad, the only bad thig is that there is a buzz when you turn on the lights, not loud at all."
4.0,"They fit as expected, but they aren't as thick as I thought they would be. I was looking for no-show socks for the winter and these are not it. Decent product though."
4.0,I bought the because they were inexpensive and different. My wife loved them and has worn them almost every day since she received them. She especially loves the black ones. I have to admit that they do look a lot better than I thought they would. They have a nice sparkle to them and fit in her ear nicely.
4.0,"very flowy, well made."
4.0,"Very cute, but both earrings were the half arrow. I liked the mix of the half arrow and whole arrow together. But otherwise very cute!!"
4.0,Too dark to see through on stage but they're groovy.
4.0,Pretty looks more expensive than what it was.
4.0,"Update June 2022: I lost weight since the review below was written so now, these pants no longer bunch around the crotch, but the legs are even more too long. I still like the zippers on both side pockets and at the bottom of each pant leg. They help these pants fit over, then tuck into my hiking boots which is important to keep trail debris out; but these pants are too thin to give any protection against snake bite, though.<br /><br />Maybe I should have gotten a smaller size so that the pants are tight around my hips and thighs? But will the length from the waist to crotch be too short; they just barely fit now? The extra fabric around my hips bunches around my crotch which I find embarrassing. These pants are PETITE length: the legs are 27.5 inches long. The best part, other than they are very, very light, is the right pocket has a small inner pocket, like the coin pockets in classic cut jeans. Good for keeping earbuds and other things that you don't want scratched, or to scratch whatever else such as the phone screen. I also like the reflective patterns on the back of the ankles. I think they give the pants a little flair."
4.0,"Husband said he wished it was a little bit longer and that the sleeves came down a bit more. So I Guess size up, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô2 and 150 pounds for reference.. a lengthy dood."
4.0,Product is great! I‚Äôve gotten multiple compliments from wearing this out in public. However the mouth part will hurt your lip after around 10 minutes. The loops around your ear will eventually start hurting after a while.
4.0,"These are good grippy socks for yoga, currently at home because of covid. I am typically a size 8 and these fit perfectly. The only reason I docked a star is because they aren't the most comfortable to walk around on the solid floor with the grips on the bottom. They can feel a bit hard and like they are rubbing at times."
4.0,Super supportive sports bra! The straps are a little too long for me which is why I gave 4 stars!
4.0,Overall cool!  Runs a little small.  Got L first I have a 38‚Äù waist.  XL fits better at waist but still a little snug at the boysüòÑ.
4.0,Material could have been a little heavier
4.0,"Both metal pieces fell off as soon as I went to tighten the strings. Other than that, they are very comfortable and great quality material."
4.0,Love the color and oversize fit. Got the purple and love the color
4.0,"The buckle arrived on time and functions great. There are a few chips in the metal and not all the edges are grinded smooth. Other than that, I have no complaints. If not for the few chips and unsmooth edges, it would be five stars."
4.0,wore one night and the elasticc came unstitched at the cuff  the fit is unever and this product does not measure up to a good purchase
4.0,Very soft but elastic waistband got twisted after first wear
4.0,Great comfortable sandals. My fiance wore them all over Bermuda
4.0,"Overall I'm happy. Not crazy about the material and was expecting it to be a bit different like other jackets similar. Seems a bit silky. I don't like how the collar just sort of does what it wants. It needs to be a bit more trained to position. Don't know how, but the weight management system seems to work well, which Imo is a big plus. See thru touch pockets for phone could be handy for some, but the wire routing system for ear buds is poor, so I don't use. Should have another option for phone if you don't want to use that version with more of just a quick drop pocket that is deeper for more security. This one is tight for today's phones. It could have 2 types of Ph pocket Imo. Some of the pockets are just so big that things get lost in them. So many pockets that it is hard to remember where anything is. I'd recommend just picking a few to start with and add use as needed. Don't try to carry much at the start. Even as a vest, this Enforcer is way too hot for summer, even to just walk to the car, but when things start to cool, this should be nice. I want a cooler version for next summer. I think they could have done way better with the built in holster, but it works ok with some pistols."
4.0,Really nice dress. Bit loose at bust area. But flows very nicely.  Has lining just above the knees.
4.0,"These fit me well and hit me mid-shin, which I wanted, but sat at my natural waist, which I didn't like. For reference I'm 5'5&#34;, roughly 140 lbs, athletic build with a short torso. The material is soft and comfy, but I didn't like how they came up over my belly button so I returned them."
4.0,"My original lenses didn't have the piece glued to the lense,instead it was an attachment. Other than that they fit well!"
4.0,Very cute but the sleeve on the right of the shirt is not very  Secure.
4.0,"Nice material, very soft, good for tall girls (legs are very long), but color is not purple...its baby pink.  I would have given it 5 stars if the color was accurate."
4.0,"Outside of being just a tad tight, its amazing!  Got it for my 14 yr old granddaughter for the Valentines dance.  It arrived badly wrinkled. Since the directions said do not iron I used the steam/freshen setting  on my dryer. Then, steamed it and let it hang to dry. The fabric seems to have a crinkled, wrinkled look..Hanging it dampened with steam did the trick. Although I would  have liked to give it a nice light ironing to get rid of the small wrinklee √†nd leave a crisp  look. But it seems to be the nature of the material.<br /><br />When my granddaughter tried it on she was estatic. For the price this was definitely a good buying decision. Having to deal with the wrinkles from the way it was packaged cost otherwise I would have gone with 5 stars."
4.0,"Nice band, color does not match picture-actual band is darker."
4.0,As they appear.
4.0,It's nice but just a little bit too soft and flimsy
4.0,I wore them under a pair of jeans and ended up having the seams rub me raw along my inner upper thighs.  It took a few days to heal and made me walk funny.  So buyer beware before wearing them with jeans but they did the job and fit as described (a hair small by American standards).
4.0,"I bought this dress for a New Year's Eve Roaring 20s party, and it's perfect, except it's TOO SMALL!  I'm 5'1"", 135 lbs, and after reading other reviews I got the Medium, but it is far too tight everywhere.  I'd say it would fit a size 6.  I normally wear an 8 or a 10, depending on the cut.  I'm sending it back, and ordering a Large.  Cross fingers!<br />A WEEK LATER: I tried on the Large and it fits a little better but is still too tight, so I returned it and ordered an XL in black, bc at least the color would be more forgiving. Two days later it arrived and it fits! Snug in the waist, but wearable.  Leaving me to wonder what size actual large women have to wear in this dress? It‚Äôs beautiful and well-made, fully lined, with sewn beads, but the cut is better suited to the svelte in whatever size."
4.0,"These seem to run small.  They are lightweight and perfect for cool (not cold) layering. The material is soft and comfortable.  If you are looking for a light layer, these are perfect."
4.0,Just how I expected. Very cute and classy.
4.0,"I'm 5'6 and 160 mother of 3 -<br /><br />This costume is super cute and fun. I received descriptive items in a timely manner. The material is stretchy and seems to fit smaller than usual (however I've been eating snacks and drinking a little so I've might gained some weight).<br /><br />The belts aren't the best material but I understand because of the price. The accessories for the belt kit is not included. I stuffed the belt compartments with copy paper because I'm a Texan without any type of guns (a complete oxymoron). However, it would be great if the grenade, swords, daggers, and guns were included.<br /><br />The quality of the costume is worth the price. Overall I'm pleased."
4.0,It is exactly what you'd expect from a basic plastic watch which works well.  Could use one button more to enter the settings.
4.0,"This case fits great, feels rugged without being too thick, but it keeps my phone from working on my wireless charger because the plastic is thicker than basic TPU cases."
4.0,"Great for the price. Little thin to be worn for no gi, but guess it could work in a pinch. Little warm at times, but wore then in the middle of summer, under heavy gi pants and was comfortable. I'll be ordering a couple more pairs to have for longer training weeks when I'm rotating gis"
4.0,Love the look but I guess I didn't pay attention to the material when ordering. Material: 88% Polyamide + 12% Spandex Ended up returning.
4.0,"Bought the hat for one of my grandsons.  He will probably not notice, but why on earth does the logo say St Andrews OF Scotland?  I'm a Scot and  it's just St Andrews, Scotland!!"
4.0,"Very well made, warm, and comfortable slippers. They came with insole inserts to adjust the foot bed fit to the foot.  There is a Velcro strap that allows fit adjustment  over the top of the foot.  Easy to get into and out of the shoe.  The sole grips all household surfaces well.  Since the shoe does not slip on surfaces, it does tend to come off the foot when stepping backwards.  The shoes quality build gives it some heft and it should serve well as an outside shoe in dry conditions.. The shoe's exterior measurements are larger than other slippers due to the quality construction and  materials from which they're made, and this increased size takes a little while to get accustomed when walking.  The arch support makes the slipper nearly fatigue proof when standing.  Would buy these again based on experience thus far."
4.0,Love love this watch.  Doesn‚Äôt look<br />Cheap.  Very classy look.  I‚Äôm very pleased.
4.0,"Very beautiful light weight summer dress. I ordered a medium and received a large. The fabric does not stretch. It is a juniors large. I had to return it because it was the wrong size, but The medium would have fit."
4.0,"Im in love with the material! since I can't wear steel, it helps my wound recover real fast. But until now it hasn't glow yetüòÇ"
4.0,Cute and unusual. Fits right at the collarbone.
4.0,It fits nicely around the neck and lays firmly on your clothes
4.0,Really happy with these plugs. Color is consistent within each pair and they're true to size. I really like the notched end so the o ring does not fall off. Took off one star because one of them has a slight chip at the edge - you can only see it if you look very closely but the edge is a bit jagged.
4.0,Beautiful earrings but the small size is way too small for an adult. Small size would probably only fit an infant. Pay close attention to the size.
4.0,"Bought this dress for my mom size medium, it doesn‚Äôt fit her."
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter and she loved it, but it was a little too long.  She is 5'2&#34; and 115 lbs.  We ordered her a small and the fit was perfect, but we had to have it hemmed.  They took off about 8 inches, but 6 might have been a little better so she could bend over without having too worry about flashing people."
4.0,I‚Äôm opened pkg and thought that I would be sending back. I tried it on and the design looks good. The only thing I would want is for material to be a cotton and not as thin as the material used. Be  cautious because it will ride up when you walk or sit. I‚Äôll use some dancers liquid glue to hold in place.
4.0,Bands themselves feel great. Screen protectors are good. The tools to remove the links are very weak; I only this because one band had some real tough links to remove. Second band no issue.
4.0,"Love this shacket! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, around 125 lbs and got the small - it was a little smaller than I expected (think I was expecting something super oversized) but it looks great over a lighter tee. The pink color is really cute!"
4.0,The color is very pretty and the comfort is amazing... BUT..... camel toe alert!!!  You need to wear a top long enough to cover the who who area because these capri's do not leave much to the imagination lol
4.0,"Female 24/115lbs/5‚Äô2/: Reviews said order up so I got a medium as I do have a larger hip. It fits the waist well and has good tummy control. This will do for work as it is just above my kneecaps and is full coverage. SO much extra fabric hanging off the sides/back because I‚Äôm petite/ smaller legs. If you‚Äôve got thick thighs, you should be fine. As for my little women, order a small or keep looking. I will hem the extra and work with it. I bought Medium in black. If this review helps, don‚Äôt forget to thumbs up! :)"
4.0,"Smaller than I had hoped, but thick and comfy."
4.0,"Pretty dress, comfy fabric, true colors. Just a little too long and a little too much fabric on the skirt. But it‚Äôs really pretty!"
4.0,"Very cute and easy to wash, I bought 4 diff pairs"
4.0,These pants are awesome. The only negative is the sizing... I'm 6'4 athletic build and wear 36x36 in everything... the 36 waist fit more like a 32 or 33. I sent back and ordered 38x36 and they fit perfect! Size up in the waist.
4.0,"Not bad, ordered a medium and it fits perfectly!"
4.0,Well made and was a great gift for my niece. She was super excited.
4.0,"Very warm, covers my ears, feels durable and little baggy (I have a big head L/XL). Although it says hand wash, I still machine washed and tumble dried (due to my laziness). So far it has not shown any signs of breaking down (2nd time doing this, so it seems durable, but I suggest you follow what they recommend). -1 Star because when I received it, there was some dried glue on it, so I had to put it in the freezer to reduce the adhesion and chip away at it for several minutes. The three metal looking fashion pieces on the hat seem to be plastic and glued on (if inspected closely, it looks cheap, but still a pretty cool beanie)"
4.0,It helps quite a bit to have a sock aid.
4.0,They work great to keep the muffs from being twisted etc.
4.0,Came incomplete  but page is very responsive and are sending a replacement  very happy with bag great buy just waiting for shoulder strap to come in
4.0,It's a good buy.
4.0,"These were very high quality and I wish they would have worked for me. I have a very narrow fit and struggle to find masks that fit. I generally end up fitting child sized products, so I‚Äôll keep looking, but I really liked the product and wished they had fit!"
4.0,"Nice socks, but the are a tad small"
4.0,"I love these so much. I wear them on a regular basis. (Practically daily). However they do make my ears hurt. They don't react or anything, just makes them sore when I wear them, and I wear them with the back on the loosest fit which gives me plenty of room. I clean them regularly as well. But they are so cute that not wearing them is a personal sin. üòÇ"
4.0,Good looking scarf
4.0,"Was hoping this would be lighter/flowier.<br /><br />Bought for working out/wearing on hot days. I think its a little heavy for both of those use cases. Quality is good enough but the 'decorative' seams on the outside look like you're wearing the shirt inside out. I checked multiple times to see which way it was supposed to go.<br /><br />Not very flattering because the fabric is so heavy. Makes me look very boxy.<br /><br />I'm 5'4"", 118lbs and got the Small. I think that's the right size based on how it fits but wouldn't order another one based on how it fits/looks."
4.0,Kinda small but my mother in law loved it
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b234119c363a2a67f149a6998108aff0]] I love my bands, looks great, feels great, easy to switch. Hopefully it lasts! Hope this helps."
4.0,"Reason why I‚Äôm giving 4stars because of the quality of this dress.Expecting better quality as I paid.Overall,it‚Äôs a beautiful dress."
4.0,"Earrings not as pictured.  I was expecting them to be yellow in color, but it looks similar to a rose gold.  Other than that, the earrings appear to be of good quality and wearable."
4.0,Fits as expected. Cool and comfortable. Washes easily and dries quickly.
4.0,"Great product for the price, especially for 5 pieces, but it runs a little too small for my guy."
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my two year old  Mickey Mouse loving nephew.  When combined with a few other Mickey Mouse bath/pool toys it made a nice gift & he loves it.  It is very soft.
4.0,These were not expensive and did serve the purpose. But my child was not comfortable with the inside seam and how thin they were.
4.0,Cute. Cheap and not durable but you get what you pay for. Fun though.
4.0,"It fits all my cards and random things and seems to be of decent quality. Looks pretty ballin' too, yo"
4.0,"They‚Äôre great, but on some of them, there‚Äôs a thin piece of plastic that‚Äôs hard to notice and after a few days in it irritates the piercing. Just look for the piece of plastic to be on the safe side. Other than that, they‚Äôre perfect."
4.0,"These jeans are soft and comfortable. I had a little gap in the back, but I alway wear long enough tops that it isn‚Äôt noticeable. They were a little shorter than I like but not too noticeable. Be sure to wash them by themselves the first time. They bled a lot."
4.0,Look wide and flop off of his feet.
4.0,"These are quite soft, comfortable, easy to wear and care for, but the bad is looser than stated, so they don't stay in place as well as they should. I believe that the sizing chart may be slightly off, as to some of the sizes. We are still looking for the perfect bra, but these are decent and do work for her. The band is just too loose."
4.0,"Very bright and cheerful wings for the young and young-at-heart! It was full of glitter and if you already have a glittered outfit this may not be for  you. But being a 'fairy type' and lots of glitter will always be welcome! Small enough on an adult to not hit anyone as you turn around in crowds. But large enough for a child that they stick out enough but without being a nuisance.<br /><br />Storage:  Have to be careful of them for storage, recommend wrapping in a large bag or sheet when not being used and keeping flat between large card-boards is a great thing. (Keeping the glitter out of your other stored items) Keep the shipping box and make it the same size for storing it flat."
4.0,"Love this dress! I was just under the impression it came with the slip under it already, especially for the price. And it didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs beautiful though, I will just have to obtain a slip separately unfortunately."
4.0,"The colors are a little off, the red is more orange and the purple could be a little prettier and don‚Äôt like the shade of green at all"
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet, very elegant.  Arrived in a jewelers box, which is nice."
4.0,They really work to keep my lower legs from swelling.
4.0,Thick material but tight
4.0,These are good but too big for my 8 year old daughter
4.0,Works ok so far.  Only used for a few days and time will tell.  The band is a large and fits great in the third hole.  Last band I had (different seller) was a large but was very small for me.  It was always in the last hole.<br />I do not like the color of tan on this band.  It is an orangey tan color and does not look that good.
4.0,Carry this tote every day! Love it!
4.0,Nice bag.  Received compliments.  Lots of room.
4.0,The material is great and I love the shirt. It does run big in the size.
4.0,For my granddaughter she loves it.
4.0,"Very soft fabric, high quality print, fits small. I ordered XL for a loose fit and it fits like a size small."
4.0,"Unfortunately this dress was needed for very special service ""Homegoing for my Mother"". It is a very lovely dress."
4.0,Sturdy. Well made. Good looking.
4.0,"I really like this top. I wear it layered under sweaters, and it's really cute. The only thing i'm not a huge fan of is the material. Because it's synthetic, it has a very synthetic feel, and kind of a sheen. That's really the only thing I don't like, and because I layer it, it's not a huge issue. It's not super noticeable and still fits well and looks great."
4.0,I workout in this product. Sometimes I just wear it around the house and it makes you sweat to drop pounds. Great product. I bought this in October and need a smaller size within a month in a half ago.
4.0,"My daughter likes it. Would prefer the top be a little bit shorter and the bottoms have a bit of a lower rise, otherwise fit was perfect.  Cute. Thinking about getting her another color except for the length preference.<br />5‚Äô3‚Äù 135lbs Size small"
4.0,It‚Äôs a bit small for my husbands head but he still loves it.
4.0,I like it. Its what i expected.
4.0,The stitching on the outer brim is the give-away that it's a little short on quality.. Not a long term item but fun and stylish without having to spend a lot... a good value for the money.
4.0,Husband uses these socks - he‚Äôs a contractor who is on his feet most of the day  He says these really help !
4.0,This shirt was cute and look exactly as pictured. The only reason I took a star off is because the material isn't cotton its like a polyester type material so it might be hot in summer.
4.0,We bought it for a granddaughter.. it arrives in a nice little gift box and looks as advertised.  Will she like it? Beats me.
4.0,"The sandals are too small for me.<br />I ordered a size 8 but they fit like a 7.5.<br />Luckly, my sister is a 7.5 so I gave them to her.<br />She likes them and says they're comfortable."
4.0,Great purchase.  Perfect fit.
4.0,LOVE this. wish it came in more colors.
4.0,This skirt is so cute and fit perfect. I purchased the multicolor. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to pop the way it did. I‚Äôm wearing this as a coverup/bottom for a bathing suit obviously on vacation. I‚Äôm a 14 and i purchased the 2x. I probably could have gotten away with the 1X but it‚Äôs not going to fall down over my butt so I‚Äôll keep it. I just had to write a review because I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. This was a great buy.
4.0,"a shirt, I should have waited to buy one at marshalls"
4.0,"Very tight fit on hips, but that was expected. Waist a little big, but manageable, especially with a shirt and corset. My measurements are 27‚Äù waist and 40‚Äù hips and I got an 8."
4.0,Beautiful hat. I feel comfortable when I wear it in the beach. Is easy to fold and take it inside your bag pack or luggage. Also  It has a rope to hang it and keep it with you safe.
4.0,They are comfortable but sounds like air is coming out of them when I walk
4.0,"The photo show this more as an olive drab color, the actual shirt is more of a dark khaki, looks very screen accurate. The print I recieved is very slightly off center, but I design stuff for a living and i doubt that most people would notice a shirt being a quarter inch off center. Decent fit and quality, was pretty much exactly what I wanted."
4.0,I like that everything came in one package and included the pin wheel bearings as well as the thick washers which can be hard to find.  I did notice after ordering though that it can be cheaper to buy the items individually.
4.0,"Lived the price, fast shipping and the choices! However one of the broke too easily the fist time I wore it :/"
4.0,My lounging bathing suit! Comfy and fits beautifully
4.0,"Nice replacement lens. Not a perfect fit though. When I clean them, I can feel them move around and they pop."
4.0,This is a beautiful ring. I get many compliments when I wear it.  The stones catch the light and sparkle. Didn't give five stars because the band scratches and bends easily
4.0,"I just wanted a lightweight windbreaker, and this one fits the bill.  I am 5'8, 140 lbs, and the 'small ' fits a little snug, but really all that I needed."
4.0,"Very pretty, just bigger than I thought. It's definitely for an adult not a child, should have paid attention to the measurements. But a very lovely bracelet"
4.0,"This shirt is very nice, an upgraded tunic with super nice tucking/shaping under the bust. However, the stitching on the tucks needed some quality control; the bottom threads were not finished or tied off or something, and they will essentially unravel over time without intervention. I don't buy a new shirt to have to do some sewing or take it to a tailor for repair.<br />Otherwise, I very much like this shirt."
4.0,"I am keeping the dress, and overall it looks nice. It is a little tighter in the chest than I would prefer, but I think it‚Äôs still within reason for work."
4.0,The women's Shymay underbust bustier corset waist was nice but to small for my wife i gave this to a niece and will buy another one bigger in size.
4.0,"It stays securely in place, which I love. However, I underestimated just how big the stud was going to be. It looks small in the package but once it's in place, it's actually pretty large and it is pretty elevated so I have caught it on occasion when sleeping. Other than that, it's a great piece of jewelry for the price."
4.0,Soft and warm. Washes well.
4.0,Waist needs to be higher for my wife.
4.0,Really comfortable with memory foam insoles.<br />I am size 7 and gave it to someone size 8 and still fitted them little big.
4.0,It's great..
4.0,"The earrings are exactly what I paid for, not the best quality but it‚Äôs still nice. I will keep it."
4.0,Smaller than pictured. State actual size before customers order.
4.0,Great classic black bow tie. Learn how to tie it and you are a go.
4.0,"I love the color of this shirt! It‚Äôs very pretty and is a comfortable shirt! It is long enough to wear with leggings. My only hang up with this shirt is the sleeves are a bit short. Overall, great shirt!"
4.0,"A bit flimsy, but works for what I wanted."
4.0,Good overall - there was a minor imperfection in the material.
4.0,decent quaility‚Ä¶.great price‚Ä¶excellent service
4.0,Larger than I thought it would be but a really nice add for my collection. This manufacturer makes some really cool watches that are always a great value. I own several.
4.0,"Very nice piece! I loved it , not translucent and very stretchy! :) Definitely glad i ordered it ."
4.0,"These are very comfortable yoga pants.  They ran a bit larger than expected but they aren‚Äôt bad.  I was hoping the black was a little darker so that the moons were more vivid. That is my only real complaint.  It looks more charcoal colored.  Otherwise, not bad."
4.0,Have had multiple people comment how much they like it.
4.0,"Price is good, decent glasses, nice and dark, however scratches easily but as to be expected by price."
4.0,"Pretty sweet given it's price. An elastic waistband around the hips gives a lot of room, perfect for running around. A little wide from below the knees, but better to be a little loose rather than a little tight. Been wearing them for a while & they seem like they'll pass the test of time."
4.0,"The product will most likely end up being perfect after I hand wash it. It arrived smelling like mildew. Other than that, its prettier and more flattering then I expected."
4.0,Fits great and surprisingly soft.
4.0,Heel is just too high.
4.0,"Although I am very happy with  the dress and  quality of fabric and manufacture looks good, it is slightly shorter and not as full as it looks in the picture. Luckily I am short and it works fine, but may be too short for a taller person."
4.0,"Thanks Daughter loved it, great quality with great graphics!"
4.0,They were as expected on the smaller side of sizing.  I ordered a larger size to be safe and I‚Äôm glad I did!!<br /><br />They have shrank a little bit after several wash & dry cycles.
4.0,Its a suede so it gets very wrinkled but other than that it‚Äôs cute.
4.0,a little costly but nice
4.0,Pic is great. You can't see any background because the size of oval too small; It's cut so close to  wolf's head. They are pretty and appropriate  for any age wolf enthusiast.
4.0,"it looks great, it is  a bit to big."
4.0,"So many compliments, i love these faux wrap pants. Very cute with crop tops! I just wish the waist was a little bit more forgiving! It fits pretty well, the length is great, but it's a bit small around the waist."
4.0,"I mean, it does what I want, covers my wobbly bits and is comfy like a nightdress which is all I really ask of clothing these days as I sink further into slovenly mid-life house wifery.  It is a bit thinner than I hoped for, not even as thick as most teeshirts. and the print isn't as vibrant and deep navy as the picture shows. But the dress is well made, flattering and comfy so really, for this price, it is fine and I would buy again perfectly happily."
4.0,"Cute! I sized up just  in case. But it's TRUE to sz,  so will fit her a long time."
4.0,I really like the stud I should have got the one or one and one half carat the two carat don't look so real.
4.0,Cute but not comfortable!
4.0,It‚Äôs fits my 5 year old
4.0,OMG.  Bling bling
4.0,"Lenses were larger than expected, but very clear."
4.0,"The fabric is a little rough, not a problem just be aware"
4.0,Cute tee. Very flattering fit. True to size
4.0,Love the material this was made out of! it's so soft. It has a simple cut that doesn't flatter the figure. It's long enough to cover your butt without becoming a dress and is perfect for leggings. I wish they had more colors to choose from.
4.0,"5'11, based on my normal clothes and size chart I ordered a medium and large (just to see difference). Medium Fit is good, but model must be TINY as the shirt is much shorter on me Both large and medium) , will keep medium and layer it with a tunic tank."
4.0,They fit well but ripped after one season.
4.0,I like the detail on the gold inlay
4.0,"light weight,"
4.0,I like the pattern and the dress. It is a little warm for me. If I could have ordered it unlined i would have.
4.0,A little thin but perfect for HOT weather. Very cute and fits perfectly. Highly recommend.
4.0,Great organization for all your travel needs......
4.0,They work however they are a pain to put in. I know small earings can be hard to put in but these seem to be even harder than normal. They look nice.
4.0,Just a little small in the butt area but it's still very cute!!
4.0,"Surprisingly warm, but I do use another layer underneath, and it fits well. The hood is a bit weird, and a bit flimsy, so I don't really use it, but the jacket is just what I was looking for."
4.0,"It's pretty hard plastic so that the toe thing doesn't give and isn't all that comfortable, but then it ought to last a long time. It's slightly a slightly large fit, but I don't expect any of these types of footwear to be spot on. I would only give it a 5 stars if I loved it, so a 4 really isn't all that bad."
4.0,My grandson loves Dory and loves the jammies. Not real heavy but good for fall.
4.0,"Cheap material, but it looks good for the price and super comfy."
4.0,"I love smartwool, and these are really beautiful gloves, but unfortunately were too small.  By smartwool‚Äôs measurements, I should‚Äôve been able to wear a medium.  These gloves were too small across the palm of my hand, and I knew that in short time they would tear.  The seller was kind enough to pay for return shipping."
4.0,This is a beautiful bag.  I purchase to use as a gym bag and while it is just a bit large for that purpose; as with most of us I am finding plenty to put inside it!  Quality is good and it is very stylish!
4.0,"Had this wallet for a few days, and so far so good.  I would ideally like the pockets to be a bit looser so i can have 2 cards in them at once, but the leather will likely loosen up over time.  Overall a good product and excellent color in real life."
4.0,"Cute earrings, but these are heavy.  I would not wear them all day, but only for a few hours at a time."
4.0,I can only give this 4 stars because the color of the hoops is much lighter on the monitor than in person. They are still beautiful but you can't wear Titanium next to white gold.
4.0,I normally wear a size 12 AND 38D bra. I ordered an XXL and the bottoms for perfect but the top was too small. Love the bottoms though.
4.0,"Runs small and tight.  Good quality, however because they are so small they are not really practical for much.  I wore them taking the bike to Sturgis.  Definitely recommend getting a size up and ordering a second set of straps.  Honestly, they should be cheaper so because of the sizing and price that's-1 ‚òÜ For me :( Also, touch screen wasnt the greatest"
4.0,I am not a big sneaker guy but I do have some nice Salomons and new balances. The Crep Kit not only cleaned my shoe it enhanced the color and made my shoes more vibrant. I highly recommend the Crep Kit.
4.0,I get lots of compliments with these... Wish the footbed was more smooth but cute overall
4.0,Love these! They look expensive and classy
4.0,A little snug the first time you wear them but then they are perfect. Keeps you grounded while doing your yoga.
4.0,Great deal for the price. Get them a size larger than usual.
4.0,This was a great strapless bra. I definitely recommend going up a size than your normal cup size. I wish I had. It fit but took my a while to get the cups on correctly. I would buy this product again.
4.0,Was a good teen girls present. Looks a little better in the picture. But still looked good.
4.0,GOod product for the price.  MY nephew loves it.
4.0,Used for gift to granddaughter.  She seemed to like all.
4.0,Love this purse!  I received 2 of these purses because when I ordered I didn't see where it entered into my shopping cart and ordered it again.  It is just a little tight for my billfold but it will work.  I am not sending the extra one back because I think it will make a neat gift.
4.0,"I was planning a trip to Alaska and wanted some head gear that would both work in the rain and keep my head warm. I found this hat and the price was right, so I gave it a try. Now, after my trip, I thought I'd pass along some thoughts.<br />I had the opportunity, due to the weather, to wear the hat twice during the trip. It performed as advertised and kept me dry and warm.  On one particular day, the rain was coming down steadily, and I wore a rain poncho and this hat to keep me dry. The poncho hood covered most of my head, but the bill of the hat was exposed to rain for quite a while.  Water was beading off it like you'd expect. Later, when we got back indoors, I examined the hat and found it to be dry. Nice! The water just rolled off of it. And that day was also chilly. The fleece lining in the hat kept my closely shaven head nice and warm!  The second opportunity I had to wear it was a day with intermittent sprinkles. I wore the hat mostly to keep the rain away from my face. It worked great.<br />Pros: Oil cloth works like it's supposed to and the fleece lining is warm and comfortable. Less warm than a beanie or ski cap, but more so that just a plain ball cap.  It was not comfortable to wear on warm sunny days (but that's not what it is designed for).<br />Cons: The bill is stiff and hard to shape (minor annoyance if you like a curved bill). Second, the sizing band is designed like a belt with holes and a buckle, so it's not as flexible to size as many caps are. I found that I needed a hole in between two holes to fit perfectly, but opted for a slightly too big fit since I did not want to mess up the hat. I did not have a problem with wind, but I also never had a real windy day to test it.  It was not a deal breaker.<br />Lastly, I did find this hat in Alaska and it cost more than amazon... glad I bought it ahead of time!"
4.0,"These were great products for a make-up class I took at college, really helped me learned special effects make-up work."
4.0,"The item does not look exactly like the picture. I feel that the image makes it look a lot dressier than it is in actuality. The material is lightweight and a little cheaper feeling than I was expecting. Not nearly as many ruffles as pictured, but enough to cover any problem areas you might have or be concerned with.<br /><br />I am short and heavy, I am normally an xl to xxl and this shirt is an xl and fits me great everywhere. I am not large chested, so if you are, I'd suggest ordering one size up for comfort. I am very happy with the length (not as long as pictured, but covers my backside) and the way it very flowy and flattering.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this purchase. I do recommend the item, but just be aware that it does not look exactly as pictured. I actually wish they had more colors available. I ordered it in gray and white."
4.0,"haven't used them all yet, but they fit and they offer different colors and tints"
4.0,"The hat/glove combo were a lot of fun and made the skunkette costume look great. The hat is big enough to cover your head but doesn't cover your face and isn't hot and stuffy like many wigs. You can easily decide whether or not to use the gloves and in my case, during a parade, they made excellent pockets for my phone and camera. I wore these with the fur leg warmers and the costume was easily recognized and very fun."
4.0,"I bought it a size larger to be safe. The arrival time was great, material soft and cozy and my daughter loved it."
4.0,"Top was great, shorts to small and tight. I got the 6x"
4.0,I love this jacket. At the moment it‚Äôs too big for my sweetpea but she‚Äôll grow and get a chance to wear it. Quality is not THAT bad. Pretty typical. Belt is super long but I think that‚Äôs the point of this style.
4.0,It's a little smaller than expected but has a nice hand feel
4.0,I love it. It fitted very well and I can also wear it with pants or tights.
4.0,"Super light weight, pockets a little shallow.  But overall great dress."
4.0,"Larger than expected, but it‚Äôs adjustable. Looks great and it‚Äôs very flattering.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and it touches the ground. So, it‚Äôs a no go for petite sizes."
4.0,"he glasses arrived safe in a little box with a protective drawstring sleeve and a polishing cloth. The glasses seem to be well built for this price range. The hinges (plastic on plastic) are nice and tight and function smoothly. The finish of the glasses is matte which makes them very comfortable. Color is OK. As I mentioned, the glasses are very comfortable. I've worn them for hours at a time without any discomfort. The glasses don't have any tight spots that lead to headaches as I have had with other glasses. The lenses not very dark. Overall the glasses are well made for the price, but do not suit my taste.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"I ordered a Medium and  received a LARGE (the bag had an &#34;M&#34; label). To save the inconvenience of returning it, I took it in and hemmed it.<br />The actual top is good, very attractive."
4.0,"This is really a pretty dress. I am typically a size 2 or 4 petite. I bought the small and it was too long and big in the bodice/ torso so at first it was super discouraging since I've had a similar problem with almost all the dresses I've ordered.  But the dress is very well made with a medium weight stretch type of fabric (64% cotton, 32% Nylon and 4% spandex) so I kept it to alter. I decided to prewash it and to my surprise it shrank sufficiently that it almost fits perfectly. I just hope it doesn't shrink more. I washed it in tepid water and put it through a short wrinkle removing cycle in the dryer. I will have to adjust the buttons because they were placed cockeyed. I like my dresses comfortable but not snug or form fitting. It is a lovely dress and otherwise made well."
4.0,Run Little too big as small
4.0,"I really like this dress - the color blocking makes it unique. I read in another review that the black/tan/white wasn't the same as the picture. In looking at the pictures closer, only the black/tan/white dress has the color blocking at the bottom, straight across. The other dresses are sewn on the diagonal.<br />My one issue with it (which made me debate sending it back or not) is that one sleeve is shorter than the other when worn on both shoulders. You can see this in the picture (but I didn't notice before ordering) - the first picture shows it being worn off one shoulder and the sleeves are even at the elbows. In the other pictures, when it's worn on the shoulders, the sleeves hit at the elbow on one arm and higher on the other. Not sure if I will wear it off the shoulder or not, but I really liked the dress and decided to keep it."
4.0,Glasses fit my needs. I like the color. Fit the round shape for my face. Looks great. You want be sorry if you like the glasses
4.0,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I had to have it hemmed.  Now that my daughter hemmed it for me, I just love it.  That is the one big design flaw in long dresses in bigger sizes...they aren't made for short people. That's actually always been my problem no matter what size I wear because even for a short person I have short legs.  I love everything else about the dress, though.  The fit (besides length), the colors, the material.  It's just the (almost) perfect summer dress."
4.0,Great product. Wife loves these. They seemed small in my hands but actually fit her perfect. She's my thick hotty and they fit her thighs nice. 4 stars because I feel they could be cheaper. Thank you tho. Would buy again!
4.0,It was received as pictured.
4.0,"It was a cute top, however it was too big wouldn't stay up on shoulder."
4.0,"No as big as anticipated, but very nice and feels like good quality."
4.0,"It's a great bag. The only thing I would improve is that if it were just a tiny bit bigger a file folder would fit in easily. It fits now, but just a bit bent."
4.0,"I like the long length of this blazer. The fabric is nice. The black, really more a charcoal, has white lines , giving a heathered effect. The lining is polyester. Not crazy about the faux bone button or the fake pockets. The fit is tight across the upper arms. Still can wear it but it is snug. Gets a bit wrinkly but is lightweight.I wanted it for office use but it is more suitable to casual wear."
4.0,"Very little stretch, but otherwise well made. If you're unsure of size go up one."
4.0,These are very well made glasses. Yellow makes it easy to see as the daylight fades or transitioning from bright light into shadows. Only thing is it doesn‚Äôt go dark enough in bright sunlight.
4.0,The top of the dress is a little bigger than expected. I bought a large and I am a 40 D but the breast area has too much room. The actual dress fits perfectly. I wear a 14 and the large is perfect. The original picture showed a skirt under the front layers of the dress but it only turned out to be a black slip.
4.0,Looks good so far. It's light. It fuctions correctly. The only issue is the light which is dim. I really don't care. I just wanted a affordable watch that works. I don't know if it will last. Only time will tell.
4.0,Very nice size. Fits laptop and a days worth of middle school papers to grade.
4.0,"Very elegant watch, it is an odd color gold, but it‚Äôs gold plated so there you go.  Looks very nice with any and everything."
4.0,Cute! Just have to wait a bit they are to big and look a little funny.
4.0,Good swimsuit. Fits as expected. Flattering though the skirt is a bit longer than I expected but not that much longer.
4.0,"I was lucky enough to get to try the cat pattern mask with matching bandana.  I don't know if I will use the bandana much (and my cat will have NOTHING to do with wearing it) but I really like the mask. It is a bit thinner than other masks I wear, but it doesn't feel unsafe.  I have a larger face so the size of it is good.  I love the adjustable straps.  If you have to wear a mask all day, it should be cute.  This one is super cute.  The set seems fairly priced."
4.0,The shirt is a little big. And the headband does not come with the bow. You have to tie the bow yourself.other than that it's really pretty.
4.0,I hate my daughter walking around barefooted because my floors are so slippery and she is always falling. When my daughter seen these slippers she immediately wanted to put them on. Now I cannot get her to take them off. When I put her to bed and I try to take these off so she can go to bed she throws a fit so I let her fall asleep with them on then I take them off. They look like boots so I let her wear them to daycare one day.
4.0,"*** NOTE: I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. ***<br /><br />The Greatrees Cotton Cargo Shorts is a nice, slightly dressier than normal, set of cargo shorts.  I received a 36&#34; size in the green color and I liked both the color and size.  Although many reviewers complain that these shorts ran small, my 36&#34; pair fit me like every other pair of 36&#34; shorts I've ever purchased (which means they were a little big on me as I have a 35&#34; waist).  Honestly because they are 100% cotton, I hope they shrink a little so that I don't have to wear these with a belt.  The material is very soft and fine which is in contrast to the typical cargo shorts that you buy where the material is either denim or a thick, durable cotton blend.  The length was also pretty long and hit me about mid-knee - and I'm 6'6&#34; - so they might almost be like capris on shorter men.  I also liked all the pockets as several of them are very deep and the one zippered pocket on the left leg is very handy.<br /><br />The one major drawback I had with this product is that the material is so delicate that it requires you to hand wash and either carefully machine dry or line dry the shorts - which essentially makes this product like dress pants.  Considering even my dress pants are machine wash/dry, I have no other clothes that I have to treat like this so cleaning them will be very inconvenient for me.<br /><br />Overall, despite the added cleaning requirements, I really liked these shorts and fond the $14.99 purchase price to be VERY reasonable as similar shorts would sell easily for more than twice this much in the stores."
4.0,"This is a shimmery, dainty, very nice chain. It's stamped with 'Italy' and '925'. The clasp works fine, it's not too hard to open, nor does it stick at all.  If you are looking for a delicate chain, this would be a great choice. The chain link style and/or plating make this a very shiny chain, it's pretty."
4.0,"I don't know if it bothers anyone else, but I was worried one would say ""the Jim to..."" and the other would say ""my Pam to..."" like in the pictures. But, they both say ""the Jim to..."" and ""the Pam to..."" if anyone else was bothered by that and curious. It's a great product overall! I love it:)"
4.0,"I don't really look good in hats and I thought this shape would be the exception but no. It did fit a little small, I wish it had a little more material to adjust it out more but it was fine to do outdoor work in the yard."
4.0,material is alittle  on the thin side
4.0,"Fits as hoped, however, would have preferred button tabs on the sleeve to give me the option to shorten sleeves."
4.0,"After the purchase of this product I got lots of compliments from friends & others, looks good, fits well and I loved it."
4.0,"Was just as expected, for the price a bargin!"
4.0,Terrific product. My son has worn his for almost a month. In the bath/shower after playing in all kinds of 'muck'...well worth the money. My only issue is the clasp. That could be improved upon.
4.0,I bought these for my tragis - and got fed up with how difficult it is to change so I stopped putting them in.
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but still pretty. A few feather strings were bent in package but will straighten out by the time I need it.
4.0,"Comfortable, flattering, washable. Perfect length for my 5'4&#34; height."
4.0,I bought it for the wife..yet to know how she likes it...I like the way it looks.
4.0,"I would have given it a 5 except that i didn't like the waist band. A wider and flat waistband would have been more preferable. The material though is really nice and soft, the colors are vibrant."
4.0,Loved the fleece feel for when it‚Äôs cold. Could‚Äôve went up 2 sizes and bc it wasn‚Äôt long enough to wear without leggings. Quality of the thread isn‚Äôt the good.
4.0,"I buy this magazine every football season.  I live in a small town and no one sells NFL mags.  I had to buy from Amazon and it cost 2 times the amount as else where.  Also, the stats have changed from past issues.  I don't care for the new format."
4.0,"The dress is very stylish and I particularly like the lacey upper body and wide/high collar.  I do not like that the material has more  cotton in the fabric blend which will require me to iron out the wrinkles in the skirt frequently.  It is an attractive style of dress, but it does fit a bit snug for me (normally a medium is perfect in blouses and dresses).  I am still thinking I will have to return it.  Concerned that a large would be too big for my chest and waist area."
4.0,I like the color.  It is a nice bag but it is a little small with not much room.
4.0,"I'm almost certain this is glass, but it's pretty and comfortable to wear. I love that the adjustment is easy to work."
4.0,worked well on mtn bike shoes and casual type shoes feet stayed warm good price and easy to put over shoes with velcro
4.0,"Love my Doonies :) This one is no exception. But 4 stars instead of usual 5 only because it is, after all a tad too small. And lacks the usual great planning details inside. I wish there was another small pocket for pen/stylus and probably another one for documents.<br /><br />Otherwise it is a traditionally great Dooney& Bourke bag - beautiful, light, stylish and extremely cool. People keep asking me about the brand and where did I get it."
4.0,"I LOVE sharks so naturally I had to get this. Super cute and good quality, but the one down side is the glue that hold the silver piece that buttons the clasp has started unsticking at times from use. I will just super glue it down myself and hope it works out."
4.0,Cute hat but it's  for  like a brand new baby. Not  a 1year old.
4.0,"I like the glasses and you won't go wrong at this price, knocked off one star because I purchased the black frames and the picture shows blue lenses but what I received was more of a light orange/brown lens.  Still nice, just think they should be shipping what is pictured."
4.0,The costume was beautiful.  I got so many compliments on it.
4.0,"I like these.  They're very comfortable and I love that they have no itchy tag.  They were somewhat larger than I was expecting, but they still fit fairly well."
4.0,Wrinkles easily but I love the dress!!
4.0,They even look good on me...  A little bit expensive though.  They seem well made and the optics are good.
4.0,"There service was great. Especially with a bad USPS shipping issue. My one complaint was the bright pink ties listed were actually light pastel pink and not what we really wanted or needed. But I would certainly do business with them again, I would just email them before I made my purchase. [...]"
4.0,The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's really long I'm 5'3 and it hits the floor and longer. Besides all that it's a really pretty dress and in my opinion I like the fabric it's light weight and breezy!
4.0,"Way too big as a purse, and the opening is a little narrow, but it is working out great as a school book bag! The wide strap distributes the weight rather comfortably. I plan to add some outside pockets to mine for pens/cellphone."
4.0,"When I received it, it had a small scratch on the inside face, not a huge deal but I could see it. Also sometimes it kind of hurts my wrist if I bend it too much, but I really do like it. I would recommend it for sure"
4.0,"Lots of compliments due to the cuteness factor, however, the strap is quite short."
4.0,Kind of small but worked
4.0,"I‚Äôm really enjoying this band, the quality seems close to the original apple band I received with my watch, other bands I‚Äôve purchased are a lot thinner."
4.0,"I know it's suppose to look like a vintage bag, but it really looks and smells like it was produced 100 years ago (LOL!). Even the plastic bag looked like something Indiana Jones would find in a cave somewhere and had years worth of dust on it. However, the bag is as pretty as the picture - although it still has a funny smell (even after I've put a Moso charcoal bag in it for 3 consecutive months."
4.0,good price for your bucks
4.0,"Love the costume, it is very cute !!"
4.0,They are very warm but don't stretch to great so be careful with the size choice
4.0,"Purchased this shirt in hopes that it would make a good base layer staple for my winter workouts. I love the color and the feel of the fabric but the sleeves are strangely tight. I do not lift weights so my arms not very built but I felt a bit constricted in the Small. The body and shoulders were loose and nice and the length of the shirt is great. Also noticed that the shirt is pretty see-through. My bra and tattoos show through the fabric though this does not bother me as much, it being a base layer. Going to return it for a medium with the hope that the rest of the shirt is not too baggy.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5‚Äô5 / 140lbs / 34DD"
4.0,Awesome hat!! Unlike anything I've ever seen!! Unfortunately...it doesn't fit. I'm not a Flat bill hat kinda guy I guess.
4.0,I thought the adult xs would be fine for my nine year old. They are tiny.
4.0,"It would have been perfect, but the shoulders did not fit right. I'm an average size person, and the shoulders were about 2 inches above the top of mine. If I pulled the dress down. so it too low. I really wanted this dressto work for me and even tries another  one that was very simular, but I had the same problem."
4.0,Great quality! The person I bought it for loved it!
4.0,Fabric doesn't breath -feels sort of slimy.
4.0,"First let me say this is a GREAT sports bra for cup sizes up to about DD, I think.  However, I am a 34G so it's very difficult to find a great fit that actually covers everything without looking like a medical garment.  Additionally I get headaches from racer and cross-back bras so I need ones that are convertible.  Those things combined make it very difficult to find the perfect sports or lounge bra.  This one ALMOST makes the grade and would absolutely fit the bill if it just had a little less padding.  Of course this is a push-up sports bra so its supposed to have padding and I am 100% keeping this as a lounge bra, but for sports, I'll bounce right out the top due to the excessive padding.  That being said, ladies who want the boost...THIS ONE IS GREAT!  Looks great, feels great, and is really great quality!"
4.0,"Shipped/arrived as expected, chair is solid and appears very well built.  Like it very much."
4.0,Good watch but smaller than I like.
4.0,"The fabric is high quality, but just a little thin, almost like a pair of capri tights. So good for wearing as pants under a tunic that is long enough to cover the crotch and butt. Very comfortable fit. I wear a size 12 and ordered a large."
4.0,"The top portion is really pretty, but the body is big....I needed a large belt to make it fit my torso. The green colour is super vibrant"
4.0,"The cardigan edge looks straight but is actually curved out in the chest area which might look great on a bigger busted women, but for small chests it shows us what's lacking. Otherwise quality of fabric is nice. Will keep because color, price and quality are good, and the chest thing is just a minor detail."
4.0,"For a one size fits most, it was small. I usually wear a Medium. It served it's purpose even if a little small... lol."
4.0,I like it and it's so lightweight
4.0,Works as design and feels high quality!
4.0,Cute shirt but it looks more like a maternity shirt on me. So i don't wear it.
4.0,"Really cute and soft, but size up. It's just a super short torso, so if you raise your arms at all, its coming up."
4.0,"In good condition when it arriveed. Package arrived 10 days earlier than the arrival day!! Sweet!! Felt sturdy and stable, so it should last a while if I take good care of it. The band is adjustable. The cross and beads are very small compared to the image, but still noticeable. I am satisfied!"
4.0,Was a little small but it was a little smaller than expected
4.0,Nice quality...a little longer than I like...but very comfortable.
4.0,"Fits well, but is too short on the upper torso for what you'd expect for a XXL.  I'm 6'4&#34; 270 and it does fit well, just sits right at the waist.  Wish it was like 3-4&#34; longer."
4.0,Love these I want blue and can‚Äôt find  them
4.0,They are comfortable nightgown!
4.0,Good quality. As described. True to size. Looks really nice with shorts or jeans.
4.0,"I bought the black one. It fits nice, looks somewhat like it is in the picture. Im about 5&#34;4 and around 120-125 pounds: so the shoulder straps dont fit me well, so i just tuck them in the skirt. But besides that it is good!"
4.0,love it but its a bit longer than I expected it to be. Will work ok but wont be able to wear my tall boots with it and this or there will be no gap between them and the dress
4.0,"I am 5'4"" and weight 100 lbs. This fit me perfectly and I can even wear leggings underneath if it gets chilly. The only downside to this was that the waist is a bit large and doesn't fit like the rest. Otherwise, I'd recommend this product!"
4.0,The material is little thin but good enough. I am happy.
4.0,"for an every day hat it fills the bill, it does the job, its what I need..."
4.0,"This dress is really cute, but its super see-through. For me, it looks better without a bra, but it's way too see-through to be able to pull that off. If the top was lined, it would be five stars.  Really wishing this fit better/wasn't so sheer!"
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars if it didn't smell heavily of cigarettes. Someone must have been smoking near where it was stored or transported. I love the bag, nice quality, and slightly darker blue than pictured. Many pockets. I like light draw string bags but we all know they lack compartments/pockets to keep stuff organized.  I love that I can attach my hand sanitizer to the little black loop in the middle of the bag. I used tiny scissors to cut out the stitches of the little rubber logo at the bottom since I didn't like the way it looked. The holes from the stitches are so minimal that it looks fine and are barely noticeable.  This bag looks nice, repels a light rain, feels very nice, and is of very good quality. It can also fit far more stuff than it looks like it can fit. Its my favorite bag I ever bought.  I sprayed this bag with perfume and the cig stink went away right away.  Don't hesitate to buy.....  EDIT :: as of March 2018 I've been using this bag daily,  still awesome,  still in great shape"
4.0,"These are very unique and beautiful. All came to me undamaged, all but one. One had 1 Pearl rhinestone missing. But i could easily fix it.  Thanks üíã"
4.0,"Very cute in person, they fit my face just right but the plastic part on the right arm that goes over the ear is already a little loose after wearing for just a few days. It kind of slips back and forth but doesn't come fully off (yet). You get what you pay for though- these are inexpensive glasses after all."
4.0,"Pros: The material is very dressy, not see-thru and has some stretch in the chest/arms.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äù2 and it comes past my knees, very modest dress!  I couldn‚Äôt count how many compliments I got wearing it, it looks very nice with heels and pearls (I bought the navy blue stripe).  Would definitely buy again in other colors and patterns.<br /><br />Cons: This is not a casual dress, the material has a sheen to it that gives it a very classy and dressy feel.  The fabric doesn‚Äôt look cheap though, it‚Äôs well made.  The dress shipping was way off and I received the dress before the tracking came available."
4.0,"Bought one for my daughters birthday. Sweater was a nice light weight pull-over, great for cool school mornings. Thought I got the right size, definitely should always go a size bigger, as it looks to have shrunk a bit since having it."
4.0,"After several years, I still have some left over and it works just as well as it did the day I bought it."
4.0,"They are nice quality, I love them besides the middle nose part gets stuck in my hair a lot."
4.0,"Cute, there were doubles of some charms, not exactly as picture but good product that we did enjoy."
4.0,"Ordered a small but the top was a little  large, not the cups but where the band would be. This didn't come in an xs. I didn't bother to try on the bottom as it looked smaller than what I prefer. Please sell tops separately. Otherwise it was pretty."
4.0,"I bought  it for fantasy, it's not really perfect but for the price, it worth giving it a 4 star rating."
4.0,These were super cute but they were a bit tight around the top. I have pretty small legs (size 2-4) and they gave me a slight muffing top on my thigh.
4.0,Bought it as a gift and they like it.
4.0,They are cute and they are true to size
4.0,"Run large in my opinion. Especially big in the waist. Nice fabric and construction, however."
4.0,Looks nice nice quality
4.0,"These sunglasses are perfect for outdoor reading which is something that I do a lot. These are lightweight and made with thin metal.  They are suppost to be Bifocal Reading Glasses so at the bottom is for reading but I didn't notice that much of a magnification. These are more purple tinted than grey, and my husband said they look more like women's. They do come with a case and small screwdriver for repairs."
4.0,"Well a little disappointed I was looking for masks made in USA which these said ,but when arrived they clearly were not Chinese writing on package as well as paper inside package. Masks are very comfortable and not scratchy like done masks . I get ours of compliments on them"
4.0,washed well . does not require any ironing just a tad larger than I expected.
4.0,I got the purple one it looks just like the picture super cute but after having it in for three days both balls fell off and can't find them :(
4.0,Husband said his feet stay warmer. Buy a larger size than normal.
4.0,"Cute. The khaki color wasnt as dark as the photo. Doesn't look like picture. I was tied between this color and black.  I should of went with the black. Also is you have pants or ckothes that pick up a lot of lent, this jacket will leave its fuzz. Need to bring a lent roller with you.."
4.0,I need to wear spanks with this dress. It hugs every corner and you can see dimples and sometimes snags on leg stubble.
4.0,"They are too much shining and bright for me.  Bought them in a bundle with a ring from the same store, looks amazing for someone else but not on me.<br />Sorry, not my style."
4.0,"I really like this umbrella! It's perfect for rainy days and casual use. However, it takes a while to lock the umbrella in place."
4.0,Tight . May need to alter it smashes my eyes and edges are kind of sharp .
4.0,"Very nice looking and very comfortable for an 18mm band (which generally are not). It does scratch and get damaged very easily. But, that's the trade off for the comfort of this material. Looks great with a dark blue watch face."
4.0,I like all of these earrings and wear them on my second earrings. They're comfortable to sleep with it on. Some posts are loose so you need to squeeze the post to make it more secure.
4.0,Love the length! Love that the material is not to thick and not to thin. It can be worn when it's a little chilly outside
4.0,light and airy fun to wear good fit..the elestic around the top keep it snug. good for the summer
4.0,"Good Quality and arrived fast. Pretty good deal, for the price that others are charging for one similar watchband, I got two!"
4.0,"I love the swimsuit. My was larger than expected, I should have ordered my true size or down one.  Decent quality."
4.0,"Nice shirt, just not a fan of the sleeves."
4.0,Super cute but i shoulda bought them smaller
4.0,didn't have the balance stabilizers on the bottom that also kept bottom of bag clean. It falls over alot like you have to balance the inside but i had a similiar bag before and loved it so hopefully this one will grow on me. Love the extra pouch in the middle and that you can zipper it shut making it hard for anyone to pick pocket.
4.0,"These are really cute and surprisingly comfortable despite the height of the heel.  They did rub the top of my foot as the strap was a little tight across that area.  The nude color matches almost any outfit, making these pretty versatile.  I wore them almost every day of a recent Caribbean trip and they held up fine.  I don't see any issues with them falling apart but I am anxious to see how they hold up to continued use due to other reviews.  At this point I don't see any issues in materials or workmanship though."
4.0,"You get what you see, its not a case, its pretty and the glitter won't stay in ur hand.<br />I bought 2"
4.0,"comfy, but kind of sheer. I have to where a tankini under it."
4.0,"It's stretchy kind of fabric, but it's ok. Fits just fine n length is just what I wanted, sitting on my hips."
4.0,"These are so so cute and soft but the first time my one year old wore the pink pair, a hole tore in the crotch. The fabric is nice enough that I am able to sew it but a little disappointed that literally 5 mins after putting them on, they ripped. The white pair has had no issues."
4.0,I wish the next size up was available.  This sandal is very nice.
4.0,"These look exactly like they do in the photos, and work well.  They feel and look a little cheap,  but they are comfy and great for the spare pair you keep in your car or bag. I wore them all day at a water slide park and they were great for that. Stayed on in the wave pool, and dried off nicely.  At the price,  I wasn't afraid to lose them."
4.0,This HD Glasses Night is so cute I like. I will introduce to everyone.<br />Thanks!
4.0,Very nice necklace but would like one a little smaller.
4.0,"As long as you buy very big (this is not American sizing), and expect it to be more of a shirt than sweatshirt, you will love it! I get noticed every time I walk out of the house in this."
4.0,Beautiful dress by way too long. I am5'8&#34; and it was vey long. Otherwise it was vey pretty
4.0,"This collection has a sophisticated color palette. The colors are so unique that I bought 2 of these bags nd my husband bought a third for Valentine's Day: marine, burnt orange and light gray (which has blue undertones)<br />The Good:<br />Colors are rich, bag is roomy but not too wide, strap drop works well for my height (5'9), cute little coin purse has a back pocket and inside zip. Bag is structured so that it stands on its own (I have a black pebble leather drawstring I really enjoy that sort of collapses onto itself once its set down).<br />The Bad:<br />The tassels at the end of the drawstring are large so it stops the bag from opening as wide as it could.<br />The Ugly:<br />I doubt that I will buy saffiano leather again. I am a great fan of the rich Dooney leathers. Saffiano feels like coated canvas. Also, when I draw my pebble drawstring up it stays closed; this saffiano stuff allows the drawstring to relax just the slightest bit so the bag doesn't cinch as tightly as it could. Believe it or not the O rings look so much like gold plastic I literally had to bite one to assure myself they are metal (they are).<br /><br />Shipping was a bit of an issue. When I checked the Fed Ex tracker my packages were scheduled to arrive on Friday; perfect since we were going out of town Sat. No packages on Friday so we cancelled the trip. They shipped Smart Post from I Love Dooney so the arrival date the tracker gave was the date the packages arrived at my post office, not at my house. Thanks, Fed Ex.<br /><br />Overall I am happiest with generous sized structured bags that I can toss all my stuff in, then throw on my shoulder. These bags fit that bill nicely and the colors are stunning. Had this bag been offered in these colors in pebble leather my rating would have been 6 stars because I am a solid fan of Dooney's design, material and workmanship."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, and sturdy material. Apparently, I had one of the main issues other buyers had, and it was the tightness in the bust area. I ordered up a size (XXL), but still had to make a few adjustments to get it to button. I order the red, blue, and white dresses, and had the same issues with them all. If they made it in a larger size, I would have ordered it, and gave 5 stars."
4.0,Knit is loose so this is very see-through but love the length and style.
4.0,I wear it often with any outfit.
4.0,Fit good material is stretchy but the sleeves are made of a different material and is sheer. So measure your arms lady. Still cute though
4.0,"Super Cute, but it runs big on top. If you hold your weight in the middle or bust, this might be good.  It is very stretchy and soft fabric and is really well made for the price.  I liked it so much I am going to exchange the one I have for a smaller size."
4.0,"I got so tired of carrying a big purse I couldn't find anything in, and realized...I carried a big 'ol purse to carry all these things I thought I needed, but when I looked through it, all I used was my wallet (which was also huge), lip gloss, altoids, small bottle of Advil, and emergency extra tampon. I downgraded to a small crossbody and this wallet so I can run around breweries, without lugging a purse on my shoulder, and this perfect little wallet that carries my money which is all I need. I gave it 4 stars because the inside pockets aren't stitched in the back so cards get stuck there. Other than that!"
4.0,I love these shoes. I wear heals all the time and the fit well. They are somewhat narrow at the toes but overall fit well and are great with dresses.
4.0,"I finally got to try these our at our friend's wedding, they were great! They stayed on all day and gave me some nice cleavage (all the bridesmaids complemented my cleavage). The reason I gave them 4 stars not 5 is because the material is verrrrrry slow to dry. I was sweating during pictures at 5pm and the bra was still wet two hours later during dinner and it was chilly in the AC for two hours with a wet bra. If this material was quicker drying, it would have been absolutely perfect!"
4.0,"Right size for my teen son wrist.<br />Looks good, functions well."
4.0,Excellent for the price. Strap is not as cool looking as the actual goggles but they are cool enough you won't notice.
4.0,"In the summer, I like to wear this kind of sock with my athletic shoes, and this pair fits the bill. They're soft, fit my size 6.5 foot, and stay put, unlike other socks that tend to slide down into the shoe. The only gripe I have is, they're not 100% cotton, as I was lead to believe. In the heading, they should say ""cotton blend,"" not just ""cotton,"" because that's misleading, and it's why I docked them one star. Other than that, I do recommend these socks."
4.0,"This product came fast, fits well, lots of colors to choose from and reasonably priced."
4.0,it was ok. could be softer.
4.0,"Not sure how these would do for yoga as I've mostly worn them around the house (I slipped twice on my stairs in my third trimester, and it was a big scare). They definitely do the job in regard to being good, non-slip socks. They do feel a bit funny to walk around on. Overall, worth it."
4.0,"I really like this, it's so whimsical. Probably will only use this on Halloween though, it's a little too out there to wear with everyday clothes."
4.0,"I would buy again, just make sure you buy one or two sizes bigger than you normally wear."
4.0,"It is just as described, I am recently retired after many years as a  RN, and wore this as a necklace and got many compliments.  Thank you"
4.0,I love the color and how compact it is. I did expect for it to be a bit thinner. I hate that the coin compartment often opens up so I end up with loose coins in my pocket.
4.0,"Very pretty. My husband and I love them, however you are pretty much paying for the charms, which are the size of a beer cap. length wise. All-in-all a very good buy. I did take off one start because for it plus S*H I was expecting something a little more WOW"
4.0,5'2&#34; 32b 115 pounds. Medium was a good fit.
4.0,Good jeans but the button feels cheap.
4.0,Great ~looks just like picture. A bit small all the way around. But I'm taking it apart and using the pieces anyway! Great for the price!!
4.0,"as advertised, runs small"
4.0,"Good, sturdy shoe."
4.0,I ordered an L fit like a small on me. Nice quality for money.
4.0,"I love soft shirts and this one is really soft and really cute. I ordered this shirt in what they call dark green. My shirt does not look green. It is more of a grey with a hint of green than a dark green like I expected. Thankfully, I still really like it and the grey color actually looks good on me. This shirt has a pretty nice neckline. It looks like a v-neck on the hanger but when I put it on it is a little more rounded than I expected. The back also has the same shape as the front neckline. It does slip in the shoulders a little bit.<br />I am about 5‚Äô6.5‚Äù tall and weigh about 135 pounds. I ordered this shirt in a medium. It fits perfectly. It hangs just right so it highlights all the right places and hides the places that I want it to. Like I said before the shoulders are wide and slip a little bit which sometimes shows my bra straps. The neckline is flattering, but not revealing. The shirt has points on the front and back making it a really flattering hemline. This shirt looks great with jeans and cute shoes or a skirt or leggings. The fabric is thin, but not see through, and extraordinarily soft. It is so cute. I love how comfortable this shirt is. I definitely give it two thumbs up!<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,I am a 33c/d I bought a size M. I can wear it with a bra but the arm holes are larger than I thought. This works really well with a lace Sports  bra or bralette that has become trendy. You can easily  later a tank top or tee shirt under this too. It is flower and makes you feel like a princess because of the length.<br />If I order again I will get a size small to compare the size of the arm holes.
4.0,I ordered this set for my 13yr old son. We were pleased with the quality upon delivery.  Received it as promised. It was packaged in a gold gift box ready to give.<br />Will see how it holds up.<br />The true test is yet to come. Will update later.
4.0,Looks beautiful. Haven't worn them yet but I will update my review once I do.
4.0,Son loves it for baseball. They called him My Hollywood this season.
4.0,"Hat could be a little bigger but the biggest issue is the bright blinking light on the side that tells my boss in doing more than keeping my ears warm.  Why though?  Get rid of the light,  it's unnecessary really."
4.0,"Bought this for work, fit is a bit on the big side. It's comfortable and good quality."
4.0,"I like the fact that it fits perfectly around the curves and that it is slightly see-through. It looks sexiest without a bra or a thong. It always looks like  a person is insecure when adding layers just to hide your body parts! If you‚Äôre going out to look sexy, then be sexy! It‚Äôs not how you look as much as hell a person behaves! You can look the part of anything for any event that‚Äôs appropriate and the only thing you‚Äôll get is confidence and respect from those who feel too reserved<br />But wished they could just live in the moments that  are quickly fleeting."
4.0,I bought the skirts so I could have some nice skirts to wear and be comfortable.  They are super comfortable and fitting.  Nothing that I dislike.
4.0,"Purchased this for a rough weather, earthquake or whatever 3-day pack and it works great for that.<br />Got meds, supplies, clothing, MRE's, survival stuff and room for more. Well made and strong zippers/nylon snaps.<br />Light and useful pockets- I bought a camel bag for water as well and it has space for that.<br />May never use but it's good to have."
4.0,"You'll end up with a zipper in an uncomfortable place until the suit stretches a little to fit your body shape, but it's actually pretty comfortable once you break it in. I bought mine to wear for a Catwoman and/or Black Widow cosplay, and so far it seems to be working great."
4.0,"This is a watch that is well made. It has the quartz movement - which means a battery when it quits working. The dial has crystals around it to help make it look dressier rather than sporty. It has a nice buckle metal bracelet that is adjustable. To open and close, you only have to squeeze the sides of the latch - so much easier than some of the others. I like the Relic watches. They are well made. They also have mineral crystals, which help to keep them from scratching. The hands on this watch are silver and the face is a pink color."
4.0,"Thin with a touch of style ,but  no safety on the clasp."
4.0,"These gloves are good and did what I wanted them to do. The only thing was the smell, which is why I deducted a star. I'm not sure if something was applied to the leather to preserve it but the smell was really bad. It took two days of letting them air out for the smell to dissipate."
4.0,I'm like
4.0,"Go to normal size,  I made mistake by going a size up and ordered a medium,  which was loose on me.  I should've ordered a small."
4.0,"I wear it as a headband because my hair is in that awkward stage where it's too short to tie up, but it's also all over my eyes. This works great with my glasses on, and with some practice and wear, it'll slowly stretch out wider. Definitely not bad for the price!"
4.0,Sizes run big. I wear a 7 but had to send back and get 6. Good cheap ring.
4.0,The earrings open up as I wear them. I had to wear them with a rubber stopper on the backs to keep from losing one.
4.0,They are somewhat comfortable but I would suggest ordering a half size down on what you normally wear.
4.0,"Nice, washes well"
4.0,"This top is so fun!  I do find that i have to twist the tie pieces in order to get a nice fit around my breasts.  Otherwise there is loose fabric that gaps in an unflattering way.  It's an easy fix.  Otherwise, this top is really cute."
4.0,It really helps
4.0,Packaged well and were well received as gifts
4.0,"I like this dress! I wish the fabric was something a little sexier, but it's a nice fitting piece."
4.0,Well fitting. Flattering cut.
4.0,"Bought this for a costume party for my husband. Based on the sizing chart I was a little torn between getting him a Large or an X-Large due to him being 6'4 and 195lbs. I opted for the XL - the top fit length wise/arm wise but it was very wide and baggy. The pants that came with it on the other hand had a tiny elastic waistband, thankfully it's super stretchy and my husband is thin for how tall he is. Decent quality material, seems to be the same as you'd find in a regular seasonal Halloween store or Target. Pretty much what I expected for the price."
4.0,Very pretty and elegant looking.  The set is one that I think will get worn many times with various outfits.
4.0,Really cute. How it ties around the top is kinda weird. Kinda big in the hip but worried a smaller size would be too tight around my stomach.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ebbd1bd919e5cd3320a561b9b2197fd7]] Super comfortable. Wished I filled the top out more but still like it.
4.0,"I ordered the pink tweed. Super cute!<br /><br />Jacket is overall a tad big (especially in the arms), but that‚Äôs an easy fix via a seamstress.<br />The shorts fit perfectly.<br /><br />Quality is pretty good. Beats spending $$$$$$ on chanel tweeds.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend üòÄ"
4.0,"I use these on a fishing pole for my cats. They're pretty good, but do note that the claws are quite sharp (I trimmed them with the same scissor type clippers I use on my cats). The attachment point is not bad, but can't hold up to a determined 10 lb cat when I tried to tie it to their cat tree. And of course only lasted a minute after he got it down. The dye comes loose pretty easily (I got purple so the cats could set it well) so be aware and maybe wipe down with a damp towel or get the undyed like I probably will next time."
4.0,"This is great for organizing your items, but it is large and hard to put in a carry on or back pack for travel."
4.0,Loveee it! Fresh material for summer season.
4.0,Loved the top ONLY
4.0,Not bad for the price and quality!!
4.0,"I can't wait to get it, I'ma make this hat look like it just came out, I'ma kill it !!!"
4.0,pretty rose gold
4.0,"Shirt has quality build, but very small.  Should have ordered Asia XL instead of L to fit a person that normally wears small misses."
4.0,"Great T shirt for hot summer days. I like the fabric a lot and my child likes to wear it. Unfortunately it runs very small, more like a 12 mo size"
4.0,"Delivery took about 10 days to arrive and for the most part, it is pretty much what I expected.<br /><br />I am an XL and for me, I would not call this &#34; clingy &#34; but I also would not say that it flows at all. It is more like a loose fitting t shirt in my opinion. I do think it is cute and not upset about buying it, I just wish it was a little bit longer, but I do have a big booty lol."
4.0,Value for money; some heavy; not as much variation of color as expected. Just different shapes. But good enough.
4.0,Very nice looking watch. Not to big but very noticeable. Bought it for my mother
4.0,Took a bit to remove a few links but the product looks really good.  Will be training with it outside running and pool laps...
4.0,This is the third set of plugs I have purchased in different sizes. I just received my order for 1\2 and noticed that the rose quartz pair is chipped on the saddle and am unable to wear them. Very disappointed to have an issue with my favorite stone. These are by far the most comfortable plugs I have worn which is what makes this damage so disappointing.
4.0,It was a good pair of glasses that I took with me traveling without being worried about losing it.
4.0,"Thin, lightweight jacket - - perfect for days that are still too warm for heavier jackets."
4.0,Love the purse. The zipper at the bottom is a nice touch. It's a good size and I can find things easily in it. There is a smell that even leaving it outside for a few days hasn't  disappeared completely! I even put a dryer sheet inside thinking it would help and it has somewhat. Just hope those near me can't smell it and wonder if it's me instead of the purse. Would give it a 5 except for the smell!
4.0,"Looks good, feels good. Strings come out, not the best quality, but i didnt expect it to be."
4.0,A little short on my 12 year old but cute.
4.0,"NICE RING 4 MY PINKY, A LITTLE ON THE LARGE SIZE, HOLLOW B-HIND STONE & UPPER AREA, BUTTE IT'S OK !!"
4.0,Very pretty dress. Wearing it for the formal day on a cruise.
4.0,"Good quality and nicely packaged.<br />Socks are thin dress socks, so they are not super-cushioned like sports socks, but they are comfortable."
4.0,A nice lower cost alternative to the expensive Pandora and Brighton Beads for my Teen daughter.
4.0,"Had to return, just didn't look good on me. But it is is nice fabric and the gray was a pretty color soft gray. I may try again and get a large instead of med and see if it looks better. Medium is my normal size. I actually bought it to wear with leggings, I'm not into mini dresses."
4.0,"good product, offer matches what I like and what I wanted, I hope to have better deals in the future"
4.0,I found out that Cargo shorts and Backpacking work together very well on long trips.  With these shorts I was completely confritable and I could place extra stuff for my outdoor activities.
4.0,Should be able to close properly when u put cards in it
4.0,Light weight folds really compact
4.0,Pretty earrings but I would have preferred ones that resembled the picture. The ones I received were smooth and had no textured design. They are nice but not as nice looking as the ones advertised. :(
4.0,Pants are perfect but the top runs a little to small. Very soft and comfortable and I‚Äôve bought the pamts before.
4.0,"I enjoy these bike shorts.  They are lighter compression that any of the other pairs I have and felt a bit big through the legs.  If ordering again, I would size down to a M, but note that the legs never got baggy at all although feeling looser than I was expecting.  The pockets are nice and deep and I actually like the subtle three seam decoration below.  I appreciate that, while not slick or shiny, these are not the soft/clingy fabric that sticks to itself, other fabrics, lint, and pet hair.  Some of my comparable (in terms of quality/price point) bike shorts are this other ""sticky"" material and it is undesirable.  The material of these is soft, yet does not cause my shirts or pet hair to cling.  If you need compression I would look elsewhere, but if you want a pair of longer, stylish, functional bike shorts these fit the bill."
4.0,"I just wish there was a compartment for change and coins. Also the wallet was much bigger than I expected, with less compartments."
4.0,This is a beautiful purse. I just wish the straps were longer or an additional set of straps were provided so I could sling over my shoulder.
4.0,"I've been crowing about how awesome NYDJ pants are for a few months now, but finally I have found a pair that is not entirely perfect.<br /><br />My main concern about these pants is the material.  I guess NYDJ is trying something new, which is great, no problem there.  But it doesn't quite work out for me.  The material is very soft and comfortable but doesn't have the dressy finish that I am looking for.  It could have been a perfect combo but doesn't quite seem right.<br /><br />The fit is decent, but not as good as the other pants I own by NYDJ.  I hope they come out with an updated version because I think there is a need for pants like this, but these just don't quite work for me."
4.0,Nice product. Shipped fast. Only complaint is that it faded and looked worn after 1 week of daily use.
4.0,"Need to dress up when wearing this, but it is lovely"
4.0,Love this. Any possibility of making tote bags out of the license plates? Good idea.
4.0,Loved it. Great piece of costume jewellery to wear while snorkeling.
4.0,Ok for the price point. Perfect for the little one that has princess-on-the-brain. She loved it
4.0,"It's actually 2 chains, it's cute I like it. I wish it was little shorter though."
4.0,"Gets fuzzies quickly so it‚Äôs only good for a few wears before downgrading in closet line up. Sexy, fits perfect, feels great! Definitely buy."
4.0,"I ordered this sweatshirt for my husband and it looks great! The colors and image look exactly as pictured. I do suggest ordering a size larger, though, since it runs a bit small."
4.0,"Actually sounds pretty good and it's actually pretty comfortable, the only issue i've had with it is the battery life. Other than that, great purchase."
4.0,Smaller than I expected but they were all in one piece and I'm glad the front magnified the flowers so you can see them
4.0,I like the product.  It would have gotten a 5 but there  is a kink in the chain that will not come out and it causes itching. However it works great .
4.0,"These cufflinks are not only beautiful, but well priced.  I don't know why the words, &#34;Christmas Present&#34; and &#34;Wedding,&#34; are in their description.  I wear them to work, and with a purple tie, they sparkle."
4.0,It is everything I was looking for. Very easy to get on and off. The only problem I have is that I have very small wrists and the bracelet can not be drawn tight enough to fit my wrist. It is constantly slipping around my wrist.
4.0,"Overall, I like this dress. The pattern is cute, the fit is good, and it has no quality issues. The price is also great for the quality you get. I normally wear a size 12-14 (XL), but I went with the 3X based on the product description, which fits well. The belt it came with barely fits, and I have a relatively thin waist, so it definitely won't fit someone who is stronger in the stomach area. This isn't really an issue though, the dress looks good enough without the belt, and I can wear one of my own with it. The only thing I don't like is the length - I'm 5'7'' and the dress hits a little above my knees, and rides up a little when I sit. I don't really like showing my thighs without tights or leggings, so I really wish the dress was a little longer. I will probably wear it as a dress later on when I can wear black tights and boots with it. I think it will look great with a simple black or navy cardigan."
4.0,Fit was nice
4.0,I ordered three pairs of these leggings.  The first one I took out of the package had a hole in the seam of the left leg.  It looked like it haf been returned because the packaging was not the same as the other two pairs of leggings.  The one with the tear also did not have the 90 Degree tag with it either.  I returned those for a refund.  The other two pair I really am happy with however one of the items was not the color I ordered however; I liked it and kept it.
4.0,"Durable material, nice color, great fit, layout my little guys face and ears protected at the beach!! Not to mention how cute it looked on his handsome little head :)"
4.0,as advertised. arrived on-time
4.0,Great product.  It does help keep the mask away from your face.  It is a little small.  I‚Äôm not sure if it comes in different sizes.
4.0,"I did a simple air test with this bag.  I opened it fully and then quickly sealed it up to trap air in it.  I then squeezed the bag to see if air would come out and it did.  Slowly, but its definitely not airtight.  I'm assuming that air was coming out of the seams so that is where you would have possible water entry into the bag.  Luckily, I didn't need an absolutely airtight/waterproof bag....just something that was going to be water resistant when in a light rain.<br /><br />The storage bag it comes with is a little unusual in that the string is sewn into the inside of the bag.  This is nice because you won't lose it and you can also put smaller items in it when the bag is in use in order to not lose them in the bottom of the abyss.....LOL.<br /><br />Packing it back up to store in the small travel bag was not an issue but you'll definitely want to observe how it first comes out of the bag.  It is small so if it isn't done just right, you'll have a struggle putting it back in."
4.0,I really like this and get lots of compliments on it. It ran a tiny bit big but I'd say it's pretty true to size.
4.0,"Ordered these for a birthday party favor and it has a great assortment of colors. The coolest ones were the hearts, as they are removable from the bracelet. It becomes an instant hair stretchy! So now your head matches the arm bling. Great value. Love the colors. Made better than most and it doesn't hurt when you wear it all day."
4.0,"I got this jacket yesterday and it's wonderful! I'm 5'7 with a long torso and a 38 inch bust. I normally for in a women's 10 so based on the sizing I ordered a large. It's a touch snug but I can still wear it comfortably, so I'm not sure if it's me or the sizing? Aside, I wore it in 23 degree temperatures with some drizzling and it held up really well and was very warm. All around good product with sturdy construction."
4.0,"I have a head circumference of about 22 inches (56 cm) and after awhile notice a little bit of tightness. I put the wig on as soon as I got it out of the bag, and in about 5 minutes it was on. It came with a black stretchy mesh band that stretches easily to cap my hair (I have short hair, so I had very little trouble getting the cap on properly). I ordered the product on February 20 and it arrived on February 23 with Prime.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to put on; color is pretty much just like in the picture with some exceptions of lighting; fits nicely without much discomfort at all.<br /><br />Cons: Has a few flyaways on the crown of the wig as well as some spots in the front that stick out randomly; crown has a rough, fake-hair feel to it while the neck hairs are soft and near lifelike; the bangs are way too long for my cosplay, but that can be fixed with some styling.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great price and a great product. Can't wait to hear feedback at Con!"
4.0,"Very nice knit fabric. Has a medium weight to it, however, it is a stretchy knit fabric, so while i ordered an XL hoping for it to drape loosely, it fits more snug and that wasn't what I wanted in a sweater vest. I want an old fashion sweater vest that fits like a v neck pull over sweater, but without sleeves. Seems to be hard to find these days. I'm bummed. It was a nicely made item, just too small  due it it's stretchy-ness that has it still skimming your body shape.."
4.0,"Bought two pairs - one for a friend and one for me. We both really like them, and it turned into a pair of gym shorts I didn't mind wearing out and about. The stitching on mine began to tear after a week, though. My friend has not had that issue. I wore mine camping and it may have been rough, but I wasn't expecting it to tear so soon."
4.0,"The sizes are very strange, a 3X is like a women's 12/14. The bottoms of the 3X fit properly but the top is too small. My daughter wears a 36 DD and there is boob popping out all over. She needs the suit now for a trip to Florida, so we made it work with a black bandau bra underneath."
4.0,I ordered my regular size do my sister gets an easy to wear summer dress. I‚Äôll be ordering a larger if it‚Äôs available. Can‚Äôt beat the price and the material and print is really nice.
4.0,"Well, it was packaged like any inexpensive item that comes from overseas. Just that terrible crinkly plastic flip close bag. Which is probably why there were rhinestones floating around in the bag that had fallen off and the tassel was unattached. But, with a jewelry pliers I was able to put the tassel back on the ring and back on the crown. It's a beautiful piece despite the few missing stones. Also, the ribbon didn't seem like the came color or width as the picture. Plus, It's not very long if you want to tie it and not secured other than a precariously placed knot that didn't seem like it was going to hold up to any number of dancing or going out festivities. (like the bachelorette party I wore it at.) So, I switched out the ribbon for one long black strand and it stayed on pretty well through dinner and most of the dancing. I had to readjust it midway in the club but, my hair was gettin' a little cray anyway so, it wasn't that big of a deal, although, I wish I had put some padding between my head and the crown because I definitely had a bruise on my forehead from having to have the ribbon tied fairly snugly to make it secure. Still, it was lovely and went really great with my Great Gatsby inspired 1920's Flapper outfit for my friends Bachelorette Party. (In the photo's I was having so much fun that I couldn't even take a proper selfie)"
4.0,Wanted a different watchband other than silicone for the summer.  These bands are very comfortable.
4.0,matches well with the 'rose gold' and the light brown/camel color is a nice neutral great for every day wear!
4.0,I looked good
4.0,Beautiful ! The fabric feels soft and ...
4.0,"Ok, I want to start out by saying that I am 5' 3"" and have a long body and normally wear a size 8.  I ordered this sweater in medium and I feel like it was a little big and I could have easily fit in a small.  It was a little longer than I was I expected and the arms were also long.  Other than it being a little big, I really like this sweater.  It is soft and comfortable and has an overall great fit making it great for wearing out and about or lounging around the house."
4.0,This item is ok for the price.<br />Not an impressive item.<br />Fits fine
4.0,"Very pretty.  It was just as the photo advertised.  It was also mfg with stretchy string, which was perfect for my use."
4.0,"Very nice tie with sharp colors. It arrived decently quick considering it came from overseas.  It, unfortunately, is not 100% silk as the description says, but is Polyester.  It's still a good tie and very nice for a polyester tie.  It's a gift for a huge fan and he will love this regardless of material, but the description really should be changed."
4.0,My son loved this jersey and looks fantastic in it on the soccer field!
4.0,Outfit is extremely cute and exactly what is described
4.0,"These were a perfect fit for my granddaughter. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because the description said ‚Äúmicrofiber‚Äù and I guess I was expecting something a bit thicker than normal nylon stockings. Overall, very pleased with these tights"
4.0,Nice look- nice fabrics- but for size- a bit small/ bit short- Order one size larger than your typical
4.0,comfortable with nice clear vision
4.0,"I thought they would be a lot bigger, but its fine. They are perfect for my polymer clay earrings."
4.0,I bought a large and usually I wear a medium. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 155 lbs. I wear a 29 in jeans and am a 34DDD on top. Great fit and comfortable. Has a zip up back which I love! Sequins aren‚Äôt too itchy. Vibrant colors!
4.0,"Overall they fit, the waist line is good, but they are about an inch longer than advertized."
4.0,cute bag. Everyone asks where did i buy it from... Obviously Amazon! :D
4.0,Beautiful dress! Lovely fit but I don't particularly like the piping- maybe because it isn't the exact colour of the fabric although it comes very close.
4.0,"I actually really like this dress! It is kind of a thin material, but still has weight to it. It does flow like the picture when you're walking around. I received a lot of compliments. Very cute! If you're busty, expect some cleavage."
4.0,I bought these for my son. They are true to fit. It's a nice and durable material. They have the Dickies feel with a slacks appearance. I really liked the look of them.
4.0,Watch band is a perfect color match and very adjustable to any wrist size. My only complaint is that there were no directions included in the package so I had to come back to Amazon to figure out how to put it on. Looks nice though!
4.0,"a friend lost a little gentlemans bet and now has to wear this tie.  Maybe not a the best tie for long term serious wear, but worth the price."
4.0,"Cheaply made, but that is to be expected. My daughter LOVED it! However, she is a size 5/6 and this dress fit her. I ordered the size 8, so this runs very small, I am so glad I ordered 2 sizes larger than was needed."
4.0,BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED.
4.0,"I bought this for the skirt part, but actually really liked the halter top part, I just wish the tie covered up the bra strap in the back more. I think it works best as a beach coverup to use the top half."
4.0,I haven't worn it yet but it seems like good quality for what it is.  I ordered the red color because I figured it could go with black white gray and other colors. The red color is a true red and really pretty. I think it completes the outfit. I really like it I might order other colors thank you so much !
4.0,"This sports bra has great coverage & the material is soft. It‚Äôs a tad small, which is the only reason for 4 stars."
4.0,Color darker than expected. Blue version cuter
4.0,It looks exactly the same in person and has the perfect size for my small wrist.
4.0,"These glasses are great.  They fit perfect, the frames are sturdy and they are a nice weight. Highly recommended!"
4.0,"Good product, looks nice in my cartilage piercing."
4.0,"These are pretty comfortable.  I work 12 hour shifts.  Towards the end of the shift, they start to squeeze on my ankles a bit.  Other than that, they work and fit as stated."
4.0,"Well, let me start with I bought the wrong size, my fault, I didn't read carefully enough.  I can't see the reason for returning as the cost would not be worth it.  I need to find someone who wears a size 7, I wear an 8 and I think the 8 would have fit fine as the 7 was really tight when trying on.  When I tried on I didn't realize I had bought the wrong size.  I like the style.  When choosing a size please pay attention as to what size goes to what so you don't make the same mistake I did.  Otherwise I liked the look."
4.0,"My daughter has a pair of purple and she loves them. I got these gold ones because she loves the purple ones so much I didn't want to miss out on this. I hate the silver on these gold ones. The purple is all purple, these have silver trim and it's gawdy but she still loves them. They fit true to size."
4.0,"The dress was short for me, I'm 5'9 and ordered a large. Very pretty material."
4.0,Bought this for my wife. After reading the reviews she went once size larger for the top since she has larger breast.<br /><br />Fit her perfect.
4.0,Very cute but not as comfortable. I can wear to church and quickly come home to take them off.
4.0,"I bought the wrong size case. Would like to buy another the correct size but not sure how to return, if that is a possibility?"
4.0,"I really like wider rings like this one, but, oftentimes, they're just binding and uncomfortable.  This ring is very comfortable.  It has lots of sparkling rhinestones along the top--they are inset in the gold so they don't catch or snag on anything.  I ordered a size 9 and it's definitely a standard size 9.  Nicely priced, too!"
4.0,Absolutely adorable but the sleeves were a bit short in my daughter. She is tall.
4.0,"I have worn these pants consistently the last two weeks since I received them and have become my favorite workout pants. Nice fit around my waist and through my thighs. I'm 5'10&#34; and 175# and the mediums fit great. Good, soft material and not see through(which is very important!)<br />I did receive these pants at a discount for my honest opinion."
4.0,Bought as a gift. I‚Äôm not sure it went over real well. But I really think it‚Äôs nice and a future like bag!
4.0,Finally a pair of jeans that fit and are comfortable. Not too high on waist and they hit just below the ankle. Nice color.
4.0,Nice color in a cute stylish top.
4.0,"I'm sure by now everyone has seen the viral TikTok leggings.  I have been blessed in the backside region so I don't really need them, but like everyone else, I was curious about them.  My hubs wasn't rendered speechless. My bottom didn't stick out any more than usual. If you weren't born with a bubble behind, it may enhance it... I can't say. I can say they are comfortable and the fabric helps to hide or I guess camouflage any cellulite. They aren't see through.  I like them.  The do have rouching right in the crack so it did sort of separate my cheeks."
4.0,Very nice colors and fit great! Daughter loves how lightweight they are!
4.0,"I have no complaints about the band, jus a warning that if you have a tiny wrist, it is not adjustable. There aren‚Äôt any links to remove, so it overlaps and gets a Little loose. I‚Äôm still very happy with it, it isn‚Äôt so loose that is falls off."
4.0,Too dark. You can hardly see the pattern. Otherwise the quality seems good and for is fine (though I have very thin calves so those with thicker calves my find them too tight).
4.0,"The body of the dress fit perfectly, but the straps were too large. As a result the top back part of the dress was loose. I had the straps sewn along the seams to make them tighter. The dress worked well for my event."
4.0,"This dress is really cute but it's extremely short, at least on me. And when it arrived it was dirty, like someone dropped it on the ground before they shipped it. It's thin material but great for a trip to Disney world!"
4.0,"Overall this product is great. I usually wear Large, but was afraid to get a Large due to seeing another comment said it ran small. I got an extra size. I was right on the size to get.  **The outfit is extremely hard to zip up by yourself , as your hands are slippery with the outfit out on."
4.0,Beautiful dress. Color is very vibrant
4.0,"Buttons don't exactly line up and sideseam has a tendency to pull up a little on the bottom, however, for the price I paid, ($7.98 plus shipping) it's a minor bother. I just tuck and pull a little on both things and all is ok."
4.0,"Great for a costume, but less sturdy for bashing other children. It broke. If you‚Äôre looking for real bashing and slashing power, this isn‚Äôt it. If you‚Äôre looking for an adorable Soul Reaper costume prop, this is it all the way."
4.0,Cute dress. It is a heavier material; fits like an a-line. It is a great dress for nursing mamas.
4.0,"Nice shirt, good material. Only issue: the cross in the chest is loose? But it is a nice shirt. Thank you"
4.0,"Would have been perfect, except the claps come undone easily. Almost lost the bracelet like 4 times now."
4.0,I Looooovvveee this bathing suit. I wish it stretched a little more because if I sized up then it would be too big but the medium is a little tighter than I would like but it seriously flatters my body. I have love handles that look horrible in high waisted bikinis but because the way this one is cut it hides your love handles in the front and back. I love it. I wish I could get it in every color because it's that beautiful! I'm 5'2 145 lbs.
4.0,"This one is a difficult one to review as it fits well around the waist but because I'm not very well endowed in the backside dept it fits a little looser than I'd like in the thigh and leg area. However outside of that the skirt is really cute, the colors are not vibrant but are noticeable and attractive.<br />I also ordered a denim shirt to wear with it because I loved the look that was modeled on amazon, and I look forward to finding some cute t shirts and tank tops to wear with it this summer as well.<br />Overall I am happy with this piece"
4.0,"Super cute and adorable for my daughter. It is slightly large, but not too much to make it unusable as it is a one piece halter so you can make it tighter if needed. Only downside is I wish the hat was more durable and useful."
4.0,"I got the ten pack of these and handed them out to teachers I work with and my kids. They‚Äôre great for short term , get anlittle annoying after a bit.<br /><br />The kids love them. I feel they‚Äôre just a little too small for me. It can either go over my nose and the bottom hits just under my lip , or just over the mouth and my nose doesn‚Äôt go in.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not 100% sold on them. I don‚Äôt know too many people that wear them more than an hour or so at a time"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:785ae75d789d406d6473d958fb90a089]] This Asian designer is getting better on their U.S. sizing.  They‚Äôre getting very close but it‚Äôs still running about one size too small.  I‚Äôm a 2XL, which is the size I ordered, and I can still wear this top but it winds up being form fitting instead of loose and drapey like a tunic top should be.  But I just love their designs, material and quality, the fabric is extremely soft and drapes very well, and it‚Äôs nice and stretchy too.  It is a lightweight top but not so much that it‚Äôs see through.  This particular top has 3/4 sleeves, useable pockets and a stylish handkerchief hem, both front and back.  I really like the khaki color on this top, it works very well for me.  Once they get the sizing right, I would love to buy this top in the other colors they have available.  [Note:  I strongly suggest you hang/air dry this top to prevent shrinkage.  Also hang drying also allows me to safely stretch out the material for a better fit while the garment is still damp.]"
4.0,"This top isn't as bad as some reviews claim. It's obviously not the best quality given the cheap price, but it's not the worst. I only buy clothes on Amazon if I'm looking for something I'm only going to wear once or with one outfit. I've found clothing on Amazon to be over priced and almost always lacking in quality. That said, the shirt is ribbed/waffle knit (can't tell by the pics) the fabric isn't soft to the touch (hoping that will change after I wash it and add fabric softener) the elastic waistband is wide and doesn't feel good against skin (might need to wear a cami underneath) the length is perfect as well as the sleeve length, the neck area is a tad large, but not so much that it's an issue. I purchased a size small. For reference I'm 5'5 98lbs 32B with a slightly long torso and arms. If your arms are on the shorter side they might be too long."
4.0,I got this for my son to give to his girlfriend for they 1st Valentine day together and the young lady really liked it the price for it is really good and looks super cute on them very nice for highschool sweet hearts
4.0,"Nice but the color was a bit more bright than I expected. Looking at the picture it appeared like a medium yellow but when I got it, it was a more bright mustard"
4.0,My wife has not complained.
4.0,"Measurements are as advertised. This was a much needed upgrade to my engineer's bag. Seems solid enough, and I really like the shiny finish on the clasp."
4.0,"I bought these shorts to wear while exercising however, they are too short for that purpose."
4.0,Fits as expected- almost knee length and I am 6 feet tall. I think it‚Äôs a little thin without a lining and I found it weird that the zipper is on the right side. Love the pockets but they make my hips look a little bit wider
4.0,Love the product..
4.0,"This bonnet is very well constructed and the adjustment feature is great.  But I find that the fabric which covers the elastic and adjustment band makes noises when laying on my side and moving my head, causing me to take it off.  That may not bother other people. It is well made for the price, however, and large enough to contain long hair."
4.0,Get your size and you should be great
4.0,"Everything is great about this dress except the material of the dress, feels like a curtain"
4.0,Really pretty baby blue.<br />Love the length. A little snug for me but not to snug.
4.0,"I like this little bracelet I wish it was a little smaller, it is hard to keep on my wrist but I manage"
4.0,"Somewhat small for a size large...however they ate spandex and they do stretch...however they did shrink when I placed them in the dryer. .but for a 65 year old, spandex (tight fit) is now the material used for clothing.... But I do like the style..."
4.0,"I use these for work as a groomer to keep my skin from getting irritated, and they work great. They stay up really well."
4.0,Slit is a little high and just trying it on my heels got caught in the lace but it fits great and looks wonderful. Im 5'4 140lbs and usually wear a 6 and ordered a 6 so it fits true to size.
4.0,Arrived on time and looks amazing. Packaging was good and even came with its on bag. The only down fall is that within a few hours they all had my fingers blackening. They are great for on the spot jewelry but i wouldnt wear them to long. Other then that i like them
4.0,Daughter likes the Shopkin image and blue color.
4.0,Much brighter red than the picture shows
4.0,"Just received my order. The tweezers and a small brush was included. The basket was missing. The e-z-est was new and sealed. The packaging was done well. I am dissapointed the basket was not in my order as advertised though!! Indeed, it was one of the reasons I ordered this ""kit"".."
4.0,"Needed a chain for a pendant I purchased for my husband.  Quality,weight and length was good.  My husband was pleased with the length.  He is able to slip it on/off over his head.  Would recommend."
4.0,"I like this color because it can be worn year round! It's good quality, but definitely needs to be broken in after a few wears, very fake leather feel."
4.0,Very soft. Feels like you are walking on a carpet.
4.0,"Ordered a large and was too small, need an XL but they don't have XL!?  Every other shirt I have is a large and this large sizes like a medium.  Otherwise quality and graphic are excellent!"
4.0,Very cute but not flexible enough for me
4.0,"I think this bathing suit is adorable but the size on the suit was listed as a size 14, so it was a little confusing, but it did fit my daughter. I just think a mistake was made in labeling because there is no way that the one I received was a 14. Anyway, my daughter loves it and can't wait to use it."
4.0,Perfect cosplay compliment piece  Wearable two ways and adjustable for average or larger body types.  The feathers  are quality and not junky
4.0,Ran out of battery within a month or two of ordering.
4.0,"I liked the concept of being able to slip adjust the strap.  However,  it would be nice to have a couple of slip sleeves to fit over the double sections of strap to keep them together.  I also think it is a bit over priced."
4.0,Works ok took a few cycles to get it open when touching the ground. And the lock pin is not enough to hold the batwing in alone the oring is needed too
4.0,"I just wanted to write a review, I bought this last weekend for my daughter from Toys R Us and it was 19.99<br /><br />She loves anything Elsa/Frozen and she is pretty happy with it.  It only has one tail that &#34;flips&#34; - I've seen some other of these hats that has both handles flip something on the hat.<br /><br />Either way though - she loves it, she has the hereditary big head from my family too, and it seems to fit her well at least.<br /><br />I would recommend going into a store and trying on any of the Flippeez hats for your kid first (if this one is hard to find) - if you're cautious about sizing."
4.0,"This body chain is lightweight and didn't look on me as it does in the photo, but I am not a size zero so I expected it to fit different. The plus is, it fit. I am 5'5 and weigh 200 lbs, somewhere around a 32 in the waist, and although stretched, the chain fit comfortably around my body without feeling strained or too tight. I posted a photo so you can get an idea of what it fits like, if you are thick like me. Overall, I like it. The only thing is, it faded some by the end of the night....but I expected that for the price so no biggie."
4.0,"Unfortunately this rubs a little small. The gift with my father was a hit, but he was only able to wear it briefly. It runs a little snug, and felt a little uncomfortable. It did arrive  early, and looked great."
4.0,"I usually use &#34;S&#34; or &#34;M&#34; but I ordered &#34;L&#34;, and even then I'm a little bit too tight to be taken into consideration, but the shirts are very comfortable"
4.0,Love the fabric. I wear a 3x and it fits perfect and has a good strech to it as well.
4.0,Great item just as described.
4.0,Great costume just have to buy mask the pic confused  I thought mask came with it
4.0,Fit absolutely perfect! Good product and quality for the price!
4.0,"Cocoons are wonderful because they are light weight and comfortable. They fit over my prescription glasses, so that makes them perfect for me."
4.0,"The panty was beautiful and made of nice material. However, it ran large and I needed a smaller size."
4.0,Its pretty! :)
4.0,"Good material and pretty comfy, better than I was anticipating. I ordered a medium and it was true to size chart."
4.0,"I ordered a red bead bracelet with silver accents/charms as shown in first picture display ,but I received one with gold accents and charms that I do not like the gold. The picture shown on Amazon is with silver. I didn‚Äôt scroll down further to see there apparently was gold accents pic below. The description doesn‚Äôt say gold or silver.  Otherwise the bracelet band is beautiful but I wanted silver accents not gold."
4.0,"These glasses are nice. They are definitely mirrored. The colors are cool. It's blue, green, with hints of purple when the light hits it. They don't fall off your face but they don't have a snug fit either. And to me they sorta look crooked on my face although when I asked, no one seemed to notice. I also gently adjusted the arms and the pad arms to get a better fit. They come with a cloth case which is nice and the price is good. Overall I think it's a great buy."
4.0,This onesie fit as expected and is very warm. It also washes well. The quality is also as expected.
4.0,"Bought the Princess hoodie for my day it fits her great, super soft inside and very comfortable"
4.0,"A bit smaller than I anticipated and I will need help to put them in.  I love the colors, although I haven't tried them yet.  I also bout other earrings that I went with first!"
4.0,"I expecteded this to fit better, but it‚Äôs pretty baggy on me. Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt have a smaller sized. It will keep you dry but it doesn‚Äôt breath well. Also the hood is a pain. It‚Äôs so big it flaps down in front of my eyes. I‚Äôm not sure what they based the size on, maybe someone with a hard hat or something.<br /><br />Great price, but will use it if only necessary. I have other go to‚Äôs."
4.0,"Per reviews order a size up..large is way too big!  I did have ordered a medium, which is my size. Now I use this for a cover up over my bathing suit"
4.0,"These are great and exceptional for the cost.  My only gripe is that material wise, they are a bit stiff making them a little uncomfortable for my daughter."
4.0,My daughter wears size 3T and she is very petite & this didn‚Äôt fit her as expected. Also these are more for like a one time use as they do rip easily. & they not thick at all.
4.0,Nice shirt. Came on time. Happy with product
4.0,They're great. Large enough to fit over my large glasses. The lens<br />are much better at blocking glare that my last clip ons.
4.0,"I like it, unlike a lot of comments said below. It fits me well and yes, you do need to wear something underneath it because it's see through material"
4.0,"It came faster than expected, I was looking for light weight & it is.  My friend wants me to order one for her.  Great for casual days."
4.0,"As a bald guy I use this to sleep, gym, or running. Pros: very comfortable. Cons: it was ordered large but came with no tag inside indicating it‚Äôs size.  All other sleeveless hoods I have fit perfect at large but this order was too big on me."
4.0,"Not sure about anything else, but that it was so huge, I returned them."
4.0,These work well.
4.0,Pretty colors. Useful product.
4.0,This dress is pretty cute. I really like that it doesn't lose the color with the stretch.  It's very long though.
4.0,I have tried other replacement bands in the past and honestly was not expecting this band to work.  Other bands have very sensitive latch releases that constantly caused the band to detach from the Gear.  So far this band has only fallen off once and I am pretty sure that was my own fault.  I think the band will actually last.<br /><br />As for build quality it is very nice.  Slightly thinner and narrower than the original Samsung band.  The normal watch clasp works fine.  The only issue is that the excess strap tends to slip out of the rubber band.  Overall I am surprised this band has worked out and it exceeds my expectations.
4.0,"I'm buying my family/friends socks that pertain to their likes or hobbies.  One friend loves to read newspapers every day so I bought these.  Unfortunately the newsprint is all about dogs, which my friend does not like.  Bought another  pair that has Chinese food containers and fortune cookies on them for her."
4.0,Love the size. Love the fullness and the color. The green was on 2 petals. One looked natural. The other looked like a mistake. I cut and shaped it to look more natural.
4.0,"The shirt is really nice, the only thing I wasn't super fond of was the material.  It's a little scratchy at first, but maybe with a wash or two with some softener will do it some good. Other than that a nice solid shirt overall."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù with long legs, 27‚Äù waist, 140lbs and size small fit great! Very comfortable and look nice. I ordered a second pair today!"
4.0,"Arm holes are oddly big as others stated, I sewed mine to fit better, but didn't account for it shrinking in the wash so it's a little short now üò©. But if you account for a little shrinking you're good. Fit as expected otherwise and flattering!"
4.0,"Beautiful blouse that generates compliments every time I wear it. 4 stars because the material does not breathe, but otherwise is great.  I ordered a Small and fit is like an XS. I normally wear an XS so it is perfect for me - but definitely order a size up. I wash it on the delicate cycle and hang to dry, no problems with wear & tear, it is well made."
4.0,Beautiful colors and great quality. The only thing that would make them a 5* would be a change in length and width. My lobes are a bit big and they tend to sit inside. If they where longer they would sit better. For width they are good in the center but could be bigger at the end of the flare. It feels like they would fall out through out the day.  I ordered the 2g.
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for and they are perfect.  Small, dainty and very pretty."
4.0,snagged on 1st day but cldnt bring myself to return. its utterly beautiful and soo incredibly comfortable to wear. i always get compliments (post pushing that snagged material in!)
4.0,"I gave them a 4 because nothing is perfect.  But these are truly overpants.  I ordered one size larger than my waist size and they fit great.  They go on (more or less) easily over my boots.  I've worn them on a couple of hot, steamy Georgia days with shorts underneath and the airflow is good.  I'm more comfortable wearing these over shorts than I am with my typical diamond gusset defender jeans.  I've bought other mesh overpants (Revit and Olympia) and this is the first pair that I actually like.  If my opinion changes, I'll update my review."
4.0,smttp
4.0,"My daughter loves these‚Äîthey are cute, soft, and comfortable. My issue is that they leave a trail of pink fuzz in their wake. Other than that, they are as expected."
4.0,I was the cookie this year and the costume was to close to my neck that it looked very weird . And uncomfortable I had to hike it down the whole time I wore it :( other wise super cute
4.0,Todavia no se los regale a mis nietas. Espero que les guste. Se ve muy lindos
4.0,Good overall performance but cheep antenna broke after limited use.  Broke where it thrWads onto main unit.
4.0,Friend loved her gift
4.0,Very nice quality. Love it
4.0,The material is soft and nice quality. I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs definitely too big so I had to replace with a small. Thick material and not easily see through.
4.0,I liked the pants they were a little long but great quality and very comfortable would difficulty recommend
4.0,"I received this ring in a lovely red and black box - very nice for Valentine's Day! The ring itself is pretty, but less so than the picture. Specifically, the band is not as shiny as it is in the picture. The cz is very pretty though. The picture definitely does it justice. The ability to adjust the band is a selling point. However, if you need to adjust the ring significantly, to say, a size 10 like myself, it warps the shape of the band considerably. I love that the adjustment function is kind of hidden, it makes it a lot more comfortable than rings with similar functions. However, in the case of needing to adjust it significantly from it's standard size, it leaves the exposed band quite tarnished. It is my opinion that the ring would be more appealing if it came in different sizes rather than a one-size-fits-all type of thing. Overall though, I'm quite happy with my purchase.<br /><br />I received this item for free or promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I love it!!!  I avoid buying clothes online because I‚Äôm always disappointed. The lines of the dress are flattering, it‚Äôs comfortable, can dress up or down, color and size were spot on.  The fabric was so so, but again, I‚Äôm picky!"
4.0,"I absolutely love the color selection provided here -  I have lots of options when it comes to matching my son's outfit for the day. They also fit well (he's 15 months and wears size 4 shoes)  and appear thar they should stretch to fit for awhile.<br /><br />The reason for one less star is that one of the pairs already has holes in them, and on top of the foot, so it's not from wear. Unfortunately, as we're a picture-prone family, that means one set cannot be used any longer (after only one wear).<br /><br />Otherwise, quite happy with the purchase, and for the price, would buy again. Be sure to wash inside-out before putting them on your little ones, as the toes have lots of loose lint!"
4.0,"Love my coverup! The only thing that sucks, is you have to make sure you don‚Äôt get caught somewhere or it‚Äôs for sure to snag! Very lightweight and soft. Super cute!"
4.0,If you're a Randy Orton fan. You'll like it. But it is very thin. Make no mistake not for use in rain or winter or windy conditions. This would be for late spring or even summer. Just a very very light cover up jacket.
4.0,"Nicely made, perfect sun-shade without being too wide. Fits well."
4.0,"While it cleans, it does not remove the tarnish completely from my silver ring. Maybe, have to soak it several times."
4.0,"Bought this to replace an old one. Its hard to find a 6ft umbrella. Came well packaged, everything in excellent shape. The color is very close to whats shown in the picture. It does have a reddish color wood pole, but I have some spray paint and if I really am not happy with it I will paint it. The material is quite heavy.<br />For the price it seems to be a great deal."
4.0,"Calidad y acabo es lo que se espera de un producto de marca, si me parece que si los re√∫nele el producto, precio un poco elevado."
4.0,This is a very well made top/dress and I am looking forward to wearing it. The material is comfortable and feels good on my skin.
4.0,Getting them broke in took a few days but they are now feeling good.
4.0,"My husband really likes this cardigan. It's very soft and looks nice on. The color is nice. The one complaint my husband has is that the pockets are rather small and with the silky material, items could fall out easily so he does not put anything in them (other than his hands). I will likely buy another for him in a different color."
4.0,"They seemed like a great product, they were just too small fo my nose piercing, guess my nose is bigger than I thought, lol"
4.0,"This swim suit is super cute, and not to revealing so you can feel comfortable wearing it with out a cover up. The only down fall is it is made for a busty women so if your smaller on top you will need to do some adjustments in the chest"
4.0,Easy cosplay for my Twitch community. The bows and apron seems a little low budget. They bow on the left leg fell off very fast and the apron seems like it was made incorrectly.
4.0,Looks and fits well.
4.0,"Adorable and light weight. Very affordable option for a designer look. But they aren‚Äôt the comfiest. The sole is very poor quality, so I‚Äôll be adding an insole. But hey, you get what you pay for!"
4.0,"This is a really cute suit! I love it! The only reason I'm giving 4 starts instead of 5 is that the top was a bit wide. If you run small in tops/ have small shoulders, be aware when purchasing that you cannot adjust the straps/ width of this suit like you can with string bikinis.<br /><br />It could possibly be my fault for ordering a medium when I might have been able to fit the small, but I just hate wearing a bathing suit that's too tight and the bottoms fit great. I ended up needing to hem the top a bit so it was less wide. Pretty easy to do with some white thread and it's barely noticeable even though I didn't really take my time to make it neat. Most likely it would have fit best if I could have ordered a medium bottom and a small top, but unfortunately most suits aren't sold that way.<br /><br />Honestly this suit was still worth it to me for the price it was! I got it while it was on sale though, so that may also be factoring in a little :~)"
4.0,super cute and great for &#34;business casual&#34; dress code at work with a tunic or flowy top!
4.0,Worked well for our costumes!
4.0,"As can be seen in the product image, this ribbed &#34;Big Cuff&#34; beanie is a toboggan style stretchable knit cap that can be pulled down over your ears for warmth during cool Fall and Winter days.  It is made in the USA by Artex Knitting Mills (www dot artexknit dot com) in Westville, New Jersey.  Artex is a US family owned business founded in 1926 that has managed to survive the outsourcing of US textile manufacturing to Asia.  The cap was sold to me by e4Hats (www dot e4hats dot com), an online seller based in Fullerton, California, and fulfilled by Amazon.  Accordingly, my purchase was shipped directly from an Amazon warehouse in Kentucky.  It was part of a multi-item shipment and was packaged in a clear plastic bag.  The beanie is made from a 75% cotton / 25% acrylic blend branded as &#34;eco2cotton&#34; (eco2cotton dot com).  Unfortunately, it is not machine washable...the tag says that it is hand wash only.  As far as I can tell, the eco2cotton label simply means that fiber and clipping remnants from cutting and sewing during manufacturing are collected and recycled into new material.  In the case of eco2cotton, Martex Fiber (www dot martexfiber dot com), a textile waste trading company based in Spartanburg, South Carolina recycles the remnants though its subdivision manufacturer Jimtex Yarns (www dot jimtexyarns dot com) based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Jimtex remixes the remnant material with other fibers and re-spins it into eco2cotton yarns.<br /><br />The cap I ordered is a medium dark brown with ribbed ridges sewn in.  The material has a smooth, somewhat slick, feel but still retains a slight harshness from the acrylic.  If you are looking for soft cotton, this is not the cap for you.  The beanie fabric is sewn into two layers and has a durable, heavy quality feel to it.  However, I do have a concern that the fabric may be too thin for really cold weather.  It is probably best suited as an emergency pocket cap for cooler days in late Fall or warmer Winter days.  The advertising copy claims the crown is 13 inches long and 8 inches wide.  I laid the cap down flat and measured 8 1/4 inches from the top of the cap to the bottom edge (hem) and a 10 1/4 inch diameter along the flat hemline.  The sizing runs small.  In my opinion, the Artex claims that &#34;one size fits most to XXL&#34; and this is a &#34;big cuff&#34; cap are questionable.  I would say this is a men's medium and, with flexibility, would probably be a snug fit for an XL size and the &#34;big cuff&#34; barely covers my ears.  Now, to be fair, the cap is advertised as a beanie and not a toboggan cap, so I guess a smaller size is to be expected.  Anyway, four stars as long as you realize you are buying a cool Fall weather beanie and not a frigid winter toboggan cap."
4.0,"The glasses fit perfectly, and I like the style.  They do darken but only slightly and not sufficient for driving while the sun is direct in your eyes.  Good for appearance."
4.0,"I love these leggings--they look exactly like the photo! However, like other reviewers have said, you should probably size down. For reference, I am 5'8'', 130lbs, and a 27 in jeans (size 4) and I ordered a medium and it was still snug. It left the design imprinted on my skin for an hour after.  I only took a star off for the wonky sizing but other than that I am super happy with these!"
4.0,Looks fine on wrist. It's a little hard to open each side (too tight)... but it's OK. Metal parts scratch easily. The yarn may unsew
4.0,"Comfortable, a bit too roomy. 7.5 I usually wear this size. Had to buy gel pads for front but that did the trick. So many compliments!!"
4.0,I thought it be more military green but it's more olive green
4.0,"They fit great, they're comfortable, and they don't slip off!! However, I do think this is a high price for these socks."
4.0,It was a gift that she was very happy with!
4.0,Great. Roomy and lots of compartments.
4.0,"I liked this wristlet, but it was a tad too small.:(  I love Baggallini, but had to return."
4.0,"I feel like I should maybe give this bag fewer stars but honestly I LOVED this bag!! Really loved it. But yes, the straps are the downfall. One started to become unsewn but I'm crafty so I just sewed it back on but then the leather or whatever the material is the straps are made of broke entirely just at the top of where it was attached to the bag. Despite this I'm seriously considering ordering another one... I used it for a little less than a year so for $20 it might be worth it!"
4.0,"Ordered up a size and it fits perfect. Definitely runs a size smaller for US sizes. Not soft hoodie material , kinda stretchy but I like it! Would order more"
4.0,"A little tight on my head, but they fit nice without sticking far off my face. I don't have to work about losing then on a boat or rollercoaster with the retaining strap"
4.0,Great quality for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these pants. They fit true to size and are long enough. I am 5 foot three and 120 pounds. I ordered the medium and I probably could‚Äôve gone smaller for a tighter fit but they are comfortable and do not look cheap. I also like that they are 55% cotton rather than 100% polyester like so many other things on the market these days. Have not washed yet but maybe they will shrink a little and be just perfect. The only reason why am giving them four stars is that the material is a little bit thin More like a jersey then a sweat pant which is fine for me.
4.0,"I like the top.  It's actually much more vibrant in color than in the photo -- almost too vibrant.  I think I would have preferred it a little more toned down.  I was hoping it would drape better, as well (seems to have less lycra/stretch than I expected from the photo), but it's still quite nice and comfortable.  Can't remember if I ordered a large or XL, but I went by the other comments that it ran small."
4.0,"It's very soft and surprisingly warm. I wanted it to be a little bit bigger so I got a large, but it fit just right instead. I normally wear a small or medium."
4.0,"The quality is excellent; however, this pin is larger than described!<br /><br />I was looking specifically for a .5 inch diameter pin, but the pin I received is .75 inches in diameter."
4.0,"light weight, material not for work, good for jogging..."
4.0,Bra shows a little if I don't wear a sweater but I LOVE how I look in this dress
4.0,"It‚Äôs a really pretty long tunic but it is long like a dress! I haven‚Äôt worn it yet, but it will look good with leggings and boots I think. It is longer than I expected though."
4.0,"It arrived as promised; well packaged and secure.  I am not somewhat ambivalent at the fit, it is either too lose around the temples or down the nose bridge.  The quality of the glass is good but not great as other brands have."
4.0,Cheap bendable metal but it looks nice.
4.0,I love these shades!  A great fit for my wider than average face. (Item 11 Silver/White uv400)
4.0,"The gloves came as advertised (even a couple days sooner). I ordered size L and they are cut a little small in the index/thumb webbing, but I have had this issue with other 5.11 gloves. The XL are too big for me and these still work fine."
4.0,It came running and I have used it yet. I will probably use it the winter. I have stopped the clock for now until I do.
4.0,"Great belt, and runs true to size.  It looks just like the photo.  I have a 30 inch waist.  It can probably fit someone up to a 33 inch waist comfortably."
4.0,very comfortable. so far lots of support for the girls. thank god for removable padding though or there  would have been no room. the straps dont have much give but that is  okay.
4.0,Very pretty dress. Some little strings hanging off and fit a little large.
4.0,The shoes look very nice and  I love them but They are a little big and wide.  I'm a size 6 but I read the reviews online and got a size 5.5 and they are a little big.
4.0,"This dress is really pretty. It was a little large in the breast area, but it was nothing that a little two way tape couldn't fix. I wore it and received many compliments. It arrived earlier that what was expected. I liked it so much I found the same dress in another color and purchased it as well."
4.0,This oversized sweater can be used in many ways.  You can use it to cover a bright t-shirt for button-down shirt.  You can use it in spring and summer as a separate piece with slacks or jeans.  It offers year-round versatility.  Having pieces of clothing that are appropriate for year-round use is the foundation of a great wardrobe.  This sweater is one of those essential pieces.
4.0,"Good quality, nice weight, overall good sweatshirt. That said...SIZE UP A LOT!! I am a medium but i ordered an XL. Let me be very clear...what i got was by no means a standard US size XL. Its actually more like a roomy medium (no, not a large). Also, as some others have mentioned, the head hole is smaller than with most sweatshirts. Overall I'm pleased though."
4.0,"Looks good for the price. Generally, I have had higher quality watches, and I wish it were more water resistant, but to have something to wear at work in the office this is a very good buy. It dresses up as well as down quite nicely, is pretty but not too flashy, and the face is not too big for my wrist (i.e. goes well with work attire as well as casual attire)."
4.0,"The sizing was strange, and I may have received an incorrect size. If you can get a good fit, these are awesome. They have good grip on trails and are lightweight."
4.0,"Feel good, color as in picture"
4.0,but very nice.
4.0,"Initially great appearance, plus they are fairly flexible so they curve nicely over the shoulder. Small areas of the wire thread started to poke out within the first few uses. Not bad for the price, but annoying."
4.0,Fits ok has the stretch needed for sleep factor. The for and material used is pretty good. The color is nice and washed up after was fine. Time will tell
4.0,"Roughly every three to four years the strap on this watch breaks and it is far cheaper to buy the watch again than a strap (yes, I tried several times). This watch arrived earlier than promised and before the strap on my old watch finished giving way. This watch was twice the price of the last one (exact same model). The strap feels a little stiff so I wonder if it has been sitting on a shelf for years. But it functions perfectly and has all the features I need. My one gripe is the light is too dim to read the watch."
4.0,"Bought this last minute for Halloween.  The hat was huge on my head,  but at least I had something to wear.  It does have some elastic to stretch,  but your head would have to be huge to need that.  I wish it was tighter to begin with to engage the elastic to the proper fit. The apron is thin but fine as a costume."
4.0,"very cute, just what I expected. they do need to be worn in a bit because I feel like they're a bit stiff and the hanging tassle thing at the end sticks out odd but once worn a few times they lay more naturally. love the multiple color choices!"
4.0,"I love these. The lenses are a really pretty pink/gold and you cannot see through them at all. They're also very dark, which I like. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the frames are a little thin. If they were a bit sturdier, these would absolutely be a 5."
4.0,It is nice brooch!
4.0,These are very nice high quality shoes! They took awhile to come in so I took off a star for that but they are a 5* product!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review
4.0,Over time these have becomer looser on my earring post.  At first they were super snug which was a relief not having to worry about losing my earrings.  Over a couple months they became looser and I'm not as confident in them.
4.0,"The ponchos served their purpose in keeping us relatively dry at a baseball game. They are definitely disposable, but that's what we were looking for."
4.0,"Just as described, just too big for my piercing."
4.0,Quality is alright. 2 screws that hold the main plate on the belt came off. I tried to put them back and found they were stripped so they wouldn‚Äôt stay in place.  Going to try a little glue to keep them in place.  They came in these nice little zipper bags too so that was a nice little plus.
4.0,"I love this bracelet/ring chain.  I would have given it five stars, but the set is a little light weight so I fear the chair will break easily."
4.0,sized small but still doable
4.0,"Very nice and classy,must have! Size was exact, only issue personally with me is a have a belly and the dress is Spandex so it fit tight against my stomach,which is my issue not the actual dress. Lol but overall great sexy dress got lots of compliments!! Material was good, color was white white.. I'm 5'7 BBW and ordered XXL"
4.0,"I read reviews saying they ran a little big so I got a small.  The one with the orange bottoms ran big on the top and small on the bottom.  I am used to having to go up a size in bottoms but I hoped it would have more stretch to it.  I don't like the way it makes my butt bubble and the top fits more like a large. I'm usually a small up top and a medium bottom...I wear a 1 or 3 depending on the style.<br /><br />The blue top, white bottom one fits amazing though! I got the small in that one too and I love the way the bottoms fit and the top feels like it fits better too compared to the other one.<br /><br />I'm 5'2"" right at 120lbs so I hope that helps!"
4.0,Good boots at a GREAT PRICE!
4.0,"Maybe i need more hips but i need to have it altered to fit my waist and hips better. Bought an xl due to my 38DD bustline which worked but now i have tailor the rest to be a lil more form fitting. I'm usually a large, will shop my tru size next time in this brand"
4.0,Love these socks (all but the purple ones). Fits is great and feet feel good after a day at work! Thanks
4.0,See through asf and the shoulders are pointy
4.0,"Durable, the metal isnt super cold against your skin, its just awesome! Only thing is I wish the straps stay in play more because it would fall loose"
4.0,...the only concern I have is that it does snag on one of my sweaters with loose weave.
4.0,The body type necklace is fun. I do wish it was silver in color and not gold tone but it is has good quality and is fun to wear.
4.0,My boyfriend loved this
4.0,Cuties. Not as authentic though. Makes one of my ears ooze. Not for people sensitive to jewelry.
4.0,Cute print on top. The neck doesn‚Äôt fit all that great and the material is not regular sweatshirt material.
4.0,"The top was a bit snug for my skinny girl, but the outfit all together was adorable. Deep navy blue, and not black.  Maybe I didn't read the description."
4.0,"Really cute, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It's basically a long springy piece with the leaves on the end but looks really nice. I wish it was a tiny bit bigger but it may stretch as I wear it."
4.0,"Very pretty personalized charm necklace for my mom, she really liked it!"
4.0,This was a great dress for the holidays. Wish the sleeves were a tab bit shorter. But I can live with pushing them up a little. Was a little shorter than I liked but all and all it was a great dress really Comfortable.
4.0,"Great price, decent material, cute style!"
4.0,The contrast material is not white.  Kinda an dark cream color.
4.0,"So soft and stretchy. Just recommend you buy a size larger than you normally buy, it runs a little small."
4.0,I like this style of pant to wear around on a casual day at home.  These are good quality at a good price and they are really fun!  The colors are exactly as pictured.  The fit is perfect.  I like them!
4.0,"These were purchase as shower sandals for my son at college. So for that purpose they are good. He hasn't used them yet, so I am not sure as to how long they will hold up. I will update once he has used them for a while."
4.0,Daughter loves them. Seem to wear out kind of easy but she never stops moving lol.
4.0,"Cute comfy slip on shoes, got the black with the tortoise mid heel, love them!!!!!"
4.0,Great for a costume. Broke easily though!
4.0,"ZOVNE is an odd name, sort of off-putting, but this NATO nylon watch band is one I don't mind putting on. I actually replaced the wooden band that came with an inexpensive BOBO BIRD ""wooden"" watch (I never liked the segmented ""wooden"" band) with this blue strap, and that pairing looks really sharp. The blue metal on this strap adds to the depth of color and is a nice touch.<br /><br />I have to tuck the strap into the hardware to keep it from sticking out, and that is a bit awkward, but I do not trust myself, or this material, to try cutting it to fit and melting the end. The strap feels fine and does not irritate my wrist. But I should note that it does not have the same cloudlike texture of a similar Benchmark Basics strap I have.<br /><br />But for style and value the ZOVNE band is certainly fine and a good option for replacing a tired or ugly watch strap."
4.0,These pants are fantastic but they pill around the midsection.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for- perfect amount of stretch and fits well.
4.0,Fun shape great in the sun...for the price.
4.0,"It‚Äôs exactly as it looks, i had issues with it hurting my ear because the corners are so blunt"
4.0,"My 19 year old daughter loves cow print things. She was very excited to get this cropped shirt. She usually gets her cropped shirts in a size small or even extra small because she likes them to be slightly snug. We ordered this in a medium. It has the snug fit that she likes, but the buttons gape and she worries that they'll pop open or even pop off. She has still been wearing it, but with the buttons open and a cute black bralette underneath. She does think that if she had ordered the large size, it would be a little loose and she wouldn't like the way it hangs."
4.0,"This was exactly as viewed on the site. Always remember when marking selection to review colors and option and they chagrin when you pick the one you want. One style offered three snaps, this one only offered two snaps."
4.0,"I would have really liked this jumpsuit if it hadn't been for the lining. It's like a built-in pair of shorts. Because the fabric is so lightweight, you can clearly see the lining. It looks like a white pair of Spanx. It's not a flattering look. Either there should be no lining or a full-length one. Other than that, the fabric is a gauzy material with no stretch. I chose the X-Large to be safe. It was a snug fit. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Little too expensive
4.0,"This is a beautifully crafted necklace!<br /><br />The amethyst pendant is  quite large, well cut, and smoothly polished. There is veining through it, which I really like. I feel like it really adds to the overall look of the stone and the entire necklace. The rose gold wire is placed around this in a way that looks professional but still hand crafted.<br /><br />Going by the manufacturer‚Äôs photos, I expected the stones that form the tree to be a lighter shade of purple. They are not. They‚Äôre green. I‚Äôm not sure what stone the green stones that make up the tree are, but they look like jade. The colors are variegated and very pretty, though I would have preferred the purple as is in the manufacturer‚Äôs photos.<br /><br />The necklace comes with a nice drawstring velvety pouch as well as a giftable box. It also comes with two very different ways to wear it - a leather necklace, and a rose gold toned chain. Both look very nice, however, the leather necklace has a silver chain and clasp (which doesn‚Äôt go very well with the rose gold on the pendant), and the rose gold chain doesn‚Äôt have any marks that would indicate that it is actual gold plating or anything. It does appear to be plated, but there are no marks to confirm that (which is very unusual).<br /><br />Overall, I do really like this set."
4.0,"Much cheaper than vinyl gloves.  Okay for food prep, although somewhat annoying (generally oversized).  I worked at Subway... These are very similar to their disposable gloves.  Would NOT work in garage."
4.0,I like it covers my nose and chin completely. represents what I want it to. I appreciate the extra filters. you can't be too safe. for people that know you need to cover your nose and chin.
4.0,This band fit my Fossil smartwatch perfectly. The necessary tools are included to size and fit the band properly. Looks great.
4.0,Cute earrings but definitely overpriced. I‚Äôve seen similar ones at Nordstrom rack for less. The latch is hard to do but I adjusted it.
4.0,"My six year son just adores these secret life of pets sneakers, he wore them on his first day of school and could not stop showing them off to all his little classmates. He loves that they light up when he runs. too cute"
4.0,This was a wonderful find!!!! Got it for my daughter's special event.  Looks so good!!!!
4.0,"I wear a size 12 EE, and purchased a size 13 slipper.<br />Happy I read the reviews and learned to buy one size larger.<br />This slipper fits like a glove and the heel is perfect.<br />Just got them and have a happy smile today."
4.0,I have not worn it yet but looks cute.
4.0,"Look so much like the real Pradas! Fit on our 16 month old a little big, but would be perfect for a bigger toodler. Gradient lens, doesnt offer much sun protection but a perfect accessory"
4.0,Sparkly. Sequence sleeves tend to get caught on dress now and then. Overall a good party dress though. Was a nice New Year's Eve dress.
4.0,"Much smaller than I anticipated, but still very cute and can‚Äôt wait for my little to wear for his birthday"
4.0,Fits right and thin but not see through.
4.0,"I‚Äôm not a big fan of hang type earrings, mainly because they tend to get in the way and weigh a lot. When I received these in the mail, I was extremely pleased to see that they were extremely light and is not cheap looking. I have worn them a number of times already and it still looks brand new.<br />They help spice up any outfit, because they look so cute!<br />I can lay down on my couch with them poking at me. Like I said, I was extremely pleased with these earrings and would recommend them to anyone!"
4.0,Cute watch band and face cover. Love that the gold face cover goes on and off so easily. The gold metal parts to the watch band a slightly more copper in appearance than gold. Doesn‚Äôt match the gold face cover.
4.0,"Looks good, will see if it holds up ."
4.0,"I ordered 2 of these for my teenage daughter. I ordered the red and blue. What I didn't notice when I originally ordered was that the pocket has a ""raggedy"" look. The fabric is left raw. It was really bad on the red one and not so bad on the blue one. I just took a pair of scizzors and carefully cut off the excess fabric. The shirts are a little too thin for my daughters taste so she wears a light tank underneath. Othewise, she loves them. She said they are super comfortable and just ""baggy"" enough."
4.0,For smaller people yo otherwise fantastic<br />Lil see though
4.0,Train was too long
4.0,"The bracelet has good quality made into it, I only had it for a week or two and the fairy tail symbol fell off but it was a good product otherwise."
4.0,This product was exactly what I ordered. It has easy to use snaps. With a great material! Would definitely recommend!
4.0,I liked the product. It was beautiful with my daughter‚Äôs dress. We had to get a size 4 because there was not a size 4.5 available. That‚Äôs the only downfall.
4.0,"Warm and comfortable, with a sturdy sole to provide support for your feet when walking in them. It runs a little on the small side. I‚Äôve bought my normal size and the next size up, and kept the larger of the two because my normal size seemed a little short at the heel"
4.0,Super pretty top. Runs a little small. Very stretchy though!
4.0,"Too small, although XXL usually fits. Too bad because they appeared to be well made."
4.0,"I was very pleased, so was who I bought it for. It shipped quickly."
4.0,"I like that they fit my sons extra wide feet. They are easy to get in & out of.<br />Unfortunately, the lining of the first pair wore out, but the shoe is fine.<br />I would like to know where I can buy insoles?"
4.0,"The braclet looks amazing, completely surpassed my expectations. However only flaw to it is that it lossens up by its self, so if you don‚Äôt have a problem with tightening it every so often then buy it."
4.0,If you have allergies to jewelry this will irritate it.  I used the blue ones and when the blue coat started to wear off my metal allergy kicked in.  Otherwise it came as described.  They're small closer to dime sized.
4.0,"Really nice romper. I'm 5'6&#34; and a very thick woman - so I expected it to fit slightly snug - but it's workable - I usually wear a size 16/18 and i got a size XL in this outfit, but wished it came in an XXL...... Still really like it however."
4.0,To big so I sent them back
4.0,"This wallet fits very comfortably in a front pocket. Each card slot holds 2 cards max, but you‚Äôd probably want to stick to one to avoid bulk. The slimmer profile means less room to stuff receipts or large amounts of cash. The exterior clear ID slot is a nice addition. The leather has a sueded feel, so the material can be a bit ‚Äúgrabby‚Äù trying to remove it from a pocket. If I could change one thing, I‚Äôd remove the front attached ‚Äúmoney clip‚Äù. It seems superfluous, and I‚Äôd rather have extra interior room. Overall not bad, just different, and it takes a bit to get used to as opposed to a standard bifold wallet."
4.0,Love this necklace. It changes colors from a pretty golden rust to a blue when seen from different angles. The only reason I gave it 4stars instead of 5 is one of the &#34;stones&#34; is a different color and the necklace never appears the color in the picture from any angle. The earrings are very light weight and comfortable.
4.0,"What I expected but it didn't come with a velvet pouch.. other than that, it is a perfect gift for my wife's friend.."
4.0,I ordered this bodysuit for a Black Widow cosplay I'm putting together. It's made fairly well I ordered a small but I'm thinking I should have ordered a medium instead. It's a bit too tight on me. I have a long torso no curves athletic build. The length on the torso works well with my body; no camel toe issues which is a definite plus! Not see through. But it does smash my boobs and bum<br /> I'm 5'5<br />Weight: 118<br />Waist: 28 in<br />Bust: 35 in<br />Hip: 33 in
4.0,So cute and love it... Highly recommend
4.0,"decent quality for the price, good buy"
4.0,Nice item fits great...
4.0,"The toe box is good but the sides so loose, I may need to return 1 pair for 2E exchange . Please advise"
4.0,Fits me well but does not look as expensive as it is. I would not pay over $18 for this dress.
4.0,"better than average, mid-weight, long sleeve T- shirt in your choice of colors, buy your self a few.... or 10"
4.0,Fun to wear for the holidays.
4.0,"Slightly disappointed as they are just &#34;fair&#34; quality and not as wide as I had hoped. Good vale for the price, however."
4.0,"I love the material, its drapey. I usually wear a large but got an XL so it would be baggy. I'm going to order another color."
4.0,"These aren't shoes, they're shoelaces. I ordered 45&#34; pairs but shoelaces must be measured by a different standard, because these were more like 48&#34; - the extra three inches might be a problem if you're trip-prone like me! Quality seems to be top-notch, and they were shipped promptly, packed overly carefully, and provide good value for money."
4.0,"This is very cute and the material is lightweight. I will say, this does run a size smaller than I expected. Also, if you have a bust, this will not work. I have a small bust and I was pushing it when I was wearing this."
4.0,Light weight and good compartments. Not bulky
4.0,Nice fit. Not as thick as others I have purchased but OK for the price
4.0,these are Great for the price!
4.0,"It‚Äôs comfy , but a little too loose ."
4.0,Very pretty and sturdy pearl earrings.
4.0,"a little small, I thought it would cover a little more.  But i did make it work. Feels comfortable after you get use to it and it does stay on."
4.0,"Perfect for showing my new tattoo off! That was the first purpose of getting it. It does run on the smaller side. I usually wear a large, but opted for an xl in black and xxl in grey pictures above, because I figured sizing ran small. Well I was right and wrong. The GREY (pictured) xxl is smaller than a normal xxl but the xl is good, it‚Äôs not too bulky in the back and comfortable. The black in xl was a great fit FOR WHAT I WANTED. If I wanted it for dressing up I‚Äôd get a large probably and wear it with jeans and vans, but otherwise, I‚Äôm using it for working out and it‚Äôs great!! I wore it to run on the treadmill and it was light, airy and I‚Äôd recommend getting it if you‚Äôre wanting a cute tank to show off your tattoos in the back or just to have a cute tank that‚Äôs airy and different to show off a Bradley. Size up if you‚Äôre unsure. happy4 shop2ping!0"
4.0,I like the style and colors but dislike that the interior is poorly padded for long wear
4.0,It was ok. if you wear large take medium  because it runs big
4.0,I would buy it again if necessary.
4.0,Ordered this for my 6 m old who wears 9m clothes
4.0,"Looks really good! Feels high quality. A soft rubber. My only complaint is that it's really stiff, we'll see how it breaks in or if I need to heat the rubber to shape it better. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5."
4.0,"Stylish, stunning, well-made.  SOOO HEAVY!"
4.0,"Ran small, but looks great"
4.0,I usually wear a large shirt and bought this in large too.  It runs a bit snug.  It is still cute and will look great with tall boots.
4.0,Very stretchy. Doesn‚Äôt shrink.
4.0,Really soft top...washes very well.  Was tighter than I would have expected from the description and picture.  I wear a M and ordered a L.
4.0,"The watch is presented in a cream colored box and comes with two press-style watch band pin removal tools. The tools are plastic with a metal center pin driver. Removing the band segments is fairly easy and reassembling is also without issue although you will need a large opening pliers or sturdy pin to drive the band pin back in.<br /><br />Band adjusts in 9mm increments. Entire sections are removed to obtain the size adjustment. There is no fine adjustment.<br /><br />Setting time and date. The crown has only one position and it is used to set the time. The adjustment occurs in both clockwise and counterclockwise.<br />The second hand does not stop when the crown is retracted for setting and thus the watch cannot bet set to the second. The day of the week is set by depressing the upper side button (regardless of crown position). The date is set using the lower side button (regardless of crown position)<br /><br />The advertisement states water resistant to 30M but in multiple locations in the literature the watch states it should not be immersed at all.<br /><br />NOTICE: The instructions state that the watch is not to be adjusted between the indicated hours of21:00 and 3:00 as the date and week mechanisms are interacting automatically and watch damage may occur.<br />""Between 21:00 and 3:00, the parts for automatically adjusting date and week in olevs start interacting, during this period, I will not trouble the master to adjust the date and week, otherwise it may damage the movement of the watch.""<br /><br />Calibration error: ""The timing error for olev's mechanical heart is with in the range of -20 to +50S. If it exceeds the range, you can contact my native place, the brothers and the sisters in the customer service center will warmly serve you and provide carefree after-sale processing schemes."" What is not stated is the duration of time for said loss. Is this every min, hour, day or year?<br /><br />Lubrication: ""The mechanical heart is driven by mechanical gears and the spring to operate, during revolving, it is inevitable to generate friction, therefore please remember to lubricate it with time passing by so as to reduce the wear rate of parts.""  I have no idea how I will ""lubricate"" the heart. since it cannot be immersed in water as a result of not being sealed I am to immerse it in lubricating oil?<br /><br />Anyhow, now you know. I will see how it does over time and update if anything occurs.<br /><br />Thanks for reading."
4.0,Good clip. Light. Strong. Seems to be wearing well. (by that I mean I've been using it for a month and there's no wear)
4.0,get it a size bigger than you think it will shrink but other than that it's fine
4.0,These are super cute and comfy! Ran a little large. Didn't shrink at all but washes nicely.
4.0,Broke the bridge just having them in my purse...:(
4.0,Great mid-weight. Strong zipper. Like that it is a fuller cut with elastic bottom hem and sleeves.
4.0,Great mask. Easy to breathe thru. Teps in high 80 to 90 are a little warm with it. And it is stretchy but I have a fairly large head and it keeps falling down below my nose. Ear straps keep it from falling of. A little tighter stretch across nose would really help.
4.0,Good value well made
4.0,Love this dress. It‚Äôs a little long but I still<br />Love it! You can dress it up or down with a pair of converse!
4.0,not exactly my style
4.0,"The star pendant looks really nice, and I love the size of it! It is not as small as other stars that sold on Amazon, and it's sparkling~<br />so for the price, it's great! However, the chain that comes with it, looks horrible~"
4.0,Good..!
4.0,"I wear a size 7 in women's and these socks fit a bit large. They are really affordable considering you get 4 for the price of 1, compared to the prices of most exercise studios. I have had these socks for about a year and they have held up in the washer and dryer. For reference, I use about 2 pairs per week during my barre classes and wash after each use. The only problem I have with these socks is when you do planking and waterski at the barre - my feet tend to slip inside the sock. The ring at the top of the band is also not very aesthetically pleasing when you pull your skin tight exercise pants over them, because it creates a huge bulky bulge above the ankles. However, this has nothing to do with it's functionality and I usually change my socks before class anyway."
4.0,"very cheap lenses, not polarized, get what you pay for....not liking the rose color you see either"
4.0,Arms are a little long but nothing that isn't easily fixed.
4.0,Lots of reviews saying to order up. I ordered up and it‚Äôs too big.
4.0,"Love it, fits great and I get lots of compliments"
4.0,Using now and Guess what? IT FITS SUPER. Good materials and fast deliverly
4.0,Theses are slightly small for a medium. I do like them overall
4.0,"They're cheap for a reason, but they still work.  Don't expect any designer kinda sunglasses here. I actually would rather have a pair like these because my head is smaller than the average person so glasses tend to fall off my head constantly.  I'd rather had a 5$ pair of glasses break than a 150$ pair of sunglasses.  Also I like how they come in different colors."
4.0,"Daughter likes the way they look and feel. I'm not crazy about the part where the upper meets the sole because it's kinda cheap feeling, but it should hold up for cool autumn weather."
4.0,"My son loves the look - this thing is well made for sure.  The clasp is like a watch band that opens on each side to make it easy to get on and off.  I don't know what you can really say about it other than it is super well made, good products were used to make this bracelet.  He said he wouldn't wear it daily but it is cool and he knows no one else has one so that makes it special to him too.  He said it could pull your arm hairs if you don't have a good fit on it though.  I received this at a discount for an unbiased and honest review."
4.0,My only complain is I wish I had bought it a size smaller
4.0,"Leopard/cheetah print is in that‚Äôs what persuaded me to get this sweater. It‚Äôs a cool fabric, thin, doesn‚Äôt itch. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the length. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô10 so it comes pass mid thigh and not the hips like I wanted it to be. But that‚Äôs because of me and not the product. It‚Äôs good for the money I paid. Just to have a clothing item to pop off a casual day outfit."
4.0,This dress runs big and long. I'm 5 feet 1 inch and petite. I ordered a small and it didn't fit at all. The colors are very pretty. Had to return it
4.0,These shoes are a little big with no ache support like other Ryka tennis shoes I'm a little disappointed
4.0,"I bought the plain black one to use as a base to make a triceratops mask for a masquerade auction. The mask pushes a little bit on the nose, making it a little uncomfortable to breath out of your nose. And it pushes on the eyes a little bit. But the mask itself was strong and nicely made. I cut off the tie straps that were attached and added elastic. It worked for what I needed it for."
4.0,"Very comfortable maxi summer dress, love it, especially the two side pockets."
4.0,...I found it way cheaper (+/- $30) on another on-line watch site.  I was surprised.  This hardly ever happens with Amazon; usually Amazon's price is the lowest.  We all know Amazon's service is fabulous.
4.0,"Slight trace of glue where the patch is, but that came off with a little water. Very good hat otherwise."
4.0,"Great product in light of competition's prices. I am a female, 5' 4'', 145 lbs and ordered a size adult small. I would suggest someone of my size go down to a youth large in the future, but it's not terrible. I was surprised by the good quality of the jersey. It may not be perfect, but considering this jersey-style is far more expensive at OSI, Winners Sportswear is the better choice. A great buy for USSF refs who are looking for 2018 jerseys but don't mind a few shortcomings (no USSF logo, non-rubberized zipper, etc.). Best price for pro jersey style I've seen in a long time."
4.0,I love a good maxi dress and this one's plus:  pockets!<br /><br />Its perfect for summer. It's very comfy.  I paired it with a lace kimono to dress it up.<br /><br />Only con is that it is a hand wash recommendation. I didn't read the fine print before ordering it.<br /><br />However that's the only con I found so far.
4.0,"As for fit, my hands measured a 9 and that's what I ordered.  The fit is perfect.  They were a bit tight at first but I sprayed them with a plentiful coating of boot stretch until they were soaked through and then wore them for about two hours, flexing my hands periodically the whole time.  Then I took them off and let them dry until the next morning.  Still a bit tight, I kept wearing them for another week on the drive to and from work.  Perfect!  Now they have stretched to fit me like a second skin.  I can even pick up my badge or a few coins without any problem.<br /><br />I'm not sure what people are expecting or want from a driving glove.  But I want them to fit like a second skin, not loosely.  And they don't need to cover any more than my palm.  I'm not looking for warmth, quite the opposite.<br /><br />I think some people may expect a fit like a winter glove.  In that case they will be disappointed.  Also, hands come in all sorts of combinations.  I'm a little bigger than average at 6 ft 0 in and 210 lbs.  But I'm pretty lean so my hands aren't bulky.  If you're overweight or just have thick / fat fingers, the fit may not be right for you.  And some people have long, thin fingers.  Again, these people may have trouble finding a comfortable fit.  But I think the majority of people just need to give the gloves a couple of weeks to break in.  And some boot stretch spray will speed things up considerably without harming the leather.<br /><br />So why the 4 star rating?  My hands sweat a lot. Yeah, one of those people.  So the black dye keeps staining my hands.  I'm sure this will stop eventually but for now it's a pain having to scrub my hands every day when I get to work or get home.  I'm regretting not getting the tan color.<br /><br />On the other hand, I can really enjoy top down driving in my SLK55 AMG knowing that I've got a secure grip on the steering wheel and / or shift lever.  And my sweat isn't grunging up the leather steering wheel.  Overall I'm very happy with these glove and recommend both them and the seller highly."
4.0,"Super cool, but turns everything red."
4.0,"The only reason I took off a star is because it is a bit heavier in weight than I expected for something obviously meant to be worn mid-summer.  We have another shirt I. An identical style from another manufacturer that is quite thin, so this one being a heavier weight material was surprising.<br />Otherwise, it‚Äôs adorable - well-made, washes well, and is flattering for multiple body shapes.  My daughter loved it!<br />For reference, she is 4‚Äô8‚Äù and 108 lbs with most of her weight carried in her waist and torso area.  She typically wears size 14/16 or 14 plus."
4.0,Hubby liked it as Christmas gift. Wishes sound were a little louder but other than that works great and sounds good if he uses it to talk to me on the phone.
4.0,"I like it.. I started freeform locs about a year ago and realized I needed something to sleep in to keep fur and lint out of my hair.. it works for that and also has started to lay them down with some direction but still letting them be wild.. I thought my hair would be too fluffy and it would be too tight but if fits nice for my hair length and has enough hang to get away with as a regular beanie.. it‚Äôs kinda tight when I wear it over my ears but I‚Äôve adjusted it to be snug.. I like how you can tuck the adjustable strap into the beanie so it doesn‚Äôt dangle and the band itself doesn‚Äôt leave a line in my head like durags used to.. the inside is silky too, idk, this is getting long.. I dig it.."
4.0,I got the double thickness as I have shallower breasts. It worked way better than any other silicone adhesive bra I've purchased and made my boobs look full and happy on top while giving very nice cleavage! Only reason for 4 instead of 5  stars is the adhesive did give me the tinsiest of rashes right under my breasts if worn for very long periods of time.
4.0,"Great little skirt.  Does run small. I am usually a small to medium in tennis skirts and I ordered a Large. I am 5‚Äô5 and my bum hangs out of the shorts. But it is comfy and seems to be of decent quality. If it doesn‚Äôt wash well- I‚Äôll change my review. One star off for sizing irregularities but for the price, it‚Äôs almost a 5 star"
4.0,Ordered my size and still SUPER short. Also very see through
4.0,"They are very nice and they arrived quickly but not all the legs of the glasses fit. If you are looking for a fit to the head, it does not work for children of 4 years like mine, it is very loose.  It works so you don't lose your glasses."
4.0,"The design of the earring is attractive, but I found the earring a bit small.  Color of the stones is good."
4.0,My husband's fav watch!! i bought this in 2009. It only recently stopped working. BUT he loved it very much.
4.0,"Might be 5 star, I ordered this as a gift for my wife. We were very pleased with the overall quality and the ""look"". We both agree it was nicer than the price might suggest. The Mother of Pearl face was nicely iridescent, the bracelet was tight and well made. The clasp had a secure grip but was easy to unlatch. Owning several ""name brand"" watches we found this watch to be on par if not better than some, at least on initial review.  We did however return this item, but NOT for quality issues. The watch was not as large (face diameter) as my wife wanted. Otherwise, we would have happily kept it. Since I have no long-term review, only initial response, I can't give it 5 stars. Sure seemed worth the money."
4.0,"This arrived as expected in a very nice box, it feels like high end quality at a very reasonable cost.  It even came with a tool to add or remove links. The watch looks great and is a good fit . The only downside is the clasp opens easily if it rubs against my wrist. I'm already looking at other buying again."
4.0,"Very Nice, large hair clip solid piece with pretty crystals"
4.0,I have been wearing these shoes out and to work with no issues. The small platform provides a good support so they are comfortable to wear for a few hours without any pain or discomfort.
4.0,"Pretty from the front, the back is a little less well made. The earrings dangle and make a bit of noise, not mad about it though."
4.0,"These are short of perfect, imo. The colors are fun. The length is perfectly long enough to hide everything in leggings on my 5'7"" frame. My issues are with the fit (although know that I'm keeping these). The hip could be ever so slightly wider and the straps should be at least an inch shorter. It's like the bottom half of these tanks are size small while the upper part is size large (or XL). I'm hoping they stretch at the bottom and I plan to take up the straps. The fabric is soft and I do think these will make nice looking summer layering pieces."
4.0,"Looks great and works fine, just rotates on my wrist more often than I'd like."
4.0,Love this BUT it has a really baggy tummy area which is fine but a bit strange. It is really comfy and flattering. Will be ordering more. Ordered a large
4.0,make sure you have a very small wrist the size is very small
4.0,These travel straps are very goog.  Like the bold colors as it makes the luggage easier to locate on the carousal.  Easy to adjust and stays secure on the bag.
4.0,"These fit perfectly over my (female) glasses and are very attractive on my face, but they did not fit over my husband‚Äôs glasses.  I love them for me!!"
4.0,"Nice shoe, but fit snug. My son wear a size 1, I ordered a size 3 so he could wear dress socks, however no socks are possible. Fit really snug."
4.0,"It appears to be well made and sturdy. However, when folded, the table top splits into unlike any other folding table I've seen. After taking it out of the box I was surprised but assumed that it would work. I set a metal cup (fortunately) with coffee on it to see how it worked  sitting and using it. Then I decided to move it to another location and picked it up more toward one side and the other side - with the cup of coffee - began to fold down and the cup fell spilling coffee. Because none of the photos showed this type of a top and I'd not seen this before, I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />I contacted the seller about this problem and they did agree to take it back. I'm keeping it but putting a piece of metal on the bottom to hold the two sides together. It defeats the ability to easily store it but will save my dishes. The seller has said that returning it would only be an $8 shipping charge which is quite fair considering that FedEx would charge about $36. Customer service has been good but a better description on the web page would have been helpful."
4.0,Looks nice but a little small for 2XL
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and this was a bit too short for me to wear out. Beyond that I thought it was cute and fit well!
4.0,"Love the fit except for the length, much too long and I'm tall (5'8'')."
4.0,just what I needed for a blue and white maxi skirt - easy to wear
4.0,"Great purchase, like that I can fit it under my clothes"
4.0,"This is a really colorful, eye-catching sequined dress. The pattern is striking and the colors are beautiful. It's a fun dress that actually fit me in the bust. My only complaint is that it is on the short side, like a petite. Definitely, worth the price. I purchased a large hoping it would fit and not be too tight in my bust. I wear a 40C bra. The dress is like a loose swing dress so it also camouflaged my love handles. Definitely a keeper."
4.0,"Light blue with white printing was just as everyone described. The white printing is the surface but not thick or stiff. The blue dye on this one did not bleed, but tested first in a pan of hot water with a bit of dish detergent to be sure. The bandana is soft and suits my needs."
4.0,instead helping my daughter to walk without fall ...NOW she cant even walk 2 or 3 steeps without fall
4.0,this verry good
4.0,Not sure if we were sent the wrong size or if they run small but I have to reorder. :‚Äô( but they look perfect otherwise.
4.0,These slippers were well constructed have good sole and kept my feet comfortable and warm.
4.0,It was okay. Amazon jewelry can be disappointing and this one was. It would get tangled super easy so not really worth your money.
4.0,"Lightweight, fits perfectly.  Fast delivery."
4.0,Like this hoodie and fits perfect.  A little on the thin side but that's OK.
4.0,"Nicely crafted Face Covering/Neck Gaiter. Double layered but with fabric sewn in at the stress points. In a nutshell, the 2nd layer (inner) could be removed (carefully)for the summer and then sewn back on for the winter"
4.0,Much heavier than I thought. Good for he cold days too!
4.0,"Only con about this earring, is getting it put together. It comes in three pieces, and it‚Äôs near impossible to get the bars into the tiny holes without having someone help you. Aside from that, it‚Äôs great!"
4.0,Fits well. Fabric a little flimsy.
4.0,I ordered a medium as that's typically what I wear but could have went with a small as the medium was a little big on me. Other than that it's a great dress! Got a ton of compliments!
4.0,Good shoe but did not have the sheet for the fixings. I buyed before at another place .
4.0,The hat is great. I had to return the first hat because the stitching connecting the mesh to the hat band was unraveling- not the sellers fault. The return was easy and I got my replacement hat the next day.
4.0,"They fit as expected and the quality was expected. 4/5 stars because they don‚Äôt stay up on their own. I had to go out and find fabric/skin tape in order to keep them up all night. But for my costume of the Queen of Hearts, these stockings were perfect."
4.0,"A little big, but fun and differentüòÄ"
4.0,They look way better than expected! A little chunky and a bit heavy but super comfortable to wear. They came with an extra pair of insoles. The leather is soft and scuffed easily when I scraped them on concrete stairs. Also the zipper detaches on the bottom like a jacket zipper which is a bit annoying but makes changing the insoles easier.
4.0,It looks lovely  stays flat and is comfortable. Perfect for a simple classy look with any outfit. Would recommend for both every day wear or any special occasion.
4.0,"When I first opened these, I wasn't sure the fabric was going to work. They look a bit too synthetic. But after a few washes, they have lost some of that sheen and are more comfortable. They have a few pockets and straps that are totally extraneous to me, but overall, they are functional and fit well."
4.0,Light weight and good quality they are very cute! True to picture.
4.0,"Cute, but very small."
4.0,This is a cute gift idea
4.0,A good hat. Collect alot of lint and hair on top where it's noticable.
4.0,"The mask is an excellent respirator with 2 speeds! It is fashionable and the additional lighting is a plus.<br />I got it specifically for travel. It is not as easy to talk through so travel and crowded situations are best suited for this mask. Smaller than portrayed, does not fit over my chin, but provides adequate coverage. I would recommend this mask for the reasons just stated."
4.0,"Cute pants. Very low rise, sits LOW on hips. Thighs very tight."
4.0,I liked the color and pattern and have worn it even though it is very form fitting.
4.0,"This purse is great! It looks exactly like the picture. It will be perfect to take to beauty school everyday because it's a crossbody, so my hands are free to do hair. The only thing that would make it better would be a pocket on the inside so I have a place to put cards."
4.0,Very soft and lays very nice. Love the color and the loose fit. Would buy again.
4.0,"As above.  I am a solid 1X, and this fits more like I would expect a 2X to fit.  I've been contemplating returning it because of this, but I think I might be able to get away with it.<br /><br />The material is very soft and luxurious, however, and particularly for this price range, it is really lovely.<br /><br />The poncho is actually almost completely reversible, with two-sided toggle buttons, and the buttonhole plackets clearly intended for reversing.  It has a tag, though, and seams are visible on the reverse, but the tag could likely be removed, and you would just consider the seams part of the design.  It's quite a bargain for the price, though, and as beautiful as it looks in the photos."
4.0,Loved pockets and color was perfect
4.0,Good purse for travel
4.0,"No complaints, I like hat."
4.0,"I like this blouse and am pleased I ordered it.  That said, it is a little smaller on me than depicted in the picture.  I'm a 12-14 size so on me it's not as slouchy but nice enough to wear over loose slacks on a hot afternoon.  The embroidery is on the hem and is red.  The fabric is  nubby cotton and somewhat see through.  A nice casual blouse for a hot day."
4.0,Cute top. Runs small. Medium was too tight to button across chest and I'm 38C.
4.0,Came when I expected and fitted just fine and comfortable. ..
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6. It was 2 inches off of the ground. Black is longer than purple. Runs small. Recommend sizing up if you want it to close.
4.0,I really enjoyed this and it came exactly as described! The only problem I had was that the zipper broke within a little over a month of me having it.
4.0,"Packaging: Bracelet is packaged in a thin plastic sealed bag.<br /><br />Usability: This has a magnetic clasp and is easy to use.  However, I could see this bracelet coming off easily as well due to that fact.<br /><br />Quality: I like the design and materials used on this.  It uses a dark black leather in the knot and the strands of the bracelet.  Tied in sections with dark brown cords and has several decorative dark gold beads.<br /><br />Effectiveness: Bracelet is comfortable to wear and lays flat against your wrist. I like that this has the magnetic clasp as it is easy to get on and off.  However, be aware that it may also make this bracelet easy to come off.  I personally did not have any issues, but in looking at other reviews some people had this happen.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. I'm not paid by the company or affiliated in any way. Any thoughts on this product are my own."
4.0,My child loved this and it fits just right
4.0,I really like these leggings. I'm 6 feet tall and they are slightly short on me but that was expected. They are slightly see through on the white parts but as long as you wear black or nude underwear you can't tell.
4.0,"This product was such a pleasant surprise for the price.  Four very useful colors.  Softest material and the perfect weight for adding an extra layer.  I ordered the first set for me but then gave them away.  Did it again.  Still have the third purchase but I love to give stuff away and this is such a wonderful, useful and very reasonable priced present.  You can give just one or all four."
4.0,Cute purse for kids. Only thing was the edging started coming off at the end of our 5 day vacation.
4.0,very cute.....
4.0,The white color dress is extremely see through and the material is almost like a bathing suit BUT im returning the white one in exchange for dark blue because it is very comfy and fits surprisingly well. I'm 5'2 and it is long but will be fine with wedges. I also have a large bust and the material is stretchy enough to accomodate.
4.0,Bra is small... will continue to order it unil I find one that fits!
4.0,Great quality. No shrinkage after wash and still look like the day i bought them.  I would recommend going up a size than what you normally wear though.
4.0,The hat is sooo fun. Good sound and look cool. Bluetooth connected easily. A little hard to shut off but i would buy it again in another pattern or color.
4.0,"Ideal to protect you in short distances. Used in a trip and it was helpful, I wore it with a little backpack with all my stuff inside.<br />All dry after the rain. Plastic is very thin, you must be careful while using."
4.0,These are handy to have for a crawler. Add a little extra padding and grip and especially in the warmer months when baby might not have pants on!
4.0,Womens
4.0,the tops were a bit tight. otherwise ok
4.0,The people in my ANG unit loves them!
4.0,Very thin material not like another pair I have order which I don‚Äôt understand why. Love the color.
4.0,"Does slip off my head a couple of times because I do have thin fine hair and what anchors it down is my forehead and having my ponytail low. Washing it and placing it in the dryer didnt thighten so I had to find a balance that works for my situation and gym routine. All in all the material is great, very soft and super absorbent"
4.0,Very pretty!  Some of the hot glue threads are visible and had to be pulled off
4.0,"Cute, fits right though it does wrinkle for sure"
4.0,"Wife likes them...and they look good on her. She's happy, I'm happy."
4.0,"I was impressed upon recieving. Looks great on. I wear a large & fits a lil tight on my shoulder area, but that's because it's lining on the inside. & I have broad shoulders, so if you don't, I'm sure it'll fit just great."
4.0,"The body chain is very cute! Be careful while handling it though... Some of my chains came off when I tried it on, but I was able to reassemble them!"
4.0,"Love the fit, but should of ordered a size up!!"
4.0,"Beautiful , and great quality"
4.0,"Good Quality, but fit is a little tight"
4.0,Only reason not 5 stars is top of suit a little to high or maybe it is long in the waist . Very pretty and like it a lot - price was Great!
4.0,I like the  jeans just need another size
4.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry. Nice width, but would have preferred it to be a little thinner."
4.0,"Nice product, use it everyday but smells like metal after while."
4.0,Love the detail!
4.0,"INTRO:<br /><br />This isn‚Äôt your ordinary belt, it has some fun tricks it can do!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />This is a ratchet belt that can be set to an almost infinite number of adjustment points along the belt strap.<br /><br />If the belt provides too much slack for your liking, you can remove the buckle from the strap using a latch on the backside of the buckle (you‚Äôll likely need a flathead screwdriver to lift the latch).  Then cut the belt strap, use a lighter flame from a distance to help melt and fuse any loose strands, and reattach the buckle to the belt strap by pushing the latch back down onto it.  I have a 30-32‚Äù waist and I found no reason to have to or want to cut the strap down.<br /><br />The belt features an elastic loop that freely moves along the strap to help hold down and secure any slack you may have at the end of it (see attached photos).<br /><br />The buckle will click with each pull of the strap through it (hence, why it‚Äôs known as a ratchet belt), and then it will automatically hold the belt firm and secure when you stop pulling.<br /><br />I love the look of the buckle and the strap - the matted stainless steel is masculine and attractive, as is the rugged tactical belt strap.  All of the materials are premium quality, including the ratchet design (with a caveat I‚Äôll get into later in my CONS section).<br /><br />There‚Äôs a small quick release switch on the side of the buckle (see attached photo), that when pressed, will release the tensioned grip on the belt strap and allow it to loosen and reverse backward through the buckle.  This is how you take the belt off or loosen it if it‚Äôs on too tight.<br /><br />There‚Äôs a curved cutaway on the back of the buckle to help grip the buckle with your thumb while pulling the strap through to tighten the belt (see attached photos).  While this feature isn‚Äôt necessary to make the belt work, it is helpful and worth mentioning.<br /><br />I love that the end of the strap is curved instead of squared off at the end.  It looks nicer that way and it feels nicer in your hand with that design (no pointy corners jabbing your palm as you grip the end of the strap to pull it).  Lastly, the curved end also helps thread it through the buckle more easily than a squared end would (less is needed to be lined up).<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />I prefer to pull all my belts through their buckle from right to left - it‚Äôs just how I‚Äôve always done it.  When wearing this ratchet belt that way, the quick release switch for the ratchet is located on the bottom of the buckle and out of noticeable view to others ‚Äî exactly how I preferred it to be.  However, in this configuration, when lowering myself to a seated position or rising from one, my pants/shorts would hit the quick release switch and instantly loosen my belt.  It would also happen if I was standing and found myself belly laughing at something ‚Äî with each laugh, there was a click backward, and with each click, I was getting closer to losing my pants.  Needless to say, I was very frustrated and disappointed by this, and I‚Äôm thinking that you likely would be too.  Since then, I now wear the belt in the reverse direction, pulling the strap through the buckle from left to right, and that puts the quick release button at the top of the buckle.  So far I have not had any unintended problems, but I do not prefer to have the quick release switch visible to others, nor do I prefer to wear my belts backward from how I usually wear them.  For this reason, I had to take a star off my review.<br /><br />REVIEW SUMMARY:<br /><br />I like this belt and I will continue to use it a lot.  It‚Äôs very well-made and I anticipate it will hold up for many years of frequent daily/weekly use.  This is my first ratchet belt, and now I don‚Äôt want to go back to any other belt without the convenience of that feature, LOL.  I strongly wish the quick release switch on the buckle was oriented differently, or that there was a safety lock on it that prevented unintended presses.  Negatives aside, I still like this belt and its pluses outweigh its minuses.<br /><br />VERDICT:<br /><br />I recommend it!<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:<br />I spend a very lengthy amount of time using the products I review, and I often spend even longer documenting them in writing, photos, and occasionally videos, for your benefit. If you found this review to be insightful, please mark it helpful below ‚Äî it lets me and Amazon know that I‚Äôm doing a good job.  Thank you, and have a great day!"
4.0,Great product. Buy for my husband and he love it. But so far he still not chance to use yet.
4.0,"I like the dress alot,but the to sides of the top do not  match at all."
4.0,These joggers are extremely comfy to lounge in. They also look as pictured and fit as expected. Overall i am pretty impressed with the product. Matieral is good quality but could be softer on the inside.
4.0,"Good, easy to clean and use gauging set. The only problem being that once you hit about 8g, the O rings that hold the plugs in place are a size too small. Like, you have to use the 6g rings on the 8g plugs, repeat down to 00g. Were it not for that, this would be five stars."
4.0,"Very pretty and elegant, but they scratch very easy."
4.0,"Great fabric, runs short. I always order up in size with all slim fit tops because my son is tall and skinny but this is short in length. Looks like it could be for either men or women. Will hold onto it to wear under coats."
4.0,"Firstly, I got so many compliments in this dress! The color is amazing and the fit is great. The only complaint I have is that it's not meant for people who do a lot of presentations. I'm 5'5&#34; and the dress rides up while I'm lecturing my students, so I find myself constantly pulling it down."
4.0,Awesome product just arrived a little late
4.0,"this is a pretty shirt.  It isn't blue though, it's a very pale mint or light green.  It's a nice shade of green.  The pipping accents are turquoise which goes very well with the green.  Both are gentle shades.  Would go very well with turquoise or teal slacks or skirts.  Excellent for someone with  green eyes and dark hair.<br />The seller checked my measurements before shipping to me and it fits, snuggly.  I ordered the size 4-6 or large, my measurements are Maximums; 37"" chest, 27"" waist, 39"" hips.  Chest is snug, sleeves nearly snug, more room in the waist and collar.  Green isn't one of my colors, but it's pleasant.  It's a lovely garment, clean seams, nice finishing.  I have just ordered another in a different color in the next size up XL. This one arrived in the predicted  window of time.  Seller was attentive and contacted me a few times. I do recommend it."
4.0,Like the dress it fits perfectly but it is think like material during the day can see thru.
4.0,"This is great. I do like the flowy nature of the cut of this Dress. I bought this Red and a Black for around the house, and if I have to run and errand they are great. I wear leggings with them. Since I haven't worn this but once, I haven't wash it as yet. If this goes south after washing I will update my review."
4.0,"Great quality fabric and love the colors but printed with stiff paint on a single side. Also, a little oddly sized for smaller heads but ideal for larger heads."
4.0,These are very good bras at an exceptional price.  They run slightly large but not too large that I would return.  I'm in between a 38C and 38D and the 38C fits great and looks cute too.  Highly recommend.
4.0,Exactly as expected. Cute and cheap dress for spring.
4.0,There were more squishy ones then the rest while was sort of depressing. It took me back to a preteen age.. but overall the piercings were great. Correct amount and everything.
4.0,These glasses are okay but I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre ‚Äúoversized‚Äù like I was expecting.
4.0,Love the dress but too small for me. No sizes were offered. Usually a one size fits all fits me well.
4.0,These are good slippers and fit perfectly. I bought these for a Christmas present and had her try them on. We're both old enough that she could set them aside after trying them. And they are her favorite color.
4.0,"This runs large, and is long. I am only 5'2&#34;, so I can't wear dresses that hit below my knee. It is super cute though, and I may try a smaller size. Maybe I can have it shortened a little.<br /><br />UPDATE: I originally gave this 2 stars, but the customer service is EXCELLENT!! They reached out to me and offered an additional refund because I was not fully satisfied."
4.0,"It is a cute hat. It has a a fuzzy fabric in the inside and a soft fabric on the outside. The hat covers everything down to the neck. The neck tie is the same soft fabric with two plastic clips. My son can't take the hat off yet because this has clips rather than velcro. It is a very effective deterrent to a squirmy toddler. The hat is very warm and thick, made of two layers.<br /><br /> The cons to the hat is that the goggle ""lenses"" are not glued properly,  and one ""lens"" has a gap so big that I can put my finger inside. I have to hand wash and air dry this hat just to protect the glue from peeling (and the rubber sewn to the side of the hat). When my son sweats, a fog forms on the ""lens"". Rubbing the hat cloth against the inside of the lense removes that, but if I don't clean the inside of the lenses, they just fill with condensation.  It looks odd. If there was more gap between the lenses and the hat, this wouldn't happen.  If there was no gap between the lenses and the hat,, it wouldn't happen either.. How it is, there is that small gap under the lense that accumulate perspiration and it happens every time. Overall,  I like the hat style and shape, but next time I would not want glued lenses on the hat. It would be better to get actual pilot goggles and place those over the hat. However,  the biggest pet peeve is the lack of quality control.  It could have been a great hat, and it will be, as soon as I find someone strong enough to push a sewing needle through the goggles."
4.0,I love the look of these shorts. I wish I could wear them all day. But I can't because it feels like I can't breathe and I may bust a button when I sit down. I got a Medium. I wear a size 8.
4.0,"Very nice purse, but there is a small cut in the leather on one of the pockets."
4.0,"This fit my rook just fine, only not like the picture shows, upside down. Is comfortable for me. Everyone‚Äôs ears are slightly different though so it‚Äôs just a matter of luck whether they work for your rook or not."
4.0,Feels good and fits good.
4.0,"He loves it but it's kind of a fitted style. If you're between sizes, size up."
4.0,Beautiful skirt but had to return it as it was too large.  I should remember to order one size down in this brand.
4.0,wasn't sure about the flat buckles but my fella likes it
4.0,Interesting. The socks were &#34;painted&#34;. Didn't expect that.
4.0,"I actually wasn't sure about this top when I saw it. But I liked the color and gave it a shot on impulse. Turns out that it is really cute, stylish, made well in the sense that it hangs and curves just right, and I'd say a pretty successful purchase. My only issue is that it requires a strapless bra. Hmph. Yeah... bra straps aren't That tacky right? Lol"
4.0,"Worked out well. Added some real buttons and used a different sash, pin, and boots. Gloves seemed a bit small and the suit was sort of short vertically which is good cause I‚Äôm short but it may not work as well on a very tall person."
4.0,"Loved this jumpsuit. I got it in white, which looked like a pajama, but it is so comfortable that I didn't care. This is breastfeeding friendly. It fits a little small, I think. I ordered a size up from the measurements and it fit well."
4.0,It was kind of big but I like it that way. Wished it was cheaper I would buy other colors.
4.0,"Although very soft and cute looking, I should have sized down for a better fit. The sizing is for men, so it may be difficult for us ladies to get the best fit. I am going to get some insoles and see if they help as not only is the length about a half inch too long... there is too much room under the band that goes across and holds your foot in the slipper. I am a Women's size 10M. I wish they did fit better because I really like them, especially the orange color!"
4.0,"DO NOT USE TO STRETCH!!! Use them as decoration and use METAL tapers to stretch. The sizing is only slightly off, but nothing to worry about too much. Make sure your ears have been stretched by tapers before you put them in"
4.0,"I was in pressed with the bead locks, I have not used them yet.  I thought they were a little hard to get on."
4.0,Love the color scheme. I would‚Äôve preferred a larger bottom but this item it sold as a whole. The skirt cover up is perfect for my booty babes that‚Äôs not trying to show all the goods. Lol
4.0,"Loved it !! I loved the color, has lots of room I just wish they had a couple outside picot hen would be perfect!! May order another in different color.."
4.0,The fit was expected especially after all the reviews and it looks great on.
4.0,"They‚Äôre very pretty, and I like them a lot. However, they do irritate my ears a bit, which is a pity. I still wear them though lol"
4.0,"This shirt is Large but fits like a Medium‚Ä¶?..I‚Äôve experienced this with the Kryptek T-shirts also. Kinda disappointing but ‚ÄúKryptek Forever!‚Äù I don‚Äôt go to the battlefield but I go from Barn to Backcountry so my dog and Kryptek gear are always with me. Go Altitude! I wear a 42L, sleeve 34/35. This shirt is probably medium length (28-30 inches) with 31/32 sleeves. The chest and neck (16-16.5 in.) are correctly sized."
4.0,"nice quality, I am satisfied with the purchase. Can't find anything like these in a store, for that price!"
4.0,"I loved them! Though they don't look exactly like the picture. Also the backs are a little weak and feels like they are going to fall off. But other than that, they look great and have a pretty strong material. It came with two right earrings for me, I don't know if it's supposed to be like that or not. So I gave one to my mom and she loved them too!"
4.0,"This dress is very pretty, but it's not flattering on my body type. I'm 5'8&#34; and 140 pounds."
4.0,"Other than these being off on the sizing they are soft, comfortable & the pockets are perfect for my lrg phone. I also love that they don‚Äôt have that uncomfortable waist band like alot of leggings."
4.0,Photo on shirt was beautiful<br />I had to order in men's size so as expected was a little long.<br />Washed well. No shrinkage<br />No fading<br />Good value
4.0,Had this brand before and great for water aerobics. Fit good and wear well.
4.0,Love the shirt but had to order 2 sizes up
4.0,"This is a nice dress with plenty of stretch. The material is a lightweight, medium-thick, semi shiny material. My only issue with this dress is that it's too short in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing it. If you've got the gams, or are comfortable in short skirts, go for it. The dress looks better on me in person than in the photos, and is a pretty cherry red. For reference, I am 158 lbs @ 5'3"", measuring 36D-33-43, and I bought a Large."
4.0,Love the colors of this shirt! The ombr√© style gives it so much character and love wearing this with my blue boots! The pictures make it look more like a sweater but it has a slight spandex feel.
4.0,Light weight and loose weave - not good for cold weather but ok for spring or summer
4.0,"I wore these all day yesterday, and my feet only got a little hot after walking the dog in our hot weather. The support and cushioning did help with the walking, and the fit, especially around the toes, is a bit more precise with a left sock and a right sock. There's an L embroidered on the left sock and an R embroidered on the right sock, near the toes. I'm not a full-fledged hiker, but I have to walk the dog, and I have a lot of trouble with my feet. These socks are a bit of extra help to get through the day."
4.0,Very nice wallet.  Zipper is a little stiff and it is a tight fit if you have a protector case on your phone (I have a Galaxy S5).  Wrist strap is of good quality - not a thin string.
4.0,Very comfortable and wrinkle-free.  Fabric seems to fade a little after washing.
4.0,The sneakers are really cute. I bought them for the fall/winter so hopefully my LO will fit into them by than.
4.0,"They are perfectly functional beginner turtles. My pin post bent trying to shove it through heavy wool, that's on me. It straightened out fine and continues to function. A tiny bit of weather discoloration but expected with pot-metal. I recommend these to all my newbie Northpersons."
4.0,Love the bag!!! The only complaint is its a lot lighter of blue then the picture but other then that super super small details I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to load all my stuff in it.<br />Fast shipping too. It came a week before it said it was going to. Definitely worth every penny.
4.0,It‚Äôs a great hoodie but is not 100% on the size possibly because the Material used for the hoodie fits a little tight
4.0,I bought it a little large for toe space.  2.5 When my 7 yo son tried it on he said it hurt because inside the seams were a little rough rubbing against his leg when he walked. He said long socks helps and wearing the jeans inside the boots helped. He loved it because the snake skin look.
4.0,"I loved the color and silky feel but it was way to long for me. I&#34;m only 5,2"
4.0,Im scared to put it in the dryer. It will stain your other clothes on first wash so wash alone or with other jeans. go up 2 sizes! I went up 1 but wish I had gone up 2.
4.0,"This cardigan is okay. It fits as expected, I like the way it drapes, but the material is thin, like t shirt material. If you're purchasing it for warmth, you will be disappointed."
4.0,My daughter likes these a lot. They're slightly long (i.e. they would fit an adult better) & one of the charms broke off the first time she wore a necklace. But she's still happy overall
4.0,Nice. Looks just like the picture. I just personally which it were a little smaller since I wanted to wear it to work. It's more of a casual outing look.
4.0,I enjoy this harry potter themed bracelet
4.0,My wife likes it it‚Äôs very good product and looks beautiful on her
4.0,"This dress is so cute omg. As soon as I saw it I knew I needed to have it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 170lbs 38DD. I ordered the large and it fit but it was tight. I wore a cami under it but if I wanted a sexier look I‚Äôd be ok without it but it would be a good amount of cleavage. I should‚Äôve gotten the size up for my boobs but I didn‚Äôt want it to be too long. Also it‚Äôs not a true wrap dress, only one of the ties goes entirely across your body. But the colors are great and it‚Äôs a good material! But I would size up!"
4.0,I do not like fabrics
4.0,The jacket is okay. It looks cheaply made. I unfortunately can‚Äôt let my child try it on yet. It‚Äôs a Christmas gift.
4.0,"The designs are great, and the variety is nice.  I thought all headbands had the sports rubber strip to keep them in place, but only a few of them do."
4.0,"I ordered size M for my daughter who is 1.70m tall. The color is as expected. Material is soft and comfortable. A pretty outfit for summer causal party , beach party . Because it is a long dress, not recommended wear in the very hot weather."
4.0,"I‚Äôm actually pretty surprised at the quality of this bonnet. It has a nice silky feel and the colors are pretty. I put mine in the washer on just the rinse and spin cycle to wash any weird smells and left over dye. Only 4 stars because I know it is not real satin, so I just want to make that clear for anyone wondering."
4.0,"It's really nice, not as warm as I was hoping and I would definitely order two sizes up if you want it a bit baggy. I'm normally a small and went with a medium and it's a bit tight for my liking. I'm also afraid to wash it cause if it shrinks it will be to small."
4.0,Cool hat. Just a little snug for my averaged sized melon.
4.0,I bought these packing cubes for an upcoming trip to Europe. They arrive on time and well protected. I havent uses then still necause my trip is in a month. These packing cubes are well made with good materials and good zippers. The only thing I would like more is if a solid divider was used instead of a see through mesh to seperate the clean and dirty side of the cube. Othwise both sides can be used to pack cloths. I am looking forward to using them.
4.0,"The mask came to me in perfect condition if we remove that the yellow tips some arrived crushed but not broken and that it is somewhat annoying to see through the mask since you can only look straight ahead through the small gaps it has. From then on the painting is perfect, it has details such as some well-elaborated scratches that do not seem to be done to make it look more faithful to the game, etc ..."
4.0,"I may have misjudged my size, but these are cute, comfortable, and stretchy plus they leave no panty-line. You should have seen my boyfriend's face when I showed him what I had bought!"
4.0,Very thing but cute
4.0,"My Wife loves the sweater, shrank a bit in the was but other than that a decent product."
4.0,Bought to match a tassel necklace and it matched perfectly!
4.0,Order up one size! I nornally wear a 0 or 2... which i ordered. Way too tight. The size 4/6 perfect. Very nice.
4.0,"Did not work . They are huge! I returned them<br />and got with a Velcro strap instead , and they worked. Overall we are happy with the quality."
4.0,The general quality is not good
4.0,Picture is distorted
4.0,it is nowhere near as long as it looks in the pictures but it's still cute and still wearable.
4.0,"Wow, this band really sparkles. Easy to put on, very comfortable and seems like a good quality band. Looks amazing with my Michael Kors watch. Would purchase again."
4.0,"Good quality shirt, not the same color as pictured but I still like it a lot"
4.0,Love the print on this dress and the fabric is soft and not see through. Its perfect for summer. I bought the smallest size and expected it to be a little big due to the reviews. I am 5'-1.5&#34; and 108 lbs. and I had it shortened about 2&#34; to above my knee. The arm openings are a little big but I plan on getting a pretty lace strapless bra that will look okay if a bit shows. I am happy with the purchase and so is my husband!
4.0,The bag is a little larger than I expected.  The inside floral bad inside is like a completely separate bag.
4.0,"Still an excellent value, and it is worn often"
4.0,Product is sublimated. Didn‚Äôt realize this. Print is a bit light and fuzzy but overall still usable.
4.0,"The dress fits well but what was received is a completely different print than what is shown in the pictures. Instead of a red polka dots I got smaller printed flowers on a rust color dress. Come on Amazon, get the product right."
4.0,"Cute little dress, perfect for the beach.  It is made of t shirt material, but seems to hold its shape well enough.  it is form fitting, hugging your curves.  I expected it to fit a bit small, so I ordered a size up.  It seems to fit perfect.  It is a mini dress, so it is a bit short.  It does not ride up while wearing, stays in place.  Worth the price."
4.0,"Ok, So I read the reviews and was surprised that it states most people feel this fits true to size. I really disagree with this! Now this style is meant to be loose and draped but I was almost swimming in the small. I am 5'7 and 140 lbs, normally wear a Medium-Large (6-8), but I got a small and it fits quite loose, almost too loose, but I can work with it. Other than the sizing, the print is exactly like the picture which I appreciate since you never know with online items. Furthermore the color is accurate as well, great dress and really inexpensive. The length is quite short! It reaches my upper thighs so if you plan to use this for a professional setting make sure to wear some tights."
4.0,Good quality but fits a bit large.
4.0,The out side of this item is really great and sturdy.  The only objection I have is the area for the concealed weapon.  It is only cloth and my concealment gun get caught when trying to take out.  It needs to have a holster installed.
4.0,"Really beautiful top with nice embroidery.  I will say that it runs just a tad small through the hip area.  The fabric feels like a crepe.  Overall, pleased with the purchase and glad I bought it.  I hand wash it and hang to dry."
4.0,"I actually have 3 pairs of these sunglasses. Two brown and I just bought the tortoise shell color.  I love the look and comfort of wear but this pair (the tortoise shell) is VERY flimsy and cheap feeling compared to the other (Brown) version I own.  I am not confident these will last  the week if I actually wear them.  Perhaps I will keep them in the car as a back up pair?  My point is, although theses glasses look like the same glasses - just different color options- they are made very differently.  Unfortunately I can only speak to the brown and the tortoise shell colors."
4.0,Got two with (  no sweat no beauty no squat no booty)  washed it 2x now pockets are not holding up
4.0,"Good fabric, Good manufacturing"
4.0,"I've worn them a couple times and they've fallen down a few times but I think with some wear and proper adjustment, they'll start staying up more. They're awesome looking and comfortable."
4.0,"Have not had much opportunity to use this item yet but love the style, utility and that I can put it in my full size purse for organization or break away purse."
4.0,Very nice. My daughter loves it but it's more of a sweatshirt material with snaps whether than like a jacket. Other than that it's nice. I got her a large to go over shirts and it fits good. She's 5'3 145
4.0,Great product just what I needed.  Used them at Chucky Cheese to hold the kids cards.  A couple of them broke with in a couple of minutes.  But the rest seemed great.  Kids where happy.
4.0,My mom loved it!<br /><br />Only 4 stars because the color is more bronze-like and not as described.
4.0,"Nice product, zipper works well. Runs a little small. Love the scarf! Looks exactly as shown."
4.0,"Great value.  For the price it is perfect.  The finish is a bit too much plastic on the buckle but who cares?  It stays all day long, clips sturdy, but is a bit hard to undo until you get the hang of it."
4.0,"I am happy with this skirt.  I had ordered a size 8 according to size chart for my waist measurement.  An 8 was too big all over.  Reordered size smaller 4-6 size and fit well.  Also, there is no belt loop in back of skirt which makes it hard to hold a belt in place, hence the 4 stars."
4.0,"This is alot smaller than what I expected, but very cute."
4.0,Its a hat
4.0,"I sent this back because I had too much ""side boob."" Probably not a great choice for those well-endowed."
4.0,"They are really great. The boots do have elastic on the back which helps with fit. I exercise a lot and so I have a fair amount of muscle on my calves and thighs, but they fit better with each wear. I bought them in a black patent leather for a costume, and they will be great for that. They are not really for everyday wear in the style I bought."
4.0,"These eating are awesome, only thing is they are a little heavy but they are great."
4.0,"As described. Minus the gift, for the same price I could of gotten 3 of these, but I was really looking forward to the tree of life gift that I did not get."
4.0,"These were definitely not what I thought, but they ended up being alright for us. They were listed among the period proof undies and I thought this was a phenomenal deal when I saw them.  Well, that good deal was because they're just regular undies.  I wanted to return them since it wasn't what I wanted but my daughter liked the feel of them so we kept them. I knew when I ordered that based on the sizing they were likely to be big on her but when she tried them on, they fit perfect, which was great but it also indicates that the sizing on the description isn't accurate. Overall, if you're looking for some soft undies in neutral colors, these are a good buy!"
4.0,"Cute, but they little too big for my daughter."
4.0,"It‚Äôs tough to beat this bracelet for the price. It feels solid and looks very nice. As others have noted, the clasp is the weakest part of the bracelet and feels somewhat cheaper than the actual links. I deducted one star for the clasp but would buy this again.<br /><br />Also, if you have small wrists, you may need to use wire cutters to remove some chain. Not too difficult but be aware of it."
4.0,"Very pretty, great dress for the price."
4.0,Little harder to put together then others but otherwise super cute and if you get it wet it drys quit fast.
4.0,4 stars because the black bleeds onto skin but wipes off easily.<br /><br />Very pretty! It conforms to your face nicely. I would order several colors in several different styles because it is similar to purchasing glasses. The black one bled on my face but wiped off easily. Not sure how to prevent that but I am sure there is something that can be done. So be cautious when purchasing the colored masks but the lighter ones should not be a problem.
4.0,"I had messed up on my part and gotten a size that was too small, but it still fit well."
4.0,Love this shirt!!!! But runs a little small order a size up..
4.0,"This dress is well made for what it cost. I am 5'6"" and 200 pounds. I ordered 2xl but I could have gone xl. It's a bit roomy in the chest and shoulder area. Perfect length, hits the mid calf.  Fabric is nice weight and no need for a dress slip."
4.0,Lov it.
4.0,nice but didn't need
4.0,"This is NOT a fine jewelry piece. For the current price of $13, this is more or less a costume piece, but a beautifully designed one.<br /><br />The initial on my heart was a bit crooked, but it doesn‚Äôt detract from the simplicity of piece.<br /><br />It makes a great gift for a child (9-12), teen (13-17), or young adult (18-20).<br /><br />The chain, for the dual necklace, is generous in length and easy to wear."
4.0,For starters this may look like a simple white dress online but it's very sexy and looks amazing.  Only thing is the dress is see through so she added a seamless white fitted slip.
4.0,"Fit ok, decent quality for the price. There was a thread showing on the rear but expected due to price. Didn‚Äôt need to wear a bra because of bra-area materials."
4.0,Very good for the money
4.0,This dress is extremely adorable and flattering. The sizing runs a bit small so I would suggest ordering a size up I usually go for a M/L but ordered an XL and it fits perfectly for me. The color is great and the material isn‚Äôt uncomfortable at all.
4.0,"Love the eyeglass case. Bright, vibrant colors. No cloth was included when I opened the case."
4.0,"It's sewn a little strange, you would thing the front would be pleated (and if it was it would fit better) but it's sewn straight across. I will have to make some alterations on my own, but it is still very cute, yet boxy in the waist."
4.0,I love these tanks. I wear a 40 DDD and like a little extra support and coverage. I am also 6'0&#34; so the length is perfect. They don't roll up. I just wish they were on stock more often.
4.0,Unless your thin enough or not wearing a thick winter coat this will fit you. You think for the price the waist band would stretch. Since it is made for cold weather and ppl wear thick coats. Which in the pics it looks like it does. When u get it the waist band looks like it will stretch cuz it looks like a workout waist band material but only gives a slight stretch. I wear a guys L-Xl shirt and have hips 5'7 and the rest of the skirt fits. I can wear it with out a coat which defeats the purpose but with a coat I would have to spend more money to modify it so it can be secured onto my body. If your thick/plus you might have trouble with the waist band like me.  Over all looks like your wearing an over sized apron. The faux fur only goes on the top of the knees and not all the way down to the shins. The material looks hefty slightly thick. The length will still have your feet peep out if your tall. I haven't tested it outside since I can't wrap it around my waist.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Changed my rating after wearing n adding length to the band for months 3 to 4 stars. I've worn in -1 and rainy days and done heat is better than non.  Wind is cold but not on my legs. Granted its not 100 percent heated but its better than riding cold wind hitting your legs. I recommend this. Can't give 5 star since the band  doesn't stretch and does wear a bit after time. But still with the buy.
4.0,Cute for styling with plain shirt or dress. Fits alittle snug so probably won't fit for every figure
4.0,These tank tops are rounded in the front and back. They look more like a women's tank top than a mans.
4.0,I loved the dress and wanted it to work so badly. the zipper seems very cheep. and would not zip up when I had the dress on.. it would go to the waist but my hubby and I both tried to hold it together enough to get the zipper past the waist but it seem to be hung on something. I took it off and zipped it up and put it on over my head but liked to have never got it over my bust. the Dress fit perfect on but I am afraid the zipper is going to separate at the waist.. have ordered a different dress for Easter from Amazon. crossing my fingers it will work.
4.0,Have not used it yet / but Looks elegant
4.0,it‚Äôs really cute but expensive. I thought I was getting a pack and not a surprise box. it is my fault for not reading the listing but still disappointed for the amount of money
4.0,Key chains came out nice. Good quality material. No bad smell. Good size. Will order again when needed.
4.0,"Shoes were great, and cheaper than I expected. As a girl buying men's shoes, they were a little wide, but 5 stars on quality. The missing star is due to the fact that one of the stripes has a crack in it, as if it was dried out. Other than that, highly recommend."
4.0,Comfy thin and breathable!
4.0,"Got size XXXL. Top fits fine, however the bibs are very tight in the legs. I could barely get them past my calves."
4.0,"Soft, warm, comfortable - except for the insole which feels like matted material under my feet after a few months of wearing. Still good but I choose to wear socks with them and that works quite well. Just a shame the interior went to feeling all worn out so quickly."
4.0,Good size and look fine. Discovered that they have to be hand-washed which would have been a no buy if I had known.
4.0,Excellent. Has just what I need and nothing more.
4.0,Nice thin and light material.
4.0,"Awesome bracelet, sturdy and firm. If you however want to be able to put it on yourself get a size higher, other than that I love it and everyone is in total envy"
4.0,"This dress is very cute and has a nice, flattering fit.  I'd like to order in other colors!"
4.0,"These are pretty standard, which is fine because they really serve their purpose without being goofy or looking too dad-ish. The frames have a bit of a flexible bend to them, which is also nice because they're pretty sturdy and have so far held up to my two youngest little guys for quite a while now."
4.0,I love the pattern and the capacity of this bag!
4.0,My girlfriend has screws in her right foot due to a water skiing accident and she needed the wide boot so they wouldn't hurt.
4.0,"Use them as buckles in paracord jeep grips, works great. Holds up to someone pulling themselves into a jeep. And have no issue of corrosion."
4.0,Great fit. Great look and price!!<br />When opening one leg squeaks a little but fine overall.
4.0,"nice. stone sits on top, not inside of metal. guess I didn't look closely enough."
4.0,Fit a little too small but otherwise I loved it.
4.0,Really good quality costume. But the sizing is a little off. They run small.
4.0,"Was unsure buying a generic brand, but has worked for my kid. Purchased the cotton version. It‚Äôs a slightly small as many reviewers have mentioned.. but it‚Äôs not been an issue.. its a decent quality product.  The colors are practical. My concern in the past with most bra has been the padding loosing shape after a few wash, but this one has held up well. Been through wash every other day without any issues. After washing only air dry them, do not put them in the dryer. It needs similar care as any other bra."
4.0,somewhat thin material.  Bottoms are somewhat uncomfortable.  I do like the style and fit of the top.
4.0,This product is well made and good looking. The only reason it isn't 5 stars for me is that I'm used to have a logo or message on my caps and visors.<br />But this visor is great if you want a plain one.<br />Excellent.
4.0,"This is the perfect hot weather top. The fabricf is light nd airy. It is somewhat sheer but ery comfortable. The modest can always wear a cami underneath. The papya color is pretty and vibrant. The frill sleeve is aa cute detail. It is true to size and very comfortable . Easy care, machine wash."
4.0,"There's really not a lot to this bracelet. It's a tad thinner & narrower than I expected, but I still really like it. It's a great piece that I will get a lot of use out of."
4.0,"I am a little nervous that perhaps it is not on completely, although it seems as if it is.  I am afraid if it not on, it could fall off.  how can I tell if it is on correctly.?"
4.0,"This sweatshirt is great ‚Äî warm, comfortable, pockets, and great fit."
4.0,"Great fit, nice shirt"
4.0,Hard to get it open and both are extremely short as in would fit a child
4.0,"I'm 5'4'' and it was pretty long on me, but I love the look of it!"
4.0,This was a fun idea! Would have liked to pick the metal color though
4.0,"These are NOT N95 masks, but rather stylish masks that are very breathable when hiking or biking. I admit I wear another mask indoors near people, as I am older and at risk. However, if I‚Äôm socially distant and/or outside these are much better looking, stay up nicely and provide protection."
4.0,Me encantan solo una peque√±a marchita fuera de lugar
4.0,Very attractive and light weight.  Hard to open until I discovered the guitar pick in the box.  Made it much easier.
4.0,"I have ordered from this company several times before and have always had a good, but sometimes slightly disappointing experience. The fabric is thick, but thin enough to keep you cool and they dry really fast. The stitching is always great and the colors are true to the pictures and hold up through washing. The fabric gets softer as you wash them and they keep their shape. Because the fabric is not super soft, they wrinkle, but nothing a quick wrinkle release cycle won‚Äôt fix. I really love that these can be my back up pair of scrubs when my really expensive ones are dirty. They are comfortable enough to wear all day without any problems and sturdy enough to last a long time. They have a lot of deep pockets, which every nurse knows is essential to our job. The shape of the top is very form flattering. So at this point you may be asking just exactly where my disappointment lies. My only problem with ordering scrubs from this company is that the sizing is very inconsistent. I wear between an 18 and 20 in women‚Äôs and should be able to fit the 2XL without problems. And I do‚Ä¶sometimes. Sometimes a 2XL is a smidge too small. There are times I have ordered a 3XL and it fits perfect, then there have been others where it is so large I feel I am drowning in it. So for that, I have to take off a star. If the sizing were more consistent and accurate, they would get 5 stars from me without a doubt.<br />***Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My reviews are that of my own experience and reflect my own beliefs and opinions of the product based on actual use. My reviews are not swayed in any way because of the discount received."
4.0,"A very beautiful dress. Fabric is stretchy and comfortable. I love the shape of the front, but wish there was more contouring (or tight) in that area or had padding."
4.0,Haven‚Äôt worn in cold weather yet but the fit is true!
4.0,"Wife loves them, came on time,"
4.0,i love it . its warm and looks just like the picture !
4.0,I was looking for a band that matched my new watch. This one fit the bill<br />It looks good. It came with a gadget to adjust the band which was not good. The pins bent each time so I took it to a jeweler who adjusted it in three minutes.
4.0,They ok. Fit snugly on the nose and are pretty convenient to carry around in my pocket. I'd order them again.
4.0,The arms were a little too tight for me and the body was a little too fitted for my slightly insecure mama physique. The vendor was great and sent the product quickly and then refunded me even more quickly so I will still give this 4 stars.
4.0,"Great fabric, color and shape to the top. I got a medium, figuring a compression top would run tight, as I usually wear a small. This is even a little too snug; luckily I plan to wear it under another top so it won‚Äôt be the worst."
4.0,Made big
4.0,"The blazer was awesome, just a size too small for me.  I attempted to order another but the size wasn't available! Too bad because I would have order it."
4.0,Works good for fat man üëçüèΩ
4.0,"I must say, this is the first I'm buying clothes on amazon that fits. This dress really shows my curves. I love how it fits just one problem, cheaply made but I also paid cheap for so i got what I paid for"
4.0,"Its a little smaller than I expected and it doesn't stay wound for more than a day. However, it does keep time well when it is wound and it looks great."
4.0,It came really fast and they look like the original. The only problem is the trademark registered company name written on the crescent that keeps showing
4.0,"These do exactly what they promise. Driving at night is now a lot more pleasurable because I don't have to squint. I even tried them for computer screen glare and they worked a treat.<br /><br />The overall weight is light, so the quality of the plastic isn't as good as you might want, but the hinges are well aligned and they sit straight on the face. I also like the added touch of additional grip on the temples. The lenses are also plastic."
4.0,As dipicted. Great color. Very thin fabric so a cami may be needed. Fits well. Happy with purchase. Have not washed it yet so not sure how it well look after.
4.0,"The boots looked good overall and the quality looks and feels great as well so I have no complaints there the reason I gave these 4 stars is because at least the ones I received didn‚Äôt look exactly like the ad, now I understand these are leather and they have that raw look to them but I definitely think that maybe they should have dyed them to maybe reduce the gray look of the backside of the leather. Just from the photos of the ad they do seem to look a lot better fully black. These also came smashed into a small bag so not sure if that affected how the roses on the toe area looked the way they did. Overall I still liked them and may see if I find a way to make them solid black."
4.0,"good fit, except the breast area... bust is snug while boobs are very loose. odd cut. will keep. still usable. very soft and flowy"
4.0,"I was very pleased with the product and the fit, they did shrink a little but still long enough on the 34 inseam I'm 5-10, I was so pleased I ordered 2 more ,,when they arrived they were Gray, so I'm going to have to return them, when I went online to see why, apparently they were sold out of black ones so it automatically just sent the Gray???? always watched to make sure that you're getting the right colors before pushing the submit button ,overall a great product"
4.0,"Made nice and look good, wish they had them in real gold, always afraid of tarnish"
4.0,"This is a well-made shirt, silky, with mesh panels that help in wicking away sweat during a hard scrimmage on the field. The colors are a little bright for our tastes--we like more earthen tones--but who cares what colors you wear when you're shooting a few baskets?"
4.0,"Dress is nice, definitely a little stiff when you first take it out of the package. I've worn about 2-3 times to work but it makes me a little uncomfortable since it shows off my ASSets a little too much (dress runs a little small).<br />Besides that, nice material, stretchy.<br />FYI: Dress does ride up when you walk if you have a booty."
4.0,"Looks good, but the slim cut is super slim... Be forewarned"
4.0,Attractive belt but I ordered small based off size chart and would have been better off with medium. Consider ordering a size up.
4.0,Very cute! Fits just right!
4.0,"Material is really soft and comfortable.  It's not as shapely as the picture, hangs a bit looser but still very cute."
4.0,It works well for the cochlear. My child has a hard time keeping it on but that's because she has a small head
4.0,Cute. Run a little small
4.0,"As you can probably tell from the other reviews, the hinges on these glasses are definitely a weak point. My son broke his first pair in much the same way as all the other reviewers However, that was mostly after normal wear and tear followed by me not intervening as he intentionally snapped the arm the rest of the way off; maybe he'll listen the next time I tell him to be careful with something.<br /><br />Bottom line is, these are comfortable glasses, they look pretty good, and they are priced right. I guess we'll see how long this second pair lasts. Pro tip for anyone who doesn't wear glasses regularly: when you are removing glasses, make sure to grab them from both sides and lift when removing them. If you just grab one side and pull, the resulting torque combined with the heat from your face will ruin hinges on even the most well made glasses."
4.0,"The white is not white; it is  beige. I like it, but the description is not correct. Otherwise, a good $10.00 bag."
4.0,a little small for my big head.
4.0,Fabric is thin and soft not cheap.  It really will show your body figure..if you really want that or not.
4.0,"Nice bag, love that it has a zipper."
4.0,"I love this wallet. The only problem is trying to dig out coins from the coin/zippered part. It's so narrow that if you have ANY credit cards in the inside slots, it pushes too much into the coin holder part and makes it a VERY tight squeeze.. If they made this with a little more room, it would be perfect."
4.0,"I'm short-ish. I stand at 5'3 1/2 and my weight fluctuates between 140-45 so I got a medium and let me just say... I love this dress. I'm attending an evening wedding in July and it's just perfect. It's so elegant with off the shoulder sleeves, it also does a great job of hugging my curves."
4.0,"The sleeves are a bit short but I could see that in the photo.... and the seam at the waistline is a bit low... otherwise fits nicely, not too short"
4.0,"Nice small crossbody pack, perfect for holding phone and money and other small items. Nice material and design. Only dislike the piece with the logo/brand on it. I‚Äôd prefer to not have it on their since I‚Äôve never heard of the company and I doubt any one else has."
4.0,"Nice basic digital watch which comes with simple clear instructions on how to set up. Like a number of other cheap Casio watches, my only quibble is with the quality of the strap and buckle which appear to be extremely flimsy. With a few cents more investment in materials this would've been a great little watch."
4.0,"All the pieces were included except the wig.<br /><br />The costume is good sublimated material.  The jersey and shirts are lightweight with a pleather shiny under layer.  This makes it a little warm to wear.<br /><br />The bow for the shirt comes as a safety pin accessory, which makes it a little floppy.  I'll need to use extra pins to keep it looking good.<br /><br />The crop shirt is a little too short and constantly rides up.<br /><br />The leg wraps have nothing on them to prevent slipping so I anticipate needing to hike them up often.<br /><br />The short glove has a cut thumb hole that I'll have to be careful not to tear/rip, as it isn't reinforced in any way.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great value costume and needs only a little work.  It fits as expected.  I ordered a medium."
4.0,Will go nicely with the watch I plan to layer it with.
4.0,Came earlier than expected! A dog I was watching broke it but it was easy to fix which is great! You get what your looking at!
4.0,There were perfect for my Meg costume. I think they would work for a Harry Potter costume also. They are not cheaply made.
4.0,Good looking strap and well made.
4.0,Gave this as a gift to my mom and she loves it! Only thing is the filter is very muffling.
4.0,"I think it is a great looking ring, except the ring is to big I will order another one in a smaller size soon."
4.0,Order a size up! I'm a small /medium size 4 and I ordered a medium. The top fits a little snuggling but better than the bottoms. The bottoms are really tight. My chest is smaller than my bottom. Leaving this in hopes to help someone else who is between sizes.
4.0,"It fit well, lightweight, fabric a little low on quality, but it was inexpensive - you get what you pay for."
4.0,"It arrived when it said, fit was just as others described haven't worn it yet. I am 5'4 and I will not need really high heels length is perfect for me. Color is the prefect navy too."
4.0,I tried these on and like the style and fit however I bought them specifically for a swim suit that I ended up returning for being to small so I did not get to wear them out and see how they fit after awhile of use.  I would purchase again if I find a suit I need them for.
4.0,Works great. A little wider than expected but much better than the metal one I used to carry.
4.0,Great Shirt just a little larger than expected. I do like it.
4.0,Very cute but much longer then I expected. It looks like the picture but much longer.
4.0,"Although this shirt is nice looking, it is not 100% cotton as stated."
4.0,I LOVE IT :)
4.0,"It‚Äôs fine with a light rain or sprinkles but in heavy rain, the arms get soaked. It‚Äôs not insulated in the sleeves."
4.0,Warm and versatile. Pocket could be bigger.
4.0,"I got a small and I am 5'8 150 lbs, but with relatively skinny legs and it tapers a little too much around the calf.  Probably should have gotten a medium."
4.0,"They are beautiful, unfortunately too small.  I should have measured my other loops.  Would be great to make for kids, but the metal is VERY hard to  loop, so end beads might work.  None of my beads would thread on either, and I'm using just regular bicone crystal beads, etc.  Too bad, very pretty."
4.0,Looks vary nice on jeans
4.0,The belt works well but the frog positions the sword perfectly vertical wire no foreward cant at the grip area.
4.0,I read reviews before buying it so I went larger. I'm typically a size 6-8 and size small too and I went with the large. Bottoms are basically trash because they are so small but the top is amazing and the price was good even if the bottoms had to get tossed. Probably my favorite too I own right now!!
4.0,Pros: Good size and colors.<br />Cons: Plastic can be improved in its quality<br />Overall great item for the price
4.0,beautiful. solid. good material. does not tarnish.
4.0,So far so good!  Love that I have 2 color options to wear with more outfits!
4.0,Nice pants. Didn‚Äôt fit me comfortably
4.0,The white fuzz inside the sweater gets everywhere
4.0,Used size chart and measured my self and item was a little  loose.  It fits  and I like the quality.
4.0,"Super cute dress, decent quality and got lots of compliments!"
4.0,Worked for the Poulan Pro 220 I was working on. Throw away the cheap spark plug though.
4.0,These are a good product.  I especially love the night time glasses.  They are also great for the rain.
4.0,Got this and was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  For the price I was kind of expecting something much skimpier.  The buckle and even the Tongue are nice and robust.  There are 2 brass posts on the back side of the buckle for peening.
4.0,"Nice quality cap, good look and representation of a quality name. I would buy again, if the price stays down."
4.0,"It has good support, cits true to size and the wiring helps with larger-chested women. It‚Äôs thin so it doesn‚Äôt feel too heavy or stuffy, but it‚Äôs not padded and very thin. Might have to add extra padding if you don‚Äôt want your nipples showing."
4.0,This long sleeve hoodie lightweight combination is good and my only complaint is that it needs to be brought in a lil tighter at the bottom so it does look like your wearing an oversized t-shirt.
4.0,Great idea for traveling.  We haven't used ours yet but they appear to be ideal
4.0,"They fit a little tight to my calf, but I do have larger calves from standing often. Well made, even for a less expensive sock."
4.0,The fabric is thinner and more delicate than expected. I'm not sure how it will hold up after many washings. I put it inside of a mesh bag  when laundering it in my machine and hang to dry. It was easy to remove the last layer of lace to make it the right length for me.
4.0,I made the mistake of listening to the reviews and sized up. It was way too big. small would've fit me fine. My measurements for reference: 34 bust 28 waist and 40 hip. The graphics om the shirt is not as vivid as advertised but overall the shirt is nice quality.
4.0,A good option if you don't want to spend $60+ on a pair of leggings. These fit great and are flattering.
4.0,"I have had a hard time wearing swim goggles as they always squeeze my eyes and make it feel like my contacts are being sucked out of my eyes. These goggles are so comfortable I can swim laps for an hour without any problems. I have been wearing these three to four times a week since receiving them.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that they fog up easily, I have been told I need to spray them with anti-fog which I will try.<br /><br />Super great, comfortable and affordable goggles."
4.0,"I bought this set of bras to wear around the house. They were cheap, they offer the bare minimum amount of support (and by that, I mean they are a gentle step up from being bra-less and sore), and they are cute! I definitely would not buy these for actual<br />sports, but they are cheap enough that when they wear out, I‚Äôll have no qualms tossing and buying a new set."
4.0,I liked it but returned it because it just wasn't roomy enough for me.
4.0,It is super cute and my daughter loves it.  The bottoms seem a little large but not terrible
4.0,It is a lovely sweater and looks very nice. It fits comfortably and would make a great addition to an outfit to make it more winter worthy.<br />The negative? It is very scratchy. It feels like it‚Äôs made from wool but isn‚Äôt
4.0,"Really like this watch. However, it feels somewhat cheap in certain areas."
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful. My only concern is that they do not feel as though they latch tightly enough. They do latch, just wish it was a little tighter."
4.0,It is smaller in fact
4.0,"Nice, bought as a gift."
4.0,this skirt is really cute and awsome but it is not midi!<br />it is long/maxi it is not midi
4.0,Very cute but it was a little tricky to put it on. It‚Äôs very small but I have a small ear.
4.0,"The shorts were super cute & comfy, just too short for someone that has curves!"
4.0,The color was a little off but this set it super comfy!
4.0,"I like the shoe for traveling.  It's a bit &#34;dowdy&#34;, nothing fashionable.  It's shiny, and the size is perfect.  I believe they told me to order a 6 when normally, I wear a 5 1/2.  I did get the 6. Since it had the elastic on the back heel, it didn't slide from the back.  So it was ok.  If I was at the shoe store, I probably would not have chosen it.  It is comfy and perfect for me to walk around on cobble stone roads and uneven streets.  It's not dressy but practical and casual.  Great with jeans."
4.0,"I have a neck injury and as a result have to lie very flat in bed without propping my neck. These work great. I am able to watch TV without moving my neck. My only complaint is they are fairly heavy. But I don't watch more than an hour or so at a time, so I can tolerate them."
4.0,It's lightweight. Price is good.
4.0,It‚Äôs a cute ring set for the price fit is ok
4.0,purchased as a gift and purchased the 2x for my sister who plus sized and is probably a size 16/17 and it was big on her. So I think this is not junior sizes but regular sized. She did say it was warm. She is keeping the large size and will add layers. It is warm but not super thick so on super cold days in the northeast layers will be needed.
4.0,So these are really great looking.  My butt looks so good in them.  This is the first pair of this type of legging.  I love the pocket for my phone.  I thought they were supposed to ride up/separate the cheeks more.  I don‚Äôt know if I ordered them too small or what.  They fit perfectly and I‚Äôm not sure how they would fit if I went bigger.  Guess I will have to play around with different styles and sizes until I find the right ones.
4.0,Bought for my daughter. Fitting was smaller than we expected. The beach sand get in easily and remove hardly so my daughter had to rinsed it many times.
4.0,"THis is the kind of garb you need for short-notice costuming. I've followed Artemesia on ebay with their medieval-style A-line dresses. I bought this for visiting Sherwood Faire in Texas. The fabric is a light cotton, so not too heavy. I'm not big on the velcro waist, but the skirt is still roomy, enough to add a hoop beneath for a more gentry look. Bodice, for the most part, fit well (36DD, and 5'5&#34;), though it was roomy around the waist area so I added a belt to bring the waist in. The shirt was crisp cotton, very white and bright. The bodice didn't have sturdy boning, but you get what you pay for, and I believe this was a quick and easy garment for any weekends you might have for a renaissance faire or Halloween costume."
4.0,"My son gave this as a gift for has girlfriend and she loves it, the only problem is she has small hands and the chain from the wrist to her finger was a bit to long, we took it to a jewler and they were able to shorten it for her. Perfect fit now, and she wears it all the time and everyone comments on it."
4.0,"I bought this hoodie, and I didn't know what to expect. Now it is one of the cuties jackets I own. So glad I bought."
4.0,"This is the third Tonsee had I've purchased - it's a great had at for the price, arrives quite wrinkled but straightens well with some work and wearing. Unfornately, this had is somewhat smaller than the others I've bought. It fits, but it's tight. Still, for the price I can't imagine you could find a better hat anywhere."
4.0,Purchased a month ago good value for the money the frame feels like cheap plastic but the lens feel like good material
4.0,"These are a great price, considering how few you get of Star nails and tacks for the same amount. However, they do not beat the quality of Star products. These are pretty good for assembling a leather heel stack. For the actual heel/heel lift, I would recommend using the 6/8 threaded nails sold by Star. The only irritation I have had with these has to do with the quality. Quite a few of them bent when being tacked into the leather heel stack."
4.0,"Nicely made, but found the size chart was off.  GF is a size 12, so we ordered the large based on what the sizing chart noted.  Found the waist size was about 1"" inch larger than expected.  Short of that, they're very nice and appear to be well made"
4.0,I ordered neon pink...The picture they have listed is a bright vibrant hot pink... I received a dull bubble gum pink...Just ruined my entire event!!<br />Updated from 1 star to 4 because they did refund me. Thanks.
4.0,Cute!  Can be worn as top with leggings. I ordered the red...the actual color is more orange than red...so 4 stars.
4.0,Great corset have to order another too small
4.0,GREAT FOR OVER A SWIMSUIT
4.0,It‚Äôs nice but I have to try it at least for a moth and see if the material resist
4.0,"Good quality, very comfortable, fit as expected. These are very light. For those who live in parts of the country where it gets cold in the winter, You would probably not want to wear them outside when the temperature is under 40- 45¬∞ Although  They would be useful to wear as layering under a heavier sweat or insulated pants in freezing weather.  These pants are very comfortable and light enough to wear inside and feel like you are wearing almost next to nothing."
4.0,Product definitely helped clean my shoes but you could still see areas where it didn't do much regardless of how much I scrubbed(all white Nike). Had to use a good amount of solution each spot even though directions say &#34;a few drops&#34; but you get a decent size bottle for the price so it's not that big of a deal. Happy with the results as I expected this to not do much but push the dirt around.
4.0,Loved it but was to small for my daughter
4.0,It looks large in person but once you put it on it fits perfect
4.0,What I was looking for.  Did some modifying to improve performance.
4.0,"Adorable! I did deduct a star because the flower on the deers ear is a pin and it is cheaply made. The dress is more of a tunic. My four year old wears it with leggings as it comes just past her booty. Soft, high quality material."
4.0,"Was OK,,,,& Liked,,by Person sent to!"
4.0,I just wish that the strap to set the height on your face was adjustable for head size. Doesn't fit me just right. It needs adjustments. I also stuck paper towels in nose to keep the beaks shape. Easy fix
4.0,"UPDATE:<br />Maggie at Shangpule reached out to me immediately upon learning of my issue. The vendor sent me (at no cost to me) replacement parts for the non-functioning pieces and I have been able to make my watch band whole. I consider it a lovely bracelet that allows me to wear my watch as well.  Thank you, Maggie.<br /><br />It is a lovely band but is is nearly impossible to remove the adjustment pins. The worst part is one of the ends would not lock onto my watch so it is entirely useless to me."
4.0,The 3 piece custume looks just like it does online. I like this simple custume and the gloves and hat fits well. If you have large hands the gloves may be too small.
4.0,it is very nice.
4.0,"It's a really cute shirt, the fitting is more of a large rather than an XL as the one I ordered. I would recommend ordering up a size."
4.0,This dress was perfect for a bathing suit cover-up!  On the beach then doing a little shopping afterwards made this an easy outfit!
4.0,"It's beautiful, a little smaller than I hoped but I'll just wear something with it for that. Yes you can see thru the white one but I expected that and I love the dress."
4.0,sleeves are very long and the stitching in the sleeves came out quickly but works for something to throw on at the office when the AC is too cold
4.0,"I purchased this directly from Speidel for the Apple Watch 4, 44mm.<br />I have worn cheap Timex digital watches for years and love their expandable metal watch bands.  The bands from Apple seem to either have 'buckles' or Velcro, which is a pain to get just right.  The expandable band just quickly slips over the hand and onto the wrist, which is why I love it.<br />My wrist measured at 7"" so I got the Medium/Large.  I did not have to remove a link.  This band feels far more substantial than the ones I used to get with Timex and better quality.  The brushed look almost matches the Apple case.<br />I did experience a little skin irritation but that subsided after a day or two, and it feels a bit warm. I find myself sliding the watch up my arm occasionally in order to 'air out' my wrist.  I did that with the 'sport' Apple band too, but it is more breathable.<br />I am glad that I did not have to remove a link.<br />I would buy this again and highly recommend it for those looking for a metal watch band for the Apple watch."
4.0,"Great product, quality and fit. Very cute with many of my daughter's outfits. I would have given 5 stars, but the purple with black bow pictured here was not in the pack &was substituted for another striped pair.."
4.0,"Great, quality, color and delivery but they are to short. If it goes over my thumb then my arm isn‚Äôt covered. Please make it longer. Otherwise great!!!"
4.0,"These tank tops are VERY thin. Almost see through. I like that style but from the pictures- they don‚Äôt look like that so, keep that in mind when purchasing if you want a thicker material."
4.0,NICE QUALITY - GOOD COMMUNICATION - ITS AWESOME - THANK YOU
4.0,Ok for the  money
4.0,"Very comfortable, yet stylish.  I have an average size 6.5 shoe and they fit perfect!"
4.0,"For the money I spent on these cufflinks, they look and work amazing.  I would highly recommend this product as it shines and makes your shirt shine too."
4.0,"Captive ball sure is captive. You'll have to pry the ring apart by a mm or so, but 70% of my captive rings were that way. Otherwise perfect."
4.0,mom loves it. using it to hold her medi alert button. looks nicer then black cord
4.0,"I ordered this hat on Feb.8, 2015 at the bargain price of $7.80 with free shipping.  Glad I didn't wait as it is no longer available via Amazon, but only through third parties. It also seems the black color is no longer available, but brown is but costs over twice as much for same thing.<br /><br />The hat is pretty well made, certainly for the low price I paid.  It is of heavy material, seems well constructed and does include real leather side patches.  I wear a 7 1/8 hat size and it can be adjusted to fit smaller or larger heads.  Mine fits well with the middle snap adjustment used.<br /><br />The reason this item gets four stars and not five is two due to two things: one is that there were loose strands of thread sticking out of some of the seam areas that had to be cut off; the second reason is that the hat was not protected in shipping.  It came in a plastic bag stuffed inside a manilla envelope, and there was some crushing of the top and sides.  I thought of returning it (I have had to return two previous hats due to shipping damage), but instead used a steam iron on low setting and it got the wrinkles mostly out, and gravity took care of the rest when I hung it on a hook.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd pay $18 for it, but at less than $8.00, I'd buy them all day long (if there were other colors)."
4.0,My order of these booties fulfilled my expectations
4.0,"Pros:<br />Style just like the picture shows<br />Color also true to the picture<br />Loose-fit as expected (I'm US XS-S)<br />No odd smell<br /><br />Cons:<br />Material not very soft<br />Crafting not very impressive<br />Iron bottom covered with the red hue after use. I wouldn't dare to wash this sweater with other clothes.<br /><br />Overall, I like this sweater. Will see how it holds after wear."
4.0,"No complaints about quality or usefulness for my bi-fold wallet to replace old insert that had worn out.  The enclosure says, &#34;Suggested Retail $1.50.&#34; Oh well, the convenience of not having to drive around to find a suitable one was probably worth it."
4.0,"def low cut and cheeky...my boyfriend loves them, I think they are pretty comfortable. I have to agree with the slight, uhm, front wedgie thing that people are talking about. But I asked friends (the good ones) and they said it was unnoticeable. I'd buy another pair :)"
4.0,much heavier than your walmart brand
4.0,"Very nice quality, but the front hooks were extremely difficult, even when not being worn"
4.0,Quality as reflected in the price.
4.0,Good quality for the price but runs a bit large.
4.0,I like the softness in the jeans and the jeans always go back into shaped after being washed.
4.0,They look great and good quality. Bit on the smaller size.
4.0,Lightweight and good quality. It's made of foam so it's not uncomfortable. My only complaint is that the string isn't very good it has way too much stretch to it
4.0,Nice shirt but quality is thin.
4.0,"The new fitbit versa is a bit difficult to change out bands on anyways, so I didn't take off stars for the fact that the material makes it hard to put on. We will see how long it lasts but for now it is true to color and size.the only thing I wish is that the sliding piece that holds the excess band was smaller so it would stay."
4.0,"I expected this bracelet to be small and dainty since it is 14k gold. It is as I expected. It is pretty and quite dainty and looks great paired with one or two other bracelets of even alone.<br /><br />The chain is delicate enough that I have to be really careful when wearing this. This is the biggest reason I dropped it a star rating. While it has a secure clasp, it could easily break if getting caught on anything. For this reason, I only wear it when I'm not going to be too active.<br /><br />For the most part, I love this. It fits well and would look really cute on some with a small wrist."
4.0,"My wife loves them and the way they look. They will slide down at times, however."
4.0,Kinda lack luster in the bling department. Was hoping for more of a glitz but the gems kinda dull but they are cute.
4.0,If you need something in a pinch and won't break the bank then these will do. Some parts of the frame's finish were not smooth. Color corrects as stated.
4.0,"True to size and color in Large and black.  My measurements are BWH 40-32-41 and height of 5ft 11in and BMI of 24.  I am a perfect misses size US12 and can often wear size 10.  Medium weight material with good structure and stiffness needed for proper flair.  Better worn with petticoat, but stiff enough to go without.  Cut and sew are well made.  I am pairing with a top of similar style [[ASIN:B01I90VNLW Ninedaily Women Tops Lapel V Neck Elegant Short Sleeve Blouse Wine L]] with matching buttons - meant to be together!  I will order the same in red.  A great find and buy."
4.0,Love the warn out look. They're my everyday boots which I can wear with any and everything. Greatest purchase my boyfriend could have purchased for me.
4.0,Size somewhat small. The zipper busted.
4.0,"I finally found a cheap ring for my septum that doesn't make my skin react. I really like these! My only complaint is that the circle didn't line up perfectly when i went to close it, so it took a little manipulation. But otherwise I'm happy with it"
4.0,I got it sooner than expected and I'm fully satisfied.
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because it is a nice comfortable dress, good quality fabric, just too small for me."
4.0,They are cool looking! Run a bit small.
4.0,"I'm 5'7, small chested but wide shoulders, 170 lbs. I ordered a Large and it fits tight on my arms, which are big, but nothing too uncomfortable. I think the dress fits great. It's made of a thick spandex type material. Plenty of give. Skirt is long enough to be decent. I like the dress. I hand wash only because based on other reviews, the red will bleed into the white. Wore it out one day and got several compliments. I believe it's worth the $25. If you don't like your dresses super tight, you might order a size up. I typically wear a large so that's what I ordered."
4.0,Good fit and very comfortable.  Took a few days to adjust the straps to fit so they wouldn‚Äôt slip. Good product.
4.0,Waistline too high but overall nice for throwing over bathing suit poolside.
4.0,It's very cute. She received  a lot of compliments.  There were a ton a loose strings but it held up perfectly.
4.0,"The shirt is really pretty and the design is very flattering for my thinner figure. The only thing I didn't love is that I wasn't sure what to wear under it! It's too cute for plain jeans and too short for just leggings (for me). Overall, really like it."
4.0,"its a bit tihing , but has a very good impression"
4.0,"The dress is nice. I wear a 1x, but went up to 2x fits good. Dress has pockets!! And adjustable straps. Nice summer dressüòÄ"
4.0,I loved my new warmers. They were very comfortable and warm!
4.0,Mad decent.
4.0,"A little smaller than I pictured, though it is as it was described (guess I should have read more carefully) but it looks good."
4.0,"This was a beautiful dress and I ordered it twice but had to return both times due to the fit. The first which was my actual size was cut for someone with a small chest. The second which was a size up was way to big in the chest area and I didn‚Äôt have time to get it altered for the event I intended to use it for.<br />Aside from the weird upper body measurements, the dress is beautiful. The length is perfect if wearing heels, your toes will still be covered and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 for reference."
4.0,"Only issue was with the metallic looking band, the metalic finish doesn't last long at all and ends up plain white. My husband loves the black one and wears it to work and at the gym."
4.0,I bought this for a belly dancing costume and got so many compliments! I liked that it was sturdy but not heavy. Very well made for the price!
4.0,This ring looks great! Not too flashy but cute and simple. Goes well with another rings if you want to where as a set.
4.0,The scarf was nice and soft.  I thought the color was going to be more burgundy but the color was a little like brick. I still like it and will wear just not with the hat I bought to match it
4.0,"This is a cute piece of costume jewelry - it's gold color, but it's definitely not gold. Still, it's pretty with the faux pearl in a three dimensional heart-shaped cage, and another faux pearl dangling down from it. The necklace isn't too long, and there's a couple of settings so you can adjust it almost choker-like or have it a bit longer. It's on the delicate side (not too big) but the chain isn't so thin that you have to worry about it breaking easily. It comes in a nice box which makes it great for gift giving as well."
4.0,"It's so cool and small, the only issue is the face cover gets lost too fast"
4.0,I purchased this for my Girlfriend...she looks amazing in it
4.0,Bought for my uncle and it was too tight
4.0,I purchased this for a homemade cleanser using the oil cleaning method. Polysorbate 20 isn't powerful enough to break down oils. You should use Polysorbate 80 instead. My mistake!
4.0,"Beautiful, but runs small!!"
4.0,Great socks at a good price. I ordered them for my boyfriend and he liked everything but said they were a little things for his liking.
4.0,Runs small and sleeves are shorter than expected. I‚Äôd go a size up at least!
4.0,Used these for a students skit at school. Perfect size for students‚Äô heads but fell off easily with movement. They were great if you‚Äôre just walking around or if you pin it down! So bright and fun! The kids loved them!
4.0,"I ordered a large black purse and received a large brown purse, it's possible the B meant Brown. Either way, the purse looks nice. The Eco leather looks like faux leather and not real leather. The gold tone chain is well made. The twist closure works well. The size makes it a nice knock away purse. The price is reasonable, so if you are looking for a vegan purse, this would be suitable."
4.0,"Really good price for a standard workout shirt. It‚Äôll do the job. Wicking, cool material."
4.0,The dress overall is very comfortable and fits well. I am slightly disappointed by the fabric. It is not as soft and stretchy as I thought it would be.
4.0,"Loved it, pranced around in it. üíó"
4.0,"Not the best quality, looks nicer in the picture but for the price is ok. =)"
4.0,"This watch is very nice! However, after using it for a month, one of the links broke unexpectedly. I take good care of my watches so I'm guessing I received a defective one.<br /><br />Update: The seller contacted me and sent me a new band for the watch at no cost. For this, I'm giving it 4 starts."
4.0,"This tunic is a nice option for a casual day. It would go with jeans or leggings. I usually wear a small but ordered a medium because I didn't want it to be tight. I would say it fits as expected, is a little big on me but I like that. It is loose and comfortable and the color (I ordered green) is a very pretty jewel tone. It arrived vacuum-packed and very wrinkled, but the wrinkles shook out almost immediately with no work on my part.<br /><br />The puffed sleeves aren't very puffed; they come up just a bit. The side buttons (decorative only) create a ruched effect and break the straight line on the body. The top reminds me a bit of a more elegant long-sleeved t-shirt. The sleeves pull up easily and bunch nicely at the elbow. The material is lightweight, so this will be a good fall and spring top, probably not warm enough for winter.<br /><br />I washed the shirt but did not put it in the dryer. The washing instructions were in pictures (I prefer words), and I wasn't sure what they meant and didn't want to take a chance. I think, though, that it could probably be put in a dryer at a low setting, and I will likely do that in the future. It dried quickly on the drying rack, though, and again, no wrinkles.<br /><br />If you're looking for an attractive, comfortable, casual top in a bright color, and for a reasonable price, this is a great buy. I had been leery of buying clothing on Amazon because I didn't know about sizing or quality, but this was a good choice and is a nice item, with sizing as expected."
4.0,I thought this came with a shirt but that's my fault for not paying attention! The skirt was cute and long but just not as flowy as I thought it would be! Over all decent purchase!
4.0,"Beautiful choker. Not the highest quality, but for the price it is great. My only complaint is that the item shipped from Asia. It would be nice if Amazon were to make this information a bit more readily available, as I could not confirm where the item was being shipped from at the time of purchase. Since it was the only choker that came in the color and style I was looking for, I purchased it anyway. Would just be nice to know when there is a chance my items could get stuck in customs, even if it is remote."
4.0,- 4 stars because earrings do snag some fabrics<br />- easy ordering and fast delivery<br />- product exactly as described and pictured
4.0,The placement of the ties is kind of high but otherwise this robe is perfect. Light and so comfortable
4.0,"These bras worked great for me. I needed a solution for a small strapped dress and it was a life saver. I have a larger chest and all the strapless bras I was trying would leave a gap in the middle or make it look like I was a weird shape. These bras made it very natural looking with a little umph. I have used them since for low cut rompers, tank tops, and backless dresses. They are the best. I would have given it 5 stars, but the black bra wasn‚Äôt as sticky on one side as the tan, and didn‚Äôt work quite as well. I would 100% recommend this product."
4.0,"Ok for the money. Good purse umbrella. Kind of flimsy. Received wrong item first time (an ""outdoor storage box, basically a plastic shoebox). But received prompt replacement. I get a lot of complements on the way these look but I don't see them holding up for long. I do like that they don't break if you fold them inside out but I live in Florida and I believe a strong gust of wind would demolish one of these instantly. I carry a very small purse and these fit in there with no problem at all but fold out to full size. I would only gift these as extra umbrellas. This shouldn't be anyone's main umbrella but makes a good back-up."
4.0,we wanted for a Mary Poppins custom and it serve its purpose.
4.0,They're cute and even came with extra things to clip on to the crock but they run large! I would go down 1 size.
4.0,nice looking but not as polished looking as silver.
4.0,Arrived quickly in a very nice gift box. It looked very nice and had a good quality chain. I gave it to a friend whose horse had recently died so she could put a lock of her horses hair in it. She loved it. Would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great necklace at a great price! So glad I found this one instead of paying $$$
4.0,I really love the base but it smell a LOT like fabric-vinyl-leather imitation. I left mine outside for 5 days and still smell.
4.0,My son loves toy story he loved his pj. he wears 3t  got him 4t it fits but it might not in couple of months. Material is soft
4.0,have only turned it on so far.  plan to use Saturday.
4.0,This is a lovely heart charm in a bright shade of pink that fits perfectly on a Soufeel or other Euro style (E.g. Pandora) bracelet. I love the look of it with the swirling silver lines and it is a beautiful shade of pink. My only complaint is that it is smaller than most of my other Soufeel charms.
4.0,It was just a little larger than expected but it still felt good.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very nice purse but, it turns out to be a bit small."
4.0,"Love them, comfortable and fashionable"
4.0,"Came early. The lip on them is a little more than I'd like. They kinda just look like they're randomly attached to my head, because you can't see my ear around it. All around, they're okay tho. They get the job done."
4.0,Very nice product arrived as promised. Quite happy thank you
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments on this dress. I cut the bottom just below my knees because it was too long. I also recommend wearing something under the dress as it is see-through, hence why I gave it 4 stars. Overall, such a beautiful dress!"
4.0,Bought the rain suite to be able to get out in the rain for some emergency work outside. It worked as expected.
4.0,"Very cute fit. The fabric is a little more stiff than I thought it would be, but that might just be the color/ pattern I picked. I ordered a size Medium and it fit perfect. I'm short so I want to hem it just a little so it doesn't overwhelm my short legs, but that's just preference, it doesn't need it."
4.0,Earring was broken when I received it.
4.0,Very nice but very thin.  Color and quality are good.  Took off one star only because I didn't think it would be so thin and I am worried about snagging.  For the price it is a great bargain though.  It arrived early so that was nice.
4.0,Not the best fabric and definitely not worn for warmth. It is cute none the less
4.0,Go's great with my jordans 1
4.0,They fit my 4 year old perfectly.
4.0,"okay, so it arrived much earlier than expected ^-^ the rings that I received are a tiny bit different from the picture but i'm not disappointed in what i got. I am really happy with them and so is my friend. I had ordered these so my friend could receive her favorites for her birthday. This was totally worth buying."
4.0,I thought these were going to be a little bigger. They are very nice though. I prefer my glasses to be a bit larger. They are really nice though and shipped quickly. They would probably fit someone with a smaller framed face. Best thing is I received these at a discounted price!
4.0,"The top's cups are a little large for my average bust, but overall it fits very well and seems sturdy.  The bottom fits great!  I'm 5'7"", 140 lbs.."
4.0,I bought a medium and I'm 5'1 / 145-150lbs. It fits awesome. I plan to get one in other colors now.  If i would've bought a large the sleeves would've been too long but the mid section would've been a bit better.  Cuz right now with the medium it's a little tight but not too crazy.  This was a great size  for me though because I'm still losing post baby weight. Read the reviews before making your choice! ! I definitely think this product was made for curvy and shorter women and not slim tal women so that's the only downside.
4.0,Cute and nice quality for the price. Very soft.
4.0,"It was a best friends birthday gift good for the price , quality of the chain is the concern."
4.0,By far my favorite mask I have had! It's just darker than I expected so some details are hard to see. Super comfortable though and love the adjustable straps for the mask.
4.0,Very pretty and it came as a set of 2. Silver 1 like these only came with 1.
4.0,"I love these plugs, they're beautiful and make an excellent gift.<br />The only caveat would be that when it states ""quantity 1"" they don't mean 1 pair. They mean 1 plug so I had to order twice."
4.0,Wow! I hate taking risks but I am so glad I did. Its stylish enough to wear with anything and it has held up so far. My only gripe is that the opening at the top is not the best. It does not open very wide and it can be frustrating to put items in or take them out. I ordered this bag to take to class and to use when I go grocery shopping. It is not large enough for my school books so I had to order another one. To be fair my books are huge text books probably slightly larger than normal. The material is not fabric which makes it easy to clean!!!
4.0,The material and pattern were as expected. The size ran small I would order up at least one size.
4.0,The winder's greatest strengths are that it is attractive and does the job.  It's biggest drawback is that it is noisy  when operating.  If you are sensitive about noises when you sleep then you would probably not want it near your bed.  While this is not an issue for me it could be for others.
4.0,"A bit smaller than It looks in the picture, but very nice !"
4.0,Looks great but didn't know about the design in the fabric. I thought it was solid design. It still works for what I need it for.
4.0,Loose flowing fit. I did size up one size because I was concerned about sizing.
4.0,"These are cute and very high which is what I was looking for. I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars because they are really tight on the top and squeeze my thighs which isn‚Äôt very flattering. For reference I am a slender person: 5‚Äù3, 110 lbs. Other than that these are great."
4.0,Just really cute!
4.0,"As everyone else said, the case is a bit bulky, but to hold my glasses and all my contact gear, I was okay with that. However my glasses don't quite fit. I wear thicker, plastic frames so anyone with wire or metal frames would probably be just fine, for my glasses though it won't close all the way. That's not to say it isn't still getting used, makes for a good thing to throw in a beach bag when swimming and wearing contacts for when I get that inevitable headache or itchy eyes at the end of the day,"
4.0,The earrings themselves are really nice. The butterfly backs are just junk. The holes are not punched big enough to even insert the posts. Make sure you know this when you buy this item. Other backs work just fine.
4.0,Cute but will fall apart fairly fast
4.0,"Love my wallet. The only complaint i have is the gap in between the the slots to put cash in, sometimes I put coins in and they would slide out when I didn't close all the way."
4.0,Great leggings! Color is just a little see through though.
4.0,"It looked a little different from the picture, but such nice fabric and great quality."
4.0,Beautiful dress for fall & early spring in North East . Got compliments & fancy enough for a wedding or special night out.
4.0,"A bit more difficult than other belts to switch from black to brown, there is no twist head you have to take the belt head off to switch."
4.0,Ad says order one size up.  Don't. It will be to big.  Great quality
4.0,Would be a 5 except wire kept sticking me (which I fixed) and they are a little heavy. But I really enjoy wearing them. Have had a lot of compliments.
4.0,Pretty good quality for the price it comes exactly how it shows and it's very nice
4.0,Cute and good quality but run big
4.0,Pretty ring just like in the pictures only downfall is that it got rusty I‚Äôve had it for about two months
4.0,"Overall, like this umbrella.  It has a pretty design, is lightweight and seems sturdy enough.  Unfortunately there is no way an adult hand will fit through the wrist strap.  I am a small woman with small hands and it‚Äôs not even close."
4.0,Great product. The loops are comfortable and being able to adjust them is really helpful. 4 stars because the mask isn't super breathable.
4.0,"Very nice.  Perhaps a little long, but i like it."
4.0,"The docks are very comfortable and do not bind around my leg.  I am not sure about lasting, because I have not had them long<br />enough to know."
4.0,"Absolutely LOVE this cardigan! So beautiful and I love the colors. But I do have one complaint: it rips and gets holes WAY too easily and frequently. If you get this, hopefully you too have a grandma or relative who can sew and stitch up holes every month or so."
4.0,Very nice neckline higher than what I needed
4.0,"Best watch I own so far, I've received a lot of positive comments about it and people think it's expensive (not the purpose I bought it for though, but it looks great!). It fits and feels good, has a decent weight to it. The only drawback for me is that I don't wear it that often so every time I wear it I have to adjust the time (and date) because of the winding mechanism. If you plan wearing it daily then this shouldn't be a problem for you."
4.0,"The white set is perfect, beautiful for the price, but the pink one didn‚Äôt match, bottom looks different in color and texture, still a decent quality though."
4.0,I like this ring . I wear all the time But stone came out easily. Already lost 4 stones.
4.0,Wish there is an extra small size for this. Otherwise it‚Äôs nice
4.0,"Great shirt, I own 3 colors now. It's airy and fits well but covers enough. Great for a work environment. The &#34;wine&#34; color I just got is actually tomato red. Not happy about that, so only 4 stars."
4.0,for the price... it's great!<br />it's adjustable as well.
4.0,"Nice simple summer dress. Really light but didn't seem to be see through which is my recipe for summer dresses. Not 100% in love w the design but solid 4 stars.<br /><br />In case it helps...5'4, 120-125, 32a....small fits well."
4.0,"Haven't.  Wore.  Yet.  But. Fit. Well,. Very. Light, for. A work. Style boot!"
4.0,"quantity is acceptable but it somewhat small on me, i am size 7.5"
4.0,"Super great replica, substantial, great detail.  Speedy Delivery.  Adjustable on ring size!  My son loves it for his Halloween Costume this year.  Awesome."
4.0,"Great idea, really ideal shape for a backpack. The elasticity of the pouches could be increased for easier transfer of items as well as increased capacity. Best I saw on the market, however."
4.0,"Great quality for the price. I actually trimmed mine, it was a bit long."
4.0,Very Cute. I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. I does have a post and stopper so you can stick in the ear (that is pierced) so it doesn't fall off and get lost. I'm sure she will be very happy with it.
4.0,"These sandals have great support, but will be much more comfortable when I get the stiffness broken in."
4.0,For the price is gave a 4star. And the fit i would say seem about right. It not bad at all. Especially when you see the other pnes out there and how much they cost. The price almost makes it a 5star and fit.
4.0,This top is really cute!  It fits true to size. I do feel that the pocket is a little low.
4.0,Very nice! My man has had a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,"I purchased this wallet for my husband who is known for putting wear and tear on his wallets. He has absolutely loved this wallet. It has given him plenty of room to fit all his cards, and he has a LOT of cards from working with many different businesses. It's not too big and not too small, he loves how tall it is. It also looks very nice, the black is sharp looking. It is not cheaply made. Having it for over a month and he is impressed there are no scuff marks on it or any wear or tear on the corners. Why I am impressed is because my husband owns two business that involve painting, appoxy coatings, and cement. He always has product on his clothes and hands and past wallets wouldn't be this durable. I received this product at discount/free."
4.0,Size was to a small.
4.0,Nice size.. good value and not cheap looking!
4.0,it's nice. you can also wear it just for regular protection against the sun. the dark color sets it apart than all the other beige color fisher man hat so i think it's quite a good look.
4.0,I love the look! A little hard to get in your ears! Thanks!
4.0,"well made chains, although they are very thin and may not work with heavy costume jewelry pieces."
4.0,Nice full size backpack. I bought so my daughter could color it and make it her own.
4.0,Pretty colors. Will wear it under overalls or jumper.
4.0,"I got these for my five year old daughter because she wanted a pair just like her older sister. These did not disappoint, the are so adorable and she gets many compliments and they run true to size."
4.0,Such a cute outfit. But doesn't fit to size. Should definitely buy a larger size.
4.0,Very nice earrings. Their about a 1/2 to 3/4 inch size which is what I wanted. I don‚Äôt like large loop earrings. I take them out every night before bedtime and so far they are holding up well.
4.0,"As some others noted, the size seemed slightly smaller than a regular 10, but it fit me fine because I don't like excess length in the sole.  It dries quickly on it's on, or a quick rub with a towel eliminates the moisture. Width of the tongue between toes seemed average (although I would prefer it a little thiner.) Good traction on wet surface. I'm happy with it."
4.0,Love the colors; he is not crawling yet but I expect to use them as much as I used them for his sister at 6-12 months of age.
4.0,"It has snaps like a baby onesie! I didn‚Äôt realize this when I purchased it and My daughter didn‚Äôt love that aspect of it. Otherwise, it‚Äôs very nice and fits well. I particularly like the length of the skirt because it is a little longer than others I have seen."
4.0,I bought this to sleep in and hang around the house in and feel at least slightly out together. It‚Äôs soft and comfy. The fit is relaxed. It fits how I expected it to but the shirt is a little cropped in my opinion. Overall I like it and thought about buying another set. My boyfriend also comments on how he likes it.
4.0,Size is just right.  Too red rather than coral but ok for other jewelry
4.0,"Its ok, but I think it makes me look like Uhura and I can't tell if that's a good thing or a bad thing"
4.0,NICE QUALITY BUT TOO SMALL
4.0,"These are nice, but the top band is way to delicate"
4.0,"I was sent the navy one and the color doesn‚Äôt bother me (though blue doesn‚Äôt go with everything, it‚Äôs not too bad). Measurement was accurate (sent a 38‚Äù and measured a 38‚Äù). It says genuine leather, I don‚Äôt know how to tell the difference between real and faux leather. It‚Äôs a softish, flexible belt. I do like the red/white stitching at the top near the buckle. Sturdy buckle. This had a weird smell when I first unpackaged it and that‚Äôs why I took a star away."
4.0,"I am a woman with a small face. The adult mask is plenty big for an adult male, but the material and design still allows me to adjust it to fit! That never happens. Very soft and roomy. Easy to breathe. Only issue is that I didn't receive any filters, but I don't need them with the multiple layers. I suspect the lack of filters is probably just for the masks shipped by prime. I have ordered more that are coming from the manufacturer, so I suspect I will get filters with those. Regardless, excellent product worth buying. I deducted a star because of no filters. Will update this review once other order received."
4.0,"A little to big,but other than that very nice"
4.0,"Came in a timely manner, and came as described"
4.0,I love it good quality the perfect fits.
4.0,"Nice, stylish shoes. Comfortable."
4.0,"This is a really cute piece. I ordered the blue one and the color is just like the picture. The product had some loose strings,  nothing that scissors won't fix. It has no padding and a little see through so I will be using it as a bodysuit. Other than that, i made a good choice by buying this and the quality is great for the price. Also, i didn't buy it as a swimsuit, i bought it for a bodysuit so it's Just Perfect!! :)<br />Recommend it.<br />Btw, I'm 5,7 and 127 lbs. ordered a size up and it fit me great (large size)."
4.0,Very comfortable. Bought another color right after receiving this one.
4.0,The necklace is VERY nice it is well sized and the chain is well sized (though on the long end at 18 inches. My only issue is that the picture makes the diamonds looks perfectly straight however on the necklace they are not BUT you have to critically looking for flaws as I was it will not be noticed by most people. My girlfriend who I bought this for is obsessed with anything France or England so she will LOVE this regardless.
4.0,Very Cute Little Necklace! My 16 Year Old Daughter liked it! It also came in a Cute Gold Box too!
4.0,"They are very pretty,a little smaller than I thought but I probably didn't read the measurements closely."
4.0,I wish I had gotten an XL.  I will still wear them but will need a longer blouse.
4.0,I bought it as a gift for my husband. I will update when I give it to him!
4.0,Update: Not leather but suede. Flimsy but it looks like the photos online. Not sure how long the metal will last but it works
4.0,"I really like these wool socks. They are lightweight and not bulky but still quite warm. I wore them for a hike at 0 degrees F and my feet stayed nice and toasty. They stayed up well and I had no issues with them bunching up. I did end up with a mildly painful indentation in my upper calf where the cuff dug into my leg, which is why I'm giving 4 stars vs 5. If your calves are smaller you probably won't have that issue.<br /><br />Unfortunately my dog chewed a hole in one of these so I'll be ordering another pair."
4.0,Have received many compliments on this.
4.0,"I will start by saying that I've never purchased clothing from Amazon before. but on the advice of my niece, I went ahead and ordered this swimsuit. It's actually very nice. It's classic, it fits pretty good although it seems just a touch short in the torso.  But for what I need it for  which is just being out on the boat and not doing  a lot of swimming or athletic activity, it'll do just fine and the price was great."
4.0,"I bought 7 of these for my bridesmaids.  They got here in time and were very very very nicely packaged.  They also looked so elegant on my bridesmaids.  The only downfall is up close, it looks plastic.  But overall, it is a wonderful gift that my bridesmaids still use."
4.0,Ordered these and other pants for my granddaughter‚Äôs Birthday. The price is great and they are great quality. They fit her perfectly. I would recommend this purchase to anyone.
4.0,I get many compliments but I think it's big around the neck area.
4.0,The top fits a little big. The dress is gorgeous though.  It was definitely worth the price.
4.0,The gray isn't gray at all it's 100% a dark muted brown but I don't mind too much.Other than that it's exactly as pictured and I love their aesthetic.
4.0,"I was hoping for a loose fit, but it is form fitting."
4.0,"I really like this dress and the fabric. Especially for the price. I am a true size 18 at the moment. I'm 5'7&#34; 220lbs. This dress is a little snug in top section and arms. I can wear it, its just a little snug. Everyone carries their weight differently, so it could very well be perfect for someone else. But I do really like the dress."
4.0,Very nice design.
4.0,Works great with our other umbrella top pole.  Also it's seem to be double rigid and strong compared to the umbrella's original bottom piece.  Would give it a '5' if it had two holes to connect to the top portion spring buttons.
4.0,"I like *almost* everything about these gloves. They are comfortable, stretchy, and not bulky for the amount of warmth they provide. But the color is a shiny gold spandex... believe the other reviews. They're NOT ""camel"" in color."
4.0,I have big legs and they still went to my knees
4.0,"This dress arrived well packaged, and pattern, etc are as shown in the photo. I ordered a medium and was concerned it would be too small, but it's actually a tad too large. I'm a solid size 6, 5'7&#34;. The fabric is a little scratchy, but I think a wash will take care of that and I wasn't expecting super high quality fabric for the price. You definitely need a crinoline if you want the 50s poof. Super cute and worth it for the price.<br />UPDATE: I have washed this and the fabric greatly improved. I do however have to say that it's made for someone with a shorter torso than me. The chest darts and the waist both sit little high on me - I'm 5'7&#34; so not overly tall. I have gotten TONS of compliments on it, though, and will definitely continue to wear this."
4.0,Very cute! Nice lavender color üíú
4.0,Great quality jeans.  Fits well
4.0,"These are very pretty and delicate.  I really like the design.  They do slide around a bit and I would not recommend sleeping in them.  They are very nice looking, however.  I wish the back was more flexible so that it could be tightened around the ear in order to prevent slipping and sliding, but still very nice."
4.0,utilitarian
4.0,"This is a nice looking sweater. I only have 2 concerns: 1- The shoulder portions is to small, don't really look like a off shoulder shirts, rather a to big neck shirt. 2- It has way too much of a waffle look. Now I know that its a Waffle Knit shirt but It's highly to much of a waffle look, and not in a good way. If you want that look then it's perfect. If not, it won't be for you."
4.0,"Good quality for price. Fabric was decent, construction was also good quality. The slit on the side was a bit high but my legs are long"
4.0,Small on top and big on bottom
4.0,Fits my Samsung galaxy note 5 wonderfully!!!!! The phone does not slip out when dropped.  A great buy for the money.
4.0,"Okay so I gave it 4 stars because I‚Äôm picky with leggings. However I really do love these leggings. The blue is absolutely gorgeous and probably my first pair of leggings that aren‚Äôt black or burgundy. They are extremely stretchy and breathable, compression isn‚Äôt really a thing in my opinion. I ordered a small and a medium to see which ones fit better and I went for the medium because I felt like the smalls would rip. My only few issues with these leggings is that the ‚Äúhigh waisted‚Äù is more of a mid waist and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4. I bought the top with it and it was okay in my opinion so I‚Äôll return the top. Also there are some threading unraveling in the thigh/crotch area which makes me think they‚Äôll rip. I‚Äôve worn them twice now and love the way they fit and move with me plus the length is great cause I‚Äôm short and usually have bunching around my ankles. Plus they do give a major camel toe btw but I found a hack to prevent it. I‚Äôm really hoping they don‚Äôt rip because they are my new favorite pair of leggings."
4.0,They look really cute but sometimes it pinches your skin/arm hair where the magnet is and it hurts
4.0,Love the colors of the outfit. It does run small but I went off the suggestions of the readers and got the x large and even though it fits the shorts are too small on my legs and makes me feel uncomfortable. Now if i lost about 5 pounds it would be perfect. The colors are just like the picture and it is a little long on me cuse i am only 5'4 and 180 pounds with a 32 inch waist 34dd breast. A xxlarge would been perfect and the dress part drags the floor but nothing a little hem couldnt do. I am debating on whether sending it back and getting a bigger size or maybe losing a few pounds and keeping it. Oh and if you are big chested this may not work for you cuse it will show all your boobs just a fyi lol cuse pinning it just wont do. Wanted to post a picture but figure I will wait til i give it some thought bout keeping it or sending it back for a bigger size.
4.0,It‚Äôs very cute but bothers my ears soooo much ! if I would return it I would but it‚Äôs really cute on
4.0,"A bit bigger than expected, but beautiful."
4.0,Lightweight knit gloves. Work well down to 35F. Also use as a liner and backup on cold days - Remove mitts and use these to change a tire.
4.0,Loved this dress. The only problem is a hole appeared in the arm pit after wearing it twice..
4.0,Nice looking ring for special occasions. Wouldn't be worn everyday.
4.0,"I ordered my boyfriend a size L, he is 5'11 and 165lbs, they fit him great!  He loves the buttflap and wears there to work under his clothes to stay warm."
4.0,"Twice on the same crossbody strap, two different claps broke in the same way. Cheap do not buy."
4.0,Great color and fabric. Prb going to buy another one.  Just fits a lil big but overall great.
4.0,Very nice product. Gage was to large
4.0,I purchased this product as a gift.  The shipping was fast and the product appears to be of great quaility.<br />This is a genius idea and looks like it will keep everything organized.<br />I need to order a set for myself!
4.0,"I was a bit skeptical of this bracelet. I think it should come in a cut little padded box, and not a bag. But over all it's beautiful for the price you pay, and looks nice. I would recommend it"
4.0,I effing love these flannels for riding motorcycles! They meet the long sleeve regulation and give me room to store crap I need. Super cheap price too!
4.0,"Band has good absorbency and stands great to washing. But it is for the smaller heads. it fits, but tight"
4.0,comfortable but a little loose
4.0,Nice necklace. It does have a cheap look and feel. But good for the price.
4.0,It‚Äôs one of those press on stickers but other wise it‚Äôs true to size a tad bit oversized. Decent quality for the price
4.0,"Cute top,but seems to run small-gave it away as agift"
4.0,I got everything it said it came with and in these pictures I‚Äôm wearing the biggest one with the spikes and the second is the second to biggest I think 12mm if I‚Äôm not mistaken they are 14g. Im always scared getting jewelry offline because I‚Äôm allergic to fake jewelry and people like to lie but these are so far really surgical steel and really good quality!  Next I want to order the silver because I love them!
4.0,Likes. Color and cz<br />Dislikes. Nothing<br />To start a travel braclet
4.0,"The quality of the fabric is perfect (front is silk, back is cotton+spandex). But it runs small, - I wanted an oversized fit and went a size up, but it fits like my regular size still. I also would like the shirt to be a couple inches longer. It's not very short, I easily wear it with pants, but it would like much better if it was just a bit longer."
4.0,"Because it is collapsible, it's easy to tuck in the car for when I need it."
4.0,"I was looking for a ""retie the knot"" dress for a beach location.  I loved the top of this dress -loose enough to move around/raise my arms and dance, but not too loose and a slight sweetheart neckline and still able to just wear a regular strapless bra.  I did not love the sash that ties in back, and I really hate a big bow on my butt as a grown adult. The sash thing is pretty in the front though. The bottom hit my legs at a ""tea length"" and was not flattering for my body shape (athletic build, 5'5'' but a little more tummy than I would like). The fabric on the skirt is lovely-smooth and lightweight. So, I worked with this dress-my friend tied the sash in some kind of heart Instead of a bow. We took one side of the bottom along my left thigh and cinched up the fabric, securing with 2 large safety pins and then covered that with a broche from my original gown. It looked sexy but still classy for what we wanted. Everyone thought the dress was made that way and it looked flattering! The wind was crazy that day and the dress was all over the place but it was pretty secure. Final product = beautiful!"
4.0,Should have gotten a smaller size
4.0,"The collar is more broad than I thought in a circular shape, wish it was slightly more inward to be more neckline visible"
4.0,"I loved the dress the only thing I didn't like was because I am in a XL and my arms a bit bigger than I would like, there is NO GIVE in the material for the arms or chest so if you are big chested or bigger arms it will not work :-(  So I will be returning"
4.0,Cool glasses the are just huge. Arrived very quick
4.0,"I am a guy that loves me some hoodies.  This hoodie has been really great.  I think it looks and fits really well.  It is not too baggy, not too loose, not to short and not too long.  The material is nice.  I like the zip up feature.  The only part that I might not love is the front pocket.  I consistently try and put my hands in it like a normal hoodie to remember it is more of a velcro pouch.  it is not terrible but I am not sure why you want a velcro pouch on the front of your hoodie.<br /><br />Overall, I really like it but I am trying to figure out why the front pouch."
4.0,I really liked this item. I is made well and very colorful. I have several items that I can wear this with. It is very light weight so  will wear well on my neck.
4.0,Cute. Fabric is a bit itchy & the lapel lays funny but that may be from the way it was packaged.
4.0,"I don‚Äôt know how to get this bracelet on, need instructions or it doesn‚Äôt fit all wrist.May have to send it back also."
4.0,"Beautiful, soft fabric."
4.0,Beautiful good for the fall or spring.
4.0,This is nice but will take a long time to arrive because they are coming from China. The shipping charge are very high as well yet you have to wait about a month to get it. They are using flags and mascots to prey on people in a very tough pandemic in my opinion. It a nice face mask though but will fog up your glasses if you breathe too hard.
4.0,Sleeves were too short and I ordered one size bigger cause I usually have this problem.
4.0,"Doesn't fall off, looks great. The paint wears off near the clasp from normal wear in one week. Still looks good thoug."
4.0,"Really cute. I really like the dress, and even though it  fits me smaller than the model in the picture, so far it fits well. I haven't washed it yet, so I don't know if it's going to shrink like mentioned in other reviews.  I am 5'6&#34; and 120# and bought a medium.  You may want to get a larger size if you want it to be looser like pictured.  The green is more prominent that in the photo, but I still like it and will definitely be wearing it this summer."
4.0,I like the way this blouse fits me. It holds up well in the washer and dryer.
4.0,Love this dress shape and fabric
4.0,Was a gift for a new driver on their 16th birthday! Great reminder to slow down and be safe. Really liked it.
4.0,It's a lovely dress. I wanted to wear it foe my grandsons wedding but the circular didn't work for me. The sleeves were especially tight and the bodice watertight as well. Too bad. It's a classic style and fabric and I would have lived to wear it.
4.0,I love it! Was a little small but it was okay
4.0,"Fits large so my daughter has some room to grow in it. I had to tie the ties on the top really tight to get it to fit and the same for the side ties on the bottoms. The bottoms are still a little baggy, but she can still wear it. The colors are as pretty and vibrant as what you see in the listing. The material is pretty basic. I'm not sure how it will hold up over time, but for the price, it's a good deal and a pretty cute swimsuit."
4.0,"I gave this purse four stars because while I love the shape, weight, and multitude of pockets in it, the zipper most likely will make this a short term item. The zipper catches at the bottom and it looks like one of the teeth may have come off. Of course, it did so after the 30 day refund window so I couldn‚Äôt return or replace it. Hopefully this is just a flaw on my item and not an overall issue with the purse.<br /><br />As I said, it has tons of pockets and hold everything you need plus you can even stick a pen, eyeliner pencil, or thin lipstick in it as well. The strap adjusts easily and has plenty of length which is great for a 6‚Äô tall person like me. The outside pocket fits my iPhone 12 mini perfectly and is easily accessible.<br /><br />All in all I DO like this purse, the zipper has just made it so it will have a short life with me unfortunately."
4.0,"This is a great product, made of quality materials. The fabric stretches and warms well, but the sizing runs small and tight. Definitely order up one size or two."
4.0,This is a great bathing suit it fits just right ( actually I ordered a large and wished I had ordered a medium maybe bcz of my shape and stature it was a little big but the material is strong and it's a great piece)
4.0,A little small but will work. Need to use the zipper a couple of times so they won't be hard to zip
4.0,I haven't used it yet but it sure is cute!  I think it will work perfectly for my needs.
4.0,"I ordered these for my 11 year old granddaughter because I think they look so feminine - I used to love wearing them when I was young. I am so glad to see them come back. My granddaughter wasn't sure what they were but once we put one on her, she loved it. She had one on when she came over today."
4.0,Earrings are extremely small but the necklace is nice.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6e2db9c5ad74ffad9cdbf6729c5f15bb]] I really think this is a very pretty bralette, watch my video for details. I ordered a medium and I am a 34B, I am thinking of getting a large just because it feels a little snug around my rib cage but then again, I am very sensitive there.  That said, this is a very simple, minimalistic & cute little bra.  If you are not too big on top, this is a nice little bra.  It has no padding and is super soft. I like the design of the bra - it's awesome for those razor back tops & dresses.  I find it a bit pricey but I'm pretty frugal when it comes to buying bras.  Overall very cute bra - perfect for women/girls that are smaller on top."
4.0,They are a tiny bit short going behind my husbands ears. He loves them though. I left 4 stars because of that and the case it came in won't close. That's a bummer! If I can get Prada to send me a new case I'll change my 4 to 5 stars.
4.0,"This is a handsome canvas messenger bag with antique-looking distressed leather accents.<br /><br />In person, the canvas has a bit more of a blue tint than the way it appears on my computer screen -- an online shades of blue guide suggests a color called &#34;Air Force.&#34;<br /><br />As others have noted, the buckled straps on the front are held shut by four magnetic closures which are easy to open and close, but not as easy as velcro, as you must align the magnets for closure.<br /><br />A brass zipper with a leather pull tab seals a pocket on the back of the bag, useful for books or documents.<br /><br />Inside, under the flap, one finds another sturdy brass zipper with a leather pull that secures the main compartment.<br /><br />The main compartment is divided into three vertical sections, one of which is sealed by a nylon zipper with a brass pull.<br /><br />One of the side sections has pockets for two pens and two phones or calculators.  The side section opposite has a pocket sealed by another nylon zipper with a brass pull.  This would be the place for your stash!<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of these sections really has much if any padding, so if you wanted to carry a small laptop or large tablet in the bag, you would probably want to insert that in a padded sleeve.<br /><br />The shoulder strap is removable, attached by brass clasps.  I have deducted one star because although the product description says the strap is &#34;padded,&#34; it lacks the cushioned shoulder pad that really adds comfort when toting such a bag.<br /><br />The bag does get bonus points for its nice leather hand strap, however, and all the brass fittings seem to be well made and sturdy.<br /><br />Finally, the bag comes enclosed in a lightweight canvas tote bag that might be useful for shopping or beach duties.<br /><br />As I write this review, Amazon has not listed a price, so I can't say if the bag offers good value for the money or not.<br /><br />What I can say is it's a good-looking bag with a number of useful features, lacking only padding inside and on the shoulder strap."
4.0,Shipping took a long time.  Fit was a little small.  Good material.
4.0,Fly and stylish!!
4.0,"I took the pendant off and put it on a proper chain. It's a very beautiful, saturated color. The findings tarnish quickly if you get it wet (as expected since it's not real silver or gold). The chain left a lot to be desired and cheapened the overall look, hence, using another real chain."
4.0,a little tight in the arms.  strong material. put together well.
4.0,The arm openings are just a bit to large so I took them in and it now fits perfect.
4.0,"They look good, easy on and off"
4.0,"I have not worn this yet, however, I have placed it with some of the things I am going to wear it with and it really looks nice.  Will wear plain gold hoops as the beads in the necklace are gold.  Think this will be a winner!"
4.0,I really like this wallets style and quality. My only gripes are the poor materials used for the see through license holder. The mesh wore out immediately. Id prefer removable card storage to thin it up too.
4.0,"Bring on the hot weather, you won‚Äôt mind in this Red hot lace tank by Sonja Betro. I‚Äôve worn mine under a light weight jacket to dress up and a short sleeve denim shirt for a pop of color on the 4th of July. Alone it‚Äôs lace insets and gentle flowing length make fun and flattering on warm days. Washed in cold water with delicates and then lightly tumbled dry on low for a few minutes before hanging to dry the rest of the way."
4.0,"Nice wallet but donated it after a few months of use, as the snap closure kept opening."
4.0,"I bought this dress for my bridal shower. Overall it was what I expected. It will definitely be the dress I wear. I would have given 5 stars but it‚Äôs pretty see-through. Like a lot. For this price though, I can buy some flesh tones to wear under it!"
4.0,Not meant for adults. It looks small yet well-made. Had a slight smell to it.
4.0,"Smaller than expected, but still great!  It is a sweatshirt.  Soft and cozy.  Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"I bought a size up due to the reviews, should have stuck with original size."
4.0,The charm is small but very pretty
4.0,They are pretty and love the 3pack I only thing is that they are a lil tight good if you have lil head.
4.0,"Dress is comfortable. Happy with price and quality. I do wish the inside material matched the outside, but it doesn‚Äôt stop me from wearing. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of compliments!"
4.0,"My daughter loves them. Neither one of us cares for the one in red that looks kind of naked, so we threw it away. But all of the others are perfect!"
4.0,Color and fabric good.  Fit was good except for shirttail length.  Was way too long. Can‚Äôt wear it out or tucked in without alterations
4.0,"I wear women's 12/14 with a mom tummy. I ordered the XL. This skirt was too tight on my stomach. I am 5'4"" and the length fell to the top of my calf."
4.0,Cute!  My 8 year old daughter was Amelia Earhart for a project at school and this hat was perfect!
4.0,It just arrived and I really like it! It's more of a patent leather than matte which is fine. Mine only came with one ring though and not two like some other reviews have stated. I wish it had come with two! But I really like it. Might have to put a couple of holes into it for a more snug fit but other than that it's great.
4.0,Product came like this even though I selected the option for the wand box.
4.0,Nice fabric. A little heavy for very hot days.
4.0,Super cute dress and very comfortable. I wore this for our casual elopement ceremony in the park and it was perfect. The dress is pretty short and a teeny bit see-through. It was overcast on our day so I just went with it but in high or bright light you might want to consider a slip of some sort.
4.0,Clips are a little difficult for a child to do by themselves  but otherwise a very good product.
4.0,It was a simple gift but the person loved it
4.0,Elastic headband is a little cheap. But it's fine. Mullet looks good though
4.0,very cute! a little tighter on the arms if you are someone that works out more but overall satisfying!
4.0,"I do like the watch, but it really only serves for ornamentation rather than accurate time telling. Of course, if hour marks were added, that would take away from the originality of this watch. Adjusting the clasp is difficult at first, if you do not know the trick of it. I used the zipper of the case that it came in to pry open the clasp that serves as adjusting the size. All in all, really pretty watch, and I will definitely wear it to formal events, with casual outfits, or even professional outfits."
4.0,"Vendor sent me a refund for one pair because he/she only had 6 packs. Fit great/have worn these many times, previously purchased at Walmart or Target. Having trouble finding these any more in cotton stretch.. Will say the fabric does not hold up, even in previous packages but continue to purchase them because have never found a better fit and the stretch makes them more comfortable."
4.0,"1 week, so far so good!"
4.0,The sweater is pretty and fits nicely. The only thing is that it is a little itchy. Will have to wear a tank underneath.
4.0,"I‚Äôm returning this ONLY because I ordered a Medium thinking it would be oversized and it wasn‚Äôt (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 2‚Äù 155lbs), it fit as my normal medium size (as expected), and I wanted the oversized fit/look. The color, material & design of this sweater dress is amazing & will be repurchasing in a L to give it a little oversized appearance, I say it‚Äôs a great purchase. Order your normal size for that relaxed/fitted look or size up for an oversized look"
4.0,Beautiful piece! I only wish the chain was a tad longer.
4.0,Good shoes but a little narrow and not as comfortable As other stride rites. They dry fast
4.0,The material isn't as soft as I wouldn't hoped but it's nothing unexpected since the price is pretty low
4.0,I had ordered one before but it ran a little small so I ordered the next size up and it is exactly the same size even though the label says it is the next size.  I was disappointed but I guess I will just loose a little weight and they will both fit just right.  I do really like the quality and style.
4.0,"I do like this vest.  I am a 40-35-40 and the Large seemed to be a bit large, but is perfect with a heavy shirt underneath.  The armholes are quite roomy.  I do not wish I had bought any other size.  Not a dressy vest, but a good medium weight insulated product.  I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,"We purchased this for our 5yo son for xmas.  It looks very cool, but the harness strap for it isn't very supporting or adjustable.  The hanging strap in the photo is just black elastic and has a spot halfway to velcro, and velcros again on the end to go the entirety around his chest.  The velcro is located on the inside of the portion resting on his chest and back so it doesn't stay secure.  It'll stay well enough if he doesn't run around, but that's no fun.  I'm not even sure this design would work better for an adult sized person in terms of staying secure, unless it's on under a fitted shirt.  But, for the price and look, I still give it four stars.... will just need some adapting."
4.0,Good swim suit cover up.
4.0,didnt last as long as the one i bought on bodybuilder.com
4.0,bonita
4.0,Reduce swelling
4.0,"Well made, fits as expected without a shaper, a simple casual piece for  a variety of occasions"
4.0,Runs a tad small. Just opened and it looks to be good quality tho I suspect the lettering on the front might come off after a few washes. My son loves it for now! I was surprised to see that it is made by new balance.
4.0,"I have some of my daughter's hair, instead of the beads. It is smaller than I thought it would be but I do like it."
4.0,love this top. only problem is the heming is total crap. they ran out of the lining and the seam is in the front of the top in between the K and B instead of the back. *eye roll*
4.0,product is super cute. only bad thing about it is the pockets are pretty deep so my cards are sometimes hard to get.
4.0,"Like them ok, the connector piece is kind of aggravating because it stays bent kinda funky."
4.0,"I ordered a pair of small size gloves. It comes with in a small box. The color of the glove is not a full yellow but a faded yellow or beige. It's a pretty good thickness and it fit my hand nicely, not too big or too snug. It came up on my arm about three inches away from my elbow so it provides good coverage. I have been using them for dish washing at home. They have been pretty durable so far and protects my hands from hot water which tends to dry my hands out if washed without the gloves."
4.0,"Got a S and I'm a size 4, it was just a little big but wearable. Good quality"
4.0,Nice was a gift
4.0,"Got this to adjust size on a new hat, size I got was a tiny bit too large and loose but next size down would've been too tight, and this has fixed it.  You can stretch or enlarge a hat that's too tight but best done professionally and not many places still do it, easier to shim one down that started a bit loose.<br /><br />My only reason for not giving five stars is that it, like all similar products I've seen, it seems to be designed for sticking to the headband inside the hat where it will get sweaty and come unglued over time.  I installed mine inside the headband, out of sight, so it shims it up and adjusts the hat size as desired but the original hat headband is what one sees and what contacts the head, and it works well there, but I would like to see it designed better for that, like a broader ribbon and some stiffness to stay put inside the headband but without adhesive and of materials that will not be affected over time by perspiration, in other words a bit more permanent.  And to be fair, this one, as installed, may do as well and be fine forever, but it just appears like eventually the adhesive it depends upon will loosen as it either dries out over time or gets affected by sweat, and I'll have to replace it.  Ask me again in a few years..."
4.0,This dress is as expected. The measurements are spot on.
4.0,"I've tried a couple different caps & even had some made but they never fit. I have a small head with a lot of hair. This cap has an adjustable elastic drawstring that allows for custom fitting. The fabric is stiff but soft. The forehead has a lining that helps absorb sweat. Cons for me are after 12-13 hours of wear it does make my forehead itch & gets a little tight on my ears. Luckily it's after my shift ends, so I just take it off."
4.0,great watch with very good looks. features easy to understand and utilize. Price per value is incredible.
4.0,"Great leggings/tights! Very bright, almost highlighter yellow. A bit long in the legs for me, but then I'm a shortie (5'2&#34; on a good day)."
4.0,This is cute but a little bit too big....
4.0,Nice tanks. Fitted but do not compress. Will wear them underneath something else to work out in because they are slightly thin and show everything.
4.0,"I needed a larger wallet for money, credit cards and ID's. It's also artistic and stylish with a design embedded into the material. Good for my needs. It's slightly longer so, I place it in my man crossbody. It can be placed in pocket but is shown a bit at top of pocket and could potentially fall out. Roomy, sleek and dapper new wallet for all my cards."
4.0,Thread at shoulders started unraveling.
4.0,IT fits as expected.  It looks like the picture. Sheer.  I like it.
4.0,Pretty tight but nice
4.0,really pretty but they do run short/small - order one size up. . . awesome bling !!
4.0,Fits well with molded design and nothing that pinches.
4.0,"This is a good hat. I like the feel of the cloth material, a little on the thin side and lightweight. The embroidered emblem is very nicely made."
4.0,I bought these and added adjustable rubber prices to the straps and glued a nose adjuster on it‚Äôs like the way more expensive ones at half the price
4.0,"Cute but one of the diamonds came off easily, so it is unwearable now."
4.0,very boxy but worth taking it to a tailor to get the sides darted. Exactly as described.
4.0,"I loved these, bought each color. Great looking.. only issue is fades badly after wash."
4.0,"wallet is good, thin material but a little wide for front pocket"
4.0,I got the size I usually wear because I know free people jeans run small and I‚Äôve lost weight recently. This were still way too small. Disappointed cause they look so cute :/
4.0,"When you order, make sure you check the sizing chart. The sizing is smaller than what you would expect for a large. Some of the distressing may be too distressed, but most people who like distressed clothing won't mind. This looks well made and I know the girls will be happy with this jacket."
4.0,Very thin and won't hold sweat well.  Unless you double or triple up.
4.0,"I ended up returning this dress, but it was because I just did not like how I looked in it.  The dress is beautiful however."
4.0,Love the hat. Brim is a bit stiff so prior to wearing I rolled and secured with a ruber band for a day. Shaped well.
4.0,Very fast shipping and very cutr! Too big for my ear though :-(
4.0,It became unraveled very quickly. Super cute though!
4.0,Collar could be better but a great shirt.
4.0,Fit nice & soft to !
4.0,Great little beanie hat for kids! The beanie feels warm but it really is about more than the warmth but about the extra‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a a simple hat but nice and thick. The cool part is the integrated flashlight in the front that has difference light levels and also flashes blue and red (emergency style lights). You can recharge it with the included USB-C cable provided or use your own.<br />The music portion can also be charged via the USB-C cable but you leave this part inside the hat and charge through a small opening in the edge of the beanie hat!<br />The sound was actually pretty good and comes out in both sides of the hat close to your ears. The Bluetooth was easy to connect and worked great when paired. Not loud enough to disturb anyone but just loud enough to enjoy even  with some exterior noise or sound around you. I think this one is a great gift for kids!
4.0,"Nice feel, fit, color. Not hot, cool though"
4.0,Great outer layer for golf. Warm but not too heavy.
4.0,Cute earrings.  Definitely need different backs than what came with them as they lean down.  I use the kind with the rubber disk on the back and those do well.
4.0,Did just what it said it would do. I ordered a few more to keep all the safety glasses I need in.
4.0,"Cute dress!<br />I ordered an XL and it's true to size.<br />I'm 5'2, 175 lbs PP, and 38 D.<br />Length - wise, it come to mid thigh, maybe a tad higher, but covers everything. For winter it is cute with a thin belt, leggings and dress boots. I would buy again!"
4.0,these went over my daughters knees so I tucked in ruffle and hopefully they will stay up
4.0,"Love the color. Love the style. I'm a tall woman so this was a little short although I wore it anyway... :-) Purchased a black one as well. If it's too short for you, wear leggings and pair it with a stylist jacket."
4.0,I ordered up a size and I am glad I did. It's  very pretty and perfect to cover those upper arms. A few loose threads but overall the quality for the price is acceptable.
4.0,The material is shinier than I expected which was nice however it doesn‚Äôt stretch as much as I‚Äôd have expected. But it is a great addition to my work wardrobe.
4.0,"I love these pants! I immediately knew I needed these when I saw the product photos. They looked really nice and high quality. I bought a few different colors and they look just like the photo, the colors aren't off in any way. These aren't as thick as some other workout pants like Lulu but these are nice and soft and will stretch. I am 5'4&#34; and 125 lbs and I bought a Medium and they fit great. BUT I will say I also bought the Charcoal_Mid Waist and those didn't fit the same as the others. The charcoal pair was really tight and a thick material almost like fleece lined legging. I am definitely returning those. I would have given them 5 stars if they were consistent with the material and sizing. The other colors I bought were Blue_Mid Waist, Mint_Mid Waist, Purple_Mid Waist and Black_Mid Waist and those all fit the same. These are nice and opaque and you can't see your business underneath. I will say if you have a lot of cellulite and dimples on your legs these will show that. These cling to your body and hug your thighs so beware if you are heavier. So far I really love these!!<br />I bought these at a discounted rate for my honest review."
4.0,"I am thinking I would have liked this shirt if I'd gone a size up from what was recommended. I want to love it, the concept is cool but the fit is kinda wonky and the bottoms of the sleeves are downright weird. Like, there's a gathered cuff weird..<br /><br />EDIT to add:<br /><br />Ok, I've actually worn the shirt out now and I like it a little better than my first impression. I still don't like the cuff on the sleeve, but I just pulled it up to my elbow and it worked ok. Not a bad shirt."
4.0,The bow rips easy but I just tuck it and it looks good. Gotten so many compliments on it.
4.0,Love these  great all around
4.0,"This product is everything that it says it is. I have had no problems with this product since I've had it, which has been for almost a year."
4.0,Shirt is very soft and comfortable
4.0,Love it to workout but not good for running as it will make your nipples bleed on long runs.
4.0,I really like this dress style just wish it was not polyester. I can't wear it to long.
4.0,"I can‚Äôt use this product, it is just too big and wide. I love the color, the material is not so bad esther"
4.0,"Fits perfectly- I'm a size 10 & got the large... only complaint is that it is slightly see through but not an issue if you wear sheer skin color undergarments.... very sexy, yet classy!!!"
4.0,"These are a well made pair of socks, I received the teal blue/green color.  They do feel like there is wool in them and they kept my feet comfy all day.  These do not stay up 100%, they did drop down about an inch throughout the day."
4.0,"I would've given this a 5 star had it not been way too small. Sadly, I had to return it. I bought the XL thinking it would fit me after reading the measurement chart the seller provided.  I am 5'4"" @210 lbs, 40-34-47, L-XL tops, and according to the measurement chart, the XL should fit me with a little room to spare.  Nope! It was way too tight, if I moved both arms forward, I might risk ripping.  I gave it a 4 star, because I do love the style, and material."
4.0,Lacked in quality !
4.0,Many times other places will sell the exact cloth for nearly $10.  I paid half that and so far it has done a great job cleaning and buffing my sterling silver pieces.  Just remember to read the card that let's you know what metals or stones the cloth is not recommended for.
4.0,"This skirt is really cute, the pattern is vibrant and it is comfortable! The material is more thin than I expected, but it isnt see through. The shape of the skirt is not great, it bubbles out in the front a little and the sides are more A-Line than fitted to my hips, but I was able ot make a few simple adjustments and it looks great! I am 5;3"" and 142 llb, and I ordered a size Large, and it was a little on the loose side. It still fits, but I think a medium would fit fine too."
4.0,"everyday use OK, but prefer larger lenses for lengthy use"
4.0,"They kind of remind me of shapewear - soft, thin, very stretchy material that can hold you in. I'm a 3X and I got a 3X, and I can squeeze into them, but I certainly won't be wearing them in public. So I recommend sizing up if you don't want to look like a sausage spilling out of its casing (me in these shorts).  But they are decent quality, and the price is fair, and the length for me was about the same as the model."
4.0,"They run kind of large, but hey my daughter will grow into them"
4.0,"Cute skirt with a little bit of stretchy material so it didn‚Äôt seem so fitted, But looked fit it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, 150, ordered a size 6 and it hit me right at the knees."
4.0,The ring is beautiful and looks almost exactly like the picture. But I‚Äôve only been wearing it for one day and the gold around the gemstone is already peeling off leaving white spots
4.0,Quality of the ring is very good. The craftsmanship of the design is superb. Unfortunately cannot wear ring for extended amount of time due to an allergic reaction with skin (not fault of seller). I would definitely shop with this seller again.
4.0,Very cute but very tiny. It would be perfect for a young girl. But if you are into small earrings than you would love these too. Great for a gift. Very good quality and they come in a nice box.
4.0,"So the product description and reviews claimed this product was the perfect solution to old style key rings because it just ""pushed open effortlessly"". I guess I didn't know exactly how to interpret that. The rings are still extremely tight like old key rings. I've watched the instructional video multiple times and I guess I don't have the dexterity to do what they do. But I did find a work around. The package came with two tiny metal rings, and I used one to wedge the edge of the big ring up, then get my key in there, and work them both around until they were in. Then I wedged the tiny ring back out to repeat for the next key. Now that all my keys are on at least, it seems solid. And the large ring can easily be placed on a hook. I'm keeping the tiny ring within it until I need it again because it can be lost super easily. I'm giving this 4 stars for the description, I'm not going to say they were misleading, I just think they embellished a bit much."
4.0,as pictured. sturdy. clever metal stretch mechanism to put it on.
4.0,I would have given five stars but this headband gave me a slight headache.  But the rhinsestones are pretty secure and i really have no complaints other than what I already stated
4.0,Overall really good and spikes stayed in. Sometimes you have to take them out and use lock tight on them. Didnt have to with these. My only complaint was the size and straps to tighten. Got the job done but would have liked them to be able to tighten more.
4.0,"Bought these for a mermaid party and they were perfect! But if your kids are rough on their knees, the metallic material will fade quickly."
4.0,"The chain looks and feels flimsy, but I love the ID holder itself.  It's very pretty and durable."
4.0,Nice chain it's very shiny and well made.
4.0,I love the dress. It's beautiful.  It does fit slightly small.  I guess I need to lose a few pounds by October.  Lol  order one size bigger
4.0,"Nice pullover with zip and pretty gray accent colors.  The hood is a nice addition.  The zipper works really well.  Only thing that I don't like is that the fabric is a little ""grabby"" when I wear a tank top under it - which is needed since this is a crop top.  Washes nicely and comes out of the dryer nice and without wrinkles."
4.0,"Nice belt but the wood buckle on the rust color belt is not light like pictured, it‚Äôs the same color as the belt. Still think I‚Äôll keep it"
4.0,Ordered mine a little large on purpose. Very comfortable. Has pockets and easy to wear.
4.0,"Fit well for the most part. Too baggy in the chest. I guess I'm not the &#34;standard&#34; measurements, therefore it'd be preferred to be able to order this by personal measurements. It was comfortable and nice looking, though, and I do like it."
4.0,This is a nice coat but it seems to run small. I chose a mens small because it is for my 11 year old boy but even so it is snug.<br />The coat seems thick and we'll made otherwise. Just order up if you are between sizes.
4.0,Super cute skirt! A little see through though in the right light/dark underwear. Ordered a M
4.0,"I absolutely love these pants. They are cool, comfortable and perfect for casual or office wear. The only drawback is that I have a 36‚Äù inseamso they are a bit short, but even so, they are adorable with a pair of ballet flats. I‚Äôll be buying more in the future."
4.0,"The quality is decent for the price and it looks authentic. My only complaint is the light to make the eye glow, is looks cheap and like a little led light but behind eye. It doesn't make it look like the eye is glowing, it makes it look like exactly what it is. A little light behind cheap green plastic. It's hard to get in a picture but it looks worse in person. Other than that it looks good."
4.0,"Cute shoes, average quality, good price. Easy to put on and take off, so my 3 year old can do it himself."
4.0,"My wife loves them, and that's all I need to know..."
4.0,"Very pretty sun dress. A little big in the neck area, but the style is cute and it's very comfortable. It's an odd finish to the cotton; sort of crinkly. Comfortable!"
4.0,These are dainty and really pretty
4.0,"Looks just like the pic, super cute! Bends a little too easy though.."
4.0,"Some of the dangeling feathers are put on backwards, but it‚Äôs still pretty cute"
4.0,These are perfect for reading while in the sun... luv them
4.0,"These are absolutely beautiful...but, two of the glass cabochons were broken. There were no glass chips in the bag, so I feel like they were broken when they were packaged. While that is disappointing, the set really is beautiful. I will enjoy making jewelry out if these with my acrylic paint skins."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; and about 140lbs and ordered an extra large and the length is great! Only thing is I'll have to fix the hem because it's a little uneven, but for the price this will be a great skirt to dress up or down!"
4.0,Dress was very elegant. I would recommend sizing down if you are wanting a more fitted style.
4.0,"As an enthusiast for sports, I like to ride hard and stop when the sun goes down. That goes for snowboarding, dirt biking, mountain biking- you name it. But all of those things can beat up your body pretty badly. So after some research, I bought some undergarments similar to football pads to go underneath the booty for protection. They worked great! And I needed another one for my S.O. who began doing all my activities with me, so I decided to try this one out. Upon him trying it on, it was hard for him to walk normally as the pad is SO big it covers every inch of your rear and even down to the back of your quads. It has three big straps for securing it well, one at the waist, one near the knees and one by the thighs, and is definitely made for under garment use. I‚Äôd recommend it for snowboarding. As you can see in the picture, it is pretty large and would fit well under snowboard pants because they usually have a loose fit. I liked the design of this for a newbie or someone who is prone to fall a lot on their behind because it offers so much protection from damaging the tailbone or just getting a sore rear, especially on day where the snow is a bit icy. The hindrance of movement takes away one star, but the protection gives it a 4 star total.  I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

4.0,"I love heart shaped glasses, but I can't always find them. Thanks Amazon!"
4.0,"Bigger than I expected, but for the price it's just fine."
4.0,They are ok. The vent plastic pieces can fall out. Just make sure you secure them or they will fall out. I like the fit. It fots my 7th and 5th grader just fine
4.0,"The slippers were bought to meet the school‚Äôs request.  They want children wear slippers in the classroom. The slippers are as pictured, run slightly large. The girl love it. Overall a great buy."
4.0,Absolutely love this band! This is seriously one of my favorites. The only issue I have is it is a little uncomfortable after wearing it for a long time but I have the same issue with every single band I‚Äôve ever worn so I wouldn‚Äôt say it was the band itself.
4.0,I like the space that the wallet has and it's structure is well built other than the outer layer is super thin a wears off very fast.
4.0,"I needed to use the bra-extenders, which makes the back awkward, and the straps really far apart in the back. I feel like some days I‚Äôm constantly pulling the straps back onto my shoulders.<br />BUT the padding/boob part is so comfortable, I‚Äôve tried a handful of different bras now, and a lot of them have a single thick strap that leaves a mark on my chest. But these are thicker and not bothersome."
4.0,This shoes do what they  supposed to do.  The shoes fit fine and they are somehow  comfortable I do have to say that they are a little bit stiff but considering that is just for the cycling class I guess it's OK
4.0,I purchased as a gift for my granddaughter age 5. Perfect gift
4.0,"I ordered one size up thinking that my boyfriend would need it, but these are cut properly to fit the size listed. He is wearing them a bit baggy anyway- instead of returning for proper size.  However, next time we buy, I will get his exact size."
4.0,Well for the price these were BS! Worn maybe 5 times and a hole just magically appears! Pretty mad I wasted my money. ü§¨
4.0,"I like the way this dress fits everywhere except it is a little bit shorter than I would have liked. About an inch, inch and a half above my ankles, and I like for maxis to cover my ankle. For reference, I ordered a medium and I am 5'7&#34; 145 lbs."
4.0,"These were very comfortable however, after one wear, they had a hole in the middle seam."
4.0,Really liked these but were much too short in torso and length for me. They do have a nice stretch to them and fit well over my stomach. I‚Äôm just too long waisted and busty for these. Good quality though and I would have kept them if they fit right.
4.0,The dress is beautiful! The medium does fit okay but it was larger than I expected. A small might have fit a bit better. I'm 5'2 and 145lbs. The material is thick and super soft! I'm keeping all 3 colors.
4.0,"Bought for my son who is a NC fan . Was a bit disappointed these socks pilled after first wear & wash . Color was nice , hope the material lasts . For the price I expected better ."
4.0,Earrings are great size and came in wonderful condition. Back pieces don't fall out and they are really very sturdy
4.0,They were perfect for our move to ND !
4.0,Happy with my recent purchase. Will see how long black paint will remain
4.0,The top is okay. It looks better in the picture. there is embroidery around the edge of the collar and the ruffles that i think the top could do without.
4.0,it seems to be a junior fit not a plus size; but my granddaughter will find them and assume ownership....as usual!!
4.0,These are comfortable and mostly stay in place. I like the variety of colors.
4.0,I like it a lot.  I haven't gotten to give it yet so I am not sure if it will fit.
4.0,Great hat for fishing. It came a wee bit small but I just put it over a lamp to have it stretched for by the time I needed to use it. I live it.
4.0,"These were a gift for my granddaughter. She loved them.  They are very attractive,delicate - exactly as promised in the product description.  The packaging was very nice, also, making it easy to wrap for her gift."
4.0,My babies love this! It's so adorable and not to thick
4.0,I bought this suit for my 80 year old mom. She love polka dots. The suit fit as expected. The boy shorts are cute and modest. Would buy again
4.0,Seems very well made! I purchased this as a gift for an adult and it was perfect.
4.0,"Very comfy romper. It runs a tad large and doesn‚Äôt have a ton of shape, but it‚Äôs a romper! I have larger arms and thighs but this fits perfectly and the tie in the middle helps my smaller waistline. It‚Äôs very light weight and is nice on hot summer days."
4.0,"Jacket looks good and comfortable, unfortunately I ordered size M, is usually I wearing, but I had to change for Large<br />And is not problem with return , just returned and ordered a new large."
4.0,"Good quality, but I should have looked at the dimensions because they are for my 7 yo granddaughter.  Perfect size for teenagers or adults. Very pretty."
4.0,This was my first ever pair of any kind of lock laces.<br />One thing I don‚Äôt like/understand is how to tighten up my laces after burning the ends and tying them to the shoe. That‚Äôs why no 5 stars for me.
4.0,Love this!  I had to get a longer chain!
4.0,I wear med ordered large from the other post could have gotten xlg
4.0,So was definitely drawn to this look. The picture looks like a coat like material shirt.  I got the XL as I know alot of these designs will run small. So it arrived faster then I expected since the XL was not prime. It reminds me of those sheets you would find at walmart in the complete bed in a bag. It resembles that kind of noisy cheap sheet. Or like a vinyl shower curtain. The cuffs and buttons are a hollow type of plastic. So I was like nope. Tried it on and it was surprisingly cute and nicely shaped. It looked like the picture minus the fabric. However I could not come close to buttoning it. It would not come pass half my chest. I was bummed as it was so interestingly cute and had a nice style. The sleeve length was great and the full length in back was perfect. So I had my daughter model it. She is 5'6 115lbs. This is not for plus size. My bust is 38/44. I think the XL would be a junior medium/small large. Unfortunately they only go to a XL. If they had a 3X it would probably fit much better. I would actually reorder if they had a bigger size lol. Call me crazy but like I said it was definitely a different type of cute. I liked how it fit everywhere else. I think its worth a try. It reminds me of something you would get from wish.
4.0,"Compliments every time I wear it.  Flows great, comfortable.  I wear shorts under it."
4.0,"The quality I this shirt is excellent. I just didn‚Äôt like the fit. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and this felt too long. The material is a true flannel, great quality and thick."
4.0,Adds a very nice touch to solid colored heels.
4.0,Really nice the only complaint is the box that it comes in is just plain white not really pretty to give as a gift
4.0,Nice pants at a good price. Would purchase again.
4.0,I have been eyeballing thisshirt forever and it went on a sale so I finally bought it. I love it. I'm 5'5 and 230.i bought a 3x cause I wanted it longer-just in case for leggings and stuff and also my bra size is 40DDD and it looks good there too. A 2x would fit just as good I think too but I usually wear XL unless I want soemthing longer I buy bigger. If that helps at all<br /> My weight is completely carried in my stomach. And the shirt compliments me. Alright I did get the faddes blue and my back isn't looking all the flattering but it's okay. Also certain bras don't work with this shirt cause of the design.
4.0,"This little romper is adorable! It's well made and soft to the touch. I washed it as soon as I got it and put it on my daughter as soon as it was dry.  The design is adorable and I love the buttons, especially, as they add a nice little added touch of class.  My 28lb 15 month old fits well into the size 12-20 months.  I would have given 5 stars except that the legs seem a little too short and one of the buttons on the legs kept coming undone, but probably b/c I kept pulling them down. My daughter is tall but these were like, up to her knees when she sat down. Overall I think it's very cute and would be a great fit for younger babies. I was able to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I liked the band however the small was a bit loose and had no way of tightening so I don‚Äôt like that
4.0,"Being a 5'2 women, and big busted..pants too big, and top seemed snug.  Nice colors."
4.0,Fun piece of jewelry to wear with most outfits.
4.0,"The material of this shirt is VERY soft and comfy...and stretchy. I wish I would have ordered a smaller size because of the stretchiness. I'm 5'2"", 130 pounds and it's bulky on me. I had to tie it to get it to fit comfortably. I washed it in hot water and dried it before wearing hoping it would shrink.  I'd buy it again but in a smaller size."
4.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry. Disappointed in size. Would have liked to have been a little larger
4.0,"These are very pretty but did not fit over my glasses. For today's glasses styles, I don't consider mine super big so Inwas surprised. I'm keeping them because I'm buying new glasses soon and maybe they'll fit."
4.0,Love the shirt but it's solid white and not what the pic shows.
4.0,Love this swimsuit. I'm normally a size Large but bought this in an XL from reading other reviews prior to purchase. Fits perfect!
4.0,They're okay..... but don't stay up.... always adjusting it back up....
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and at a very affordable cost.  My daughter loved the look and the simplicity is exactly what she was seek No for her special day.  The zipper and sewing around the zipper seemed to be well done and we found no issues.  The side seems however we're not as well done and halfway through wedding day there was a small hole beneath the arm where the stitches had loosened.  The length worked well for my 5'4&quot; daughter who was wearing western boots.  The dress was not dragging at this point so for someone much taller and with high heels this dress would most likely not reach the floor, alternatively someone much shorter may have issues with it being too long and dragging.  The straps are pretty and a warped scarf like material.  The strap on the right of the dress was sewn just a tad off and did not lay the same way as the one on the left - not too bad but something that you notice on your daughters wedding day none the less.  The bodice of the dress is very pretty and flows nicely.  The bodice does not give a deep low cut view but is a very flattering classy look with a tasteful amount of cleavage.  The skirt of the dress flowed very nicely and the layers were very flattering.  All in all the dress was beautiful and my daughters day was beautiful."
4.0,"Pros:  Lots of side pockets, good inner pockets for phone, glasses, etc. Strong seams, durable zipper pulls and carrying strap.<br />Cons: I wish it was  slightly bigger as I use this tote to carry my clutch (bulging with cards), a small container for lunch and a book to work and it's a little tight.  I also wish it had a shoulder gripper one could attach,  it slips off my shoulder easily (slick nylon strap) and I do not like wearing it slung across my body.  Overall, it was a good value for the price."
4.0,Gt this aa a gift for a co-worker. Comfortable to wear and fashionable. It is not an even width all around and that ia part of the design.
4.0,"Nice beanie cap, good material, though a bit stiff. Will need to wear it in to be actual 'slouchy' style. For the price a very good cap."
4.0,I love this dress i love the polka dots and the color of it and also I love the style and design that it has which is a side tie
4.0,Great hats!  The balls you have to adhere yourself and aren‚Äôt as secure as needed
4.0,Perfect for really cold winter days.  Roomy and comfortable. stylish and warm. I think it‚Äôs a great purchase  I loved the price and the exceptional quality
4.0,"Plenty of compliments, fits good, used for a Heritage day,  will use for a costume next year"
4.0,A little small but great quality!!
4.0,"Fits slightly small but still wearable for me. Nice blend of fabrics has worn and washed well so far. A good choice for the money in color, style, fit, and quality."
4.0,I liked that this dress fit my 32DDD chest but was small enough around my midsection. The length was good and it was super soft on the inside. It didnt show every single imperfection on my body which I'm grateful for as I'm 4 months postpartum. The dress made me feel great and didnt break the bank üëåüèº
4.0,"not 'wow' effect, but I cannot say it's low quality<br />sleeves are long enough for 183cm height but not super-long<br />it hides your fifth point and looks pretty stylish"
4.0,"Very thin, but fits great."
4.0,"I always hated buying apparel online, but there is just nothing in the stores. These are high quality slipper, but they ran 2 sizes too small."
4.0,"Cute, but with probably turn quickly."
4.0,"Colorway is amazing, they definitely seemed authentic, although the glue for the soles to adhere to the uppers was smeared a bit all over but I'm not a sole collector so it wasnt too bothersome for me. No creases after running. I would purchase this shoe again."
4.0,Very good but  too big
4.0,Thin like basketball shorts.
4.0,"Not much to it, very sexy. Doubt I'll be wearing it out though, the top of the slit is just a little too close for comfort"
4.0,"I purchased the orange top, because my wardrobe needed a bit of color, and this shirt jumped out of the page at me.<br /><br />It really is adorable and unique, but I will have to make some alterations because my breasts are quite small and the holes are larger than I was expecting, so I hang out.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's a good buy, and I recommend it."
4.0,"I bought this dress for my engagement pictures, and it looked very elegant and fit wonderfully. The only concern was that the sleeves are a much baggier than the picture would have you believe, and there's not really a lot you can do to work around that. The material is good quality and does not feel or look cheap."
4.0,My daughter has a pretty boring school uniform so this really spruced it up! She loved all three designs + wore them a lot. Be careful not to dry them because they will shrink. Will be buying again for next winter!
4.0,"Love how this key fob cover looks. However, to use my remote start I do have trouble. The way it covers the button makes it hard to press. Otherwise I love it and it‚Äôs doing its job. The main reason I wanted this was just to protect the fob and it is definitely doing that."
4.0,I am a 0/2 I ordered a small and it fits like a M/L. it is very nice but the style is not as cute when it fits baggy.
4.0,I thought I would have more coverage. Like it would over lap. I bought at a great discount.  Works for a short or top cover up.
4.0,The color Green was much darker than the picture. Picture looks more emerald but What I got was Hunter. Overall the fabric is not thin. Good buy for the money
4.0,the pendant and necklace come int good condition nice and shine. look buatiful
4.0,Super cute earrings with a bit of an edge. They are somewhat loose but as long as you‚Äôre mindful they are fine.
4.0,I really like it but thought the color would be darker. It is a light tan not a brown
4.0,Fits a bit too snug but great otherwise.
4.0,"My son loves the ties, they were for him on his mission in another state."
4.0,"I like the T-Shirt, however, it was a little big."
4.0,"I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5 only because the tag for these hats are on the outside of the hat, so when you cut it off there is still a small white strip where the tag used to be which is annoying (and yes im 100% positive I have the hats the right way). Other than that, super cute and fit my 4month old sons head well."
4.0,As advertised and perfect for my eco-minded daughter. Stylish and practical.
4.0,"Warm, not scratchy. Don't need liner for warmth."
4.0,"Bottom Line - X bionic products work!<br /><br />The Energizer Long sleeve was the cheapest at the time. So, I thought I'd give it a try. I was going to mainly replace my UA, Nike, and Adidas Tech Fit compression clothing with the X-Bionic line. Primary sports are Basketball, Running and Weight Training. I sweat profusely sometimes and needed a better solution.<br /><br />My first test was playing basketball outdoors. After a couple of runs, I wasn't as thirsty and winded. The shirt didn't feel wet. To test for sure this shirt works, I played without the energizer shirt the next day and I immediately notice the difference. I was sweating more from different regions of my body and I felt a lot more thirsty.<br /><br />As for post workout, I do wash the shirt as soon as I get home. You can gentle was and dry the shirt in the washer/dryer but I prefer gentle wash/hang dry.<br /><br />Overall, I believe this brand is a bit pricey. However, just try finding deals on Amazon sometimes you can save a lot. This is a must-try for all athletes. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!<br /><br />I'm waiting on my socks, pants and soon, the track suit."
4.0,It stiffens the hat but will leave light spots but you can remove with a damp rag.
4.0,"These fit and were soft, so soft, but there was no support at all, which I have a lower belly and I'm giggly. Returning for that reason alone."
4.0,"I like them well enough. I wish they were curved a little like a natural ear. It make it stick out on my earlobe. But that could very well just be my personal ears lol. Haven't broken, fast shipping, and overall cute. I have small ears and they go further up than the models. Keep that in mind!"
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful! But fragile, one of the feathers came off of mine! Still really like them!"
4.0,"Dont like how long the pin is, but looks decent"
4.0,"The size runs small from the arms and chest area,  but beside that its a gorgeous dress."
4.0,My husband really likes this watch band his only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt hold the watch face as tightly as the one that came with the watch so when he pluggs it into the charging station it pops out a lot. Otherwise a great watch band
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, just didn‚Äôt look how I hoped it would on me, maybe a little too big In The sleeves"
4.0,Great bathing suit my little girl loves unicorns love that it has a UV protector liner inside of it definitely recommend and will be purchasing another one
4.0,"I love the bathing suit but it is a little small, it fits fine but for as small as it runs, its odd that for me the legnth of the neck tie was a little too long. I can & totally will manage since it took 3 weeks to get to me! Super duper cute!"
4.0,"I got this set for my little sister and she loved them. I wasn't thrilled with them but that's a personal opinion. They seemed of good quality and were packaged very well. The only issue I had was that the silver metal looked very cold, like platinum or another similar metal. I like jewelry to have a warm feeling to it and this set looked like cut ice set in platinum! If that's the look you're going for then I highly recommend these -- very heavy and blinggy. Just not for me."
4.0,"Does the job, good quality, would buy again. they are really big!"
4.0,My phone fits perfect once in put i in one of those rubber sleeves. Cards and IDs are all in one place too...Great buy
4.0,My daughter love these shoes. I just with it was a turn off and on button..
4.0,less sheer than I expected
4.0,"This is a little short, but it is very cute."
4.0,Totally satisfied. The dress fit perfectly
4.0,Wish I was a little thicker and it came to me a lot lighter in color than I thought
4.0,"Really cute and fits well. Not the best made product, and smells horrible when it arrives, but my daughter loves it."
4.0,"The tunic itself is a blended stretchy material that is warm but light so could be used in spring and fall without  jacket here in Vegas without being too warm. The ""sweater"" part of the tunic is the same material as the other parts just shaped to be like a cable knit. It fit as I expected it to since I had read the other review that stated it was not shaped in any way as my picture shows. That's the reason I took a star off since the picture makes it appear to have some shaping in the waist."
4.0,kinda cheap ... but it was cheap $$$
4.0,"Little bigger than I thought, but still a classic."
4.0,Came flattened and folded in the box. Fits well and has ties on the inside to make it tighter. Bought it in beige and is more of a blush pink color.
4.0,Fits under seat fine except aisle it's a little tight. So far it's wearing fine no issues. Color and size as expected.
4.0,The top is nice and the material is as expected.  My only disappointment is that it's not as long as I want.  The picture indicates it's longer than it actually is.  It doesn't quite cover everything when wearing leggings.  This is the only reason I am not buying more.
4.0,I wanted a new purse but didn't feel like spending too much. I liked the design on this and got compliments on the first day of wearing it!
4.0,Washed & dried now its all good
4.0,Smaller than expected but beautiful.  My 3yr old loved them and has received many compliments
4.0,These are adorable and appear to be very well made!  I am disappointed though that the band is too big for my 3 month old's head!  :(  I guess we will have to wait a few months for her to wear them!  :(
4.0,"I really like this dress. I would have given it a 5 star, but I feel that the picture isn't accurate. My dress was a shorter than the picture provided, and the material was a little on the cheaper side. Over a, I got this dress for under $5 so it is totally worth the money!"
4.0,"These rose colored lenses are great, and my eyes love the protection. You just need to be aware at traffic lights as the green light doesn't show up when wearing these. I can see the red and yellow, but I can't see the light when the traffic light turns green."
4.0,I like the dress I just wished it were longer. I'm 5 ft 7&#34; and it stops short of my ankles.
4.0,If you have breast dont get this dress. But otherwise its well made and a beautiful color. (also make sure you have thin arms). I returned it.
4.0,"I liked it. I weigh 165 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù.... I ordered a medium and it fits perfect. Unless you want it to be loose, you should order your true size or even one smaller. I‚Äôm usually a medium/ large in blouses and I could‚Äôve bought a small. But I am used to girdles so I don‚Äôt mind if is a little tight. Material is good."
4.0,These are great. Only issue is that the Rose gold one changed color to actual hold. It looks nice even though it changed but I really wanted a rose hold color one. Now I have 2 golds. I showered in them and the other colors haven‚Äôt tarnished they are be light and comfy forget they are there sometimes.
4.0,"I purchased two Tibetan Medicine rings and love them for the symbolism and meaning. However, the lettering on both rings has peeled back and snagged some of my clothing; eventually peeling completely off.  I would purchase the rings again and put a clear coat of nail polish, or varnish  over the lettering  in order to preserve the integrity of the jewelry. The rings are lovely."
4.0,Read reviews and decided to order a 5x I normally wear a 1x sometimes 2x depending on material. The fit was great beautiful dress order up a couple of sizes
4.0,"It looks like it did in the picture. It needed to be buffed clean when it arrived. It was dingy, sticky and dull on the back, not all rubbed off.The blob of glow in the dark paint is a sloppy mess inside. I don't know yet if it will glow in natural light from wearing it all day, but it does glow when put next to a light. It is pretty, They should just take more pride in presenting the item to customers. Especially when bought as a gift for someone. I was disappointed when the recipient sent pictures of what it looked like when it arrived.All in all she liked it."
4.0,it is a lovely blouse but the decolletage is too big for my age. I am planning to do some alteration to it. the reason is that I dont have a large bust. it will fit perfectly women with large busts.
4.0,"The gauges look great, but they seem to run on the small side, I got 1/2&#34; and they are a bit small. Still great for the price and very pretty.<br />The Amethyst, is lighter and more see through than what the picture I posted shows. I would recommend these to friends. Arrived in about a week."
4.0,Another plain run of the mill hoodie but seems to be of a good quality.  We will see how it holds up
4.0,very nice color... and very silky to the touch... dressy looking.
4.0,:=)
4.0,I've worn the black one everyday since I got it in October.....shower...everything.  It's faded and one of the leather pieces broke free today.  It was worth how cheap it is.  Gonna get another one and take it off more. I just really like it.
4.0,beautiful belly ring. the back wares a little with time and rubbing against your skin a lot but still very great product!
4.0,Nothing to special but very fine for cost.
4.0,they are a little big but I love the warmth they provide.
4.0,"I got this for my wife. She is 5'8"", a little under 150lbs, 36C bust and usually wears a size 8 or 10 (U.S.).  Based upon the sizing chart, I got an XL.  Here are her thoughts:<br /><br />First - Yes, I know I wore the wrong bra under this dress to take pictures.  Once I changed into a different one, the straps were no longer visible nor were the shoulder strap tighteners outlined underneath.<br /><br />This a ""nicer"" dress for not-so-casual occasions.  A party or for when you want to be a little ""dressier"" for a date night maybe.  Also, good for work if it's required.  There are not buttons/zippers/snaps/etc to fool with, which is nice.  Fabric seems decent in a medium weight.  I like the lace detail on the back as well.<br /><br />One thing I do not like about it is that the inner fold along the neckline is not stitched down.  It's loose and makes it look unfinished.  Not that big of a deal.  I'll either put a few stitches in or use some fabric tape.  But I do like the depth of the neckline.  It's a little deep, but not immodest, in my opinion.<br /><br />I do like the pleats in the front and I think it shapes the body pretty well.  It's a little longer on me than in the pictured on the model.  On her, it seems to be above the knee while on me it is right at the knee.  I mean, I'm not short, but either the model is tall or the pattern is not exactly as pictured.  I may get it hemmed up a little to show a little more leg.  (Husband Edit: Nice!)<br /><br />Overall, I am going to rate this 4 of 5 Stars."
4.0,This is a super cute dress and the pockets are amazing. The sleeves are a little longer than the ones pictured and the length is longer than pictured as well.
4.0,This dress was the best last minute purchase I could have made for my in laws 25th anniversary celebration. It arrived with just enough time to have it hemmed. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and it was quite long on me. But if that is the only thing I need adjusted in a dress these days... I‚Äôll take it! I received so many compliments on it the entire night and no one could believe where I got it from. Overall very pleased with my purchase!
4.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K4HW0C4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
4.0,Nice dress. It was too short. It came a few inches above my knee.
4.0,"Dress is ok, interesting material. It fit me perfectly, I got a large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 164 pounds."
4.0,It was nice but it was a little big and hard to put the bands on.
4.0,Shirt is as expected.. good price.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift only to learn that the blue in the photo was more of a teal in the actual item. The person receiving it is content with the color and likes it, but I am disappointed that it was not the color I had ordered/pictured."
4.0,"The frogs are cute, but they look like they are for children. I like my silver frogs better."
4.0,"Its a really cute outfit. Shirt fits perfect...bottoms a bit loose. They dont hug you the way biker shorts do, which creates those wrinkles when you move. I dont like the wrinkles :/"
4.0,"Surprisingly good for the price. Time will tell if they last, but so far working out and working no tears or damage. Even if they only last a few months or a year, you're paying for 10 colors what you pay for 1 ring with qalo."
4.0,I'm pleased they are a little delicate but if handled with care there perfect. I decided to take them out of the packaging 2 weeks before the activity they should be fine and adding extra velcro for smaller kids.
4.0,Reduced the sun glare better than my other glasses. They work for what I wanted. Got a pair for the wife also and she seems happy with them.
4.0,"Love the style, a lil too snug around the chest area (but I am well endowed)."
4.0,"Works like a charm and good quality for the money. It's my first pendulum, I was able to ""program"" it just fine. All of the pieces came in tact and a cute little velvety bag to keep it in."
4.0,"very beautiful jewelry, however it was not a strong material which resulted in me breaking it within a day. it was an easy fix though, but then i ended up losing a few of the butterflies because they fell off. Overall, though, it was very good for the price."
4.0,These shoes were too big for my son so I sent them back. He wanted a different style shoe
4.0,The packing was GREAT!! The tie look judt like the pic. Quality was great. Only problem was i didnt recieve my square and cuff links. But othet than that. Service was great!!!
4.0,PRetty color
4.0,"Just love this dress, it was exactly what I wanted for an upcoming wedding and a christening."
4.0,"Ok, so it's not going to be a super high quality luxury dress at this price point, but it is a nice, decently made dress.<br />Full disclosure, I'm an actress and got this for my costume wardrobe for when I play a certain role. It was AMAZING wearing it for that show the first time. If I were actually gettingarried, especially on a budget, this would be my go-to dress.<br /><br />Fair warning....it's LONG. I'm 5'7"", and it was hard to walk in until I altered it. (I did princess gathers throughout the skirt instead of a full hem at the waist, but a full hem at the waist would have been awesome too, and probably hidden under the embellishments.)<br />The length is great if you're tall, and if you're not, can be dealt with by doing some minor alterations  which the dress is perfectly set up for.<br /><br />The bodice actually has structure and boning, so a bra is proba ly not necessary...which is good because it has a sheer back. Not too sheer to wear a skin-toned bra underneath without issue, but pretty see-through. It's actually very lovely that way, though. I wore a strapless beige bra (I'm larger chested, and NEED a bra, regardless).<br /><br />Speaking of the chest area, there's ample room if you're well endowed, but if you aren't, I feel the shape of the bodice and the structure will make that a non-issue...there shouldn't be any sagging or gapping if you don't have enough to completely fill it out.<br /><br />The sash is nice, and the covered buttons on the back were a nice detail. The buttons are decorative only, as it has a zipper.<br />The dress is super easy to get in and out of, and was incredibly comfortable to wear.<br /><br />There's definitely room for crinoline underneath if you want a fuller look in the skirt. I probably would have, but the shows I do usually get pretty warm, and I like to stay as cool as possible. For an actual wedding though, I'd probably do it.<br /><br />The train is a little bothersome when walking around socializing. I think I'm going to put a satin covered lastic loop hidden in the end, underneath, or a white satin scrunchy maybe....so that I can slip it over my wrist whole socializing and have it out of the way hands-free.<br /><br />I'm 5'7"", a little busty, and weighed about 225 when I wore this, and it fit perfectly, maybe just a little loose even.<br /><br />I'm losing weight, and down about 10 pounds now...it would have to be altered by someone who actually knows what they're doing to keep wearing it...for the price, I'll probably just order it again in a smaller size when I need to."
4.0,I took a shot. I must have a misshapen noggin'?!
4.0,"Really like this shoe! But go up a whole size. I think in order for this one to fit my foot I would have had to order a 8 1/2 and I'm usually a 7 1/2. I ended up gifting them to someone that is about an 8 1/2 and it fit them. Fast shipping, really good quality shoes with a great padding inside. Would have been very comfortable to wear."
4.0,"Like all Leofoto products I have purchased, this strap is well made. However, the strap has a very prominent 6""x1.5"" logo using white letters. The logo is so large that it could look like it would be branding by the wearer of the strap. This is not shown in any product photos displayed on Amazon. This might not matter to some, I'll have to decide whether I can cover the logo in some fashion or return the strap."
4.0,"This is a pretty top, fits true to size.  I took a star off because of fading.  I only wash on delicate wash cycle and lay flat to dry and it was faded from black to a charcoal gray."
4.0,perfect and arrived in a timely fashion.
4.0,"I want to love this hat, but it's so big! It looks great on, but slips over my eyes as I continue to wear it."
4.0,"My budding scientist ten year old son asked for a new lab coat &#34;for his friends&#34; when they're working in the lab... well, they're getting his old one. This one is of much higher quality he says, the fabric is thicker and has a &#34;real&#34; feel to it, hangs on him properly, and just all-around makes him feel like he's a working scientist. Nice!"
4.0,"My little girl picked this one out herself so she was super excited when it arrived today and she immediately had to try it on. Thid leotard is very cute with thick material, I absolutely love the snap buttons on the bottom, anywho My little girl is 2 months shy of being 4yrs old, she weights 31 lbs and fits in your average 3t/4t shirts and she's just moving out of 3t and into 4t pants, until this last growth spurt she's always been on the smaller side but her measurments for this leotard were (21 chest/ 20.5 waist /21 hips) i originally planned on ordering up  as we're in between sizes and for room to grow but reviews said it ran big and i didn't want it to swallow her so I went with the 2-3 and it does not run as big as I expected it actually fits her perfectly everywhere except the shoulders and private area (where it's loose) luckily when pulled down to fit the shoulders you can't see the crotch due to the skirt so it works out well. And the kid loves it and can't wait to where it to her dance class."
4.0,A little more yellow in color then what it looks like in picture.
4.0,Slide a bit inside the shoe but pretty much do what they are supposed to do.
4.0,"I needed two, only one was available in Mar. the other on back order. This one arrived a slightly different color and slightly smaller. It is needed so I will keep it."
4.0,"First off, I really like these pants.  For other shoppers I'm 5'6"" 250lbs size 18/20 in Lane Bryant.  The XXL fits my waist perfectly with stretchy room to spare when I sit.  My only complaint about this item would be that it is a bit thin.  Not see through thin, but I'm worried about the longevity of them in the thigh rub department.  One wear and the material already has those little pilling balls on it.  For those who don't have the rub to worry about, they are perfect.  I paired mine with this top:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WJFWZ2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  The green matches beautifully, and the length comfortably covers any tummy insecurities."
4.0,This is my second hat my first one got faded they are very comfortable wear. Thanks. I'll be ordering another one for a friend of mine as a gift.
4.0,"Cute, stretchy.<br />Itches a bit, but helps a lot having the satin ribbon band at the waistline.<br />Comes to about 4&#34; above my toddler's knees. She's two and a half and is tall for her age."
4.0,The jeans are great and define the booty nicely. If you are in between sizes go with the smaller size. The jeans stretch.
4.0,"They're not Tommy Bahama's, but they will do."
4.0,"If you wish to use this hat as part of a costume, it will definetly come true. The actual material seems to be somewhat elastic, so wearing it is comfortable."
4.0,Good product..wish it was heavier and a little bigger
4.0,Good shirt to workout in...good comfortable fit..
4.0,"I was SPANXed to within an inch of my life, but I felt very curvy in this dress.  Good fabric and well constructed, I'm glad I bought it!"
4.0,"Provides more support than I expected, but not as much as an underwire obviously. Very comfortable, almost like wearing nothing at all. Does have a little stretch making it easy to put on. The only thing I don't like is the straps are not adjustable (I'd like to be able to tighten them just a tad) and they twist easily so I feel like I'm constantly trying to straighten them out. Overall a cute and comfortable bralette to pair with off shoulder and/or low back tops or just in place of a regular bra for comfort. Would not recommend for very active days if you are large busted as it won't provide enough support for exercise or a lot of movement (beyond walking and carrying your handbag)."
4.0,The material its made of rather scratchy but otherwise its a great product
4.0,"The ring arrived in a timely manner and was packaged securely.  Both the ring and accompanying necklace arrived completely intact, the chain and clasp fully functional. The engraved name was clear and neat, which was a very pleasant surprise considering how affordable the piece is.  The little gem adornment is shiny and doesn't at all come off like costume jewellery.  The piece comes with a lovely cloth bag for presentation and storage.  I deducted one star only because the ring started to tarnish and dull after only two uses.  I think that's more because of skin interaction than the piece; but still: Two days is not very long.  All in all, I would buy this piece, again, and definitely recommend it for casual wear."
4.0,"I love how they look, but they‚Äôre so lightweight that it feels like they won‚Äôt stay on your face. Also, the lenses are low quality."
4.0,Pretty. The lace isnt the most durable. But it gets the job done.
4.0,"I wish I noticed before there were more color options than black and silver. It's nice. I honestly thought a large may be snug (5'10&#34; and between a 10/12 US size) but it's actually fairly loose like the photo. So if you want a more snug fit, I'd suggest going the size smaller. Comfy!"
4.0,Cap fits good however the front is somewhat flat because of the sewn on Chevrolet emblem. I wear the cap but not totally satisfied with its looks.
4.0,"Love the look! Quality of the buttonholes are not great.. there was some threads coming off while I was buttoning my shirt. I gave it a 4 because it fits and feels perfect, but they need to tighten up on the quality of the details."
4.0,This was a gift for a friend but about a week ago the shoulder strap clasp broke.  How can I resolve this issue?  She loves her handbag and wants to get it repaired.  Help!
4.0,It's cute totally cheap and can only be worn one way if you put it on wrong everyone will see how cheaply made it is but I'm not mad at it.
4.0,It is a little big but for the beach it works
4.0,The charms are slightly different sizes. The color are the charms are true to what is shown. I added a few to my bracelet and trade them out on my bracelet over time.
4.0,This sweater is warm and the fabric is nice and of a moderate weight.
4.0,"The quality isn‚Äôt the best, especially for the price but my son loved this shirt so I can‚Äôt complain. Although we ordered the biggest size they had for toddlers, and it was more snug than I imagined. My son is on the smaller side for a 4 year old. It has held up well too, we bought it for our trip to Universal Studios in August and it‚Äôs still in good condition. Would recommend but it does run very small, I would say 4T fits more like a 2-3T max."
4.0,Fits fine on my table.
4.0,"These shoes are adorable. They had a funky smell and needed to be aired outside i the garage for two nights before allowing them in the house or to be worn. Just a cute, vibrant, artistic shoe that captures many compliments. One shoe felt a little tight, but as luck would have it, I was buying these for my post bunion removal surgery, so the foot that was surgically correctly may actually fit. Will write update. I wear a size 71/2 and ordered size 39. One shoe fit, the other was slightly tight."
4.0,"This jacket is extremely compact when packed into it's storage bag, but it is also very warm. I was surprised how warm it got when i tried it on. The hood also has a lot of coverage and when on and the jacket is zipped up it leaves just a small hole for your eyes and mouth. It fits true to size. It also looks nice."
4.0,"I like that both testicles and growing are seperated and away from sticking to my thighs, but my penis was too big to grow inside it. I was stretching the fabric. But ill rate 4 of 5 because i felt confortable in it. Even to sleep in."
4.0,Luv the same print on back and front.
4.0,"I was expecting the wool to be much cheaper for the price.  It's good quality though.  They look good, they're warm, and I think they'll last for a while.  These are my winter dress socks and I love them."
4.0,"I'm small on top, so generally a &#34;faux&#34; wrap doesn't work for me because of gaping. But I thought I'd give this a try... and I'm glad I did. The dress is stretchier than I expected, so it's fitted on top and clings a bit around the middle, but not enough to be a deal breaker. It's definitely low cut, so some may want a cami underneath to make it more work-appropriate. Overall, it's really cute. The print is fun, and the length makes it good for the office."
4.0,Love these for my 3 year old just wish they came in one size up as they have shrunk quite a bit with washing. Perfect for everyday use... not see through and the grips are great for the toddler on the move
4.0,"First time purchasing these, they were too small but only because I couldn't figure out the sizing chart. To find the correct size you have to measure the circumference of the widest part of your hand, for anyone having trouble with this.<br />I measured my hand at almost 8&#34; and went for the X-Large. The gloves fit very snugly and are almost too small, so I would suggest getting a size up from what the sizing chart tells you. The wrist section of the glove is a bit too big as well...<br />Overall, great glove, and they look nice, just wish the glove wasn't a little tight and the wrist a little big.<br />Bekah :)"
4.0,"I liked the fitting and the fabric. Unfortunately,  the fabric faded very fast. Like after two washes."
4.0,"I like the dress and the style, but it runs slightly larger than usual mediums. I would order the small if I ordered again. I put it in the dryer hoping to shrink it slightly."
4.0,I bought this headband for my 5 year old for her Christmas play. It was great quality!! It was a good size for her head but also fit me perfectly as well. Definitely would order again.
4.0,A bit more pixelated than expected but the fabric and stitching are both high quality
4.0,Grandson really likes it.
4.0,"only complaint I have with this top, is it needs to have something under it as it is super thin and it is also a bit short for my liking. otherwise, it is a great top!"
4.0,Labs where
4.0,"Cute shoe. Good price. This product is from a Chinese company. Not just made in China, but shipped from China. Meaning it takes a long time to get here."
4.0,The fit is very good.  They are waterproof.  They seem to be warm but we have not had very cold weather yet.  The only thing I do not like - the clip that keeps the gloves together when not being worn - is very tiny.
4.0,Cute for pics but uncomfortable to wear
4.0,"This is super cute! It's a little loose material, the lace isn't as tight as pictured, not totally in love but it's cute."
4.0,"I got these as friendship shirts for my friend's birthday. They're the perfect amount of cute without being too cheesy or cliche. The shirt is a thicker, less flowy material than I was expecting (had I known, I might not have gotten them in black), but otherwise I am very happy with them. They do run a bit small in the chest. I'm between a small and medium and don't have a very big chest, and I ordered mediums, so this wasn't an issue for me, but I would recommend sizing up if you have big boobs!"
4.0,Se ven bien esperemos duren si son la medida
4.0,This jumpsuit rans big and loose. Fabric is soft and comfortable. I ordered small I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 110 lbs. if you are petite the length is good
4.0,I wanted to love this skirt. Its okay. The material is SUPER soft and maid from the same soft legging material that comes in funky patterns. I didn't care for the waistband though. it was a very basic elastic and I prefer a more structured style. It was also a little long on me (I'm 5'2) but it didn't look horrible. I took a chance but ended up returning it because I didn't love the floral pattern. If it wasn't so bright i probably would have kept it. Nice for the price point though.
4.0,"These pajamas are nice, not too heavy, soft material. Unfortunately, they sent the wrong shirt and I have a cat face instead of ""Let me sleep"". I like them enough I am keeping it anyway. Nice fit, quality seems good. Very comfortable. If they sent the correct shirt, I would give them 5 starts."
4.0,"I like it it's very cute. The only thing is the pink part looks like you'd get it at the dollar store and not like the picture, the paint is in even. BUT I still like it and it looks nice"
4.0,"It fits and it is tight but not uncomfortable.  I was hoping it would go under a black lace over thing I had but it didn't work.  I think it will be nice and contouring when I find the right thing to go over it. Because of the red, though, it won't work under everything. I will definitely not dry it.  It seems to be made well and it helps hold everything in place."
4.0,Definitely order at least a couple sizes larger than you normally would but otherwise a nice shirt. Bought it to tie dye and it worked great.
4.0,Absolutely love the material!!! Fits perfect!!
4.0,"They run a little big and I think they‚Äôre adorable. Not greatly made for every day wear, but for the price I paid they work great."
4.0,nice fit and comfort
4.0,"My daughter really does like these.  The only reason I am marking them down to 4 stars is the sizing is silly.  My daughter is 7 and wears an 8 (even if I occasionally buy her a 10 that drapes fairly big on her).  The 12-14 is tight.  I mean quite tight, not just snug.  For a 12-14 to be tight on her is crazy.  She still wears it and just consistently tugs at the bottom end of it (if you know what I mean), but I would highly recommend ordering a size or 2 up from what you think your child should be wearing.  To be fair, perhaps my daughter is taller than the average 7 year old and that might be contributing to the problems with sizing."
4.0,They are awesome for running. I would give a 5 star but my right light has a bad battery‚Äôs I should have gotten the warranty and I didn‚Äôt. I have to charge every 3 days. Running 45 a day.
4.0,Ordered for my sister.  Looks good but just a little tight around the hips and a little too short for her
4.0,Awesome fit. Look great!
4.0,"I like these a lot. They are too small it got size 7 in these. Not sure how I'm going to get them off. I'm very thin, I'd recommend these for a young girl."
4.0,The fit is as expected but the back T-bar needs to be taller before it spreads horizontally
4.0,"Very well made of high quality materials. Really nothing negative to report, though like anything else relative to apparel, make sure you are cognizant of proper fitting/sizing needs which often seem to be at the forefront of clothing criticisms/reviews...Happy New Year to All!"
4.0,I like it....right size ...ample space.... as described ....
4.0,nice little fun scarf. could be a little longer  comfortable to wear good color has many tie options . great addition to my scarf wardrobe.
4.0,These collars are super comfy and cute for pictures to my boyfriend and social media
4.0,"4 stars, only because the quality is just so-so (you get what you pay for, right?!?). These leggings fit well, feel super soft when wearing them and have maintained their color, even after many washes. For the price, you can't beat them."
4.0,The colors were just a little off and the sleeves were just a little short. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4ft and weigh 120lbs I ordered a small but should of went with a medium. Still really like the shirt though :-)
4.0,"This is the cutest little bracelet! I love the colors and the little owl bead. It's a very vibrant silver, a pretty blue, and I have a bracelet over all. It seems like good quality. I've enclosed a photo to show what it looks like on. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to open it, LOL. The clasp looks just like a silver bead and I was afraid I was going to break it. It does say 925 on the silver clasp. Very good quality bracelet. I'm really impressed. The only problem is when I opened the clasp all the beads fell off so therefore I am taking away one star. Just be careful when putting it on. It's gorgeous though!!!<br />Disclaimer: I did receive this product at a discounted rate and in exchange for my honest review and unbiased opinion. My opinions are my own and no one else's. I have never been paid to write a review. I purchased products and I would use my own home that I like myself. If my review is helped you in anyway, please vote yes. Thank you so much for reading my review."
4.0,Fits comfortably. I'm 5'6&#34; 127 lbs and ordered a small. The belt is kind of shoddy but not a big deal...can wear it without the belt or a different one
4.0,...which is all I want out of a flip flop. Good job.
4.0,"They are comfortable and fit well. A bit thicker than I expected but work for thick types of pants like Jean's. Def not leggings approved lol. Although the thick lines are actually on the sides of your butt and not on your butt so they are less noticeable in reality . I would have preferred they had a bit more support in the tummy, not like shapewear type support but something that would have allowed my extra skin from pregnancies to not still giggle out lol.<br /><br />For sizing reference. I'm 5ft and 120lbs and wore a medium that fit well. I also have pretty thick thighs despite being slim so the legs fitting were perfect because most would be tight"
4.0,For the price of $3 it was beautiful! No regrets in buying it.
4.0,"It is a nice dress, suddenly the low cut must be used in my case, but the material is beautiful and otherwise it looks good."
4.0,Need to remove it occasionally to allow your skin to breathe.
4.0,Great color.  They fit quite tight.  But look good.
4.0,I like the shorts a lot except they didn‚Äôt come with a belt! Just ordered a second pair. I don‚Äôt see an option to contact the seller either.
4.0,"Fit was good. Haven't ran in them yet, so will update when I do"
4.0,My girls wear these every day and love the look. I am pleasantly surprised they've held up every day wear!
4.0,"This dress is a 8th grade graduation dress for me, but also casual to wear somewhere else. It is a little see through, you do have to cut a tag off, but overall a good dress."
4.0,"It fit okay, the arm holes are definitely cut small. My upper arms are not huge, but this really cut into me underneath the arms. If you have a larger chest (I am a 40C) sizing up helps but it will still be tight. Otherwise this was a great dress. The material is sturdy, the skirt is full and it works perfectly for work."
4.0,Looks really nice I'm just worried about where the chain goes through on the pendant looks a little fragile
4.0,"I bought a woman's small hoping it would fit my 12 year old granddaughter, but it was way too large. It fits my wife really well, but she would normally take a woman's medium. She's 125 pounds and 5' 6"" tall. Overall, it seems to be a nicely made jacket at an affordable price. Good for cooler weather."
4.0,"It's definitely a tight dress, but love it! Flows beautifully."
4.0,pretty but kept sliding down legs
4.0,i ordered this bracelet in order to be part of my halloween costume this year and im happy to say itll be making a great addition to it! the shipping was very quick [no more than 3-4 days] and it looks just like the picture and is very very cute!
4.0,"It's just as described, totally collapsible (except the upper cap portion of course).  It is a nice soft plastic rather than a hard plastic that could develop cracks as time goes on, I think this will hold up to lots of rolling and unrolling.  I like that it has the little string hood to keep it rolled up when not in use.  I also like the flip top lid, it keeps the mouth piece clean yet convenient to use.  It seems to work best when squeezed for drinking.  There are 2 issues I see with it.  the first is that I don't think it's safe to through into a backpack or anything as I don't believe it is entirely trustworthy as leakproof.  I haven't experienced a leak but I imagine it could be an issue.  Also it's hard to hold when it has water in it as it sort of mushes around.  Some kind of solid protector/holder would be very convenient and perhaps solve both of the issues it has with one fix.<br />I love the color!  And I think it's really the perfect item for the airport (which is why I bought it).  Much easier to transport through security and such than a non-collapsible!  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,Love these but I was surprised that the size 8 felt small. This is my third pair of Tom's jutti flats and about my tenth pair of Tom's; all size 8. I plan to keep them and just stretch them a bit.  The style is perfect for casual or slightly dressier wear and the color is a great neutral.
4.0,They were fine except red and blue are not as bright as on the picture ... dull grandma colors ... green one is my favorite the only one I wear out of 3
4.0,"after reading some of the reviews, there was a common complaint that the shirt fit small.  I ordered a size up and this shirt his huge.  Lucky for me I like my shirts larger."
4.0,inside lining was too short
4.0,It‚Äôs really cute!! But definitely go two sizes up!!
4.0,"My son is 6 and they fit him a little on the tighter side, while my daughter is 4 and they can be a little loose on her. I do like this masks because they can pull them up and down around their necks. (and don‚Äôt leave them lying on a table or ground ) However, they do not seem to hold up very well after washing, the stitching has come out of most all of the multiple colors we have purchased. This is the reason for not giving 5 stars."
4.0,"Very well made, comfortable and secure feeling."
4.0,"Looks really cute with a navy skort, built in bra gives interesting detail.  No problems yet with multiple washings, hang to dry"
4.0,"I wished it ad a different clasp, but I new that clasp would come with it. I don't think there was a choice for a different one!"
4.0,Cute dress - I ordered a small and it fits a bit loosely. Looking forward to wearing it to a party :-)
4.0,"I love this blazer and I love the fact that no one else has one like it. The stitching was a little off on one side of the jacket, but after steaming it and dressing it up, I'm the only one that can tell this imperfection exist.  The material is not that of a traditional blazer...it's made from something softer, but still not a bad product."
4.0,some earrings are not as bright as others - the ones I received on the second try were high luster which matched their necklace - just lovely
4.0,a little too short in lenght
4.0,"The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because it was stuffed in a tiny box that warped it a little, making it super snug to put on, but once it's on it fits perfect. Overall, it's well worth the price."
4.0,"nice shirt, very soft material. I'm 5'2 and around 93 pounds, so I'm kinda tiny, but the collar and shoulders were a little tight for me. I would definitely buy again though!"
4.0,"Est√° aceptable, pero se torna un poco diferente el color de la presentaci√≥n."
4.0,I like the style very much. But somehow it is a little bit poor quality. otherwise I would give you five star.
4.0,Fit was good as well as the construction. It warms your head until it gets windy. The weather I was in was the 30's and the windchill brought it down to the 20's.<br />It would be a good head cover when the weather is in the 40's-50's.
4.0,Very nice but didn't fig me as needed.
4.0,My daughter says it's easy to use and holds tight.
4.0,I just received my order (9 pairs) and privious comments are accurate. They are smaller than one inch-I would say more like half of an inch but they are pretty especially for a little girl or your second piercing. Well worth the wait- I received them 17 days after order. Recommend purchase.
4.0,"Great hat, perfect to keep cool and out of Suns rays"
4.0,"I've only used three of these since receiving them, but each time I thought their sturdiness was fine. I'm not sure why they are flat, other than to ""look cool,"" but the flat shape makes them somewhat more difficult to pry open to get keys on and off them than the standard non-flat rings.<br /><br />Other than this, they're fine."
4.0,Fabric was great. Sewn together well. Fit great on 7 year old niece & she loves it. Tie string in hoop skirt hurts her though. Crown in wonky. Dress is adorable.
4.0,This is very cute but fits more like a dress than a top. Would be cute with a pair of leggings though
4.0,"So I'm a true 9, and ordered as such...and they were pretty snug. Like to the point where I wanted to exchange them ((but I couldn't))...they are SUPER cool looking and I love them, but they do run a bit small. If you can order up a half size, I would!"
4.0,"Nice comfy jeans with good stretch. I like my jeans a bit tight. I bought these my size and they fit kinda loose. I would definitely buy again, just a smaller size."
4.0,"I have only had them for a short time . They are very comfortable, nice to wear around the house. I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,The Skirt can be a little hard to walk in because of the longer length- but beautiful and great material!
4.0,The black buckle scratched too easily. But because of the buckle adjustability and overall length adjustability I'm buying another one.
4.0,"They're good-looking aviators, but you will get some sun peeking in from the corners. Also, they're a little tight if you've got a bigger head. I'm not too upset though, as they were only $5.<br /><br />I'll probably keep them around as a movie prop or something."
4.0,The socks are great and fun design. However the packaging was tight and there was nothing between the socks and the mailing envelope. So when I opened them I cut the heal of 2 socks.
4.0,"I love the significance of the 3 nails and the the cross itself is beautiful, perfect size. The chain doesn‚Äôt work well with it though, doesn‚Äôt flow through the cross opening as smoothly as it should, I‚Äôll be replacing the chain soon. I would definitely buy it again."
4.0,A little small but it could be useful just to remove the lifters. A bit uncomfortable. I might just use the cups by themselves to cover up the intimate areas. Other than that the adhesion is very good.
4.0,Nice shoe!  Runs on the smaller side.
4.0,"Easy to use, and did not require a lot of effort for it to work"
4.0,I ordered bigger than my size on purpose so that was my bad. It was okay otherwise.
4.0,Cheap hat for Madeline costume.  I wouldn't really wear it for actual outfits- because of the cheap quality-( but that's why I like it- we didn't have to pay a lot for a costume accessory!)
4.0,"Very cute, and comfortable. The size was a bit too big but my child will grow into it."
4.0,very authentic costume
4.0,"Pretty good, basic tunnels. My issue, and this may just be me, but my earlobes are pretty thin cause I have small ears so I had to trim the flairs down so they could show my earlobe. But even trimmed down they rarely fall out"
4.0,Very pretty and stylish for any age young girls to old ladies!!
4.0,"Nice and beautiful design,it fits very well on my shirts and makes me look like a real gentle man."
4.0,"Nice necklace, especially for the price. The necklace is attached so it has to be worn together. The length is adjustable to make it more choker style or longer for lower necklines.<br />The color is a little bit more yellow than I personally prefer but I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs 18K gold plated.<br />Looks really cute on, and hasn‚Äôt turned my neck green!"
4.0,"Beautiful locket with nice, detailed charms.  Chain was left handed,  and a little short, but overall great.  Will use another chain for the pendant."
4.0,You have to go down In size with these pants.The are Gorgeous!! And Unique.. But why do Amazon or whoever keep going up on the price!! Geesh
4.0,The sleeves had a break in it that made me look undesirable. Felt like a spinster. Not form fitting enough for my liking.
4.0,Very good for smaller faces. The glare is a little too much for me.
4.0,It üëå
4.0,"They were a good size, and look nice in person.<br /><br />Not all of them &#34;click&#34; together in the back very well, or even at all in one case, so some pairs are not secure."
4.0,"I wish the picture showed the neckline, not a super fan of v-necks but a cute shirt."
4.0,Ordered for my 3yo (currently wearing 6T shoe size) knowing they would be too large. Plenty of room to grow. I'm giving only 4 stars because after moderate use a heel broke off. Very easy to glue back on however. Looks just as pictured. Overall very pleased with the shoes. Great for pretend play/ dress up.
4.0,A bit large fit<br />Soft materials and fast shipping
4.0,So beautiful and delicate! Love it. Only thing I wish the bar was a tiny but longer like other stainless steel belly rings
4.0,Originally ordered a size large but ended up reordering in a size medium. It was still a little bit large but only really in the upper half. Which could be because I am only a B cup. The material in the top is lightly see through so I would recommend wearing something to cover a little.  Overall the dress was good quality and worked for the occasion.
4.0,The back of the dress doesn't fit well at all. It's to loose but everything else was fine. I'm a bittom heavy person with wide hips.
4.0,"its cute, it doesn't look exactly like the picture... there is more yellow in the actual scarf and the colors are bolder but its cute!"
4.0,"The dress is not white like the photo but more of an off white/dirty white style. Which is fine, but finding the appropriate colored underwear can be frustrating. Needed an appropriate dress for family photos (with siblings, cousins, etc.) But this just did not work out. Thankfully I had a plan B. But the material felt nice, the shoulder materi felt weird and the pockets are pretty good. Will I ever wear it? Probably not. But the size was correct. I wear XL due to my chest size and it was perfect."
4.0,Great suit that fits just above your belly button. The top is a little flimsy (something may pop out)...but it looks great with the bottom. It would've nice if there were a halter strap to make it feel more secure.
4.0,"I like to write my reviews well after having owned the product long enough to have an educated opinion of the product. We have had this umbrella for a year now. Early on it worked exactly as we wanted. But as mentioned by a few folks in previous reviews, you don't want to have it up in strong winds. We went to use it this summer and found that the main horizontal pole that attaches to the top of the umbrella spire had a plastic connector break. It is the main part that connects the umbrella to the horizontal extension pole, AND is responsible for the majority of the horizontal stability of the umbrella. I am quite surprised this part was made of plastic. While we did not try to use it in winds at all, I believe that over the course of time, and with normal breezes, this part just weakened and eventually broke. The only other knock on the product is that the dark blue canvas lost a LOT of its color and faded. You can tell from parts that are not exposed to the sun vs. those parts that are. Vast difference in color. These are the only negatives that we had for the umbrella. Yes, the piece breaking is a deal breaker, but it worked fine until that broke.<br /><br />The positives from this purchase are that the customer service from WIKI is absolutely outstanding. Not only were we refunded the cost, but they readily accept input from their customers for product improvement. They are already working on an upgraded fabric to be more resistant to UV light. They also took some input regarding the part that broke. IMO, at a minimum, it should be metal like the rest of the umbrella framework, especially considering this particular part is so critical for umbrella stability.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase from WIKI in the future knowing the upside of their customer service (which can be VERY lacking in today's times). If they upgrade the fabric, and fabricate that critical part with metal instead of plastic, I would give it another go and buy the umbrella again.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />UPDATE 1-12-22: Wiki has been in contact with me for the duration of our issue. And they have gone above and beyond in today's world of customer service. They have taken the recommendations/suggestions that myself, and others, had noted previously and made upgrades accordingly to their 2021 model. They have asked me to try a new umbrella and asked me to offer an updated review based on the improvements they have made, and I accepted. As a result, I am upping my review to 4 stars (from 3) not only for the exceptional Customer Service we have experienced in working with Wiki, but also the fact that they seem to care enough about their customers that they would not only accept recommendations, but act on them as well. Looking forward to the new version. I will update here again after we use it for a while to see how the improvements hold up!"
4.0,"It fits good like a glove, but couldn‚Äôt give 5 stars because it wasn‚Äôt white, but off white, and I don‚Äôt like that"
4.0,"Fit what I needed, but the pads were much smaller than I originally thought. Also, look clearly to make sure the shape is the shape you want."
4.0,I use this when running outside in the cold & it works well to keep my ears warm. Haven‚Äôt washed it yet so I don‚Äôt know how it will hold up.
4.0,Beautiful bag!  Just a bit heavy.
4.0,Very happy with this wallet. Lots of pockets and compartments. The zipper is a little sticky but functional.
4.0,"She likes the way it looks, the length of the chain, etc.  You get what you pay for with the clock part.  It doesn't keep great time.  Se are going to try a new battery and see if that helps.  Other than its &#34;clock&#34; properties, she likes it a lot.  I can't give it less that 4 stars as for the price, you have to know the clock part isn't going to be stellar..."
4.0,This is so beautiful. I get so many compliments. The size is large but delicate looking. I would give it a 4.5 instead if 5 only because the chain kinks up and is difficult to get the knots out.
4.0,I have skinny wrists and the fit is perfect. I love the way it looks. Only reason for 4 stars is because some of the blue seemed to rub off after time.
4.0,"I love the shades, but I wish the lens were a little darker"
4.0,"Very high quality lenses, frames are beautiful. Just a tad heavier than I expected."
4.0,"This is super cute! I bought it to wear down in California while on vacation and it was perfect, lots of compliments and it looked just like the picture. Great for travelling too as it doesn't wrinkle easily. I did say that it fit small but what I really mean is it is short. Like bend over and show your booty short. It was great while on vacation but I will probably pair it with leggings or tights for more daily wear."
4.0,This bracelet is pretty and a nice price.  It is casual and goes with lots of casual outfits. I like the way the cats eyes move when I move my wrist in the light.
4.0,"Nice looking watch. I am 5'8&quot; and 155 lbs. The watch seems a little big on my wrist, but it isn't heavy so not that big of a con. I like the sundial that shows the sun and stars. It is basically a small 24 hour clock that shows AM or PM with a sun or stars. The other 2 subdials are chronograph (or stopwatch). They seemed non functional to me at first, but it turns out one is a second hand and the other a minute hand. The movement is subtle. If you have any watch repair tools (buy a set if you don't) it is easy to adjust the size. If you don't I could easily see someone breaking either the supplied tool or the watch by being to aggressive. I tried the included tool and it started to bend. All in all a pretty nice looking watch."
4.0,The bracelet is well build and as advertised. I find a bit to bulky from my wrist and the clasp does not allow for an easy adjustment of the size.
4.0,The Aurora Women‚Äôs Classic is a fine watch for the price.
4.0,"Cute little Outfits, however in my opinion the Red Shirt & the Red that is in the Hearts on the pants don't exactly match & the pants run a bit short legged, so I would size up."

I nearly punched myself in the face when i lost my grip trying to pull up a pair).<br />¬†<br />***Don‚Äôt try to put them on while you are still wet.¬†<br />Don‚Äôt use lotion before putting them on.<br />¬†<br />You ever see that episode of ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù when Ross wears leather pants on a date, and goes to the bathroom? If not, google ‚ÄúRoss wears leather pants ‚Äú and it‚Äôll come up.<br /> THAT is what you‚Äôll be dealing with.¬†<br />¬†<br />********* Wash them daily in cool or lukewarm water with mild detergent (i use dawn dish soap) , and hang to dry.¬†<br />¬†<br />Do NOT wring them out.¬†<br />¬†<br />You can gently roll and pat them on a dry towel before hanging them up to dry.¬†<br />¬†<br />If you can‚Äôt wash them daily, then definitely every other day.¬†<br />Washing them helps them to maintain their shape instead of stretching out and getting stuck that way.¬†<br />¬†<br />*******When you get new stockings/leggings ,¬†<br />-wash them, pat them dry, loosely fold them, then put them into a ziplock bag and stick them in the freezer.¬†<br />¬†<br />-Once frozen, take them out and rest them on a towel so they defrost (do not try to unfold while frozen).¬†<br />¬†<br />-Once defrosted, hang them to dry.¬†<br />¬†<br />You only have to do this once. It‚Äôs to strengthen the fibers in the fabric and help them last longer.¬†<br /><br />I don‚Äôt know why it works, but everything i‚Äôve read and been told says to do this so i‚Äôm not taking any chances."
4.0,I ordered the biggest size but still the mask was way too small. So be warned if you have a bigger face this mask might not fit.
4.0,"I bought this leotard in white, size 2-4 ,for my 22-month old daughter, hoping she can wear for the next years to come. The fabric is not thin at all, which is great because I chose the white one. The leotard is made of a firm stretchy fabric. It seems a good quality fabric, but I wonder if it will stretch enough as she grows taller. She used it for a costume, and I was hoping she could use it as well for her first ballet classes when she is 3 years old, but I am not sure if she will be able to wear it when she is older. I guess I will have to wait and see."
4.0,Great way to stay organized and not get wires tangled while on vacation!
4.0,"These fit pretty well, however the stitching in the straps can be really itchy and/or scratchy. It's really hard to find decently priced cami's so I think what you get is a pretty good deal for the price."
4.0,"This dress's material is very comfy and the top part fit amazing, I just wish that the slit at the bottom didn't open up so much. I always risked it, when sitting, showing the spandex shorts I wore underneath."
4.0,Feels nice but the 13s feel a bit smaller thsn usual
4.0,It s ok. The leather and metal rings make it look cheap. Should have buy from a store. Hope this is real coach
4.0,My son was super excited about these shoes. They look good but are a little tight. We bought the same size as his car shoes but these feel a tad bit tighter. They don't seem too heavy though and are tough enough for my little ninja.
4.0,"Runs small. I ordered 10/12 for my very thin 65 pound 11 year old and it‚Äôs small on him. Otherwise, a good product."
4.0,"Good product, especially since the color selection is so good.  The small jar of this cream does not last all that long, especially compared to standard shoe polish."
4.0,"Good quality, but it did not fit me right. It is a cute dress though."
4.0,Nice quality very soft shipped quickly. I bought a size XL for my husband who is 52 years old. It fit just right but we are going to return it for the next size because he feels like it fits almost too perfect in that with one washing and just a tiny bit lshrinkage it will be uncomfortable to wear aroun the pool where he prefers to be relaxed. See pictures he is always a standard extra-large.  I  would recommend sizing up if you are on the larger size of an extra large.
4.0,I like this product very much true to size and is very comfortable
4.0,"Not bad for the price but the cup did not fit quite right. The wire came out the sides within 4-5 times of use. To be fair, I washed them in a washing machine. Not sure if that was the problem but I‚Äôve never had the wire come out so quick"
4.0,Great colors and washes well. Should have ordered a size smaller.
4.0,great quality and comfortable
4.0,Cute for my witch costume.
4.0,I love cats.
4.0,"Very comfy soft, but thin and long for me since I'm only 5'0. But satisfied with the price I paid for and the comfort"
4.0,"Finally received my dress today. Its is lovely! The materal is of good quality and the style is just as advertised. I'm 5ft 2&#34; and weighs 124lbs. I got a small in the colour blue and it only needed a few adjustments; mainly because I'm short and with short limbs as well. Otherwise, it fits perfectly. Cant wait to wear it with my bday dinner. I also bought a little gold body chain to accessorize it."
4.0,"mask fit perfectly. i basically use it during my early morning bike rides this winter, specially when outside temps are below 20 *F. works as expected."
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34; , 145 lbs, 36&#34; bust.  This shirt fits fine.  I don't know if it will shrink when washed.  No tags in it, save for back of neck.<br /><br />I also ordered the same shirt in white.  It was approximately 3/4 to 1 inch smaller across the front.  Too small.  I sent it back.<br />No problems with the seller."
4.0,"Variedad de motivos, no me agrad√≥ que no haya paquetes"
4.0,Very neat. Does what it's supposed to and easy to use.<br /><br />My complaint is it gets really hot and hard to  breathe in.
4.0,"Cute! Soft material, but a bit see through. I‚Äôm 4‚Äù11 and it was down to my knees like a night gown. I cut in it 2 to make a crop top and then a skirt for Halloween."
4.0,"Very nice looking and feeling, but I was surprised they were too big to be able to wear without alteration. I'd consider ordering a size smaller than usual. ( I'm 5'6 and 320 lbs and have to work to keep them up, lol.)"
4.0,"I love this watch, it is kinda big for my wrist so I need some links removed but other then that it is a nice watch."
4.0,"Nice dress, I wear it to work, it works fine for business casual."
4.0,It was ok. It didn‚Äôt really wear good.  Dissatisfied with the material. It was to thin.
4.0,Brother thought it was a thoughtful gift and loved the look and feel.
4.0,"Very good looking shirts, made of comfortable material. I use them for work all the time and they help keep me dry. However make sure you order a size or two bigger they do run small."
4.0,"The hat and should be very warm, however it is on the smaller side. Overpriced for what it is."
4.0,I got a black & grey one. The shirts fit good but the arm lengths are completely different. Won‚Äôt be able to wear the shirt as long sleeves since both of them are too long.
4.0,"I'm going to get the main problem out of the way. The lens feels like a toy. I was swapping the lens out from the one out of the box and I swear I thought I was going to snap the thing. Outside of that it does come with a case and a cleaning cloth. You have a polarized, tinted, and clear lens you can swap in between. Personally I don't like the ""bottom"" frame, I'm used to normal sunglasses or the Beretta glasses (that's shown in the picture as a comparison), but maybe all biking glasses are like this with the frame on the bottom. Overall, lens feels disgustingly cheap, and I feel like I'm wearing goggles instead of sport glasses, but I guess it works."
4.0,"Its not the highest quality necklace, but the chain is good and cute gift for the Coffee addicts out there,"
4.0,"Great fit, comfy but just a little see-thru so where a bra color that matches."
4.0,Nice product and material
4.0,"Good shirt, good price."
4.0,Material is nice weight. Good coverage without being too long. Comfortable.
4.0,Looks very good on me
4.0,"Perfect weight for someone who likes a light robe. The length is perfect, but it does run a bit large. I will order medium next time."
4.0,Little tight but cute
4.0,This bag looks much better in person than the picture. It's very functional and holds my 15.4&#34; laptop well. I use it for work and it has held up well. I tried quite a few different bags and this one has been the best. You can't beat it for the money.
4.0,"Daughter wore it to silly hat day at her elementary school and the kids loved it! The dancing ears are so funny! Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the air bulb would detach from the hose inside the hat.  But even the kindergartners could manually reattach it themselves by feeling through the fabric, so not too tricky. Would recommend."
4.0,It lovely but a little to small for me
4.0,Holloween
4.0,"It isn‚Äôt like a dark black, sort of a dark grey. Washed up okay, but not great. Not the material I expected."
4.0,This is a very nice jersey. Very soft and comfortable. The only issue we have is that I had ordered a M because the reviews said to order a size smaller. We probably would have been fine with ordering a size small. It is very big and baggy. Will work for what we need it for.
4.0,Great socks! I gave these as a gift and they were well received and fit well (a male with size 10 shoes). The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is the price. They are slightly overpriced for the quality of the product.
4.0,"Purchased for twin granddaughters, they are adorable and the girls love them."
4.0,Wish I had a better pic ‚òπÔ∏è But the dress was cute. was a little too big in the chest area for me as I don‚Äôt have a big bust. I ended up sewing it so it could fit tighter but I did really like the dress. It‚Äôs really simple but the right accessories make it pop
4.0,I was skeptical about ordering but once they  fitted perfectly and I recived compliments.
4.0,Nude leggings are a little see thru as seen in the photos. I‚Äôm also normally a womens u.s. size 8 and I ordered a size 10 (large) and they fit as tight as a size 8 normally does. So I‚Äôd order one size larger
4.0,"Have several of these, they are so comfortable and pack well."
4.0,"I was looking for a Tom purse but purchased this one by mistake due to the names being similar. It is heavier than the one I want but the design is not bad so I decided to keep it. Beside it was shipped from China, it is too much trouble to ship it back."
4.0,I really enjoy how they feel and that the straps are fully adjustable<br />Edit: I will say this is my second batch of these type. They ended up not fitting quite like the other batch. They are wider and the shelf is shorter. So I am lowering by one star.
4.0,"Received as a gift. Great glasses, fit me well, easy to see through and keep the sun out well whole driving and outside in the yard. Wish they were more true to the wood color. The pattern is spot on, but the color is more mauve/pink than actual brown or tan."
4.0,I love the print and color! I am a size 22/24 at Lame Bryant and a 3x fit perfect. Does wash well in regards to shape and fit but fuzzes up even in its own fabric. It‚Äôs nice but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll buy again.
4.0,Very cute! It will be nice to be a little smaller but it doesn't look big too.
4.0,"They were way too baggy for me in the legs. I look like I was wearing a tent. I knew they were Capri length and because I am short, five foot tall, I figured they would be ankle length for me, which they were, but they were way too big in the legs."
4.0,Great light weight face cover for riding and protecting from covid. Nice to have a versatile mask.
4.0,Very pretty.  Somewhat difficult to put on your self.  But it takes a little patience. Not bad for the price.
4.0,Like them - very comfortable & wear well
4.0,esta bien
4.0,Love the top. Perfect fit. Bottoms were a little big on me. I think it would be great if pieces were sold separately.
4.0,"Really pretty dress! Received many compliments while wearing. Only thing is it‚Äôs a little short, kept having to pull it down so I didn‚Äôt show too much"
4.0,"Its a nice charm, but its slightly not as awesome as it looks.  But for the money, you cant beat it."
4.0,"These leggings stayed up my entire run! Mine did have a tiny hole in the seam of the crotch area, it‚Äôs not even noticeable so I will still wear them. Got them on a discount so definitely still worth it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 180 pounds and the large fit me well."
4.0,"hook on handle is ridiculously large.  Other than that, works as advertised and is a huge improvement over traditional umbrellas."
4.0,Bought the hoodie as a gift. Looks just like the picture! A bit thinner of a material than a traditional sweat shirt but the inside is still pretty warm. Material overall seems like good quality. Tags on it say this is official MC merchandise
4.0,I love the material. Ordered one size up because I‚Äôm well endowed and it didn‚Äôt help much. Now the dress is big but still tight around my chest. Very cute but wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre also well endowed.
4.0,I bought this outfit for an event but I wind up not going. The outfit fits very nice. I am 5'4 and 192 lbs. The material is nice and I cannot wait to wear this outfit at a later date.
4.0,"I have a lot of hair, these just about accommodate my thick hair. I bought them to keep my own hair out of my food prep. Also find them useful when working in the garden, they help to keep pollen off my hair and improve my visual without hair in my way."
4.0,Soft material and comfortable. Pockets not big enough for a phone.
4.0,"decent boot for the price, worth it, no complaints. I recommend these."
4.0,"Somewhat short in length, tight around the arms, and the neck is a little too loose when buttoned with a tie, but otherwise good shirt. I'm 5'9 and 150 lbs average build."
4.0,So far he loves it and is holding up well.
4.0,It's kind of bright I feel like I standout when I where it.
4.0,Nice looking belt. Buckle is very heavy.
4.0,Not exactly as expected but can be worn.
4.0,"It's cute.  I though it would be a little bigger, but I think it fits good.  Very cute."
4.0,I didnt like that it runs very small. I do not know how to return the item to get a bigger size.
4.0,Works as advertised for me.
4.0,Love the dress. So comfortable and love the pockets!
4.0,Too small. My daughter usually wears a 10. I ordered a 12 based on sizing chart and reviews.  It was so small she couldn‚Äôt zip it.  It is good quality and we ordered another one but definitely size up.
4.0,"I tend to run a wide range of sizes (34/28/37measurements), but this dress in Medium fit just right. It's a stretchy, good thick material,  and color is spot on. It is hard to iron out the wrinkles, and I would say that a slip is a must if you're wearing tights or leggings underneath as the material tends to cling to the nylon. Over all though very happy with the dress!"
4.0,"After one wash cloths did fade, but maybe we wanted wrong."
4.0,"Fit well. Cute dress. However, I came wrinkly."
4.0,very sexy number that can also be dressed down. Only complaint is that the material is loud when I walk. You hear a swishing sound.
4.0,The cups are really small but love the style.
4.0,"The charms were cute, but they are brighter than antique gold should be."
4.0,Very Stylish hat. Exactly the look I was going for. It is a tad too big for my head. For prospective a fitted new era cap size 8 fits my hear perfectly but this still left some space.  Also it was crushed a big during shipping which left deep wrinkles in the front of the hat.... but i was able to use by iron on high and steam them out. good as new
4.0,Sturdy hat and can get a lot of volume!
4.0,One of my favorite Amazon purchases.  It's relaxed and fun to wear.  Material has held up well
4.0,"Love the hat a little disappointed in the ""gemstones """
4.0,These pants are long in the pelvic area! Makes shorter women like me look bulky in a non-bulky area if that makes sense?. They are thin but comfy and adorable! I would say to be sure to wear a longer shirt and heels and the legs are pretty long too. I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11 almost 120lbs and without heels I look super thick and step all over the bottoms. Still good product just not designed for someone shorter than 5‚Äô3-5‚Äô4
4.0,Pretty snug but to be expected. Attractive sweater despite fit.
4.0,My grandson was so excited to open this gift.
4.0,I purchased this dress in navy blue x-large but should have purchased large.  I get compliments every time I wear this dress.....nicely make if you get it in the correct size.
4.0,Very accurate with size.  My daughter is very slendar and tall.  The &#34;medium&#34; was a perfect fit.  It is also a perfect length.  She is 5'8&#34; and the dress length is at her knees (middle).  It is not a full as pictured on-line but does &#34;swing&#34; while dancing.  I bought the dark blue lace dress and this was very pretty.  The scoop neck provides great coverage while dancing.
4.0,"This dress is very nice for the price, but unfortunately for me, it didn't look that good.<br />I'm busty, and this dress falls right on your chest, so if you don't mind your bust being given very accentuated, then this dress is great!"
4.0,"Beautiful purse which will easily fit a skinny, small laptop and a notebook. It's pretty well structured and look expensive. I'm only giving it four stars because I ordered the pewter and the color was way off so I am returning it. If I had ordered the black one, I probably would have given it 5 stars."
4.0,"The seller quickly reached out to me stating they apologized that my initial watch had a defect and they would happily send another. Great customer service! I will update again when I receive the watch.<br /><br />The watch itself is beautiful, however when I removed the protective covering that came on the watch it also took off the coating... so disappointed."
4.0,Item as pictured! Great wallet and fits my 7plus iPhone. Minus one star due to the writing on the wallet. If anything I wish it was at least a little smaller font.
4.0,"A little thin, but love the material."
4.0,"True to size. Nice, just dont like zipper dont go up all the way"
4.0,"I purchased this hat to wear about a month ago and have been wearing it everyday since. It is lightweight and fits my head great and it very comfortable. I wear a size 7 1/4 in a fitted hat and the large size fits nice and not tight like a lot of regular flex fit hats in a large.<br /><br /> I have worn it outdoors in the rain and the water wicks off of it, and does not penetrate the material. All I did was take it off and shake it once in a while and throw it back on and it kept my head dry.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the top of the hat gets kind of bunchy looking and doesn't keep its form. Not a big deal though I think that's what makes it comfortable and perform like it is supposed to being a fold-able brim.<br /><br />I have since purchased a Yukon Cap from Outdoor Research for the PA winter."
4.0,then picture. received 1 that the seam in the back was coming undone straight out the package.
4.0,"Love this hat. Could be a little smaller, isn‚Äôt very snug on my head. Love the design and color!"
4.0,"My son wears one every day, but the clips break easily causing me to have to tie them."
4.0,I really love this watch band. It looks great with my watch and is very comfortable. Unfortunately i am only giving it 4 stars because the magnetic strip gets stuck to a lot of stuff
4.0,This tunic seems a bit on the large side not as form fitting as it appears in the picture.  I do like it though and wear it often.
4.0,"I like this piece and it looks pretty nice, but there's a couple of places that could have been polished a little more to get the roughness out.  I wish the stones had been set up more or were bigger.  They're set into the metal and don't show and sparkle as much as I thought they would.  It is a very nice design, though. I do like the fact that this is very sturdy; not wimpy at all. 1 3/8 inches (35mm) in diameter.  The bail is 7/16 inch (11mm) long."
4.0,"Great product! The pendant is well-made, detailed, and double-sided. My one complaint is that the necklace cord is quite short. Other than that this is a really good necklace and looks just like the one in the show."
4.0,"It's a great purchase for the price. The only problem I had was that there are faint smudges on the cover, but it's not that noticeable."
4.0,"I purchased three different glasses last minute for a trip, these being one of them.  At first they felt large and weren‚Äôt my favorite.  Once I showed my husband my options he immediately chose these as his favorite.  I kept them and now love them.  I ordered the brown option.  The lense is not dark, which took some getting used to.  But it made using them in indoor spaces a lot easier as well as later in the evening.  I love that they are polarized.  They‚Äôre very light and obviously don‚Äôt feel as sturdy but for the price I can‚Äôt complain! I am now ordering the black option!"
4.0,"I had this wallet/coin purse from Target for years and it just got old and gross and needed replacing. This is the same brand, but they've taken away all the nice little touches, like the zipper and a patterned interior. It took me a lot of hemming and hawing to actually use this less-impressive version of my old wallet, but now that I've had it for several months, it's fine. However, my old one was still better. If the company puts out a spruced up version again, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
4.0,"Very see through, but good for a quick flirt or as a base layer in the winter."
4.0,Downside is there was no indication of sizing (or I missed it) for this hat. It is too large for my head. I gave it to a friend and she loves it.  It is very  nice - perfect blend of nice fabric and sparkle.
4.0,"The colors of this cardigan are really nice with a definite boho feel to it. The fit is a little tricky though. I ordered my typical size large for tops. Although it's comfortable and loose, I feel like it has the potential to slip into frumpy territory real quick. Overall, the cardigan is shapeless. It's definitely not meant to offer warmth or style with the cut of the material, rather it lends to a nice ""finish"" to your outfit. Paired with the right jeans or leggings and a fitted top, it will be pretty cute. Overall, I think it's a solid accent piece for a well rounded wardrobe."
4.0,"I ordered a US 2 :  I am 5'3 with a 28&#34; waist.  The length is perfect but had my waist been just an inch or two bigger, they would be uncomfortable. The material is a little scratchy. Other than that, I love them."
4.0,Just got them and like them. I have narrow feet so they fit a little loose but stays on.
4.0,"I recommend this dress - very cute for curvy figure - I am 4‚Äô11, 130 lbs, DDD Cup and ordered a Smallzc it is pretty snug on my body (which I like) and fits perfectly in my chest with a little room to spare surprisingly.  Better than expected for price point.  I would give it 5 of 5 stars, but I choose to give it 4 out of 5 stars just because it is not a expensive dress or designer brand, so dress isn‚Äôt as sturdy or stuctured or well made as say a WHBM or Calvin Klein dress and I also do not know yet how will it will do in the wash/dry process. But it is well worth it for the money and very flattering on my body type."
4.0,It works great and wady entry and perfect size.
4.0,Finally found these! Theyre my favorite!
4.0,Liked the product just what my daughters needed for ugly Xmas sweater day at school and it had their favorite animal of a unicorn on it.
4.0,"Fits great but is very short (I'm 5'7'', 120 lbs. and got a small)."
4.0,"fit of xxl is tight. I wear a size 13 shoe, still have the pair I came home from the hospitable with and they are a better fit."
4.0,"Love, Love, Love the adjustable ear piece!! All glasses should have those!!! The reader lense is quite blurry but the other two are fine. Glasses have a great fit and are light."
4.0,Little too big for the size
4.0,This set is really cute in person. It was a great thing to add to some Christmas gifts!
4.0,Long sleeves and color
4.0,"Lovely dress, however i am short and the length was weird, too long. I expected it to be little under the knees. I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on altering it so i am sending it back."
4.0,These work perfectly for my husband that works with heavy equipment. With these he doesn't have to worry about ring evulsion. I took a star off because some of the rings are SUPER ugly. But the pack is great because it gives him options.
4.0,"A great looking, nice fitting sweater."
4.0,"We got an XL and out of the bag it didn't look anything like an XL.  It did have a surprising amount of stretch, but I still think it is on the small side.  Once on, it did look good and the orange straps on the back look especially nice.  The chest is a little padded and it does provide some good support.  All in all, it's cute and useful, just a little tight for the size."
4.0,I like the watch and the price was great but it is a little hard to see the skeleton face unless it is in really bright light.
4.0,Keep cold things cole  Nice size
4.0,Great ring for the price .
4.0,Fit perfect. My husband loved them and really liked the warmth. Good quality cotton.
4.0,These are a really nice color and the lenses are polarized and nice and dark. But they feel like they're too low on my nose. I don't think they're going to be comfortable for long-term use.
4.0,"While i really liked the top and the color, I did return this product. I am 5 foot nothing and the way the bottom comes to a point was simply not flattering on me. It made me look even shorter. If it can straight across I would purchase that product."
4.0,I loved it. Only thing is to size up. They do give you a tool to make another notch though.
4.0,Look very nice. Not to weighty on ears.
4.0,"This visor is very soft, easy fitting and stays snug on your head without causing headaches.  Very nice with elastic to fit most anyone.  The front band is also cotton cloth and soft to your forehead.  They only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating was the brim appears much longer in the photo than it actually is.  However, still large enough to provide protection from the sun over front of face."
4.0,Beautiful looking BUT they one par of earring (the first on the model picture) didn't came and instead the send two of the same color of the small skinny one.
4.0,They seem to polish our bells quite well.
4.0,"Its really cute!!! It is cheaply made but not very. Also, it doesn't hang as much as the one in the picture. Nonetheless I like it a lot and it does its job."
4.0,Love the suit however I wish you could buy different sizes in top and bottom-bottoms are too snug.
4.0,Is okay for the price...
4.0,These are tight and high waisted. I love them
4.0,"I bought these for running when it's too cool for shorts and too warm for heavier tights and for that they work very well.  The fit, however, is weird.  I I I normally wear 34-32 pants and the extra-large technically fits.  As other reviewers have said, they are low-waisted.  I thought that maybe this wouldn't be a problem for me as I feel I have to pull my other, name-brand tights, up to my chest to get a proper fit in my crotch.  These tights ride low, butt-crack-showing low.  It could be quite awkward if one wore these riding a bike, say in a triathlon or shirtless.  Additionally, as others have said, the material is quite thin.  They came with an odd liner in the front which shows through the fabric.  The low-cut and revealing fabric aren't issues for me as I do most of my running in the dark.  The low-cut, butt crack thing is just a little odd.  I do like the colored strip down the side.<br />I debated with giving these four or five stars.  I considered five stars since for the price, one shouldn't expect too much and they do what I bought them for.  I gave it four stars simply because of the low cut.  Maybe the asian cut isn't the best for the North American market.  Would I buy these again?  Yes."
4.0,"I like the shawl poncho but it feel a bit scratchy, perhaps some wool?  It is fashionable with the collar.  I do wish it was connected at the sleeves as sometimes I find it hard to find the right fit.  The color is a nice gray and does go with any color of clothes you wear under it.  I am short so was worried about the length but I think it fits good.  Overall, I do like it and wear it often and like the collar look.  Other colors would be nice."
4.0,The skirts are very fitted. They are exactly what I needed. I have already purchased 4 more. I prefer not to dry my skirts so they will not draw up.
4.0,"I love these! They're warm, soft, comfy, stretchy, etc...but everything sticks to them. You have to carry around a lint roller to get the hairs and dust and fuzz and stuff that winds up on them.<br /><br />Also, shout out to short people...I'm 4'11"" and they go up past my belly button but you can't really tell that...the length to my feet is pretty good. So if you're worried about length, I'd say go for it."
4.0,"Necklace arrived on time and came in very nice packaging with a small silver care cloth for continued shine.<br />I like how small and discreet this monogrammed necklace is. It allows me to keep my loved one‚Äôs memory close while not drawing a lot of attention or questions. The chain is slightly chunky for how small and dainty the monogrammed heart is, but not a deal breaker. And it has a nice shine/reflection to it."
4.0,"I really liked this dress but I'm 5'2"" and 130lbs and it was too long for me. great fit otherwise just didn't want to spend the money hemming it and I'm not big on platform shoes!"
4.0,"I got this for a Disney trip but it will still be wearable after (with different shoes lol). It is an actual wrap dress but there is a lot of fabric so size down if you want it fitted. I got the XL as a L wasn‚Äôt available in this color, but I think even a M would have been fine. The ties are very long, but I did them around me a few times and you can make it as tight as you want. It‚Äôs very stretchy and soft- I will get in another color!"
4.0,Bigger than expected but still cute.. Tag in back is a little lopsided and button to clasp closed a little big..but overall happy
4.0,Very light weight but feel well made. I found them perfect for long hikes
4.0,"Bought these as party favors for a 4 year old summer party.  These were a big hit with the kids.  Quality is ok but not great, which is fair given the cheap price.  They ended up being exactly what I expected/wanted."
4.0,"I got these Athlefit hiking sandals for my 6-year old for a spring break trip to the beach. They arrived quickly and are exactly as pictured and described. The sole is thick, non-marking but not too heavy for her. They were easy for her to get on and off. They style is super cute and the closed-toe is perfect for the playground. That said, they are very wide and about 0.5-1 size too large, though I ordered her typical shoe size. If I were to order these again, I would size down. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a well made, functional shoe for a great price!"
4.0,I ordered an XL for my size 14/16 frame and they were a bit tight and short.  Go one size larger.
4.0,"Warm and cozy! I like that even as a large women it‚Äôs still a firm fitting coat, so I don‚Äôt look like a sack with a head like most plus size coats fit. Good job"
4.0,The earrings are really cute. My 8 and 9 year old great nieces went crazy over them. They have very bright colors and cute designs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they didn't come with earring backs. I keep extra at my house so they were able to wear them right away
4.0,"Too Long. Fit fine but over my knee. OK under long pants, bueno absurd for wear with shorts."
4.0,"I like how cute these Easter baskets are. They come compressed which is understandable, but they seems a little floppy. I have each one open I‚Äôm hoping they will be sturdy enough for out egg hunt this Easter. They baskets are nice and roomy without being excessively large for little ones. All things considered, I‚Äôm pleased with my purchase."
4.0,FIt well and seem well made. Won't be until winter that I use them so hard to evaluate howwell they'll last.
4.0,"Like the product, but I ordered medium and received extra large! Now I have to start over with my order!"
4.0,It will make a good fishing hat.
4.0,"This is a good product and fills my needs effectively.  The one caveat is that the carabiners are VERY light plastic, one broke or off the box (self closing spring) just crunched on the first opening.  This is not a big deal though as the rest of the apparatus is strong and reliable and carabiners are a dime a dozen."
4.0,"Its nice, but after a few washes you can tell the material was losing some of its luster."
4.0,"The perfect, stylish bag!  Just the right size for your laptop and a notebook or two. Sturdy straps. Nice solid finish on the overall bag. Could use an inside or outside zippered pocket, but overall I love it!"
4.0,"Chemical fiber composition seems more, do not like"
4.0,"I usually get a small when ordering open front cardis like this because I am slightly on the petite side (5'4&#34;, 140) and I tend to drown in anything bigger. But I went ahead and ordered a medium this time and I'm really glad I did. It fits perfectly so be aware that these aren't like the oversized shawls -- they are pretty true to size.<br />I like the fabric. It's softer than cotton and has a lot of stretch to it. The elbow pads are a little asymmetrical when comparing right to left, but that's probably something only I will ever notice. It's also easily remedied by pulling a sleeve up or down on one side.<br />Overall it's a great fit, great feel, comes down past my butt so I can wear it with leggings =) and I'm happy with it for what I paid. The elbow pad placement is the only thing that kept me from giving five stars."
4.0,My daughter loves it fits well
4.0,Could have been a little more loose but it worked zipper tends to come down a little bit if it was looser it probably wouldn‚Äôt
4.0,The galaxy print was vivid and perfect for the space then event we were going to.  The fir was very snug.  I could have easily gone up a size (maybe two).
4.0,Should of measured.  Way to smalll.  Laces were fine.
4.0,"Super cute PJs, I got them for my nephew for Christmas (he loved them). Straight out the package they felt a little scratchy and had some lose threads (why I took a star) but after a small trim and a trip in the wash they looked and felt awesome"
4.0,"These gloves are amazing!<br />I love how soft and comfortable they are. I also like how feminine they look and the little design gives it some style. These gloves also allow you to use your touch screen phone with the gloves on which I was not expecting! A very nice little touch to the product.<br /><br />The only con I can think of is that the gloves fit smaller then expected. I recommend buyers to go a size up then what you think you should get, especially if you want to wear layers underneath the gloves then go two sizes up."
4.0,The actual stone is well carved and I really like it.  The cord on the other hand broke the first time wearing it so I bought a new chord and it works like a charm.  I would suggest they improve the cord and then you will have a 5 star pendant.
4.0,confortable!
4.0,"I like the shoe. It's a great basic pump. I have a narrow foot so I do have a gap in the front, but my friend who wear the same size and has a &#34;normal&#34; size 9 foot the shoe fit perfectly. I had to add a shoe insert at the ball of my foot to make the shoe fit properly."
4.0,Great and real snug. The socks make wearing my vibram shoes much more comfortable and its quite cool to walk in
4.0,"Royal blue color is true royal blue.  Size is perfect for wallet, phone and lip gloss.  Decent quality for price."
4.0,I like the shape and fit of these sunglasses.  They don‚Äôt look like<br />Bifocal readers!!
4.0,very cute tankini and I would wear to the beach and then just put my rash guard long sleeve shirt on over the top when snorkeling
4.0,"These are super cute and comfy! however, they do run small, so I would suggest buying a size larger than you normally wear. They arrived just two days after I placed my order. I would order these again for the right occasion."
4.0,It wasn't as nice as in the photo but the person who received it thought it was pretty good.
4.0,Very pretty necklace it‚Äôs not to be worn too much tho definitely gotta take it off at night
4.0,Very cute but belt would fit an adult.
4.0,Easy to put on but sometime the prong that holds the jewels get caught in clothes.
4.0,I was super excited to wear this bc of the pockets and the elegance but unfortunately the dress was lacking pockets and had a weird amount of extra fabric like they we just forgotten and the line was mismatched but other than that I loved everything else
4.0,"Nice top but it was too large/wide. I'm 5'4&#34; and 117 lbs and bought a small. Wish I would have returned it, but waited too long. Just sold it at a garage sale for $2 instead."
4.0,Cute sweater yup shirt. Ran a little bigger than I expected it to. The color is also a little brighter in person then I expected but it is still really nice. Seems to be made of good quality material. Thin enough to wear on warmish days. The bunny on gives an extra cute factor!
4.0,Looks soooooo good. I love this shirt
4.0,"They are very small, thought they were big backpacks üéí but they are big enough to put small personal things not books for school. Overall they are cute and yes I would buy again."
4.0,"Runs a little small, but it's still a great jacket."
4.0,It is a lighter pink one than it looks in the picture.
4.0,Gift for my grand daughter.  Haven't heard any complaints.
4.0,I bought a pair of Oakley glasses and needed a way to keep them from sliding off my head because the temples  do not hook behind your ears. The Ear Hooks  work  to address this issue.  The Straps are quite adequate but  I think the kind that attach closer to the hinge might be a little easier to take on and off for Reading Glasses.  A great deal!
4.0,Bought this as a gift for a teen neighbor and she loved adding it to her key ring!
4.0,"Nice piece. Not as shiny as on the picture, but still looks good."
4.0,Really pretty for the price. Altered the straps to be shorter. Ordered a size up due to these reviews and it fit well enough.
4.0,Color was not what I thought
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7-150 bought size L in military green.<br />Love it!!!!<br />Looks and feel great, except for the fact that the fabric is 0 stretch which makes it hard to sit or move in it. Would have put 5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for the lack of stretch.<br />I‚Äôll recommend to buy one size up to give you more room.<br />Note: it‚Äôs very long but you can always trim the franges to the desired length."
4.0,I love it.  I wish it had pockets.  I will probably buy in other colors.
4.0,Comfortable but I thought the pants would be same material as top.<br />Pants were made of a thin flannel material.  I was expecting fleece pants also.
4.0,"My critiques with the product are solely due to my body not the product itself.<br />The bras are cute, came as shown in a nice little box. But if you are a person with side boob, these aren't for you. They do not have underwire but they do have the side support which does nothing to contain that and instead bows out because it doesn't have that additional containment underwire gives. To comfortably wear them, you need them down low on your ribcage (like near the bottom of mine) and it gives as much support as a cheap sports bra like that.  And if you have belly weight, there's a bit of a rolling issue with the band in front. Still workable, still cute, but they are strictly around the house for me as there is far too much adjusting for public wear. Again, this is all for MY body type not the bras themselves. If your breasts are all contained at your front and perhaps more pear shape vs busted hourglass with extra minutes like myself? These are probably great for you. It's why I didn't give a lower rating because the issues are more operator error than product itself and I will not slander a rating just because of that but I will warn others who want to know how they fit on people vs a model."
4.0,Most of them aren't the length they appear in the pictures but still nice.
4.0,"** I am,writing this review under my fiance's account*** The only reason I give it four stars is because, the material is on the sheer side. I did get the white dress so,that didn't help. However I just wore a tank underneath and I was good to go so I am glad I did get that color with the easy fix. I love how it flares out under the boob area which, helps hide my belly. I felt comfortable and beautiful in it. Yes, it is not something you would find on the rack at Saks however, I felt like a million bucks! The material does make me think of a &#34;swim suit&#34; and the flowers do kind of look like &#34;water color&#34; yet, I love the symplicity of it. The material does help conceal the effects you get from the hot/sweaty Florida summer weather. And best part... it has POCKETS!!!!!!!!!<br /> To me it's worth every penny!!!"
4.0,"Good company, love the clothes."
4.0,"I think that this TSA compliant carry-on quart-sized bag is a good item to have, especially if you travel frequently.  I generally use zip-loc bags designed for TSA travel; however, they do rip and tear.  As noted in the description, these are an &quot; upgrade from using resealable ziplock bags that constantly rip.&quot;  This statement is certainly true!<br /><br />The bag is formed to fit quite a few travel-sized bottles, plus more.  It appears to be well-made and the zipper has worked as expected.  I'm confident that this product will last for years to come; however, if it doesn't, I definitely will use their lifetime guarantee policy noted.  I have stored this with my other &quot;vacation&quot; items.<br /><br />If purchasing, I would recommend the two pack instead, it is a better value.  You will definitely save money over time using this bag versus the zip-loc bags purchased from the supermarket."
4.0,For the price I have no complaints. It's an inexpensive piece to wear with fashion.
4.0,Cute dress but it is a bit see thru
4.0,"My 2 year old niece loves it and still plays with them several months later. As noted, the accoutrements fall off and they are very slick - guaranteed to slip on non carpeted floors.I attached sole grippers and they work well on all floor types"
4.0,"Women in my family having freezing cold feet from 60 degrees and below, basically, so I'm always looking for ways to keep my feet warm while I'm at home. These are thick and cozy and definitely keep my feet not cold. I haven't ever felt like my feet were hot in them, but that is without shoes. With reasonably insulated boots, I would think your toes would be pretty toasty. Keep in mind, too, that these socks are hella thick, so you need some extra rooms in your boots if wearing for that purpose."
4.0,"Smooth feel to the shirt. Very solid, no problem wearing it in public- very comfortable and not sheer. Not overly tight but it is long."
4.0,When I was young my mother always wore a dainty jade bangle.  When I saw this bangle it instantly brought back those wonderful childhood memories. The bangle is a beautiful apple green jade.  I was slightly disappointed because I ordered a small and it was still too big for my hands. The bangle was also extremely wide and heavy. If you have a larger hand and wrist it would look better on.  It is still a lovely bangle.  #jadebangle<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,Good for wearing under other clothing.
4.0,Great shirt and print only if they didn't come so small
4.0,"They look and fit great, but I will say that the soles of them are not as tough as they probably could be. I feel like I'm going to have to buy another pair of boots after only having this pair for a month or two. I suppose that they are pretty good for the price though."
4.0,"Had some issues with shipping but seller promptly replied offering to resend or refund. I'm glad I opted for resend, they're beautiful!! Only complaint is the flares are still small enough you can slip them in and out without removing the backing. Would still recommend üëç"
4.0,"This is a really cute and comfortable dress but it is not for me.  It was too short for what I am comfortable with at my age.  I am 5'2"" and it hit at my knees.  I was hoping it would cover my knees.  I sized up for it to be looser in the arms and bust.  If it had been longer I would have kept it but returned because of the length."
4.0,It was actually bigger than I expected and it has nothing on the bottom to keep it open and flat. It can easily hold a book and lunch which is what I bought it for to go through work security.
4.0,"My wife needed new goggles for when she goes swimming a few mornings per week.  Having gotten a few sessions in, here are our thoughts on the goggles (Please note that these are for the goggles only and NOT the earplugs, which she did not use):<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Fit: These should fit any shaped face well, as the tightness is adjustable on both sides.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Comfort: Based on her comments, these are more comfortable than her prior Speedo pair given the placement of the interior rubber piece that surrounds each eye.  Additionally, she liked the placement of the nose bridge moreso than her prior pair of goggles.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Water Leakage:  On the contrary, these goggles did tend to leak water in (even when it is worn tighter than normal).  It‚Äôs not a ton of water, but moreso than you would hope after swimming a few laps.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Look: I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because they have UV protection, but they give a very strong reflection, so be mindful of that if it‚Äôs something that could bother you.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great value for inexpensive goggles.  We‚Äôll dock it a bit for the water leakage, but it‚Äôs certainly a good secondary/backup pair at worst, and recommended to just about everyone for its solid comfort."
4.0,Like this hat a lot!
4.0,"Very comfortable slippers! I really only wear them as slippers, as I don't want to ruin them as shoes worn to the grocery store or something. Solid bottoms but they do make my feet sweat if I wear them for more than a few hours at a time."
4.0,Kinda hard to close but once I got it it's been really comfortable in my ear. Definitely gonna buy more for my other piercings.
4.0,It was exactly as show picture I love it so much
4.0,Cute and comfy cool
4.0,They're cute....feel like plastic but they're only for church so it's okay. They are a tad big but that's room for growth.
4.0,"Touch screen hardly works, if at all. But the warmth these gloves provide is top notch. I roof during the winter and when i put these on my hands instantly begin to warm up. But its hard to pick up small things and use my fingers because the gloves are so thick. If you are looking for a pair of gloves that will keep your hands warm and thats it, these are the ones."
4.0,Loved the dress but you can definitely size down. I tend to wear large and it was too baggy and it also has a lot of stretch around the waist. Should‚Äôve gotten medium
4.0,Smaller size than expected.
4.0,I wanted a dress for traveling. This hit the mark. It is easy to pack. It is also very comfortable
4.0,Comfortable enough to sleep in . Minimum support. Good value.
4.0,This mask is great! Love the saying! Large coverage on face. Comfortable.
4.0,"I was a little sckeptical when I seen them but to my surprise there really cute, I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments!!!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:980280472451f898b6753452407df4bb]] The UV Protection Arm Sleeves by Gellwhu comes four sets in a package.  The package includes four different pastel colors; grey, lavender, pink and peach.  Each sleeve has a thumb hole to allow my thumb to poke through.  They appear to be a simple cotton light weight fabric material.  Of all the colors, the grey color is the only one that doesn't seem to reach all the way to my armpit like the others do, but it does reach over my knuckles and yet the others do not.  I took my son out for ice cream after school last week and had to sit outside.  It was a very hot day and my left arm was exposed to the sun.  I didn't wear a sunblock and therefor got myself a light sunburn.  So I decided to keep a couple of sets of sleeves in my car.  The next time we went out for ice cream, and had to sit out side again, I pulled out my sleeves from my car and it helped prevent a sunburn effectively.  I'm not really sure if there is any real UV protecting material on these sleeves because it doesn't feel like there is.  They are like taking along portable cotton sleeves and using them just in case the need arises.  Similar to wearing a long sleeved shirt that has removable sleeves.  I think for this reason, they do work to prevent the sun's rays from burning my skin and I would recommend them.<br />I received the Gellwhu Arm Sleeves at a discount, in exchange for an unbiased opinion.  This review is 100% my own."
4.0,"I like the color and fabric.  I wish the ties were longer so I could tie it in front, but otherwise it‚Äôs a nice apron."
4.0,Really nice and looks great but was smaller than I expected
4.0,"Really cute tank, but I normally wear a women's 18/20 and this is way too snug."
4.0,Pretty simple & straightforward design.
4.0,"These are great. They keep your hands warm and you can utilize the phone screen. You will have to expose your thumb or finger if you choose to do the fingerprint security on most functions. All in all, they work great for me."
4.0,"The shirt is super soft, fits perfect. However, the picture displays a shiny/sparkly rose gold color, but the shirt is just a flat, basic color. Still cute, but wanted the sparkle."
4.0,Nice tote bag ! Big and didn't look cheap at all well made .
4.0,They‚Äôre attractive and seem quite sturdy. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to travel with them yet so don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôll hold up.
4.0,"really good, but its small"
4.0,"Excellent Milanese Loop.  I have a Moto 360 46mm Gen 2.  It came with the leather band (very fashionable, but always worried about how it will hold up with daily use).  I installed the TRUMiRR band on my 360 with ease.  The magnet is very strong.  It has been easy to tighten and loosen depending on what I am doing for the day.<br /><br />Doesn't cause any issues going thru metal detectors at the airport TSA.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a replacement band for their android wear watch.<br /><br />Updated 08/24/16: I received this product in May.  So about 90 days later and I am afraid it might be wearing out prematurely.  I do wear my Moto 360 Gen 2 constantly.  Looks like the connection to the lug is separating on the left side and the rubber like material is wearing unevenly on the magnetic clasp. (See Pictures)<br /><br />TRUMiRR, What is the warranty on this product?"
4.0,"I honestly purchased this jacket for an 80's party and the jacket was a hit. It fit perfectly (a little short, but not out of the norm). Comfortable and not stiff. I will wear this again!"
4.0,the boots are heavy and very warm
4.0,At first they are really tight and painful but after a few washes they fit fine. Make sure to wash on delicate and in a garment bag.
4.0,Very cool lookin watch... But it's kind of annoying having to wait 3 secs while the time comes up thru the little animation... just sayin.
4.0,I got this dress last minute for my baby shower. It‚Äôs literally came in the mail the day before and I‚Äôm so happy I got it because it fit sooo good and looked even better ! Highly recommend
4.0,"Good comfortable shoes. We will see how durable, but so far, so good. I like the design."
4.0,In all fairness my husband is 6‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äô and hence why they could have been too short. But they are nice.
4.0,"Great necklace; I would have liked it more if it was on a leather string... but overall very nice to look at, color true to picture, and arrived quickly. Sometimes I even feel the healing powers ;)"
4.0,"Fits great, quality shirt"
4.0,It's beautiful!! 4 stars since i just got it dont know if it'll tanish or not.
4.0,No keys :)
4.0,This ring is really nice looking. It fits a little snug so size up. the runes are all engraved individually into the ring. It has a wood inner ring and is very comfortable. This is a great gift and well worth the money spent.
4.0,"Fits my 9+ inch wrist fine, material is soft but not flimsy and seems durable. Only issue I have is because of how the moveable keeper is done, it doesn't leave much room for the watch to fit. If your watch has a long lug to lug length it could have trouble fitting at at a minimum leave no room to adjust it on the strap."
4.0,"I am not sure why people are saying that the hair elastics don't stay on. I put a cheapie dollar-store hair tie on the bracelet I purchased, and it stays on just fine. This is a gift for my daughter, and she is going to love it!"
4.0,Great fit. Love the material.  Great value.
4.0,Love the adjusatble straps.  Fits the way I  expected. Easy  to machine wash but cup padding doesn't stay in place.  Wish it was tacked in.
4.0,Fit as expected. Very comfortable & looks very nice for the price
4.0,Shorts could be longer but over all a nice fit. Just be careful to look at the sizing chart. I usually wear a L but it showed my measurements as XL
4.0,I would get a size larger. Got a large and it was a bit too snug.
4.0,Much bigger than I thought it would be. It had a funny smell to it but other than that the purse itself looked beautiful.
4.0,Perfect size . The color is very nice
4.0,Fabric is fantastic.
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress, especially for a working professional.  The material is thick; definitely not cheap, A good investment for the price. Unfortunately, the size 8 I ordered was too tight, which made the dress rise.  I would definitely size-up."
4.0,"Order a bigger size cause I ordered my actual size, well now I have a shirt that doesn't fit.."
4.0,"For the price, this anklet is a great value. I‚Äôve worn it constantly for over 6 months, never taking it off to shower, swim, etc."
4.0,"Received as stated from amazon. Was happy with the quality of chain  , was for a diamond pendent that the chain was poor quality ,  didn't want to spend a lot of money for solid gold, my only concern is that it can't be worn in chlorine . I like to where my necklace without changing daily , that is why only 4stars, otherwise wonderful."
4.0,It's a very attractive band. Pretty well constructed and durable
4.0,Touch finger is very tricky hard to use.
4.0,Very pretty.  Better than expected for the price.
4.0,"I like it but there's a kind of gather toward the bottom, so beware. It tends to make one look on the hippy side.  It is a bit on the small side of me, a size 10-12."
4.0,"I love cotton but now 100% cotton is very rare in the market now. So I am really glad to find a pajama made with cotton without any synthetic fabric. I like cotton because it is breathable, soft and does not cause skin allergies which is good for sensitive skin. I love the yellow check pattern and the design of this pant. It has 2 pocket for my phone. The elastic waist makes it easy to adjust and pull on. The best thing I like is the additional stay stitch- it holds the elastic so it stays after washing. This is a comfortable pajama pant that I would love to wear everyday especially in hot summer weather."
4.0,I like they were made in the USA.<br />I also like the foot support they offer.<br />They seem durable and easy to clean off.
4.0,The shoes are very cute and comfortable. I ordered one size up based on the reviews. I normally wear US size 8 so I ordered EUR size 40 instead of 39. The shoes arrived quickly and I realized it‚Äôs really true to size and I shouldn‚Äôt have sized up. Stick yo your size when ordering.
4.0,"I did not get this item for free for my review.  This product for the price is excellent.  I have been traveling abroad a lot for the last three years and needed a quality passport holder because I was constantly bending my passport in my pockets sitting on it.  Very selective of appearance, but spend savey, I decided to get onto Amazon and look at some options.  Looking for weeks, I stumbled onto this one and decided to buy it due to the reviews and low cost.  When I received it, like others was supprised of the look and the quality of the product.  Nice buy."
4.0,It's a nice suit
4.0,Love the material although it is a bit clingy it does stretch. Just is more fitted than I like. Great colors.
4.0,Very nice pair of earrings but the picture is misleading. They are much thinner than the picture depicts.  I chose the earrings because they were a little thicker in the picture but I'm happy with them. They are nice & lite and very pretty.
4.0,"I like it , Color and look the same like picture. i am happy with it."
4.0,"Love the size, quality and look"
4.0,I would say it fit just a SMIDGE small for a medium. I was hoping for a looser fit but definitely still wear it
4.0,"...that's the most apt descriptor.  They're not gorgeous, not actually cute, even, but interesting enough in their simplicity to appeal to me.  Maybe they look a little like a lady bug...<br /><br /> I don't like earrings with the lobster closures (hinged snap back) because they are harder to insert in the ear and sometimes feel like they snag on the way through.  But a little lotion on the ear lobe helps."
4.0,I would have liked to pay less for it but the case is fun and functional. I went on an island beach vacation and I wasn't afraid to set it on wet surfaces. So far it's holding up well.
4.0,Super cute. My kids Love!
4.0,These reading glasses have made it easier to see my computer display again. And it's cheaper than those ones I had bought before. I want to buy another one for my husband but this one is only designed for the women. I will recommend this to my friends!
4.0,"I liked the dress I should have ordered the M size I though, no one bigger size like I read, just order your usual size and if you are not overweight this should fit perfect."
4.0,"I use em every day. Nice molding and good threads, don't slip."
4.0,Muy bonito comodo
4.0,"These earrings are a lot bigger than expected. The fringe feels a little cheap, but overall they're a good statement piece and dress up anything basic and black. Very unique."
4.0,"Love the color, love the material, love the style.....just a lot smaller than advertised. I require a 16 and recieved a dress more sized for a 10-12. I‚Äôll keep it as I‚Äôm still loosing weight and will wear it in a few months."
4.0,"This is a nice bag, yet it is very large and a little stout smelling. I returned because it was too large for an everyday purse."
4.0,Beauiful piece of costume jewelry for the price!!!
4.0,It's a little thin.  I have a couple of these hats.  Nothing keeps me warmer in the cold tho.  Great for the price!  I recommend.
4.0,They are okay but not as great as I thought they would be.
4.0,Product description/photo implies it's a bead rather than a photo under glass.  Still cute though.
4.0,"It fits perfect! I prefer a more distressed and thinner fabric, but I never wear shorts and after slipping these on one hot afternoon I  nonchalantly walked into my living room and laid down wearing them instead of my jeans.. it took my man a minute but after he noticed I was wearing them he said- ‚ÄúOH MY GOD YOU LOOK SOOOOO HOT WITH SHORTS ON!! WHY DON‚ÄôT YOU EVEE WEAR SHORTS?‚Äù<br />Well, I‚Äôm pale as heck, that‚Äôs why. But apparently my booty looked pretty dang good in these shorts because he couldn‚Äôt keep his hands off of me! They have a good amount of stretch and I ordered the perfect size with enough space in case I‚Äôm bloated from that time of the month. They aren‚Äôt hemmed at the bottom do you can unfold them if you feel they‚Äôre too short of roll then up a bit higher!"
4.0,"nice but fits small, about 2 sizes"
4.0,cute love it looks good with outfits
4.0,I like very much but it is too large for me
4.0,The resin housing is easy to damage. You‚Äôll need patience and steady hands. A backlit magnifying glass helps too.  The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the angle they stick out of the watch (almost 90 degrees)
4.0,Very nice stitching!
4.0,"Fits snug but if you want a fitting look, it was worth the purchase. Gives a sexy Mrs. Claus vibe."
4.0,"It was transparent, and I cut off the little pom-poms that were on the sleeves. It's so sort I wouldn't wear it even as a mini dress. I'm 5'4, 145 lbs., and got a medium. I don't mind the transparency, a tank top fixed that, but the length was my main issue. It goes past my stomach, but it might as well of just been a long blouse. I had wanted to wear it with skinny jeans and boots. Over all it's still cute, and it fits as a blouse. I like it as an outfit maker with a jacket."
4.0,It‚Äôs fitted nice but it‚Äôs smaller around the arms .
4.0,I ordered this as a gift for my daughter and received wrong size. Order a 34C and received a 36C...the sticker on the package said 34c but the tags on the bras all have a tag of 36C!<br /><br />Update:<br />Received correct size today and it fits my daughter perfectly.
4.0,"Read the comments about size before you buy. I'm a 170 lb, 5 foot 7inch guy and the large fits well. I would have normally bought a medium. The pockets have this ""shine"" that I'm not sure I like."
4.0,"It's a good first-time collar, but it's a little itchy on your neck and can make you sweat underneath it which makes it very uncomfortable since you can't adjust the size"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, if you are in between sizes get one size smaller, (Unless you are larger in the bust area, I would say go 1 size smaller)  the dress is incredibly beautiful!  :)"
4.0,I love the comfort and way they hold up after many washings.
4.0,My niece loved it......
4.0,"This toiletry bag is nice but I was disappointed when it arrived. Other reviewers described it as big, but it's not- it's definitely a standard size. I was not able to fit my full size shampoo bottles in it, I wasn't even able to fit a mouthwash bottle in it. It is made of a sturdy material and the zipper seems sturdy as well. Overall, I'm  happy with the bag but disappointed that it isn't actually as big as described."
4.0,These are super cute boots. However a little tight on my calves (i have huge calves)
4.0,Top too tight.  The front reached the floor.  Would cost as much to have it hemmed.
4.0,"The sweatshirt is soft and very comfortable.  After reading the many comments about the product, I ordered it one size larger than what I usually order and it fit nicely."
4.0,Not flattering on me. Slightly deceiving  picture looks like it would cover full torso but it‚Äôs short and scrunch in the middle think of it as a crop top
4.0,than it appears but i like the T option
4.0,It‚Äôs ok if you like low front.  And long  I don‚Äôt. Gave it away
4.0,I bought this for my granddaughter because she loves ‚Äúsparkly‚Äù jewelry and begs to wear all of mine. She was so excited when I told her that this was her very own diamond rings. Very nice for the price!
4.0,I love these sandals!  They are cuter than they look online!
4.0,Item didn‚Äôt light up notified sender a replacement was sent right away
4.0,I like this ring very nice for the price
4.0,"I love this jacket because of the soft, comfortable material, the length and the bright coral color.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I believe the sizing is off a bit (or maybe I'm fatter than I think :).  I ordered an extra large, but it still will not button comfortably around my waist.  Most items sized extra large, I have no problem with that.  Also, the buttons are a bit large and difficult to get through the openings.  But I'm nit picking. I love this jacket and will order another one in the near future now that I know about the sizing."
4.0,"These shorts are beautifully soft and comfortable. I also LOVE the pockets! The only issue I have with them is that the waist is 3-4 inches too big so they shift as I'm wearing them. Since I sew, I'll just be taking them in a bit (they fit well in the butt and thigh) but you may want to size down."
4.0,"These mimic the chunky plastic frame look of the Oakley Sutro glasses but are closer to drugstore brand quality.  When setting them down, you can see that the arms don't sit flatly on a surface (photo) with no capacity for adjustment.  I have an XL noggin, and despite the enormous visual statement at the front, they are narrow at the back (9cm, photo).  The frame has to flex a bit to get around my head, and the arm tips dig into my head a little.<br /><br />The seller's product photos adequately illustrate the look when worn -- basically, a ski-goggle aesthetic made in sunglasses form.  Fashion is in the eye of the beholder, but I won‚Äôt be wearing these out on the town.  My thought was to have them protect a large amount of my face from the wind and sun for winter sports like cross-country skiing and tubing.  I've taken them out once in sub-zero weather to snowblow my driveway, and they were acceptable with some mild to moderate fogging.<br /><br />On the plus side, the maker boosts the value proposition with a few extras like a microfiber bag, cloth, retainer cord, and glasses screwdriver.  All in all, I suppose it's a reasonable amount of kit for the price.  Just don‚Äôt expect that these will compare to their name-brand brethren."
4.0,"Wish it were a bit bigger, but Grandson loves it anyway."
4.0,Wish they'd make them in cotton
4.0,"The ties seem fine, haven‚Äôt unwrapped them. The box was barely closed and a mess though. Was pretty disappointed and surprised I received the ties after all that!"
4.0,"I like the fact that the quality of the product is good (the fabric, the clear part and the adjustable ear strings).<br />Having said that, the product didn‚Äôt work for me. I couldn‚Äôt use it for what I wanted. I am a teacher and I wanted my students to be able to see my mouth while teaching. The clear part of the mask kept tightening to my mouth.<br />Maybe for other people it will work!<br />I contacted the seller after asking for a return and they were nice and kind in their communication with me. They offered me a % refund on my purchase and I could keep the masks and give them away to whom I think they would be useful."
4.0,I like the way they fit on my face but they definitely could have been smaller.  The reason I got them was because my old ones keep sliding down my nose and while these ones are definitely better they too slid.
4.0,Wrong color and texture for a man.  Gave it to my girlfriend.  She loves it.  Says it works very nicely.  Thanks.
4.0,"I was looking for a waterproof warm jacket at a good price for my active 2yo daughter and came across this cute jacket. It def did its job! Love the design and cute pink color, the jacket matched the description, decent quality for the price."
4.0,Fits Adult size (looked small like kids but fit my face fine and I have a round shaped face. Box was crazy damaged and was worried about it being scratched but was perfect in the box. Great for the price! Will probably buy more!
4.0,Runs small. My daughter used the sizing chart and the shirt was too small. Order one size up.
4.0,"The petite fit great, and the weight was perfect for a trip to some cooler temps, where I could wear this alone, or under a lighter rain jacket."
4.0,Love this sweater and I get so many compliments when I wear it! It's oversized and off the shoulder just as pictured.
4.0,lighter sweatshirt material I have a larger bust so every thing fits tight there but love this sweatshirt! so comfortable
4.0,Beautiful watch. Would have been 5 stars if the crystals had more Sparkle. However the white dial looks really sharp on this watch
4.0,Very like this dress. Run a little loose but look exactly like the picture. Thick fabric. Perfect for fall wearher.
4.0,"Overall this is a very good watch. I would probably be willing to pay $25, so for $10, it's an awesome deal. My first impression was that it's a little bit smaller than I was thinking. It wasn't so small that it was a problem though, and I actually came to like it later on. One problem with it being small is that it ends up slightly offset on my wrist when I have to use the hole for a larger wrist. That wasn't a huge issue though. One thing that I didn't like is that the light button also serves other functions in some modes, which can make it hard to use in the dark. That's another thing that I got used to and didn't mind later. It is definitely waterproof; it works fine for swimming, I never did try showering though. I do have to say though, don't mess with the screws. I unscrewed the back, just cause I like to look at what's inside things. I thought I got the screws all the way in, but apparently I didn't, because I went swimming later that day and broke it with getting water inside. So it's waterproof as long as you don't unscrew the back at all. So overall, it's a great watch for someone that isn't looking to spend a lot, and doesn't need a ton of functions."
4.0,I dont usually like clothes I buy ok online but this one was great. Great for great color great price
4.0,"Very simple earrings, as described.  Not as shiny as I expected but ok"
4.0,"The boot is nice and sturdy. I‚Äôd say the sizing runs closer to the smaller size. I got the 9-10 for my son who just moved into size 9, and they‚Äôre just a little big. I did get the wrong color, like a few other reviewers. I got blue and black instead of grey and red, but I don‚Äôt want to send them back and risk just getting the wrong color again."
4.0,"Bought it for my niece who loves batman with a passion. The mask does not fit on an adults head, I wonder why if it is made for children. But! Cape looks nice and the color of the pink was beautiful!<br />I would buy it again!"
4.0,I love it because you use the material that will protect the kids for getting cold in a cold weather
4.0,"Super soft material! The button up top isn‚Äôt as long as the V neck, making my 23wk prego belly pop out of the bottom. Cute!"
4.0,They look just like the photo but one is smaller then the other and is very tight.
4.0,"The tie turned out to be darker in color than it appeared on my screen, but better darker than lighter.  Fair price, fast service."
4.0,4 stars Because it‚Äôs too large for my face. I do have a small face so a simple tuck on each side by the ear corrected the problem. It‚Äôs not KN 95 compliant- I wear it with another small mask talked inside. It‚Äôs really beautiful and I get a ton of compliments on it!
4.0,"These work fine as clip-on earrings, and should last if not abused, but do hurt after being on for a few hours."
4.0,Not all letters on both sides are visible
4.0,"I love this dress. I do wish it was a bit longer but it's perfect for the summer. Also, POCKETS!"
4.0,These glasses are very light and makes your vision sharper.  The only down side is that the lenses are a little short and allow light to come in from the bottom.
4.0,"As described, true to size.  It was purchased as a costume, for that purpose the quality was good."
4.0,Love it.. order your size..
4.0,"Fun take on a basic black one piece. I ordered an XL because I was afraid it would run small and I am glad I did. It seemed short in the torso for me, but the XL helped make up for that. I normally wear a M/L in swimsuits. Nice thick fabric and not see through. Great for the price."
4.0,this item is very nice for the price. it does run small and it plastic but for the price it cant be beat! just make sure to have some kind of extender at home
4.0,"Durable materials and zipper, great size bag for a weekend"
4.0,Very cool! Great price!
4.0,"At first I was a little iffy about this dress, but the more I look at it, the more it grows on me. I was not expecting it to be so large up top, but I think it kind of actually works - I like the look. I ordered an XL, which is my normal size, and I do have a bigger chest. Normally, even with XL things will ""just"" fit in the chest or even be a bit too small. That is *not* the case with this dress. I think it could probably handle a chest of any size (though if you are smaller it will definitely hang). The sleeves are VERY loose / a little puffy in the shoulders. So overall, the dress has this look of mixed contemporary club / retro Elvira, and I kind of dig it. You can adjust the drawstring to cinch both the V-neck and the bottom of the dress to make it as long or as short and as plunging as you want. And I put a black bra under mine, because unlike this model, gravity is a thing that exists in my world, and it looked pretty cute. It did come with an odd smell, which came out with washing. If you are in-between sizes, order down and you will be fine."
4.0,"I love the color and all the space inside.  It also has plenty of pockets, and separate interior spaces.  The drawstring closure is a bit stiff, but I figure will loosen up with daily use.  It was a little bigger than I anticipated, but overall, I am satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Fits nicely.  Received compliments when I wore it to work.
4.0,Beautiful ring. 4 star rating only because the setting is tall and the ring feels a bit bulky. Other than that the stones and finish on the ring are perfect and seem to be good quality and sturdy
4.0,Received fast nice looking piece and she liked it. Nice price also
4.0,"Lenses are not as dark green as the photo makes them to appear to be.  Lenses are clear and fit is good.  Go polarized all the way, I'd buy this item again."
4.0,nice shoe  what I expected
4.0,It is designed to keep you cool but you may want a good sports bra and shorts undeethem because the material is lightweight and see through from certain angles.
4.0,"Good shoes! The color was more black than charcoal, but it was a good buy and no regrets!"
4.0,"It's smaller and more cheaply made than I'd hoped, but for the price I can't complain."
4.0,"These are pretty good. Wore them on a daytime cross country flight the other day and they really helped me to get some sleep.  Just  a little light came in around the nose area,  but not enough to really bother me."
4.0,It was for a friend & she loved it.
4.0,Dress is really cute but the fit is a little off on me. I will still wear it but I might have to take it in under the arms. I guess I am a little smaller chested so the under arm fit is a little looser.
4.0,But I love silk next to my skin
4.0,"They are good to work out in, but they attract little hairs and tiny fuzz in the dryer, like a pair of tights."
4.0,Didn't expect high quality.  Purchased as a work hat... overall not disappointed.
4.0,It is cute light weight cotton dress but although it is called  a belted dress it  did not come with belt. I would have given it 5 stars if as advertised.
4.0,"Band is nice and is light weight. This item also includes a very nice tool set to remove links from the band. The included instructions for sizing the band are very poor and are written in broken English. Over all, I would recommend this band for your Fitbit Blaze."
4.0,Absolutely loved it! Almost made me cry it felt and looked so good
4.0,"Not the best print, but we liked them because of the meaning."
4.0,Nice  and warm for morning.  Probably not heated enough for really  damp work boots.
4.0,Feel great just a lil snug But if your a stud you spouse loves the way they look and feel in the bed
4.0,"Nice quality bought this for my costume and was so disappointed when I received it as it is not for short people. Even with some heels this would be way to long. I'm 5'1"" and it was at least 6 inches to long. I didn't have time to have it professionally hemmed so I sent it back ."
4.0,I like this belt but the adjustable piece is very sharp and scratches me all the time. I have very delicate skin as I have found. That‚Äôs my only complaint
4.0,Beautiful. Quality could be a bit better.
4.0,"Good looking, buy at least one size larger than normal."
4.0,"I loved the sweater, I normally buy an XL, but I sized up one size to a XXL to have a comfortable fit and it was way to big. I reordered and sized down a sized to a L and it was perfect!"
4.0,I am buying another one. Thanks
4.0,For the price I I was pleased.  It is quite heavy and has to be tight because of the weight which makes it uncomfortable after an hour or so.
4.0,"It's a cheap scarf and while it looks good, you can tell. But I bought it to stay warm, and it does just that!"
4.0,It was a gift for my mom. She liked them especially that it came with a set of 3 in different sizes for her 3 piercing holes on her ear. They are comfortable.
4.0,"Design is great, wears and washes well. Runs a little small would have gone a size bigger but still looks great on my son."
4.0,Comments suggested this runs small and got the 36/XL which was too big. Returning to get a 34/L which should be perfect. I'm a 34B/36C. Very nice material otherwise.
4.0,My daughter plays soccer and they hold up great!
4.0,The watch was a gift for my wife.  It seem to be a bit snug fit. Otherwise great product
4.0,This dress is for the most part as pictured. The material and seams seem to be good sturdy quality. The fabric feels good against the skin. The only thing I did notice is that the dress is actually longer than the picture and the description show. It has a good stretch to the material and it has a drape affect. I chose the olive color for a bit of a fall theme and the material was great for Texas weather.
4.0,Dainty is the perfect description but also it was exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"Despite the name, these tank tops do not supply compression. The size chart is meaningless. I weigh 130 lbs, bra size 34DDD, and the Small fits me perfectly, with no compression at all. I am disappointed. However, they are silky soft and very comfortable, so I will keep them and wear them."
4.0,"I‚Äôm a very small person (under 5ft and under 100lbs), but this was just too small- even though it‚Äôs a cropped style. I returned it."
4.0,Enjoy wearing Aussie Chillers!!!
4.0,Little small but snug still usable and works for exercise
4.0,keeps me warm in and out doors overall good buy
4.0,Fair quality about what you would it would expect for the price.<br />Seems fairly well made.
4.0,"More or just what we expected for the inexpensive price.  The quality is fine, pretty color, good size.  We ordered them for a boy."
4.0,The jacket was looked great on and the pictures represent exactly how the product looks. However I am usually a women's medium and I ordered a medium and it was too small. Order a size up!
4.0,"I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars, because if it fit, I think it would be my favorite dress. One star off because the sizing is off, it was probably one size too small. The neckline is also a bit lower than expected. Other people said this was stretchy, I don‚Äôt see much stretch in this. Maybe it‚Äôs different material for each pattern? I got ‚ÄúGreen-2‚Äù. It‚Äôs a beautiful dress, though. I would just order a size up."
4.0,Super cute but it's insanely tiny. I even ordered up a size. I gave it to my roommate because it fit her so I guess it wasn't a total loss
4.0,"The hat is very small. There is no stretch to it. The net fits big. Overall its ok, couldn't use the hat"
4.0,"These are the male version of yoga pants but they are not that tight for ""compression"" tights.  Actually, they fit very nicely as ""tights"" and wear well on the upper part over the underwear. I work smooth UnderArmour underwear under the tights. No see through. The tights give more compression on the upper part around the butt and groin.  They need to be pulled up to fit best.  The look is great, slick blue and attractive.  The zipper pocket on the right front is excellent and holds your phone well while running on a treadmill or the street.  I like how they felt warm and then breathed so nicely. I didn't feel overheated with them.  I have compression tights that are ...tight.  These are not quite that. But they are excellent workout tights for men. Look good, professional quality, well made."
4.0,"It was a bit bigger than I expected, but I really love the compartments."
4.0,"Girls' slip-on fashion sneaker is a pretty pink, but has no arch support.  My niece loves them, though."
4.0,"This keychain is beautiful quality! I gave it as a gift. However, I am not sure what the B/K stand for on the circle charm and why you cannot change it. I just removed it and that was fine :)"
4.0,This is a great shirt from NF - I love the black with red and white accents. It doesn‚Äôt have any shape to it though so it can be a bit unflattering on women but I still wear it all the time!
4.0,Muy buena pero tal vez un poco corta. Atenci√≥n las mu√±ecas y brazos grandes...
4.0,"I've been wearing these for a few weeks now as a base layer.  They work great and I like them.  I'm 5'8&#34; and 126lbs and got a small.  The only part I'm not one hundred percent happy with is the torso area.  I was going for a compression shirt and it all is good except for this torso area is not as tight as I would have thought it could be.  Also the length of the torso is maybe normal.  It goes to the top of my jeans.  I would have preferred a longer torso so I could wear it past my waist.  If I tuck it in it stays, but the back will eventually come out.  So great shirts overall.  It's hard to find a shirt that fits just right since we all have different body types."
4.0,"Thr blouse is very feminine, but very very small it doesn't even have darts, made for flat chested girls, not for women. I wish it was a larger size. If ordering, order two sizes larger, like I said it is s very pretty blouse, just very small.  I am keeping it for our 12 yr old granddaughtet"
4.0,"This dress is really cute. I'm 5'1, so it's a little long, and I will need to get it hemmed. It's a great value!"
4.0,My husband really likes these slippers....they are very comfortable and fit good!
4.0,"Although I was sent the incorrect product, I still feel as if the company it was sent from did an exceptional job at keeping with their 100% satisfaction guarantee. Also the jacket runs smaller than normal for more Asia sizes so order 2 sizes or more larger than your normal."
4.0,"I like the costume, just wish the t-shirt was bigger so it fits like on model"
4.0,"This wallet will let you easily carry 4 cards of standard thickness. If you put 5 in there and a couple of thin cards like a business card or insurance card, you will find it hard to carry any cash. US bills are 156 mm x 66mm, so folded in half = 78 X 66. Problem is, the center picket (the deepest) is only 64mm, so even if you can get bills to bottom out, they'll still stick out a little. The problem is, If you have more than a couple of cards in the outside pockets, you can't cram the bills in that far so they stick out even more.  Right now the cash sticks out about 4 mm in mine. That's over and 1/8th of an inch.  Also, a few bills folded is not as stiff as a card, so they bend when you push them in and they don't go as far down.<br />I only took off one star since the edge of the bills getting beat up doesn't bother me. I also think that the tight stitching and leather mean that this wallet will stretch with wear and this problem will get better. They could make the center section just a tad deeper though."
4.0,The pants are not flattering
4.0,made a perfect gift for a friend it was smaller then expected but worked out in the end. the photo has to be a 1x1 and still need to cut it to shape.
4.0,This is super cute. Order a size larger than you think you need. I did and probably could have done even one more size up to let her grow with it a bit. One size larger fits her almost perfectly. It's soft and my niece loves it.
4.0,"This was definitely over priced but I loved it! Its very soft and cute. Although, it got wet and is no longer as soft."
4.0,Very simple little necklace.  For the price it was okay.  My granddaughter really liked it.
4.0,"Love these, but they are very heavy! I can't wear them for an extended period of time as they begin to hurt my face (cheeks and ears) from the weight. Each flower is held together with a tiny screw, but loosen with normal wear. I make sure they are screwed in tight after each use so I dont lose a flower."
4.0,"Earrings are very nice for thr price. They suite my particular outfit I choose them for,m.yes I would recommend them."
4.0,"I wish the first time I bought them at christmas they would of fit. dog gone kid has feet like fred flinstone, I kid you not. talk about a bruise but she's so beautiful but a tom girl by hear. I think I was more excited then she was yet we bought the whole bella outfit..."
4.0,I liked that these glasses were not bulky like the ones I tried from a discount store.
4.0,This facemask definitely gets attention
4.0,They are a little looser than most leggings but they're very adorable and comfortable too. Just rated them 4 stars due to the fact that they can be a little thicker so they're not see through.  I suggest wearing a pair of spandex underneath being that they are a thin and you can see through them.
4.0,Comfortable to wear and easy to breathe through.
4.0,"11 was too big, 10 1/2 too small."
4.0,"Good, great for the money. I don't spend money on designer styles. They will be lost, broken, or stolen. These are just fine!"
4.0,Very convenient and light
4.0,"Oakley cases are pricey; this one was not.  This one is made just as well.  This is large enough to accomodate most sunglasses, but not so big that it looks silly protruding from your jacket pocket.  The clip is nice as well for backpacks or a messenger bag.  I highly recommend this item.  Oh, and it's not cheapy; it is made fairly well."
4.0,Loved the hat. Wore it on the beach and it was very stylish with my retro-style bathing suits. I was even told that I looked absolutely adorable!
4.0,I liked this skirt but it was wrinkly. And i had to wash it in order to take the wrinkles out . The skirt has a nice style and flow but i wish the material was a little different. Overall it was a great skirt.
4.0,"Super cute, I hope they aren‚Äôt too big for my my mom to wear. They are a gift."
4.0,Great material and fits perfectly!
4.0,So very cute but cut strange on top. Made for someone with small chest but large behind. Was so disappointed to return.
4.0,I like them my only complaint is that the waistband is stretchy but you can hear threads pop when going over the hips or they run a little small in the waist band.
4.0,"Fit a little too snug for my chunky crawler , but the quality is great."
4.0,"These pants are cute but not the jean material as displayed. It‚Äôs more like a silky material, also I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, you would need to wear ankle boots for them not to be high waters. Thinking about returning them due to that.."
4.0,Was looking for something to wear to a concert that was in November but still showy. That concert happened to be Lady Gaga. It was 45¬∞ and windy and this shirt didn‚Äôt feel it. It‚Äôs woven pretty tight. This shirt caught my eye. It‚Äôs cropped. I wore a black lace bralette underneath that had some wider coverage in the back. It looked awesome! Paired with high waist black destroyed jeggings and velvet booties with a wool hat! This is a juniors large here with a tiny bit of stretch and I have average size arms and torso and chest for 5‚Äô6. I wear 11 pants mostly.
4.0,"Works good when you latch it correctly, if you don't it will randomly fall off your wrist"
4.0,I‚Äôm 5 /3=::they were very long an the crouch was long . I had to roll them at the waist . An legs .
4.0,I got the smallest size available and it still feels too large. This is supposed to be loose but the cut for the upper part of the tank is a tad too generous for me. I am a 34C for bra and have a 30&#34; waist. That being said I like the tank and the color I just may need to do a little creative taping.
4.0,"I'm glad to find comfortable hipsters in my size because unfortunately they're difficult to find in stores. The butt is fully covered and they do not get overly stretched out like the boy short cut does, however the band is a tiny bit smaller than the advertised size of the underwear..I'd say between 1/4 and 1/2 size down which can lead to some digging and visible panty line in certain bottoms. All-in-all it isn't enough to warrant more than about a 1 star reduction but it should be noted when buying them that if you're at the top end of your size or are heavier in the midsection and/or hips than you are in the thighs you might want to consider a size up. I would still buy them again as they are otherwise comfortable and have been durable."
4.0,"it is cute. Quality is not the best, plastic like, some stitches are loose. Not sure how many washes it will last.<br />The fit is a bit weird, the shoulder area is a bit loose but then it kind of get tighter at the hip area. Not the end of the world. I just tucked it in. I did get lots of compliment."
4.0,Looks good but they are for a Christmas gift so I don't know.
4.0,"Gorgeous. Soft stretchy like cotton gym material. It‚Äôs small on the legs to accentuate the butt. Good for clubbing, not office party."
4.0,"good, have used them a bit, do what they need to, nice item to have when all the gym ones are missing or being used."
4.0,Shoes are nice looking and allowed me to stand on my feet for a longer period of time before the pain set in. Good quality shoes but still was in pain by end of day. Not shoes fault just how it is.
4.0,"It's cute and fits, but it's not a snug fit. I wear a size small and it's a little big in the back. You can't adjust it cause the back is stretchy. I bet it'd fit perfect for someone who wears a medium though. Nice buy. It gets 4 stars for being a little too big though and non adjustable."
4.0,"Perfect for the spring camp I am about to go to but, it is overpriced for what it actually looks like in real life. A bargain would be $6.99"
4.0,"First of all, I'm a bit snobby when it comes to both leather and purses....but let's keep this in perspective...this is a $60 purse (at the time of my purchase).<br /><br />It is a decent grade of leather. Not quite the caliber of some of your designer brands, but I've spent A LOT more money for much less quality but I feel confident that this bag can endure extended daily use.<br /><br />With the bag being so large, I would have appreciated the handle straps being slightly longer. However, based on the buckle design, I was able to have additional holes added to the straps. With that the new drop increase was negligible (to me) , but the bag wears comfortably on the forearm, even fully loaded.<br /><br />The photo compares the purse to my current handbag. Again the leather isn't quite as supple, BUT I also paid 3 times more for that purse.<br /><br />Inside the bag, I can fit my iPad mini, 6x4 cosmetic pouch, pill box, mini first aid kit, emergency hair pouch, and my essentials wristlet that includes wallet, loyalty cards, receipts...the standard things that we shove into our purses.  In addition to all this, I still have plenty of room to drop in my Otterbox enclosed iPhone 6 Plus and oversized sunglasses in a hard case.<br /><br />Oh I can also drop in my A5 notebook (approx 6x8 inches).<br /><br />Admittedly if I'm dressed up, looking to make an impression, I'd swap this bag out for a nicer one... HOWEVER this is a good substitute to save some wear and tear on your designer bag or a nice &#34;starter&#34; bag for a young professional."
4.0,"These socks fit way, way smaller than other Darn Tough socks. I wish I had ordered one size up. Darn Tough's &#34;ultra light&#34; is significantly lighter than their &#34;light&#34; sock and light years lighter wear than their hikers. Well constructed, but very thin. One of those things that you can't discern well without seeing and touching the fabric. These are much thinner than what I wanted, but that's my issue. This is more of a wicking running sock than a wool sock that I associate w/the brand Darn Tough."
4.0,"These socks are warm! They also feel nice and soft on the inside. While they fit large on my feet, I suspect washing and shrinking will make them snug and warm. Overall, I'm pleased!"
4.0,"We bought these late July and so far they are holding up. We mostly use these as outside shoes, so my son really uses them hard. They don't seem to be made any different than the cheap rain boots we bought on Zulily.com for around $10-15 dollars. But, they do not have any tears in them or leaks as of yet. My son wears them nearly everyday."
4.0,"I like this helmet.. it‚Äôs not perfect though. The cheek pads seem tighter than most other brands and models I‚Äôm used to so it can be a touch uncomfortable for me. The color online looks nothing like the color of the actual helmet (I‚Äôm talking multiple sites across multiple monitors).. this thing is BRIGHT orange. Almost wish I‚Äôd returned it and picked another color ..but it‚Äôs growing on me.  Functionally, this is a solid helmet. It toes that line between dirt and street very well. In dirt mode (no shield, no breath box, vents open) it breaths really well and keeps me cool.  The breathe box and dual shield of this model are nice on the street in cold weather, too.  Overall I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a better value for the price so I would recommend."
4.0,I bought these for my 14 year old son to take to Jamaica. He is 5/9 but very thin. I got them in a medium and they fit perfect. The length was great and the best part they have a draw string and a belt loops. Got them in black as well for him.
4.0,shirts fits however it did come a little big even after I washed it. Material is very comfortable and is very warm to wear in the summer.
4.0,My daughter loves these jammies. They do fit her very well and are soft! The only thing that is a downfall is the collar on the top was so WIDE that it almost is like a one-shoulder shirt. Other than that they are great and are getting a lot of use!
4.0,"It fits perfectly.  I normally wear a medium but bought a large as they said it fits small.  The belt is vinyl so constantly comes undone, so I just weaved it back through the buckle.  The only real issue I had was the coat hem kept flipping out as it was not hemmed well.  But overall a good costume."
4.0,"I love this idea, I bought one for my significant other and I for Valentines day. The chain is very think as are the puzzle pieces. Although the writing is very thin and not that deep, so it's hard to read which sucks. Also instead of the date, I put our names on each one."
4.0,"Beautiful socks, but still too big for my daughter. I purchased because the description said infant, but my 13 lb daughter is still way too small to wear them."
4.0,Necklace was short if you have a fat neck. Bracelet was small. But I guess for the price it was ok but definitely not big girl friendly. Earrings was GOOD
4.0,"This is beautiful, but wrinkles easily. It fits true to size. The only thing I'd change is the sash. I wish it was sewed onto the robe so that it wouldn't slip out as easily."
4.0,These ties come from an assortment I believe so you can order them multiple times and get different patterns. They are of decent quality and this round both patterns were really nice. No regrets with ordering them.
4.0,My husband is very pleased with this replacement band for his UP Move.  The secure buckle is a plus and the band is more flexible than the original band.
4.0,"The shirt itself is fine overall and as expected, except I bought it because my daughter needed a green shirt for field day. The photo looks kelly green, but in reality it is not. It's more of a mint/ light teal color, not a true green."
4.0,"I really wanted these to be nice to gift to a colleague, but they are sort of clunky and look cheap. They come in a nice enough gift box but they look like the beads were glued on."
4.0,i love these pants
4.0,I like the material fairly light weight and comfortable and it flows well.  The color is nice I've been complimented on it.<br />I'm 5'8&#34; the longest hemline hits mid thigh as pictured. I would like the arm holes a bit higher for me but it's acceptable for a smooth look.
4.0,It is a nice belt.
4.0,Good quality and nice length. Not too short.
4.0,I gave this as a birthday gift for a book club member.  Very cute and versatile.  Can be used for a lot of items to carry.
4.0,A bit thicker than most other ski socks I have worn. Nice coverage up thr calf just below the knee. They work well inside my Apex Boot but would guess not well in a tight fitting boot requiring a thinner sock.
4.0,"Pretty good a few stones have fallen out.But what do you expect for the price.<br />I would order them again.<br />I  usually  pay 2 bucks for 1 ,@ random shops.<br />So this is a steal."
4.0,These are nicely made and the price was decent.  My only minor complaint was that the blue is a dark & dull shade.  The stars however are perfectly colored.
4.0,Very Cute. good fit
4.0,I really really love the concept of this watch. Don't get any other LSAT watch- GET THIS ONE. The 4 block color coding for each section (RC & LG) and countdown from 35 minutes are exactly what you need. I've been using it for about 3 months to prepare for the LSAT and I haven't encountered an issue with it breaking or anything like previous reviews. My only complaint is that I wish it came in a smaller size. The band and head of the watch are just too bulky and large for my ~feminine~ wrist. Women take the LSAT too guys!!
4.0,"I like these, but I wish they made some that are longer. I hoped they'd be longer. It tends to rise due to the way my body is shaped. If you are flat-tummied, they will be fine for you, but I still have a baby pouch as a grandma! So not their fault, but I figured it would help someone who may want these. The material is awesome, though probably more for either over a bra or under a shirt, as the fabric is quite sheer. Today I wore one instead of a bra to the store, which was delightful and super comfortable but supportive."
4.0,"I have a pair of vintage-looking menswear style oxfords that came with laces that kept coming undone and caught in my pant legs.<br />I ordered these, and they really do work! They were easy to put in, look neat/tidy and even give the shoe some &#34;stretch&#34; over the top of the foot which gave my particular shoes a much better fit. Plus, you get the bonus of not having to tie the shoes anymore. What a great and simple concept.<br /><br />Note: They may not work on a very small or dainty shoe or athletic shoe (these are a thin dress style)."
4.0,"My wife loves it, I bought it for her as a present. Rose gold & Bling! It really looks nice on her fitbit. Haven't had any issue with it yet, worth the price! Easy to install onto the fitbit with the a little help.."
4.0,Love this tank blouse. I wear a small & bought a meduim. Runs a little big. Fits  great still. Love the Material.
4.0,"For the money, nothing touches this watch.  Accuracy, detail and finish are amazing.  The leather strap is stiff; conditioning is a tremendous help.  The strap should have a second loop and it really needs a folding, locking clasp.  I can't wait to see what they can do for under $100!"
4.0,"I purchased this top as a nursing top. I wear a nursing tank underneath and find that it definitely has easy access for feeding.  The price is also great.  I haven't washed it yet but I'm not expecting it to hold up in the washing machine for very long but for how cheap it is, I'm okay with that."
4.0,"I order one full size larger (XL) and it fit me just fine, they are running in small, so i will suggest to order one full size larger then you normally used,<br />i love the design, vivid colors and great fabric...will recommend"
4.0,Ordered my usual size .The dress fit perfect. Very pleased with it.
4.0,"I really like this because I never notice it in my back pocket, but I had to deduct one star. The reason is because that even though I only carry three cards, when I use the center section to put cash in I have to push in and bend the cards to expose the center area and I don't really like bending my bank card. Maybe I'll try using one of the side slots for cash."
4.0,So I got the large and it's weirdly too big/long when untied and too tight when tied up Love the open back though and the fabric.
4.0,Must have a slip under as it is shear. The colors  are stunning and size as expected.
4.0,This is my first cold weather running cap. I love it. It kept my ears warm while keeping my hair and the sun out of my eyes.
4.0,"Beautiful dress! No structure/hold in the bust area, but still did the job."
4.0,"Works for what I was looking for, just something cute, comfy and a little sexy to wear around the house. Soft material,  not scratchy at all. 0nly problem is material is already getting balls on it."
4.0,"This v-neck/faux wrap dress by Msbasic is super cute. It wraps slightly in the front (I wore mine with a coral tank underneath). It has very pretty sleeves ‚Äì flutter style. There is a side zipper which makes it convenient. It has a very nice hemline, stops right above the knee. The base color of the dress is navy blue, with a floral design. The flowers are bold yet subtle (yeah, I know that is a contradiction) ‚Äì cream, soft pink and red roses. The material is satiny and comfortable against my skin. I like that this dress is machine washable (cool and hang-dry). It is perfect for a summer BBQ. I‚Äôd recommend it."
4.0,"Love the color, beautiful shirt. A bit big in the arm pit area."
4.0,pretty good quality for cheap sunglasses
4.0,The suit is cheaply made which I expected since it was inexpensive. But overall it serves its purpose and I would probably purchase again.
4.0,"Fit my glasses good, fairly easy to put on with just one hand.  Wish they were a bit darker."
4.0,"The charms are cute and kids love them.  My daughter uses them with her rainbow loom.  There are a lot of duplicates, so you get more like 25 designs and then duplicates to varying degrees.  We got seven weird looking fish."
4.0,Love this top! It's so pretty. The back is completely open just ties with a ribbon on the bottom and a button  at the top. Button broke off of mine cause it was a little cheap but that's ok just gonna get a new button.  Material is a little rough on the white flower one not sure about the others but I definitely plan to order more
4.0,"Very cute sunglasses!  However, some of the ‚Äúbling‚Äù was coming loose when I received it.  :("
4.0,Very soft but run large. Very roomy.
4.0,A decent value for your buck. It's comfortable and provides a little warmth. But mostly I use it for protection and for those days I don't want to do my hair. Lol.
4.0,Runs BIG I usually wear a large in bottom. Wish I would have ordered a small
4.0,It was too big and the material is thin
4.0,"I really love this top.  I have received lots of compliments each time I wear it.  The knot in the front is trendy and cute.  It is a little baggy and is long, sits below my butt, I'm 5'3.  But all in all, it is very cute and can't beat the price."
4.0,These are a bit smaller than most reusable bags - which is what I was looking for. I prefer to use these small bags to hold more fragile items so things don't get crushed.<br /><br />These are a great price and seem fairly sturdy but not indestructible. They are washable and held up well in the washer. I hung them up to dry. They are not the easiest to fold back into their little envelope so I just fold them up to the best I can and not worry about it.
4.0,Super cute but thumbs poke/snag at stuff so be careful
4.0,It may be my fault for not checking the measurements. These chokers are THE CUTEST THINGS EVER but they‚Äôre really small so I couldn‚Äôt wear them :(
4.0,Overall this dress was nice and will serve its purpose at a bridal shower. I usually wear a size 8 in dresses so I ordered a M. The material is a bit transparent but I don‚Äôt mind bc it‚Äôs perfect for summer weather. The slit was a bit higher than my liking but other than that this dress was flowy and elegant. I had no issues with any of the buttons
4.0,Great fit!  Very comfortable!
4.0,it is amazing except for the fact that it is a bit smaller than the description made me believe.
4.0,"Good quality leather and well made. But, it‚Äôs BIG. More for a woman to put in her purse and not one you can simply clip to a belt loop and into your front pocket due to the bulkiness from the padding."
4.0,Good present for how much it costs
4.0,I like the large bags for my trips to Costco.  I don't have to make several trips from the car to my home.  The employees at Costco really like them. I load all my items on the conveyer and then snap the bags on to the cart.  This would be a good item for Costco to carry.
4.0,The color goes great with shoes I have üòÉ
4.0,Works great for under my scrub tops.
4.0,"I love the way this Spartan Yoga headband looks! It's so stylish; I've worn it out and about in addition to wearing it while I work out. I don't do much yoga, but love to wear it for cardio. It keeps all the loose hairs off my face. My hair is too short to wear up without strands falling out, but this headband is the perfect solution to keeping my face hair-free.<br />Most headbands don't stay on my head, but the thickness of this one makes it work for me.<br />I gave four stars, because it has been a bit snug and needed to stretch it quite a bit to make it feel more comfortable. (It gave me a headache at first). One recommendation was to wash, and while still wet stretch it. I may try that.<br />Hoping to remember to take a picture the next time I wear it to post!<br />I received this headband with a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are solely my own."
4.0,I'm using this for a Freddy Krueger costume. I think it looks perfect for the costume. It could use a band so that it fits more snuggly on the head. For my purposes it's excellent. It fits very well on top of my mask.
4.0,"For hunting, comfortable , and warm"
4.0,Pretty...elegant!!
4.0,Need larger
4.0,"An inexpensive blazer--not top quality, but actually a little better than I expected for the price.  Only had it a few days, so I can't comment on its durability yet, but if it holds up over time, I'd say it's a good buy."
4.0,I was looking for something with the AZ flag on it and found this in lieu of a shirt - it'll be worn more than a shirt and looks great.
4.0,It's a nice jacket but it's way too small!<br />Ordered the XL and fits like a Medium or so. Get at least two sizes bigger.
4.0,I got my some the Navy and the black. The Navy is great. It's soft and durable. The black one is rough and has never softened at all. The black one also was way smaller than the Navy one. It's almost like they are 2 different brands. He refused to wear the black ome after 4-5 times because it is so rough and uncomfortable. Navy 5 stars. Black 0 stars.
4.0,Great fit but the sides that are sewed on fell apart.
4.0,"Bought these for my mom, along with a dress, for mothers day. They are not a heavy metal, but they aren't flimsy either."
4.0,"These are a good option for those searching for maternity shorts. I would definitely say they are more lounge/workout shorts but are not see-through so they could be worn in public. Also, they seem like they will be a great option in the hot summer months to help stay cool. I gave 4 stars because I only received one pair instead of the pack of two, but was compensated for the mistake."
4.0,Somewhat small but I have a lot of hair. still my favorite hat!!!
4.0,Shirt is a good fit for me.  Kind of flimsy though considering the price. Don't know how it will hold up to washing.<br />Edit--will up my rating to 4 stars.  It is very comfortable.
4.0,This dress is super cute and comfortable
4.0,"Purchased this charm because it was different,  and it is. A bit small but nice."
4.0,a little weird shape but still cool.
4.0,Padding doesn't cover much surface area. Too much room near the bottom
4.0,Only had the product a year and already the blue center fell out of the O and now it looks terrible. However i got a call from the seller directly and they resolved the issue. AMAZING customer service!!!!
4.0,i fopund these leggings when searching for cold weather running pants....they are not. My legs were cold the second i was out the door. they did make me run faster as i wanted the warmth of my home that much sooner. But oh they are so comfy. i put them on and waffled on calling in sick to work so i didnt have to take them off.
4.0,Very pretty but I had to pin the top or my bra shows
4.0,"Love this Van Gough painting, & the image is captured well even though it is tiny. Bracelet is easy to get on & off an average size wrist & comfortable."
4.0,"Nice,comfortable,lightweight socks.  I've worn them for light hiking and every day.  Soft, not scratchy.  Thin... which is good for summer... but I'll have to see how they hold up over the long term.<br /><br />They did ship a catalog and enough other junk mail with them to double the shipping weight.  I didn't appreciate killing all those trees just so I could sort through them and make sure there wasn't anything actually important in there."
4.0,Material is not very sturdy with limited time water resistance.  Pockets (location and number) are fabulous!
4.0,love the product. but it was not very durable.
4.0,"cute dress, a little big in front, can be a little itchy"
4.0,"I want to gave this 5 star but it still the product is good tho it just that the material is kinda suck but it's all good the color is kinda not the color that show as the picture but overall I like it .And it come fast thanks to the seller, I will gave seller a 5 star ‚òÖ rate on this, he response so grade and positive."
4.0,"Ankle strap fell off right boot when removed from package. Seller replaced with a new set of boots. Great customer service and the rest of the construction appears to be fine. I did spray inside and out with Armorall to make the fabric more supple. The soles have a good traction surface, with small suction cups and lugs, and the zippers work smoothly. They do run small. XL barely fits my US 11.5 hooves. The next size up would probably be floppy though. An insole of flat foam might have taken up the slack tho'."
4.0,Fit the wife good
4.0,Nice cap for the money.  Looks and feels like real leather.  I gave it 4 stars because stitching thread on one seam needed trimming. (made in China).
4.0,Super cute but too small. Gonna have to buckle down on my diet to squeeze into these babies.
4.0,"With COVID wearing a mask with eyeglasses is a recipe for fogged lenses.  With this product, the fogging has improved greatly.  I will be purchasing again."

4.0,"Super cute, the material is thin but still very comfortable!!!"
4.0,Its fitted and soft. I'm not sure if I want to wear it on a hot summer day or wear it as a night shirt.  I can tell that the material will keep me cool and comfy.
4.0,Is very soft and cool for the summer.
4.0,"GT GOERTEK Toddler Girls Sandals Little Girls Orthopedic Princess Flat Sandals Kids Summer Beach Shoes<br /><br />These shoes are so cute! I love how the shoes are so adjustable! The velcro closure makes it super easy to get them on your little one! Curling toes are no longer a problem! My little one LOVES BOWS! So she is very happy to put these shoes ON! The problem with bows on shoes is that as much as she loves them, she is not happy until she pulls the bows OFF the shoes! These have stood the test so far! The bows remain! A double win for me! Super cute! Comfortable! Nice treads - non slip! 5 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,Material was not what I was expecting. It was big in all the wrong places and was NOT flattering.
4.0,Probly a little bigger than most xl shirts I own but is comfortable and fits well.
4.0,"I‚Äôm an athletic build with minimal waist and purchased a size large for my thighs. They fit well, almost too big, and will consider buying a size down. I don‚Äôt put them in the dryer when washing so I can‚Äôt speak to how they hold up if you do that but recommend purchasing!"
4.0,It was for my grand daughter.  It fit a little snug but she liked it so we kept it.
4.0,"We purchased this after my husband lost his standard wallet. It seems pretty good so far, although the money clip isn‚Äôt very sturdy or heavy duty. But it was a great price to be able to locate the wallet if the husband looses it again."
4.0,It is nice but to big for me
4.0,Fit a little longer than expected but quality is amazing great pants
4.0,"I ordered a large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, and 160lbs. Definitely runs short, even for a short girl. Lace is very soft. I wore it for family photos with a slip under, but chose not to when I wore it for work.<br />Lots of compliments."
4.0,"This is a very nice top, cooling and soft. Looks very nice but is a bit larger in size. It's a loose fit and I ordered my regular size of Small. But it feels a bit big and I'll end up wearing it tucked in to give it some form and a better shape. Else it just looks too boxy on me. I was hoping to wear it without needing to tuck it in. Also, it's not as sunny yellow as the pictures indicate but instead, more of a mustard yellow. The material is very good though. And it gives off a sheen consistent with a silky satin. It does look very nice with slacks or narrow pants. The batwing sleeves are a nice touch too."
4.0,Very nice product. Hangs longer necklaces also. I wasn't crazy about the roses but they are OK. Without that it would have been better.
4.0,I liked it enough to try a smaller size.  I just felt that the size I ordered was a bit too large for me and wouldn't offer me the correction I need for my shoulders and upper back.
4.0,"This swimsuit arrived very quickly.  After reading the other reviews I ordered a medium and a large.  I am 5'8'' and 148 lbs.  I tried on both and the large fit more comfortably.  I returned the medium without any hassle.  I only gave it four stars since I haven't used it to go swimming, so we'll see how it holds up after that.  I really like that I am covered and feel modest.  I feel like the cup size works for me (34 C) and is very supportive.  Overall super cute and flattering swim suit for this mother of two!"
4.0,It looks like the pictures guys! What you see if what you get. Lol
4.0,These aren't the most attractive but I like how they make me feel secure. I have a mom belly that does not work with low cut undies. I'll keep buying these cheap and comfy styles until I lose this tummy!
4.0,The corset is very nice but the garter clips are a bit too flimsy and kept popping open to the point I just removed them. The little padding in the cups are nice
4.0,The packaging is very nice. These are well made.
4.0,"I like the idea of this bag, it kept the food I traveled with warm, which is it's intended purpose, however the material is like that of a reusable grocery bag, (but with reinforced sides and bottom), and the zipper is a little difficult to work. With a little revamping, it could be great! But overall, it's not a bad bag :)"
4.0,"the coat is shedding. It is super warm but the lining is really fuzzy. It is a nice coat and thick. The arms are a little long, I ordered a large so i could layer underneath"
4.0,The product is what I wanted but I ordered the wrong size.  I need an ex-large.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
4.0,"The packaging was great, however one stone broke. It‚Äôs a birthday gift so don‚Äôt have time to return it. Other stones looked good no issues. Just disappointed have to remove it altogether or put the broken larger bit in the box‚Ä¶"
4.0,Customer service is top notch. There was an issue with my necklace and they immediately contacted me and replaced it. I love my Mama Bear necklace.
4.0,"Very GORGEOUS jewelry!!! I really love how big & noticeable the &#34;MOM&#34; on the necklace is!!! Very shiny & the bracelet is strong but easy enough to bend & stay into shape! I just wish the necklace itself was a little bit thicker, for added strength! My 9 month old loves playing with my necklaces when I'm feeding her & I'm just afraid she's going to accidentally tug on it too much & break it! Otherwise, great gift to get mom & ships fast too!!!"
4.0,Very comfortable material. PattyBoutik clothing is definitely worth trying!
4.0,"I bought 2 different clots, love this, lightweight I wore a tank top underneath.  It could use a little ironing after washing but I‚Äôve also worn it without ironing by washing and hanging. I wear clothes and clothes fits perfect"
4.0,The teeth slightly longer than expected
4.0,Its good but a bit small for my head my ears are not comfortable in it.
4.0,Very cute and so comfortable!
4.0,Very nice fit. I like them a lot n my girlfriend said &#34;They look good on me.&#34; As well
4.0,"It's a nice necklace. I thought it would be larger, but still nice"
4.0,They‚Äôre not actually very large but they get the job done.
4.0,Husband who lives in slippers.
4.0,Almost perfect.  Would be five stars except for loose strings on arm seam.  I'm going to hv to sew it to prevent a hole.  I'm 5'9&#34; tall and the dress skims my feet and it's still sexy.  It's a curvy woman's dream dress.  Definitely big girl friendly.  It would look like a sack on a skinny girl.
4.0,I wanted to be my dog for Halloween. The costume fits great but now I sheaf like her too.
4.0,This runs very small I'm a size 8-10 and it's very tight
4.0,Love the top! The bottoms are seriously cheeky but target has white bottoms that match it perfectly.
4.0,This scarf has absolutely beautiful and I really like it. I'm really glad I bought it. Now waiting for spring so I can wear it.
4.0,good socks...just so hot right now to wear them.
4.0,"Light weight!<br /><br />Takes a while to learn to breathe while wearing, but doesn't fog!<br /><br />Do not wear in a dark room!!!  You will be totally disoriented!<br /><br />Well made!"
4.0,"The hooded wearable blanket is perfectly suited for lounging. It is not as plush as I expected but for the cost it is comfortable and warm. Perfect for curling up on the couch, a little too bulky for activities around the house."
4.0,"Super, super cute. I haven't had a chance to take this in the swimming pool yet....but I did go for a run with it in 90 degree weather. It's very airy! I just wish it had a little more elastic to the bra part of the top."
4.0,"The version with short sleeves is a favorite of mine. I wish this one had the wider boat neck and it seems like the fabric isn‚Äôt quite as soft, but still pretty good."
4.0,"I am tall, 6'1&#34; and wear 34dd. This fit a bit tighter than I expected, but I can run in it without bouncing, and the straps can be lengthened enough for me. I think if i re-ordered I'd get a 34ddd, or a 36dd. I'd just get it a bit bigger to be more encapsulating and a little gentler in the fit. It's great for a few hours of exercise and then take it off, or size up maybe."
4.0,"Cute. Even better with a waist belt.<br />I am 5'2&#34; petite and length is perfect, mid thigh.<br />4 stars because it's too short in the back, if I don't wear tights you can see my bum if I bend at all."
4.0,"Look good,  good price, holding up so far, though durability is questionable. One hinge creaks and twist when putting on and taking off.  But at this price it's kinda of expected.  Just think of them as disposable ""stylishish"" blue light blocker readers."
4.0,Looks nice and lightweight. Not sweater material so need an undershirt layer for warmth. The material has a strange smell even after being washed. I sprayed fabreeze -maybe needs be to aired out.
4.0,Worked great for a Princess Leia costume.
4.0,"These are very nice thick  Wish the skirt was just a bit longer.  The band at top twist some. But these are the nicest skirted leggings I have seen  I would give them 5 stats if not for the above  I would not put these in dryer, I was in hurry to wear once put in dryer  shrunk.  They do not use dryers in Korea"
4.0,"Great, easy to wear."
4.0,Strap good<br />Finish good<br /><br />Hands hard to read<br />Watchface looks cheap
4.0,Wife was happy with gift.
4.0,Both items look great.
4.0,This is a very pretty top.  I love the colors and the material is nice quality.  My only problem is that it's a little short.  It just comes to my waist and I wish it were a little longer. which is why I only gave four stars.
4.0,Love the blouse. Fits perfect.
4.0,"Wasn't expecting the exposed seam to be so pronounced but I still like the dress.  I am usually a 16 but went up a size because of the type of occasion.  It's perfect! If you have a tummy, go up a size. The midsection is tapered."
4.0,"This product was a little smaller than expected however, it is extremely comfortable."
4.0,"I was skeptical because it was so cheap but I splurged and bought three pairs. Arrived on time and fit what I was expecting (which was to be a little tight) but it isn‚Äôt bad! It‚Äôs a cheap material but it‚Äôs a VERY COMFY one too! I wanted a more sophisticated pant look for work but something also comfy and this really hit all the points! The red pair and the beige/grayish pair weren‚Äôt see through but the pink pair is a little see through. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 145 with a curvy build so medium fit Perfectly!<br /><br />Update: I ordered two more pairs since I loved the first 3 but I was disappointed with the two that I got the second time, the plaid paid fit akward amd ended up actually being a little big on me and the material wasn‚Äôt comfy and almost itchy. the stripped pair was way to tight but then loose up top and a little see through. Will still wear them but I wish they were as nice as my first 3 pairs. For the price I really can‚Äôt complain."
4.0,My som loves it .
4.0,"This is a great bag. Very functional and roomy. So far I have carried books in it, my laptop, and some random bag stuff with no issues and it's comfortable. My only complaint is that I ordered the slate grey color and it doesn't look grey. It looks like a dark khaki color and the straps definitely look more brown than grey or black. I chose grey because I like grey or black accessories and clothes, my purse is grey, so I wanted this in grey to go with my every day looks. Other than being slightly disappointed in the color, I do like the bag and I think it will also work well when I have to travel for work."
4.0,This is super pretty but much bigger than I expected. It is quite a statement piece
4.0,It is so pretty and heavy.  It makes me feel special.  I love it.
4.0,"I love these studs. Perfect for when you want to jazz up your look, without being outstandingly gaudy. Did not hurt my ears after wearing all day. They are completely flat"
4.0,"Perfect under blouses or tops, also perfect onits on as workout top. Smooth and absorbent fabric"
4.0,"very soft material, excellent packing, but the size is not as I wished.  It is almost a huge square while I wished for a shawl to wear as a head scarf. It's my fault, I did not read the description thoroughly."
4.0,These bras fit perfect and are so comfortable that I forgot that im wearing it.
4.0,Un producto hermoso me encanto para mi esposo y El esta muy contento muy buen producto
4.0,Good quality material & construction. Nothing wrong with the product but I did return it as it didn't flatter my figure. Color is spot on & beautiful.
4.0,Very decent
4.0,Love the money clip.  It's magnetic and I can place it on the frig door or under a metal table. It doesn't  bulge out like my old wallet.  It's compact and convenient.  Fits nicely in my jean pocket.
4.0,For the most part I like them. 2 of the pairs with designs feel small and are tough to put on.
4.0,"The plastic end was broke on one when received, otherwise the others held glasses in place and was comfortable."
4.0,A Gift.  Cute......Real Cute.......!
4.0,I have a few oh these shirts but the beige on the bottom was see through and was not flattering. I donated it.
4.0,"I bought this because it looked small on the female model in the picture. Unfortunately it is LARGE. Easily a size L/XL. I have a petite face so this did not fit me at all. Aside from being too loose, it made it so that the mouth design hangs below my chin and looks weird. It also doesn't come with the little ear clasps to tighten it.<br /><br />The design is crisp and cute. It looks good. The material is really high quality and soft and I'm sure someone with a bigger face will love it. I'm going to give it to a friend instead. So sad it doesn't fit, otherwise I would wear it daily!<br /><br />It did come with a gross factory plasticky smell, but most masks do. A quick wash in a washing machine will fix that."
4.0,"The fit is a bit strange, the arms are oddly tight for an XL, so it's not really suitable for layering."
4.0,"Great quailty, but runs small"
4.0,"Someone finally listened & gave us some pockets!! And they're actually roomy & in the right position for your hands, it's like a miracle! The closest reference I can think of is hoodie pockets, they feel similar. Like, there's plenty of room for your keys & phone, but they're soft & stretchy so it's highly likely your keys & phone will fall out if you bend down. They're intended more for your hands, and maybe your mask? Either way, any company that adds any kind of functional pocket to women's clothing has my vote!<br /><br />Unfortunately I sized up after a few bad experiences with other brands, and it would be a lot more flattering if I hadn't. Fits true to size. So it's a bit boxy on me, but that's my fault! Also the heathered ""wine"" color looks more like an inside out sweatshirt than a fashion choice - again, my fault, I was feeling colorful & should have gone with a black or gray. So I won't be wearing it to any formal dinners, but it's super soft & comfy & I will definitely love cuddling up in it on a rainy day!"
4.0,These are made very large.  Loved the material
4.0,I love the shirt and the color but it is a little skimpier than I expected - still OK - I can wear it!
4.0,item was as expected
4.0,"pretty colors but had to return,large was way too big."
4.0,"I'd never heard of Babybotte shoes, but I'm glad I took a chance on these. The brown and beige detail is extremely cute. The shoes fit well with no chafing. They're easy to put on and take off. There entire upper is leather and the footbed is nicely cushioned. My son is hard on shoes, his last pair of Robeez Tredz had to be thrown out with holes in BOTH big toes, but these shoes look like they will last.<br /><br />I have two complaints. One, lace-up shoes for toddlers is annoying. Perhaps I'm an incompetent shoe tier, but these slippery laces won't stay tied unless I double knot, which means it takes longer to get the shoes off. Two, I do not agree that EU25 is the same as US 8.5T. We need to do something to standardize on shoe sizes so that parents purchasing shoes over the Internet can have reasonable assurances of the size of the shoe. Someone else sold an EU25 as a 9.5."
4.0,A bit small and smelled funny when we got it - otherwise your typical t-shirt with a mustache taco on it. you really cant go wrong
4.0,"Cute jacket, but even the smallest size was too big so I have no idea how it performs."
4.0,Good value<br />Fits well
4.0,I love the style and color.  They are beautiful. Gave a 4 because they are just way too big for my facial structure. I had my daughter and DIL try them on as well to see if they fit either better and they also felt they were too big for them. Bummer because I really liked them. Recommend looking carefully at product description and using a ruler to get a good accurate idea of how bit they are going to be.
4.0,Nice dress ..this dress is fresh ..nice for a summer time
4.0,cute for novelty dress up but the &#34;thong&#34; or g string is a piece of flimsy flim flammery... supply your own panty option for a better time...
4.0,My husband loves Flojos. They are priced right and arrived quickly. He is very happy.
4.0,"Not fancy. Not high end. But great to bring the costume together. It is your basic latex mask. Doesn't breathe well - obviously. But for the price and product, quality is good. Worked great for my costume."
4.0,beautiful dress. Well made. I look forward to wearing it on my wedding day :)
4.0,"Waist fits as expected. These have wide leg openings for me. I wear 32x32 slim jeans, but I don't have super skinny legs. Must wear base layer with these, but they look goofy over tights. I have two colors."
4.0,"Had a few hiccups with getting this purse. Amanzon used their own shipping, and I‚Äôm not sure if it got lost or what but I had to reorder to get it here. Used customer service a few times through amazon and everyone I talked to was more than helpful, very friendly, and helped me as best as they could.<br /><br />As far as how the purse looks and everything, it‚Äôs great. Looks and feels high quality for a decent price. Worth the wait."
4.0,"An awesome product for the money. However, if you are ordering multiple pairs SPECIFICALLY for the color don't spend your time or money. I completely understand that there are ""color discrepancies due to monitors"" but they are NOTHING remotely similar to the color in question.  I ordered multiple different colors and 2 of the pairs look almost identical. There isn't a color with a red lens as shown. Overall though they are great glasses for the price!"
4.0,My tdddler absolutely loved these crocs. They're super cute and easy to clean. They run really small though.
4.0,"For the price it‚Äôs a great watch. Not sure how well it keeps time, it could be 20 seconds off everyday and that‚Äôs accurate enough for my purposes. Fit and finish could be improved but for the price it‚Äôs a cool watch."
4.0,"Beautiful watch. Only thing that bothers me is the stiffness of the alligator leather strap. It is very thick and and hard to get the pin into and especially out of the watch strap. Other than that, it is a very simple but also eye-catching and elegant watch, I enjoy the arabic rose gold lettering against the black watch face."
4.0,"These are great for my larger square plastic frames, but they leave scratches where the clip isn‚Äôt covered in rubber.  Otherwise lovely."
4.0,"great style<br />A little bigger, longer and wider than expected"
4.0,"A little bigger in person than I expected, but they still look good. Rich looking without looking flashy or cheap"
4.0,"Very nice bathing suit, but I think it is too reveal for my type of body."
4.0,Love the look. Goes well with my business casual outfits.
4.0,Thought it was smaller
4.0,"This is very cute, looks just like the photo.  The material is soft, however I am a size ten and this is very snug.  When you see one size fits all, it means probably a size 6 or less."
4.0,"This shirt is adorable. The elbow pads are sewn on well and add a really cute detail. My only complaint is that the shirt is thin, so it is not very forgiving."
4.0,This was better than i expected. its So cute and the material is SO soft. i would absolutely buy again
4.0,"Badass jacket.<br /><br />Zippers are too small, and it's a pain to snap the zipper to zip up.<br /><br />Belt is not wide enough.<br /><br />Leather is top notch. Soft and awesome.<br /><br />Lining is okay. I would rather have lining I could remove. Sleeve zippers dont expose wrists, because the lining is there.<br /><br />Fits absolutely amazing. Sleeves are long enough to not roll up when you bend the elbows."
4.0,"Fits large, but great shirt."
4.0,"Cute shirt, but I normally wear a medium and ordered an XL so I could wear over leggings with a cardigan- if I had ordered anything smaller it would have been tight!! You definitely want to order a couple sizes larger."
4.0,"The faint pink on these is subtle. Sometimes it looks clear. Sometimes they look pink. Depends on the lighting . I would have preferred a clear frame with the green and red stripe, but I‚Äôll make these work for now."
4.0,"Works as advertised!!  Just insert your batteries, plug into the self contained solar array and sit in the sun.....your batteries will recharge in 3 to 4 hours (depending on how many you insert).  A nice little package to take with you to the park or picnic so you can have fresh batteries for your battery powered stuff.<br />Small way to be off the grid."
4.0,my mom appreciated the gift.
4.0,It's a nice print on the shirt the design looks great and stands out. It shrinks quite a bit coming out of the dryer. It was also a bit short out of the packaging. It does look good though.
4.0,"Great quality fabric, but fits a bit small. Husband wears a large in most clothes. Vibrant colors"
4.0,Nice for girls just little wider.
4.0,It's ok tho in like it.
4.0,The large size is perfect . .I am using this bag for traveling its weatherproof and light weight. It is prefect for a little shopping to put a few small purchases in it.  It's also comfortable on your shoulders.  I also like it a as zippered pockets and a place to put a water bottle.
4.0,Very Very cute and fit great. But be careful if you plan on wearing all day they will turn your fingers green. Cheap cost gives cheap materials. Just don't wash your hands with these on!
4.0,"This is a quality shirt. Warm and well-lined, pretty pattern. It was not as ridiculously small as other reviewers have said. I usually wear a small or medium, but when ordering from Asia on Ebay, I order an extra large, which I did here. When it came, it was very big on me, but since I mostly wanted to wear it as a jacket, that's okay. If I were doing it again, I would only order a large, or maybe even a medium."
4.0,Cute style and fun for the sun!
4.0,"They work, definitely not the same quality you get from Costa but I figured that would be the case when i purchased these. They've held up to a harsh summer or use so thats nice."
4.0,"This review is for the CORAL RED Jane Stone Statement Nevklace. This necklace is so so pretty for the price! I was concerned it would be cheap feeling/looking plastic but it's got a little weight to it and the pieces are so shiney and smooth. The color is spot on as shown in the picture. It is a bright true red. the chain is pretty but it made with anything durable. The clasp works well. I foresee the chain wearing as time goes on which is why I gave it four stars rather than five. Also, this necklace came with matching earrings! Surprise! See photos :)"
4.0,"Yosemite is the original Kathmandu by High Peak and to be fair I'll update this review after having put this pack through some serious paces, just received yesterday. As I'm a permanent resident of Amazon, I will update when this pack has been flogged hard enough to rate a real review.<br /><br />A wee bit of personal history, related to the item. I started back packing when I was 15 years old, that's roughly four decades + ago and was a good keen outdoor fella; appreciated everything about the lonely trails most will never see, at a time before it was popular; I would go bush for two weeks to a month at a time, traveling high mountain peaks and the good bush huts of NZ trails around the country -But mainly in the South Island. Later, World travel to experience different cultures and lifestyles. All of these adventures were done with large external frame back backs capable of 100lb loads and often had a maximum load, no corner stores at 4000 feet and 140 miles from the nearest road.<br /><br />This is the very first internal frame back pack I have owned.<br /><br />It arrived and the first thing I did was put it on and test the weight, extremely light from what I'm used to and was very impressed with how it fit/contoured. However, the weak link yet to be tested was even though this back pack rates at 6,000 cubic inches, the internal main compartment appears very small I loaded up two pairs of jeans, three pair of socks, underwear and three Tee shirts and a warm 'Jumper' et al -That filled the entire internal main space, I would have liked almost double that for month trips, though would work very well for a couple of weeks of completely independent traveling. I see the pack capable of around a 50-60lb load, which is more than typical back packers would need. The external (To the main compartment) is very generous indeed and suppose that's where the bulk of 6,000 cubic inches comes to the fore. There are plenty of strong external storage spaces and the pockets do appear well made; also the buckles (Anybody for buckle city?) There are a lot of straps, far more than I'm typically used to, they do not seem cheap at all. Its an extremely comfortable pack to wear.<br /><br />The one-size fits all seems to be correct. I'm 5'11"" and 200lb -Not a small fella, I had my Daughter try this on and she is 5' 6"" 128lb -Fit perfectly; she also liked the dry weight a lot.<br /><br />Overall, price for bang -Can't seem to complain, this price point and quality if anything, is probably around $65.00 underpriced, for a comparable pack alternative.<br /><br />Thanks, Jerry for answering questions, the seller was prompt and knowledgable.<br /><br />Cheers"
4.0,"If you are tiny (I am 5'3&#34; and 98 lbs), the small sags a bit and is not very tight. Other than that, they will do just fine. Pocket fits my larger phone good."
4.0,"Super comfy,  love the fabric. I probably should've gotten a size down because these are a bit big,  but I still wear them around the house.  Love the pockets!"
4.0,I really like the way this product fits and it‚Äôs very comfortable. I only wish it was 100% cotton.
4.0,"Such a cute dress! Fits great, true to sizs!"
4.0,"Hate wearing socks to bed, but found the pair of these I bought last winter and have to have more! These are even better, soft, light weight, lil traction beads on bottom!"
4.0,still love it i order it to small
4.0,Be careful it detattches easily
4.0,It fits great. My daughter loves all the options she has in taking it apart and putting it back together.
4.0,I bought it as a gift. I don't know how it holds up but I thought it was a bit thin for a baby outfit. My 4 year old picked it out and was very happy with how pretty it was.
4.0,"Different from any hat I've ever worn. The crown is made of a thin and soft felt-like material, and I get the feeling the ""leather"" insert is more likely of the ""I can't believe it's not"" variety. The bill is very pliable and yet returns to a straight edge despite hefty bending. The bill does not extend far out, and so the cap must be worn low on the forehead to give any shade. The overall style may be a too ""old-timey"" for some: this hat fits like I imagine a genuine 1940's baseball cap would. I kinda like it. Others won't. Either way, wouldn't recommend paying $35 for this one."
4.0,"My mother was delighted with the pendant, the neckless could be of better quality."
4.0,Beautiful dress. Good quality. A little too long. Would buy again
4.0,"Love the dress, ran larger than thought..very pretty though"
4.0,Simple and cute.  My daughter is happy with hers.  Thinner and smaller than the picture shows.
4.0,"it‚Äôs decent quality and very versatile, i love!"
4.0,Fits well material is ultra thin - that was unexpected.
4.0,Very good value for the price.
4.0,"It runs a little small and is thinner than expected, but I like the way it looks."
4.0,"Warmer than most leggings, very comfortable. The only odd thing is that they don't have a front or back, so the crotch seam feels a little odd and not in the right place if you have a bigger booty."
4.0,ok.  Very hard to order Converse online due to fitting.
4.0,Very soft material. My kiddo doesn't like having things pulled over his head so this in a nice alternative. I am only giving it 4 stars because it is a little overpriced and when you have a squirming baby it can be challenging to know which snaps go where (one could easily just color the snaps)...
4.0,"Pros:<br />Very thick, comfortable and absorbent. Really good quality.  However out of the bag, they smell as bad as it gets chemically."
4.0,"Good fit, light. I like it as I walk every day and want my head covered, and light enough if I want to put my hood up. Love the black one, the white was not that attractive"
4.0,This was pretty and we used it as intended -  To go with a pretty dress to wear to a wedding.  I ordered it on the large side because of other reviews I read and it was still a little too small but it looked good anyway.  The price was right.
4.0,Its a really cute ankle bracelet only downside is it turned my ankle green. :( other then that it's great
4.0,"Very small, several issues with the seller. Missed the gift date, even though ordered three months ahead, due to issues."
4.0,Only 5/30 had doubles and some of the patterns and colors are similar but it's still a great deal.
4.0,I love the ring but I gave it four stars because it does have that costume jewelry look
4.0,The product great
4.0,Love it but it's a little smaller than I would have liked
4.0,i really like these gloves but some on the details are not as pictured it would not let me post a picture but the logo is split spelled on both gloves instead of the logo fully on both so one glove reads DCSHOE and the second one says COUSA
4.0,"It's pretty ,the reason is 4 star because it's extremely thin,pretty much see through ,because of that extra delicate ,it should be little thicker that's for sure."
4.0,"Very cute and simple, the hood is a bit small for the jacket, I'm 5'5 200lbs and the x-large was perfect"
4.0,"I am 5'2"" tall and size 0/25 inch waist so this robe was a little big on me around the waist. There was no tie on the inside of the robe, just on the outside. Since it was a little big around the waist I only had access to one pocket since I had to wrap it around my body to have a tighter fit. Its lightweight ad comfortable fabric. No strange odors when I took it out of the packaging."
4.0,Little tighter than expected but works great with a running vest on.
4.0,"As others have stated, the bifocal portion takes up more than half the lens so it‚Äôs hard to see the ground without cocking your head. Also, the bifocal portion is narrow, so unless you have narrow-set eyes might not work for you. Having said that, they work fine for me and are excellent for meetings where you need to see far and near."
4.0,"Nice bag, just thought it was a lil bigger but not really disappointed"
4.0,"Apenas le qued√≥ y medio ajustado,pero en talla L,el mide 1,78 y pesa como 80kg ,para m√≠ suerte que le gustan las playeras medio ajustadas,deber√≠an de especificar mejor las tallas ya que uno se confunde mucho,pero de fuera de eso a √©l le gust√≥ mucho adem√°s el color como en las fotos,trae su etiqueta y todo,me gust√≥."
4.0,"The material was such that it became very hot and hard to breathe, very uncomfortable"
4.0,"I'm typically a small in shorts, but these were extremely tight around the waist. The elastic waist band twits like crazy after one wash. I ended up cutting the elastic waist band out and it made it more comfortable.<br /><br />Other than that issue these were really comfortable!!"
4.0,Awesome deal. Hard case & carrying pouch included. Just a bit small so they sit a bit high on my face. Still love them!
4.0,"So I love the pattern and material. But it‚Äôs so incredibly thin so if you were to wear this during the day, good chance you‚Äôll see through it. I also had to sew the top properly, the boob parts are just so awkward and big that it doesn‚Äôt actually cup your boob. I‚Äôm a 36DD so I could really use the cup shape. I had to tweak a few things but it‚Äôs pretty cute for a night out."
4.0,Got these for an event. Very comfortable and easy to wear. Good for summer time.
4.0,I have been using these for about a week now and so far so good. They help with the pain of varicose veins.
4.0,"These are great.¬† They are soft and warm.¬† My daughter is 6 and is about 40lbs and 44.5"" tall.¬† We have the XS.¬† They fit well but we are rolling the waist once.¬† They're pretty stretchy, so she'll likely still¬† be able to wear them next winter, as well.¬† I think the lace at the ankles really makes the style.¬†"
4.0,Looks and fits just like expected.  Not disappointed
4.0,"I feel like this back pack is of a thinner material, but it's comparable to any other one you'd buy at Walmart or target. Has lots of pocket and fits her school stuff with extra room. Super cute design and the top strap to hang it from is really thick and seems super sturdy. In the past we've had them break so they couldn't be hung, I don't think we'll have that problem this year!"
4.0,"I'm 5'1 & 145 Lbs , I usually wear a medium but I ordered a size up and it actually fits really great. I think if I would've ordered a medium, the shirt still would've fit good because it's actually a little loose."
4.0,These are well made but the material is a bit stiff.  Easy to wash and comfortable to wear.
4.0,These are great and lightweight. The only thing I would change is to make the eyeglass attachments smaller so they are less obtrusive when wearing them.
4.0,Sister wanted and she looked very odd with them on. Just not her thing....she went through a hipster phase. Didn't break to my knowledge. Looks to big to be real.
4.0,I've enjoyed the compliments and feel these shoes are a great value for the price.  What may not be obvious from the picture is the upper of the shoe is plastic so there isn't a lot of give.  I wouldn't wear them on a day that required a lot of walking.  Love them for work.
4.0,"It is great. Thick too, not flimsy. Only thing is it has velcro that needs to be closed by someone each time so going to the bathroom was difficult without removing whole outfit."
4.0,Beautifully maid.
4.0,The purchase a medium based on some of the reviews this was not correct for me.  I'm petite so the medium was like a large. Its a very light weight jacket. I like the k=jacket I will return for a smaller size. Thank you
4.0,The bottom around your calves were to large for me.
4.0,"Little tight in the tummy but I need to flatten that a little!! Otherwise really cute and comfy, and sexy"
4.0,Went hiking shoes worked well
4.0,Discolored after a few wears but a great necklace for any outfit!
4.0,"Great sturdy bag, bought it to use it for backpacking and can hold a lot of items. Very lightweight. Love it!"
4.0,"Would love a section for change, since I use this as a true wallet."
4.0,Some of these are really cute. The only problem I have is that the bow tie necklace is actually too stiff to look good when you try to tie it and the clasps are so heavy on a lot of them that they constantly spin around to the front. Still not bad for the price.
4.0,"I like the shoes, I normally order a size 10 when ordering Skechers shoes, but these were slightly smaller than expected."
4.0,"This is an exquisite bikini.  I love that it isn't the boring usual style.  It has more of a sporty, yet feminine look.  The top is a great floral pastel print with a high neck.  It does have a little support and fits as expected, based on the size.  The bottoms are adorable yet a little skimpy in the back.  They have the solid pink fabric, criss-crossed with the same floral print as the top.  I can't wait to show this one off this summer.  This is a great 'stay-put' suit for those who like to move around and actually swim.  Recommend.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"When I ordered this for my granddaughter I got her normal size, in a three tea. When the package arrived, the label read 2 to 3 years! That wasn‚Äôt going to work much different in sizing so make sure you read the size chart. Beautiful top though, absolutely beautiful"
4.0,Love the bright red color
4.0,I absolutely loved these for my beach vow renewal. They looked so expensive but were the quality of a beauty supply store accessory. Be careful when using them
4.0,"Fits true to size. A little long, but I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù. Thick fabric and not see through."
4.0,"These are good socks. I have noticed that they have strings hanging from them after use of 2 months. Otherwise, I would give them 5 stars."
4.0,Wiggly
4.0,"This is a pretty pendant--very shiny.  It's rather light, and the edges within the design are a bit sharp.  It is a nice piece for the price and a &#34;keeper.&#34;"
4.0,Love it fits as it‚Äôs should
4.0,Light weight slip on shoe.
4.0,"Pros:<br />-Well packaged and sealed.<br />- Fine mesh strap with sturdy clasp and joints.<br />-Colour matches the Pebble Time Steel in gold perfectly and makes it nice to pair with jewelry.<br />-Watch comes with 4 pins, 2 for the watch and 2 extra as replacements along with a watch adjustment tool.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Pins for the straps are not quick release and require a bit of fidgeting to get into the watch.<br />-Clasp doesn't always lock and close properly (can risk watch strap coming loose and falling if not on properly)<br />-No instructions on how to adjust the sizing so it took a couple Google searches for me to find a video that explained this.<br />-Finish on the end of the watch strap is quite pretty but ends up getting tucked on the inside when the watch is on.<br />-Very long strap for a woman's wrist."
4.0,"The glasses are well made and should last a long time, magnet is powerful and always works.<br />Love it and recommend it highly."
4.0,"Fits great very thick material, I‚Äôm 5‚Äù7 and wish it was a little longer ....But over all great dress!!!!"
4.0,Love these support socks. Just right. I have purchased others and can't get them on easily and cut off circulation.
4.0,cute and whimsical watch.<br />band was to small had to replace<br />it. but it works and came on time.
4.0,"Large stated, up to 43"" waist. Would not fit larger than a 38"" waist.  Other than that good items for the price."
4.0,Muy fresca y lindo color
4.0,"I received a lot of compliments on this dress. It was shorter than I had expected it to be, but I am also 5'7&#34;. It is made of a spandex material."
4.0,"Great color & length.  A bit heavier than my other popcorn sweaters, but feels nice.  Overall, great sweater."
4.0,Happy Pride!
4.0,Works well for the money.
4.0,Super cute and great price but they definitely run small.  I have average sized calved and it takes some work to get them up above my boots.
4.0,I liked the way it pulled on but I ran into trouble when it didn't want to fit below my breasts because of too much fabric and too short of straps. It basically wanted to fit over half my breasts which caused puckering from my bra below.
4.0,I very much like the softness of this fabric. I toss and turn a bit before I fall asleep and the silky fabric doesn‚Äôt grab the sheets. I love everything about these PJ‚Äôs except the large neck.
4.0,"I have fine, short curly hair so I would have preferred  less material, in other words, not so much material hanging down the back--a slightly snugger fit.  Other than that, I am pleased with the sleep cap."
4.0,"Good quality, clips worked and attached firmly to the tie. Material seems good, not the best. paying the price you get it for, it is worth it!"
4.0,"I have three daughters, and I bought these for them as Christmas presents.  They are all about 5‚Äô2‚Äù-5‚Äô3‚Äù, and range from 110 to 125 pounds, but they have very different body types.  The youngest is a slim size 0/2 14-yr-old, 110 lb.  I would usually buy an extra small for her, but the small fit her, except the cap sleeves creep up and aren‚Äôt quite big enough.  The next oldest, age 16, is a curvier size 6, 125 lb, shorter waisted with longer legs.  She has the medium (usually fits a small), and she says her sleeves creep up too, but otherwise a good fit.  The oldest couldn‚Äôt wear this dress.  She is 115 lb, athletic build, slim hips with really strong, broad shoulders.  This dress just looked silly, in either the small or medium.  No way would the sleeves come close to staying on her shoulders, just bunched up on top.  The color is a pretty dark magenta, not really purple.  The fabric is a nice drapey weight, but I wouldn‚Äôt put this in the dryer.  I hang dry to maintain the length, which falls just to the knee on my petite girls.  The favorite thing is the twirly skirt.  It would be so fun to dance in (with shorts/spanx underneath!)."
4.0,These look nice and are nice and dark against the sun. At $19 they are a little pricey. They come with a good hard case which is nice.
4.0,"The color is totally wrong, it said light pink, but it‚Äôs orange/melon colored."
4.0,Came pretty quick
4.0,Cute! Lots of compliments!
4.0,"Very Happy with these cute, warm and well fitting slippers."
4.0,Wish I had sized down.
4.0,very cute.. somewhat light weight... will make a great chrastmas gift
4.0,I don't have anything native to say about this dress
4.0,"El vestido muy bonito, yo mido 5‚Äù5 y peso 144lbs, lo compr√© m√©dium y me quedo ancho.  Me deje llevar por la tabla y no me funcion√≥.  Pero el color me encant√≥, el material no est√° mal pens√© que era mejor."
4.0,"I like it, but it shrinks when I dry it. So I just wash and air-dry."
4.0,"Belt is just as advertised , good fit and exact colour shipped on time so 4 stars until i wear it a few times to test durability but so far it's great"
4.0,Bought for a roaring 20s New Years party. I am normally between a  medium and large and bought an XL and it fit perfect. I am 5‚Äô3 and approx. 160 lbs. The accessories that came with it were the quality you would expect from a Halloween store -  not the best but worked for the occasion. Some beads popped off the necklace and the headband fit kind of tight.
4.0,No joke in the front
4.0,"Felt a bit baggy, but still pretty happy with it. Specially for the price!"
4.0,Very cute. Typically size 12 and this fit perfect. Bought for school musical. Will look great on stage. She may even wear it on occasion.
4.0,Got This for my husband and he is very pleased
4.0,"Fabric feels nice, fits nice, goes well with jeans."
4.0,My daughter loves these boots and she wore them the day after delivery ! They seem to be comfortable and stylish for my little Diva
4.0,A little smaller than what my size is compared to the size chart. But cute!
4.0,I think so far it‚Äôs a good product. I wasn‚Äôt asking much from it and the shoes does what I need it to do.
4.0,The bag was smaller than I anticipated but I was surprised at how much you can actually pack in it! It works well as a women‚Äôs gym bag or overnight bag. I LOVE the sections for shoes at the bottom and there are two sections inside; one for fresh clothes and one for a wet towel/sweaty workout clothes too. There is a small pocket on the front ideal for keys and a pocket on the inside for phone/wallet/coin purse. The only thing missing is a long strap for over the shoulder carrying ease.
4.0,Ok - So I made adjustments to this 'dress' as it was really short on!  So I cut off a little of the length and made a tunic top out of it - SOOO CUTE and I have gotten lots of complements!!
4.0,I like the way they fit. I‚Äôm not use to big sunglasses but let‚Äôs see if they pass the sisters test LOL!<br />No matter what I‚Äôm keeping these!!!
4.0,Little heavy but breatheable material!
4.0,"It's a pretty good bra. Fairly true to size (if you know your REAL size, measure under bust and bust. Under bust measurement = band size. Subtract under bust from bust, count your cups using UK cup sizes. Convert to US/EU etc.). Though it is extremely stretchy, like STRETCHY. Cups are really great. I reinforced the gore with a non stretchy fabric to keep it from stretching to far and digging into breast tissue. Is discontinued I believe."
4.0,"I‚Äôve purchased from this vendor & others who are Chinese.  To get a jersey to fit my broad American shoulders, I need to get a 2XL jersey. (In US street clothes I usually get a size 14 or large top).  This jersey fit my shoulders but is easily 6‚Äù longer than needed (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù tall) it completely covers my butt.  I kept the jersey as it‚Äôs bright & has a nice design but hope the designers in China note that broad shoulders does not necessarily equate to being extremely tall, perhaps they are just using men‚Äôs sizing & marketing to women?  Don‚Äôt know if this length issue is the same for smaller sizes - something to keep in mind."
4.0,- and he seems to like it!  It would be nice to have a few more versions/designs so I can buy him another one next year!
4.0,It is ok but not what I expected as a sweat shirt.
4.0,"This cover up is subtly see through and comfortable to wear around the beach/surrounding restaurants. The fabric is a kind of a light, coarse chiffon that kept me cool. However, the photos advertised definitely make it look more vibrant and form flattering on the model when it is fluttering in the wind. I was surprised to find that it really is just a giant rectangle and makes me look a little formless. The aqua color is really more of a lighter, dull blue.<br /><br />I am 5'2'' and thin -- it is pretty long on me and falls around my ankles, so I would not purchase if you are more than an inch or two shorter than me. Other than that, I enjoy wearing it, and did not notice any weird smells that another reviewer pointed out."
4.0,"This fits a little tighter than I was expecting, but it still works. It covers the belly fat and has a good pop of color. I will not be purchasing another of it's type. However, it wasn't bad enough to return. BTW, I always review sizing and reviews prior to purchasing to ensure the correct fit (as much as possible - but sometimes I am surprised by incorrect descriptions)."
4.0,"The fit is a little big, but the material is very soft and the shirt is over all quite comfortable. The way the shirt is folded in the front lays a little weird but its still a cute shirt."
4.0,Better than I expected. Perfect for a costume. Good fit for a large head (literally a large in hats that come in those kinds of sizes)
4.0,head came off but I just glued it back on
4.0,Very very thin a little bet loose so u can go down a size but over all super cute and pretty
4.0,Makes for a great gift for yourself or anyone else. The pendent is a slightly reflective stainless steel metal. The workmanship is good. The necklace isn't super heavy but you can feel that it is solid. All of the etchings are a good depth so they won't rub away easily over time. The metal also seems the been resistant to fading or rubbing but only time will tell on this.
4.0,"The material is a little cheap, but it is exactly as it looks in the picture"
4.0,"The perfect variety pack. A pair for the car, the purse, the night stand, the desk, and the kitchen. No metal pieces touch my skin so no breakouts or scarring. Will be ordering again."
4.0,These earrings are super cute and comfortable. I would say there is slightly variation from the picture just because its hard to accurately see the colors on the picture. Overall wonderful.
4.0,Just a tad snug
4.0,"Other Officers Like it, adds to my uniform."
4.0,I play soccer and after a game putting on my helmet before riding my motorcycle home means I get my helmet all sweaty. Gets pretty smelly after a while and washing the liners doesn't always get rid of the smell and its a pain. I am hoping this skull cap will eliminate or greatly reduce the problem. I used it this week (it was 102 when we played) and it seemed to do a pretty good job of reducing the sweat transfer. Didn't eliminate it but did stop a lot of it.
4.0,"Didn't run into any trouble using these to size up my lobes. I just had a bit more gunk than when I had my steel kit. Bonus, they all come pre sorted and labeled where as I've had other kits where they were not."
4.0,"Fits perfect even though the package, upon opening---says &#34;Small/Medium.&#34;  That's deceptive--so go ahead and try them on when you get them.  I'm a man's size 11 and the socks fit very comfortably."
4.0,"Posted as it looks in person, great purchase and I love it!"
4.0,"Great shirt ,but made of of cheap blouse materials. I'd still wear it ,because what do expect it was less than ten dollars did have to lace it ,but that isn't very hard."
4.0,Fun wallet. Just got it and like it. I'm hoping it will last too.<br /><br />I do wish that this billfold had pockets for three cards per side instead of two.
4.0,It fit a little smaller then I hoped but I have hips and booty it covers well just not as high waisted as it is in the picture..but it still looks great.
4.0,A little different from the same product in a different color? Runs a little small in the waist compared to the other discovery pants.
4.0,Fits snuggly
4.0,Cool idea I hope it last awhile
4.0,Seems to be cut narrowly
4.0,One of the apron ties was installed twisted so I had to restring it.
4.0,It is the right size and is a good fit'
4.0,Cool breathable cotton material. The size is a little off; Bought a medium which fits like a large.
4.0,Use inches or mm so people can measure fooooooots
4.0,"La tela y su color es muy favorable y la talla es la correcta. Las mangas son realmente grandes, mucho m√°s de lo que uno logra apreciar en la imagen, si no deseas aumentar talla en la parte de arriba visualmente hablando, no te recomiendo esta opci√≥n."
4.0,Nice but runs too small
4.0,I am impressed with how comfortable this product is.  I only wish I'd ordered XL instead of L.  The sleeves have a tendency to creep up about an inch. I will order the next ones XL.
4.0,I like the way they fit on my face and they feel comfortable.
4.0,Good ties for the price.  The back loop to hold the tie in place is very cheap and falls of after a couple wears.
4.0,"I ordered the size Medium and they fit well, the bottoms are sized a little smaller than what I would consider a normal medium but they still fit me so it's not an issue.  The fabric is super soft and after laundering they still look good.  The collar gets a little floppy but with this soft fabric that's not surprising.<br /><br />I'm over 50 so I get hot flashes at night so I appreciate pajamas that can keep me warm when I need them to and have breathability when I'm experience a hot flash. These are great for that.  I'm happy with these pajamas and will probably order more from this company in the future.<br /><br />Don't forget you can use Amazon Smile when you shop to donate to your favorite charity!

4.0,I love how it fitted my body well and the split up the side was not too much. You can honestly dress this up or down.
4.0,Nice but they are a bit small.
4.0,"So far, my husband loves them and have gotten compliments on their behalf."
4.0,"It fits on my SGW-100 watch perfectly, hence replacing my old broken wristband. But it seems that this is a different kind of plastic than the original."
4.0,LINING IS POOR QUALITY THOUGH
4.0,Very nice sweater. Fit was okay. Would prefer a large over size medium so the open front will overlap.
4.0,They fit nice and seem like they‚Äôll be warm.  Very comfortable and seems to be great materials.
4.0,"The stone doesn't look like a genuine topaz, it looks more like a cubic zirconia But the color is pretty. The seller should update the metal and stone description. Otherwise the product arrived quickly and packed nicely."
4.0,I love it but does not fit so will return<br />Robin Salinas
4.0,Size was just a little tight through chest and arms. Beautiful style and material.
4.0,"Warm and attractive, but as a size 8-10 I find it hard to believe it could stretch enough to really fit most."
4.0,Love this look
4.0,"I gave them a 4 star just because I like the style, but they are too small my kids use a 1.5 I use a 3.5. I bought them thinking big, but I think the sizes are wrong. they are more like a 2 the same for the adults."
4.0,"Nice sleep set, well made, the pants are long enough for someone who is 5'10&#34; or taller. I will hem so that I can wear them."
4.0,"Unlined boots were advertised....that's what was wanted....what we recieved were lined boots.....they fit, quality is good, comfortable, but not what was ordered."
4.0,I ordered a 5T for my little girl who is 3 and solidly wears a 3T typically. This fits just right really and she will outgrow it long before she is in most 5T clothing.
4.0,They were way to small but customer service was awesome.  I would give them a 5 star rating.
4.0,"Clover off center, however still beautiful"
4.0,"Super cheap and they scratch ... a lot.  But it feels good.  And if your rough on things like I am, don‚Äôt ruin a $1,200 ring.  This is my third.  Lost one.  Wore one out."
4.0,The top fits great the bottom ran small
4.0,Good hat nice fit
4.0,"I was surprised how well these belts worked, since they were so inexpensive. The plastic buckles are sturdy and functional. Two spare buckles are included, plus a clip on attachment for keys. The nylon webbing isn't real thick,  but it's quite strong and doesn't stretch.<br />We'll see how long these last, but for the price, I have no complaints.<br />They also look cool."
4.0,"I had ordered these shoes in blue, but I had to return them, they were too big, but since they did not have the blue in a smaller size, I ordered the tan color. it fits perfect, I have another pair from this company, in green at I love those also very much, just wish I could get these shoes in blue, I would order immediately."
4.0,The stripe on the sides is a printed ribbon.  I thought it was in the material.
4.0,"Great umbrellas design, but wish it was a folding one that wa smaller."
4.0,Very pretty but a bit larger than I had anticipated.
4.0,"I really like the hat it does the job very well .however the gloves are for light winter ,not best for very cold days ."
4.0,This shirt looks good on my son and he likes it for biking or running. It fits well and I like the bright colors. It doesn‚Äôt seem super high quality but should last for his needs. Overall a good purchase.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and seems quality, but I measured myself and used the sizing chart they suggested which had me order a larger size than normal. When I got it the dress was too big. Luckily, the return was very simple and I got a smaller dress that I love!"
4.0,"I liked the style and look of these glasses, but they were just a bit too snug on my face."
4.0,Good but not as i expected it is a little bit thin
4.0,My husband really likes these slippers.  First time we have purchased this brand.  The final judgment will be how sturdy they are in addition to being comfortable.<br />Final judgment...the sole of one of the slippers came apart after only 2 months.  He wears them 90% in the house and 10% outside...very disappointed.<br /><br />Received in the guaranteed time.
4.0,Used as a head wrap worn around the house on in zoom meetings and to the store.
4.0,"For the price these are the greatest pair of glasses I've ever bought. Although you get what you pay for. Very dark lenses,  light weight.... Cheaply made, but what do you expect. As often as I lose or break glasses I will definitely be buying more."
4.0,Good compression ankle sock
4.0,Very pretty and good quality but the x-small was too small and the dress was too long. I'm 5 ft tall and weigh 112lbs.
4.0,Runs a size small - I usually wear either xl or xxl - the shirt was way small and I don‚Äôt have a big chest
4.0,"Suave, ligera y calientita; incre√≠ble color y muy combinable. S√∫per adhoc con la temporada navide√±a."
4.0,It‚Äôs works good but feels real cheap.
4.0,‚ù§Ô∏è This
4.0,"Master Replica's Barbossa necklace is a good approxomation of the movie prop. It looks a bit undersized but its shape and details are about right. If you are putting together a Barbossa display or costume, you need this prop."
4.0,I bought this for my granddaughter who is 8 years old.  It was a little big for her but she loves it.  Good price and gift for the money.
4.0,"Bought these for my 17 yr old daughter because I guess bear slippers are cool.  Who knew?!<br />Anyways, they‚Äôre cute but she said they definitely make her feet hot.  Oh, and they are a huge tripping hazard.  But when your kid is 17 yrs old and tripping, you can laugh at them and not be a jerk.<br />She likes them, and I get some comedy out of watching her, it‚Äôs a win-win."
4.0,"I have a hard time with metal backs on earrings, these little guys work great.  Terrific value."
4.0,Colors not as vibrant as picture but fits well. I got xxl I am 6'2 220 but fit
4.0,Great fit and great price. Almost like the original lenses. Just not quite as clear
4.0,"It didn't hug certain curves like I thought it would but was pleased by the quality! Was hoping it would be tighter by the hips, even zipped."
4.0,Fits real good while I‚Äôm working out
4.0,"The shirt I received was too small, but when i contacted the seller they were very considerate and helpful. I suggest ordering a couple sizes bigger than what you are actually looking for."
4.0,"I wore these for a few days recently and they seemed fine. I didn't have a reaction to the metals, which was good. They were extremely easy to get on. The thing I didn't like was that the stem sticks out farther than the opal bezel. It seems like a weird design. I guess it had to be that way but I couldn't tell from the product pictures. I love earrings without backs--I find them very uncomfortable--so overall I liked these a lot. They are great to sleep in. I forgot they were there. And they never fell out for me. I just took off one star for what seems like a slightly strange design that I think could be improved with a little more thought."
4.0,"Used this on a costume for my daughter's school project, the perfect little touch, thanks!"
4.0,"These are great for summer. They give the no-socks look while making shoes more comfortable and protecting insoles from perspiration. I've purchased these before and I find the newest version better made than the first ones I bought. One thing to remember: If they are put in a dryer, they will shrink and the rubber that keeps them from slipping will not be as effective. Always hang them dry."
4.0,Material seemed more fitting than it is
4.0,If you take it off and  on the rope weakens easily.
4.0,pretty but too small in size.
4.0,"Its a nice bikini of the Jamaican flag I always wanted. I am 4'9"" 150lb and I normally wear a medium or size8-10 so I got the medium. I am pear shaped meaning I am smaller up top and larger at my hips and butt. The top fits as expected but the bottoms are a bit tight. Overall nice swimsuit!"
4.0,"I ordered these in 34 FFF even though I'm a 34 G.  The fit is as I expected, slightly small but then I ordered smaller because they didn't have a G (which can be hard to find). They're very comfortable and do offer good support. My only issue would be that they're most definitely NOT lightly padded. These suckers have full on padding. They'll be fine for winter and spring but I'm now on the hunt for something a little more lightweight that still offers good support for summer time."
4.0,Very nice in person. I had given them as a gift and was very happy to do so.
4.0,It's a very nice watch
4.0,It‚Äôs the exact one I ordered. I love it but the clip is broke.<br />Which wouldn‚Äôt normally be a big deal for me but it‚Äôs for my work keys and I don‚Äôt want it to be clipped and it fall off since the clip is broken.
4.0,"I was going to return this band because it seems to be too big for my wrist but I do like the quality and it was very easy to attach to my Apple 38mm 2nd generation watch. I chose black to replace my Apple silicone band that was stretching out of shape. I will continue to review whether there are bands for narrow wrists and whether I can find one in gray.<br />Other than that wrist size, it was good!"
4.0,You can't adjust half of them well so they're too big and just slide off. Very disappointing.
4.0,This suit is really cute!!!
4.0,great colorvand great fit
4.0,Fantastic.  I have Lupus so I must keep bare skin out of the sun.  Couldn't be better.
4.0,"The bag meets my standards. But the only problem I observed was the phone pouch by the side, which does not accommodate the modern mobile phones currently in vogue now, as they were designed for the older versions of mobile phones that were slim and narrow. They should expand the pouch to take in new and modern phones by making it wider."
4.0,"They were cute, but the black paint peeled off and it got my ear infected..."
4.0,I love this dress but I gave it 4 stars because I did not like the choker part around the neck.  Would love for this to have been a halter and the front of the dress to be higher
4.0,"This bag is perfect for a future bride, gift for mom or a friend, or to treat yourself. If giving it to a future bride, they could use it to store all wedding day supplies and accessories and the best part is they can use it every day after! This bag can be used for anything. My favorite part about this bag is the price. I looked for a well priced simple cute bag similar to this one for a while but most were well above $20. I can confirm that there is a lot of storage space inside and it has a small zip pocket inside for personal items."
4.0,The arms are very long may be difficult to shorten Otherwise nice looking top material silky lightweight
4.0,"Cute dress. I'm 5'4&#34;, I wear size 10 pants and 38c bra.  After reading the reviews I ordered an XL.  I think a large would have been a better fit. The arm holes are a little big but it's a really cute dress.  It can be worn casual or dressed up. The fabric is very soft and feels like it should cost way more than it does. I'm very happy with the purchase."
4.0,nice but run small
4.0,"This bag holds all my stuff fairly conveniently but I needed to purchase a small change pouch to make it fully functional.  The zipper section that hold credit cards opens wide enough to allow fairly easy access to them but was then too wide for my tastes for holding cash.  To make it work for me, I had to put my cash in the interior zipper section so I had no place for loose change.  If the bag were just a little wider, it would perfect but as it is it looks a little over-stuffed when all my ""necessities"" are in it."
4.0,leave intied
4.0,"Scarf pin was very nice. Have worn it already. It was packaged well, arrived as stated and I would order a similar item in the future without concern."
4.0,"I got these sunglasses for the horrible NM winds and blinding sun. They work like a charm. Downside is the Orange bars on the side tend to pull my hair out if I'm not careful about it, hence the four stars."
4.0,"First let me say I am tall and big (6' 2"" and 300lb) so I like the long length, but the sleeve holes are huge, I could almost put my head in them.  I have no problem pulling them way up over my elbow.  Weird cut.  I am going to keep them but be advised if you are smaller that me."
4.0,"I bought this for my daughters Amelia Earhart costume, and it's a great fit."
4.0,"Although the watch is super stylish, at first didn't like it.  But the more I wear it, the more I like it to the point I never take it off.  The watch is well packaged, and stylish.  Keeps good time and easy to set.  The only negative is the watch instructions suck, went on youtube and found out how to set the watch. Wish the alarm was little louder but works perfectly.  Overall, a cheaper, stylish watch that is waterproof and comfortable.  Couldn't ask for more."
4.0,Fits good nice
4.0,I like the top but it's kind of loose fitting and it's see through a bit.  I will use over a bathing suit.
4.0,"All around great glasses, perfectly heavy enough to stay on your head!"
4.0,No le doy 5 porque se ve√≠a m√°s elegante en la foto
4.0,"Great material, fits perfectly, can sneak one cross body bra strap in there, interesting... But two people in one day saw the white on my arm and thought it was a bandage. The arm bits don't look like part of the top, which is cool except for the looking wounded part üòï"
4.0,"I really did like this product. Good for switching out your tongue rings often, because these do collect plaque on them easily. They weren't easy to clean & I swallowed one ball while eating :/ other than that, they were very good & pretty."
4.0,Good quality...only problem is that it is not made in USA.
4.0,"A little snug as your putting it on, but once it is it's wonderful to look at.üòä"
4.0,"Really big necklace, but really great if love big necklaces. Not for a petite person. Colors are a little different, so don't expect it to look exactly like the picture, which was why I gave 4 stars."
4.0,very smart looking--just too small thru the hips.
4.0,Love it. Took one star off because it gets twisted up a lot
4.0,"Love these bags! They‚Äôre durable, great space, and look nicer than a gym bag."
4.0,Sounds pretty good for a Beanie! : )
4.0,"They arrived on time and are very cute. They are comfortable and keep my legs feeling cool and relieved all day long. They were just a bit long for me, but I'm oly 5'2&#34;. I just roll them down an inch."
4.0,"Returned but not because I didn't like it. In fact, I loved the linen-ish texture of fabric. Problem is that it didn't accessorize well with my existing wardrobe."
4.0,"The frock is beautiful...its just like the photograph displayed here....I had purchased a 130 cm as a birthday gift to my 6 year old niece (frozen fan) who is thin but 110 CMs tall...thanks to the previous reviews, I had bought 2 sizes up, the dress just fits her right...she may be able to wear the dress for another 6-8 months hopefully..its high time the manufacturer provides a proper size chart instead of one which depends on the height of the child..."
4.0,My son love these
4.0,Works and my daughter loves it
4.0,Beautiful skirt but runs extremely small. I had to fight with it a bit and wriggle into into.
4.0,Looks nice. Easily bent
4.0,"FITS GREAT. GREAT FOR FALL AND SPRING. CAMPING/OUTDOORS, AND JUST LOOKING SUPER COOL.<br />I ORDERED BLUE BUT GOT GREEN INSTEAD. ?"
4.0,"The Egyptian beaded headpiece is well made. Only issue is the short strands on front are a little long.  1 or 2 less gold beads would be perfect, but still love it! Once I put on a wig, there was no issue with the front beads."
4.0,"its a really nice leather bracelet but as a male i thought it would be cool to surf with , but its a little small"
4.0,"Very high waisted, but great other than that."
4.0,only reason not 5‚≠ê is bc the  isn't as clear as expected.
4.0,Good value for the money.  Has some polyester and may be a bit warmer than 100% cotton.  The belt could be a bit more generous but it is serviceable.
4.0,Great fit! Excellent support!
4.0,"Great t-shirt. Fits and washes well, material is good quality. Not very soft."
4.0,"It‚Äôs tiny! I mean tiny - I definitely expected something bigger for the price. The picture is misleading. However, it‚Äôs cute and would be great for a layering piece."
4.0,The earrings are bigger than I expected and the necklace has a weird back on it.
4.0,nice cap for the money - sharp clean look
4.0,Ordered an xl originally but it was too large. I‚Äôm a DDD bust so I always buy larger. Didn‚Äôt need to buy a size up this time
4.0,Tiny! Didn't pay attention to size but will be cute to wear in my 2nd hole. Also would be a great gift for a little girl.
4.0,"Love the jacket and color, but was a little larger then expected."
4.0,"Love the color, print, fit, and style, but absolutely can not stand the clasp. For the life of me I can‚Äôt get it to connect on my own unless I‚Äôm looking at at. The clasp also feels like very cheap metal that could break at any time. I‚Äôm planning on replacing the clasp or sewing it together before using it again. The rest of the suit is perfect. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù approx 205 lbs, curvy, and I ordered an XL. It fits great and covers my problem areas nicely. Probably wouldn‚Äôt not order again in the future unless the clasp design was improved, but otherwise a great quality suit!"
4.0,My husband loves it. And purple is my favorite color. I bought two of these and wear them every day in the house. However they didn't get 5 stars because they are thin.
4.0,"I wanted pants that were appropriate for work and didn't fit like yoga pants so I ordered a size up. Still too tight. I'm 5'5 and 126lbs and got the large. This is the third pair of pants that I've bought larger than my size so they don't hug my butt enough to make a horizontal crease. Super disappointed that this was MORE money wasted. Other than the size problem, they are nice. Just be aware, they definitely have a shine to them. Which also doesn't work for what I'm using them for."
4.0,"I really enjoy the way this brand fits me. The pants are extremely comfortable. They look like dress pants, but they feel more like yoga pants. Unfortunately, these ran a little bit big on me. I have other styles in this size that fit me well, but these seem to run just a little bit on the large side. If you are in between sizes, I would recommend sizing down. The length was perfect for me."
4.0,"The box came damaged with screws missing as a result, we used screws from a previosly retired, used umbrella that we are disposing of. Other than that its nice."
4.0,Gift for sister.  Hope it is as large as it says for her wrist.
4.0,I like it but it was a lot smaller than I thought.
4.0,"I very liked, except for the bag because they sent me another"
4.0,This is a nice quality tee but a little larger than expected and price a little steep.
4.0,this was a nice dress.  I just did not need it.  wish sleeves were not so fitted.
4.0,"I have a small head and the hat is a tad tight.  HOWEVER, I know it will stay on in a wind..  Love the look, though!  I'm hoping it will ease a bit in the wearing.  Cool hat!"
4.0,These sandals provide terrific arch support. My sister recommended them to me after her podiatrist told her about them. She bought several pair and loves them all. I bought a pair and wore them all summer. They provide great arch support and relief for tired feet if you've been wearing dressier shoes all day. I recommended them to a friend who liked the first pair so much she bought them in different colors and has been a happy wearer ever since.
4.0,I love the style of these but they do run a bit large. I'd reorder in a 1/2 size smaller but the price goes up. I'm keeping the pair that is a bit big because I love the look of them.
4.0,Merchandise was received as advertised.
4.0,Look great fit is average and comfortable hold up well in bright sun. What you expect from RY-Bn
4.0,Very nice golf shirt for the price it is what it is
4.0,its a very cute little belt and stretches well :D I am enjoying using it in my outfits and think its cute :)
4.0,They are socks.  They are new and soft.  The best part is that they don't fit tight.  They don't make my legs itch or imprint the design of the sock on my leg.  I could do without the light blue for winter but in a pair of boots no one can see the socks so the color doesn't matter.
4.0,The wallet is a bit stiff but the this technology tends to make things a bit stiff and if it does its job that is great!  The wallet has loads of slots for cards and certainly fills my need.
4.0,"The bracelet was beautiful! However, it is quite large. Being stretchy, it would have been nice if it were a bit more snug. Excellent for someone with larger wrists than mine!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8520a7afca8225bf6d5ccc1614067c7e]] Very shiny gold yellow, which is not my favorite.  I compared it to my expelliamus bracelet with a softer more realistic gold color and there is a significant difference.  I don‚Äôt know what this yellow color is called, but if you don‚Äôt mind it, the bracelet is pretty"
4.0,"Brownells Acraglas epoxy bedding kit can help a lot to improve the consistency of shots on an old rifle with a loose-fitting or soft wood stock.  Acraglas is a VERY strong and rigid industrial epoxy, that seems much harder when dry than the epoxies that you can buy at a hardware store.  The kit comes with brown coloring powder to approximately match the epoxy to the wood stock color.  Black powder may also be included; I don't recall. There is also a similar Acraglas GEL kit available that is more appropriate if you have a very loose stock or large voids in the stock to fill.<br /><br />However, I would only recommend this Acraglas kit for someone who is handy in the shop and carefully follows directions.  This is not a one-hour project.  You need to follow the directions exactly and use the release compound properly. If you make mistakes you can either epoxy your gun's receiver to the stock, or wind up having to grind or sand down excess hard epoxy.  One alternative is to find an inexpensive wood replacement stock, say on an auction site or at a gun show, and do a practice job on that stock first.<br /><br />You'll also really need two well padded gun vises or shop vises to carefully hold the stock as you work (padded ski vises will also work).  Or you can improvise with some padded wood blocks screwed or glued together on some plywood.<br /><br />If you are not up to careful shop work, then epoxy bedding a rifle it is a job better left to a gunsmith.  If the gun is very expensive, then in any case I would have a gunsmith do the bedding.<br /><br />Another thing to consider before buying a bedding kit is that many companies now make fairly inexpensive rigid polymer replacement stocks for many rifles.  You can often find these used on auction sites and at gun shows. You may get satisfactory improvement just by switching to one of these stocks (and saving the nice-looking original stock for if you sell the gun.)"
4.0,Fit fine.  I just didn‚Äôt like how it looked.
4.0,Great fabric super soft
4.0,I like this tshort a lot. It's a good material and is very well made. I gave 4 stars because I thought the shirt was a little on the distressed black look.. its just a regular black tshirt. Still good though.
4.0,"I like the design so I ordered it for a family friend.  But when it arrived it was smaller then we thought it would be, so I had to return it."
4.0,"The band is a little shorter than the original, but it is a Casio and fits the watch perfectly as described. As others have described, it takes some patience to install."
4.0,"I read reviews and ordered based on recommendations. I understand the dress is made to be blousy, but a Large practically swallowed me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 170lbs, currently 3 weeks PP so wanted something to hide the belly. I‚Äôm not sure that a medium would have been a better fit; I‚Äôm somewhere in between the two sizes I suppose. Fabric is heavier but soft, quality is good. Overall, would purchase again, just maybe after I lose a few more pounds and can size down."
4.0,These were for my son -must like okay -hasn't said otherwise
4.0,"Great for necklaces for kids.. was perfect for 4 year old since they could put over their heads, some older kids couldn't. a couple of clasps broke right away..but I had enough to make what needed."
4.0,"Nice quality, running size to size , arrived as described."
4.0,"I am a size 4 and bought the size 4s, which are way too big! I spoke to a nice rep at Carhart who said they are not supposed to shrink very much, so I guess I have to go down a size‚Ä¶. but oh no! Nobody has size 2s! : ("
4.0,Love that these are cheaper on Amazon! This one is so cute! It‚Äôs as$less.
4.0,"I didn't notice the &#34;Plus-Size&#34; description for this item. I'm a medium/large man, waist size about 34. I ordered the M size, the smallest offered. The vest is huge around the waist. It's definitely made for larger folks (I wouldn't have labeled this as a &#34;medium&#34;). But I like the style and weight of the vest. It's also lined, so it slides/adjusts comfortably against your clothes (unlike fleece vests). I decided to have it altered by a seamstress. I'm happy with the vest now that it fits.<br /><br />After the purchase, Swisswell's customer service reached out to me to ask how they could make this right. They were very thoughtful, so I am adding a star to my review (going from 3 to 4)."
4.0,9 of the 10 were perfection my 10th piece the heart in the middle was missing
4.0,"I thought this item was a pair, i only received one of them. I will order another one..."
4.0,For the<br />Rice I laid it was a heck of a deal for a really neat conversation starter watch. It actually keeps great time.
4.0,"for the price, you can‚Äôt beat these.  they‚Äôre labeled victoria‚Äôs secret but the fabric feels a bit thicker and stiffer than vs laser cut panties.  and yes they run SMALL.  i‚Äôve included a pic of my vs mediums compared to these in large and you can see that the larges are smaller than the vs mediums.  i may order them again in xl.<br />fwiw, i‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 117 lbs and usu wear a small in vs panties but get the laser cut ones in mediums"
4.0,"This romper is a mixture of comfort with style! The material used to make this romper is listed as 65% cotton, 30% polyester, and 5% spandex. The material soft, of medium thickness, and is comfortable to wear. The design itself is different from most rompers I‚Äôve purchased in the past and features an asymmetrical cut across the chest with a single ruffle. The romper itself features longer shorts than most rompers. I‚Äôve worn it with strappy wedge heels and peep toe wedge sandals without showing too much skin. The romper features one pocket on each side of romper which is very convenient and different from most rompers I‚Äôve purchased. It is recommended by the seller and other customers to purchase the romper one size up because it tends to run small and there are no zippers or buttons to help you put the romper on. This means that you must put on the romper by pulling the asymmetrical ruffle top over your legs and waist before tying the drawstring waist. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 115 lbs and typically wear a small. I ordered a medium as suggested and it fit me but made me appear larger than I am. The drawstring waist helps me to display my true waist size which emphasizes and  flatters my figure. I did not experience any itchy tags or scratchy materials while wearing this romper. One con about this romper is that there is an elastic band on the top part under the ruffle to hold up the top portion of the romper. It does a good job of that however, it digs into the top part of my chest after several hours of wear. Otherwise, I think this is a chic yet comfortable romper which can be worn casually or dressed up."
4.0,"I have bought several leather belts for my husband and I decided to get this one for myself, so I got the smallest size available at the moment, which was a 35, and It fit me perfectly. I am a size 28 in the waist, size 6 in jeans and this belt fit great on the second hole.<br />The leather is nice, but not exactly what I prefer. It is a more shiny leather and I like the softer, more natural looking leather, but I still like this belt. I have worn it several times so far and it's held up nicely. I noticed that the buckle can be taken off in order to cut and size the belt perfectly, so that's great. I will post updates on durability with continued use."
4.0,"These low/no show white socks come 6 to a pack. They are made with 85% nylon and 15% spandex. They feel tight but in a good way like your foot is getting a gentle hug. I need just a bit of support in my arch area and these are perfect. I like that they come up my ankle just enough that my shoe doesn't pull them down off of my heel. My only ding is that they are described as ""thick padded"" and they are not. It works great for most of my shoes but not all. That being said they are well made and feel good. Combine that with a price of less then $10 for 6 pairs and I highly recommend.<br />&lt;Thank you for reading my review. I hope this has helped you in your decision on this product.>"
4.0,"These yoga socks are great! The colors are fun and they really do give good traction. I have balance issues and am usually a little clumsy, but I did not slip or slide in these at all. The fit is a little different at first, but once they stretch out to the shape of your feet, and you get used to something being in between your toes, they are really quite nice to have on. They wash well too. I did not notice any fraying or holes after going in the machine. These are a must have for any serious yoga addict! Disclaimer: I received this product for a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Great plus size swim suit! Hides my belly well.
4.0,I have small arms and the arms are TIGHT. Cute design and fits well otherwise.
4.0,"The frontal panel is a little thin, so it can fold easily, and one size bigger compared to other caps"
4.0,"Covered the kids and adults in our party. One or two of them tore, but they certainly did the job they were intended for. We were glad to have them!"
4.0,Happy to have a bottom that covers enough.
4.0,"The material is soft and I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs wrinkle free, shirt length is just by the hip, arm length and fit is as expected. I just hope it‚Äôs not going to shrink cause It maybe tight if it does. So far I‚Äôm happy with the shirt."
4.0,Warm!! Well made. Cute pom pom.
4.0,Nice product for the price.  Thanks!
4.0,"This is so cute, but the details were slightly off. The blue border along the shorts weren't even on each leg which made it look poorly made. Also, this was too small for me (I couldn't raise my arms), so I let one of my shorter friends have it."
4.0,this bag looks so beautiful. Like it costs much more. The only reason its not perfect is that it has that fishy smell. It is dissipating slowly though.
4.0,"This particular color on me doesn‚Äôt do the shirt justice, however, I can attest to it being incredibly comfortable! I will say I was little disappointed when I first got the shirt because it looked like a square sack with absolutely no shape. Perhaps that‚Äôs because it seems to run large? I wear a small, which I ordered, but the shirt comes down below my hips when I stand normally and the sleeves are very roomy. The advertised mock neck was true to the listing at least, as well as the color being spot-on as to what‚Äôs shown in the pictures.<br /><br />So far the quality and durability have been great. The color hasn‚Äôt faded at all after several washes now and it‚Äôs still as comfortable as it was the first day I got it. It hasn‚Äôt shrunk or stretched either so that‚Äôs a good sign.<br /><br />Overall it‚Äôs an incredibly comfortable and relaxed piece, though it looks a little plain and baggy on its own (without outwear or accessories). I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars for comfort and it being accurate to the pictures, but taking off a star for it running large and having less shape than what it looked like in the pictures."
4.0,Kids said there very comfortable and easy to breath.
4.0,"Was kinda snug, would size up"
4.0,Love these pieces but a bit pricey
4.0,"Very cute, the shirt is super soft. I would have loved to wear it but it came smaller than expected."
4.0,"This shirt is ok but I didn't like a couple of things. One, I wish the neck opening wasn't so wide to where my shoulders nearly showed. I also think this is a shirt that would look a lot cuter on thinner women. I'm 5'8"" and 205lbs and usually wear a size large shirt so maybe if I got a smaller size this would fit better. It is an ok shirt though, just not my favorite."
4.0,I love this dress. It‚Äôs a little see through but it‚Äôs not that bad. It‚Äôs flattering and comfortable.
4.0,"Initially bought them as a gift for my Mom, I bought two pairs and ended up keeping one for myself!"
4.0,Received the 4 colorful lanyards for my masks.  They are a little on the short side but still gets the job done. Can be used for children as well.
4.0,I like how clean and thin these keychains are! They have a film on both sides so they stay really clean. I made a quick keychain and it came out so nice! My only issue is the size. It doesn‚Äôt have a clear description of the size which would make it easier for me to decorate them.
4.0,"Loved this product! The color is a bit different from what is pictured, however, the material is AMAZING. It really hugs and sculpts the body."
4.0,"This dress was gorgeous and fit exactly to the manufacturers measurement chart.  My daughter was May Queen at our church and wore this dress for the occasion.  She received numerous compliments.  I will say this, though:  it was a little bit gapped at the neckline.  This is because the manufacturer appears to be trying to accommodate for the generally curvier American figure (my daughter is *not* large busted.) However the correct way to adapt for this would be to make the darts bigger, not make the shoulders and neck bigger.  Therefore even though it fit exactly as measured, her bosom looked a bit smashed and there was a larger gap at the neckline.  Just the wrong strategy to adapt the pattern, that's all."
4.0,The fit is as described in their size section so was happy with that. It does run a bit longer at the hem. It has a sexy cut and it clings so I like that. The material though is more like pvc so it does get a little warm wearing it and it doesn't look as glittery as the picture.  Definitely more shiny like other pvc dresses I have.
4.0,"Very happy with my purchase, but here are a few things that you may want to know:<br /><br />1.  Go to the product website on Google which will have a lot more helpful pictures than what's here on Amazon to help you make up your mind<br />2.  This is a pretty heavy wallet -- not cumbersome but heavier than it looks<br />3.  I'm an amateur leatherworker and without getting into the technical details, this is good leather -- the kind that will last a long time<br />4.  Design-wise, there are some elements that I don't entirely agree with or understand, and if you buy it, you'll see what I mean.  This is nothing major, just made me question why certain choices were made.  Makes me think that the next version might use the space/material more efficiently.<br />5.  I had to stretch the leather to fit the 5 cards I had in there comfortably.  Easy instructions are given which involve soaking it in warm water."
4.0,"So the reviews said it's too tight on waist and it is. For some reason these pants have  electric and a draw string. The string is just for show. I did however cut out about a foot of elastic very carefully. Now they fit around my waist. Second, these pants sag a lot in the butt area after wearing them for a few minutes. Feels roomy but not looks weird to me. So I'm keeping these as house pants ;-)"
4.0,So far they have been staying in which is more than any other post has done.  Happy with them!  Just hope they don't get worn after a few uses and begin falling off like most
4.0,This belt ran slightly smaller than I thought. It still worked for me but in hindsight would have went a size larger. Also the catch on the inside of the buckle is in a bad position IMO; sometimes when siting down or in the restroom it gets bumped easy and releases without warning. It should need more tension applied to release to be better functioning.
4.0,"Overall this fits really well. I am 5'7&#34;, 115 pounds and I went with the small. It's a pretty nice swimsuit except for the cups for your boobs. They are super rounded and I can't imagine that they would fit anyone very well. I plan to cut them out and stitch the suit back up, but this might not be the right choice for you if you don't feel comfortable doing that yourself."
4.0,The bracelet is absolutely darling. So many charms just perfect for the play. From a scarecrow to monkey to music note to ruby slipper and of course the wicked icon charm. My only issue is the witch hat charm came broken so can't be used. Luckily I took it out the gift box to check it out. Normally I would just exchange it but it is a Christmas gift and there just isn't enough time so I'm just not going to mention it and I doubt they will notice with the large amount of other charms there.
4.0,Nice crosses well made. Perfect couple gift.
4.0,"I love that these are made in the USA, but they &#34;run&#34; and stain your pants when hanging in your pockets."
4.0,Color are very vibrant and the round handle gives it a retro look. It is well stitched and has a nice long strap that can go across the body if so desired. Great mid-size bag.
4.0,I like these. They look and fit great. Not the best for stopping glare of the setting sun. But they are serviceable and look cool. Can't beat the price.
4.0,"Very cute dress but too short. The style is adorable, it‚Äôs flattering on any body type and it‚Äôs a nice material but if you‚Äôre tall, it probably will not work for you. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and it was too short in the front so unfortunately I‚Äôm returning it. The back was plenty long just wish the front was too!"
4.0,These work really well for my husband and me. We use them every night. The fabric and stitching are smooth. Not slippery like satin but not scratchy either. The shades are molded in a form so a secure fit will block out the light but doesn't press against m yeyeballs. My only criticism is they do peel apart after about 6 months. But I don't mind buying another set because the price is pretty low. Two pairs for $10? Come on! I've tried other brands that are prettier and more expensive. They all pressed against my eyes. That's a deal breaker for me.
4.0,They are very soft and have a very nice fit.
4.0,"These glasses work well for reading glasses. I use them in the car when I need to use my smartphone or general reading. However, since these are reading glasses don't use while driving.to handle glare. Use regular sunglasses."
4.0,Nice dress. Fit is smaller than expected. Good quality and fabric but very form fitting.
4.0,"These Non Slip Yoga Pilates Socks are just what I was looking for and the price on sale was great.  They are comfortable and because they're all cotton, my feet don't sweat.  I usually wear a 7-1/2 shoe so the fit was fine for me.  Don't know how they would be on a larger foot but they have a little stretch to them.  Great product."
4.0,I really love the tank and the message. The shirt fits perfectly. Unfortunately the print is not screened printed but more like plastic ironed on. The design was peeling upon first wear. Sucks but about expected for price.
4.0,"I got these compression socks as I found a pair similar, with the same brand at Big 5.  I need them on my right leg due to lymph return problems as a result of a serious accident. The socks do not show but there are a series of ~2 inch lines that run the length of the mid foot when they are put on; I would have preferred a solid black."
4.0,"They are warm and comfortable, but after one winter the back is already starting to separate a little."
4.0,I really the jacket as my Christmas gift from my sister üß°üòäüß°. It‚Äôll hopefully proved be to waterproof from the snow and rainy weathers. It‚Äôs comfortable to keep me warm.
4.0,"Very soft and love the color (pink). However, it is way too long. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and an literally stepping on it. Also, pockets would be a great addition."
4.0,"The necklace itself is great but when you order from Amazon it comes in a cheap plastic sleeve, when ordering from the Jewelry website direct it comes with a nice box for gifting. Wish I knew that before I ordered because these were for bridesmaids and the Amazon one looked really cheapy in the plastic sleeve. I would definitely go to the website direct they were just as fast as amazon, came with a nice gift box, and prices were the same."
4.0,I ordered purple pink and it seems more like a dusty pink. I decided to keep it anyway because I like the style and fit.
4.0,"The reviews and sizing charts indicated these shorts run big. Uh...not even close. My daughter is a YL. I ordered the YM.  Way too small. She is wearing the women's XS.  UA is NOT consistent In their sizing. You should try on before buying. Her entire uniform collection runs between YM and women's XS. Once you get the right size, the clothes are great!"
4.0,Beautiful shirt too large.  Gave it to a friend
4.0,Great slip ons.
4.0,"This dress went above meeting my expectations! I was looking for a holiday dress this year that could double as a dress to wear to my sister's law school graduation ceremony. I ordered it because I had a half off coupon code and decide to give it a go and I am very happy with it! The quality is nice and I like the way it fit, generally I fit a small, but I sized up to a medium due to some reviews suggesting to do so. My measurements for reference are 5' 3"", 127lbs, 34C"
4.0,Very roomie and comfortable across my shoulder.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a small but a lot of room for a purse.
4.0,"So I really enjoy the top of this item, it was very large when I got it but I was able to tighten the straps & that fixed it!<br />The bottoms were a little weird on me. The runches on the piece were just weird. They clothes also don‚Äôt have any tags so you have no idea what‚Äôs the back side or front side"
4.0,This robe is so cute! We bought it for our 3 year old who still loves baby shark. The only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little thin but in Florida that‚Äôs okay.
4.0,"yes i like it alot. my next one i buy,will b the 5mm thanx.."
4.0,"Really like the minimalist wallet, I leave the miscellaneous stuff in my old wallet. Took a couple of minutes to figure out how it works. Would have been nice to have a small sheet of instruction on capacity, useage  and tips."
4.0,"Nice, high quality sunglasses. I did find they were a little big for my face, so I think I need a 53mm size.  Ended up returning only because of the size."
4.0,Very comfortable...great sleep wear
4.0,"Quality is not that great, colors are &#34;shiny&#34;, red is really bright,<br />Great for the price and the skinny size"
4.0,"Although it is ‚Äú flannel ‚Äú, it is a very light weight"
4.0,"Comfortable on my face compared to those disposable masks, unfortunately it was a bit small for me and pulled on my ears."
4.0,I bought this for my cousin and she loved it! It fit well and looks great. :)
4.0,"I had just bought a new bike and was so excited about riding it but by the second day I my bottom was really sore.  I bought these, they fit, are comfortable and fit my purpose. They are exactly what I expected and my bottom is no longer sore when I ride my bike.  If I need another pair  - hopefully smaller if my dieting and exercise work - I'll order these same shorts again."
4.0,"They're very comfortable, but the skirt kind of rises up and doesn't stay in place well. Of course it's nylon so I dont think it's a functional flash, just the nature of the fabric. I enjoy them for my walks"
4.0,Fits well. Needs a tank top underneath. Looks pretty. Have washed on delicate hung to dry. Not sure how long it will last.
4.0,Love the dress but shrinks a bit in the wash
4.0,"I had to order a 2x, I usually weat a large or XL. I'm very top heavy. Cute top"
4.0,"Sizes seem to run on the small side. Otherwise a good product, worth the price."
4.0,Really cute! Just what I wanted.
4.0,Nice quality and fit.  Something needs to be done about the tags sewn into the inside side - rubs against the skin and very irritating.
4.0,"warm, comfortable, washes nicely"
4.0,Very comfortable little boots. They are best used for mostly indoor and a little outdoor. They do have amazing grip on the ice. They are not water proof but somewhat water resistant. They do run small so size up!
4.0,"Soft, thick, comfy, stretchy.... but the gripper bottoms don't extend long enough to the toe and heel for Pilates reformer use."
4.0,good quality and fits well.
4.0,Seem pretty decent; although I hope they hold up at the zippers and stitching around them.
4.0,Pretty long dress.Need a belt  to shorten.But I like it.
4.0,Very nice and well worth the price
4.0,"They‚Äôre very heavy and sort of give me a headache, but they‚Äôre so cute, fun, & a great value for what I paid. Even if I can‚Äôt wear them for long, they‚Äôre novelty & fun for friends & children to play with. I appreciate the paper glasses included as a gift as these I can use."
4.0,"Comfortable and pretty.  These are not as bright a blue as I'd expected, and I really like bright blue, so I was a little disappointed.  But the truth is, they are very pretty, and if you're not expecting them to be really _bright_ blue, they are likely to please."
4.0,I bought this for my girl and she loved it. It fit her perfectly and it great for her playing in the snow.  Escpecially with the snow strom we have the last a couple of week it was great. Took her sliding and finally now snow in the face. She love it.
4.0,needed them for work at fat pussycat.  little big.
4.0,"Love the inscription, exactly as pictured. Be advised, the band itself is rubber."
4.0,"I live in these shoes. Very comfortable, sturdy and long lasting. I have about 6 pair! Only negative is the lining gets a bit smelly quickly. I have never had this problem. Maybe they have changed it by now. I put in new liners."
4.0,"It was easy to adjust and looks nice with my Gear Fit, but the paint is wearing off the bottom side (clasp)"
4.0,"I bought these as comfy sandals that my baby could crawl and toddle around in.  The soles are surprisingly sturdy, and I think these will be OK to get wet.  But most importantly, they are so cute!  The only downside is that they are super easy for my kid to take off, which makes me question the strength of the velcro."
4.0,Kinda Low quality. they get lost pretty easily but for the price I can‚Äôt complain!!!
4.0,A bit thinner fabric. But overall a good buy.
4.0,Perfect for 4th July! Quite soft and comfortable to wear.
4.0,"buen articulo, me quedo un poco grande pero es muy freca"
4.0,"I really like these leggings and have bought two pairs but have noticed an issue since purchased. Both pairs have developed a run right in the middle of the crotch area. It is currently small but the second pair came with the run and the second pair I after seeing the run in the second pair and found a run in those as well.<br />I wonder if this is a coincidence, manufacture error or has to do with the types of workouts I‚Äôm doing (a lot of flexibility work).<br />The run is small right now, but I know it will get bigger as time goes on, which worries me. And for the second pair to arrive with a run is frustrating.<br />I still love these pants and will probably order another pair to see if they all have runs and make my judgement from there."
4.0,"The brim isn't as wide as I thought it would be, and it came all folded up, I'm hoping that the creases will eventually go away. But it's cute, colors are as expected"
4.0,Online the glitter looks gold but they are silver and change colors as you move around. The size ordered was 12-18 months and was too big. Overall it was cute but just not a good fit for my child.
4.0,I don't like the pattern as much as expected from the photo. Other than that they are pretty nice shorts.
4.0,"These are very thin consistent with the low price, and I actually like the light thin shiny material but beware they run small. I wear 2x or 1x usually but these in 2x run quite small. I just ordered another set in 4x."
4.0,I love it. It's comfortable but it runs big. Would order another one just size down.
4.0,You can find full body workouts using this kind of bar on YouTube. It‚Äôs excellent value! I had to take off a star because to truly use this at full capacity in workouts you need to have the ability to roll the bands around the bar to increase tension and this model doesn‚Äôt lend itself to doing that easily. I have to get creative and wrap it around the bar in weird ways to create resistance. Other than that üëçüëç.
4.0,"Very pretty shirt. Well made. A little thin, and a little short, but I'm very tall."
4.0,"These socks are great at this price. Supportive and durable. I just got them out of the first wash, no problems at all. I'm looking forward to seeing how my calves feel after a run!"
4.0,"Very cute comfortable dress.  However, dress is extremely short and even at 5'7 I have to wear it as a shirt.  Still cute."
4.0,Love the design! Great quality.
4.0,"I purchased these pajamas to add to  my collection just for spice.  I'm 5'6, 170lbs, not to curvy.  The fit is true to size with a little give.  The tops fit nicely and the bottoms are not overly loose.  Great fit.  They are cute, comfortable and sexy.  My husband really likes them.  Mmmmhhhmmm."
4.0,"I'm sort of used to dealing with this having had big feet my entire life, but these are a little tight if you're like me. I do think that after wearing them for a while though it won't be as noticeable but if there was another half-size up I probably would have gone with that instead. The material feels really sturdy and they make you feel pretty awesome too!"
4.0,Great but very thin.
4.0,"It's cute, it fits good too. The only thing I don't like is how it sticks up at the bottom in the back a little because it's a fitted skirt but not fitted all the way down. I think it's because my butt isn't flat so it doesn't just go straight down, but it's still cute and it's not a highly noticeable thing. Anyway, looks great and not too short. To some people, it might look short if you're tall. I'm 5'6 and have long legs so people think it's short on me, but mid-thigh isn't short. So don't be discouraged. Great skirt and own your legs!"
4.0,"I lost most of the stones (the entire top, the stones always stayed in the setting) in the first month or so.  However I think this may be an inherent flaw with internally threaded jewelry, rather than this particular product.  For that reason I am not taking any stars away.  I use these in my tragus, but they may function for effectively in a location that isn't constantly being slept on or having a phone touch and loosen them."
4.0,Good product for a great price!
4.0,"Cute I loved these glasses but once it gets scratched it‚Äôs over , really needs to be kept safe."
4.0,"I ordered a Medium (8-10) and it was a little snug. It would still be cute to wear but I'm a little too self conscious about my armpit/back flab sticking out and just a tiny bit sticking out at legs on sides. The colors are bright and fun. The cups have push up pads in them which I love --&#62; the cups fits great. Adjustable straps. Overall, nice suit that disguises and hold in my tummy/pooch area but if you want a looser fitting top then size up. The top was little bit itchy at the seaming.<br /><br />If it helps: I wear a women's Medium on top and bottom or size 8-10. I'm 5'5&#34; and 150 lbs, bra size is 34 C-D."
4.0,The shirt is ok. The material could be nicer and the cuts could be cleaner but for the price it makes sense.
4.0,It was shorter than I expected so the rings fall in an odd place on my wrist but I still like it and wear it every day.
4.0,I ordered these socks for me but I didn‚Äôt like the material. They are not cotton socks. My  husband has been wearing them to work. According to him they are decent pair of socks. The material is a very soft silk like material. He said that it had decent moisture wicking properties and didn‚Äôt slide down as he went about his day. My husbands only complaint was that they were a little snug but he has larger legs. He says they are a step up from his old church socks and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an everyday dress sock.
4.0,"Love the color of these earrings, they sit well on my ears, my only concern is the backs seem to be off in size quite a bit, I am constantly squeezing the backs tight to avoid losing an earring but overall they are nice looking."
4.0,This is a pretty skirt with a distinctive look.  The gold and black fabric looks nice and is soft. The elastic waist has a subtle sprinkle of gold. It doesn't roll or bite but is a tad large. The hem is unfinished which is unfortunate. I don't consider this length midi. It falls just below the knee; classic midis usually come at least to the calf. Cute skirt with less than impressive details.
4.0,"They are comfortable and are still holding up after a year of wear. No awkward seams anywhere and NO TAGS thank god. The colors didn't run off in the wash. They also didn't shrink in the wash. I'm happy and impressed with the quality and comfort. When i need new underwear, I will be sure to buy these again."
4.0,"I purchased this set because I thought it was so cute. This set is definitely not lasting long, costume jewelry. Cute to look at though."
4.0,"I love this hat!!! I want extras so she can wear it 24/7 haha. Even when she cries she looks cute!!! (don't worry she was just inconsolable at the time, she's well cared for, possibly spoiled with hugs)"
4.0,"Very happy with it, great price, color of leather was exactly what I was looking for. A little thicker than I would have liked but still comfortable."
4.0,"Super cute! A little tight on the bust.<br />I sized up one size based on other reviews. Good plan fits well, a little tight across the chest but not too bad."
4.0,"They are warm and good for the winter, but they pill up like crazy!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, and covers some unwanted ""curves ""  :)"
4.0,"A bit billowy around the waist area, but I will either wear a belt or take in the seams above the pockets. I like that it's primarily cotton...could do without the spandex, but not a deal breaker."
4.0,"This is a fashion piece of jewelry that is made of glass beads and seems more trendy than something that will last for a while. Keeping that in mind, it is actually prettier than I expected. It is adjustable so it will fit a variety of different sized wrists. The light blue color with the gold beads looks really classy together. It matches quite a few of my clothing pieces.<br /><br />This bracelet is a cuff bracelet that is easy to get on and off. It comes in a cute burlap bag that makes it great for gifting. Overall, if you're looking for fashion jewelry and not expecting high end, this is really a pretty piece. The beads glisten in the light and I'm happy with it."
4.0,i'm returning them
4.0,"The print came out kinda dark but it‚Äôs a cute shirt! Super thin, so it was perfect for the summer concert I wore it at."
4.0,I am petite so I cut it.
4.0,Beautiful shirt. It was somewhat large but still a nice fit.
4.0,Loses it's tightness after the first couple washes. But comfortable enough to still wear when I'm at home
4.0,My husband enjoys these and seems to really think they are great
4.0,"I REALLY like the lens quality on these sunglasses. They came in a natural light bamboo color instead of the darker one shown in the picture. Is there a way I can get the darker ones also? I don't see any way to purchase them differently. I like these light colored ones, but i'd much prefer the dark frame"
4.0,"This product is what I was hoping to get made, as being said in many reviews.<br /><br />Removable brad pads and putting them back in place could totaly reshape the bra and defeat its whole purpose. I am certainly glad the Cup Claw was designed and entered the market."
4.0,"Good hat, &#34;ok&#34; quality. Runs a little big but I'm good with that"
4.0,Cool looking sports bra. Feels high quality. I typically wear a 10-12 and the large was slightly tight but totally wearable. Happy with my purchase!
4.0,"THe light is from 2 green LEDs on the board.  They're so bright, they show through the filigree as 2 distinct sources, and somewhat washout the filigree.  Otherwise, these are pretty slick.  Oh, one more minor glitch: screwing down the lid can be fiddly.  Be patient.<br /><br />I'd suggest a diffuser, multicolor/color change arrangement."
4.0,"Fit larger than I thought for my son and the color is navy and white, we had originally thought it was black and white. We decided to keep it anyway since the navy is so dark it will be fine. Nice shirt for the price!"
4.0,Fits as expected. Helps hide the tummy I gained since I ordered it a little lol
4.0,"This was super cute on my daughter. Like several other reviewers mentioned, the arm holes were quite small in size. They just weren‚Äôt proportioned to the size of the dress. Had to cut them along the seam to get some relief for my daughter. Oh and the zipper wouldn‚Äôt go up. Didn‚Äôt have time to fix it, so I had her west a tank top underneath the same color as the dress and the wig covered up that her zipper wasn‚Äôt going up, so it worked out."
4.0,It looks nice. Sort of strange that it comes with a lovely gift box and this is a gift but they show it to you then you have to open it to put it into the box. I found another one I liked better as a gift but both very similar.
4.0,"Love that the fabric is cool enough for summer, don't like that it doesn't stretch and my 10 year olds can barely get it on their heads"
4.0,Nice and festive for the holiday!!!!
4.0,The purse is light and small yet spacious.<br />The pewter color is gorgeous.<br />Love it!
4.0,Got them fast look good
4.0,The colors are true to the site and the size is nice.  I plan to order more in different colors.
4.0,Received today.  Perfect for my grand-daughters (age 13)
4.0,I love every thing about this dress. It fit great. Lays really nice. Not clingy. I‚Äôd recommend
4.0,"The necklace is just as pretty in person as the photos. Colors are great. Makes it very versatile since it can go with lots of outfits. Some of the smaller stones did come off during delivery, but they are still in the packaging so nothing I can't fix myself."
4.0,"I can't give feedback, it is a gift to someone"
4.0,Very different look!
4.0,"They look exactly like the picture and I get compliments on them all the time. The only complaint I have is that they don't block the sun well, but if you want them for fashion rather than functionality like I did, these are great."
4.0,"Looks good and the material looks ok, let 's wait and see. Will update review later"
4.0,Love the material.  The lace sleeves are gorgeous.  Bought the small....runs big.
4.0,"GREAT sweater for the price!  Minus one star bc sleeves are a tiny bit short, but didn't bother that much."
4.0,Cute. Great customer service.
4.0,very cute..
4.0,bought these for my daughter's costume and she LOVES them
4.0,To my surprise a large fit perfect. I have really long arms and the sleeves were good. Came right down to the crease in my wrist. I am 6‚Äô1‚Äù 215 pounds. It fits how a slim fit should fit. Only thing I would have liked is if the shirt were a little longer but it‚Äôs still long enough to tuck. So I‚Äôm satisfied!
4.0,"Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase.  I wish it would have been warmer, more of a sweatshirt material. I ordered an xl because I wanted it to be long enough to wear with leggings, which it is. However, the arms and sleeves are longer and wider then what I need but it‚Äôs still super comfortable."
4.0,Little boxy and slightly stiff. Super cute otherwise.. we will see if the letters hold up through multiple washes in the future.
4.0,The height of the jack was perfect. However the arms were longer than expected. I ordered a small thinking the arms wouldn't be a problem but they were. In the process of getting the suit jacket taylored.
4.0,Loved the look.  Wide width didn't fit.  Even went up a size and couldn't get my foot all the way into the shoe.  Bummed because they are really cute and well made.
4.0,Good quality made had for $14
4.0,pretty sweet glasses for the price. Do not meet Oakley quality but seem sturdy and look cool
4.0,I ordered an Extra large but should have gone one size larger. I know it's supposed to be a compression fit which it is but the torso to waist is on the short side.
4.0,It's a pretty dress
4.0,Great assortment of fitting dies
4.0,Wearing in a wedding in May... Pleasantly surprised by this purchase!
4.0,"This is cute, looks as it appears in photos.  2T was way too big for my little who is consistently in 2T clothing, but hoping maybe it'll fit next summer."
4.0,"Provides A LOT of face coverage. Little metal bar in middle is random, but doesn't ruin. Packaged well, and glasses bag included."
4.0,Maybe I‚Äôve gained weight but it didn‚Äôt look as good as I thought it would. Still a very beautiful dress.
4.0,Very useful.  Little flimsy but so far 4 mons really working great.  They get reality dirty but work great
4.0,"These are actually very good quality compared to the one, $16 belly ring i can get at Claire‚Äôs which will break in a day. These have lasted me a long time & are super cute! 10/10 would recommend."
4.0,"Fit great, very lightweight. Upper not the most comfortable material but everything else as expected."
4.0,It's cool and I use it to my work outside.
4.0,So far is performing as expected.
4.0,Nicely made and good for keeping hands warm inside and outside.
4.0,Very Cute bracelets. Plastic packaging made them a bit messy and had to untangle.  That‚Äôs why I am giving it a 4.
4.0,You can pack a lot of stuff into this tote. It is waterproof. The one thing I do not like about it are the straps. They are too stiff and tend to slide off your shoulder.
4.0,H. Cardenas.. the front is to square for my liking. The fit is comfortable enough for thick socks. I gave it 4 stars. Would have been 5 but I don‚Äôt like the squared off toe look.
4.0,super cute but too short on me
4.0,"Great apron, but it was really, really late."
4.0,Just what l wanted simple and fresh
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and the length is much shorter then the pics.
4.0,It is thinner in width than I expected but it was still loose and fits nice. I really liked it -perfect for vacationing at the hotel pool ! Just enough coverage for modesty.
4.0,"these red boot's, with the red bow, are rel cute, but, the little girl couldn't wear them......... so i orderd, another pair, gave these one's to another little girl.."
4.0,Cool looking pants. Comfortable fit. Only negative is the pockets have grommets that cut my hands. I think the grommets were bent but I didn‚Äôt return cuz I don‚Äôt really put my hands in the pockets that often so didn‚Äôt bother.
4.0,Don't care for this shirt. Don't like how it look on me. But is made with good quality.
4.0,"These are cute  however the one I wore yesterday for the first time, the sweater material got fuzzy instead of staying knitted maybe from rubbing on the boot"
4.0,"Wore them to deliver my baby. I almost lost a sock. Didn‚Äôt even realize it until I looked at my feet because of my epidural. They‚Äôre super comfortable but a bit big for my feet (size 6 women‚Äôs). Also washed them, some of the grip on the bottom are loose or came off. But overall a good fuzzy sock."
4.0,This was a great gift for my fianc√©.
4.0,"Very nice looking watch for my husband..however you need to take it to a jeweler to remove the links if you want to adjust the size of the band :-( On Amazon theres pictures of how to remove links, but it doesn't come with the tool needed to do so. It does include a small screwdriver, however that does nothing for resizing. Other than that it's a beautiful looking watch."
4.0,"Decent stretchy material, can be somewhat see through and you WILL see any lines from undergarments! I wore Spanx undies and it worked perfectly...after trying on several different undies... otherwise everyone loved it ! Can't beat the price"
4.0,I liked this dress. It has very pretty colors and is lightweight. It will be perfect for a beach wedding in Cancun. The dress seems to be well made. My only complaint is the underskirt stops at the knee. I would have liked it much more if the underskirt went to the ankle.
4.0,"Nice gloves. A bit of a loose fit for my liking. Index finger and thumb are too long, but the rest of the glove fit well. I measured my hand using the guide, and considering I was 8.5, I went with a 9. Now I wish I would have gone for the 8. Oh well...still really nice gloves with a great feel."
4.0,Loved the tutu!! Very good quality and looked adorable on my granddaughter .<br />I did not care for the romper at all.
4.0,"These tights seem well made, with side pockets and a drawstring waist.  However, the description said that these were 7/8"" tights, but they were full length. Also, I ordered the navy blue, but they are not a true navy; there seems to be a bit of purple. I usually wear a medium in tights, but these are too long, and too big in the rear area.  I do like the high waist and fabric."
4.0,"My Granddaughter loved this necklace, and it looked very nice on. The Quote is a bit tiny,but over all it is great!"
4.0,Shipped quickly and of good quality. Item was way too large. Mended the length on arms and legs so it would fit better.
4.0,Purchased several of these to apply htv at a baby shower. Great gowns.
4.0,"I'm probably about a C cup, and I barely fit in this cami bra. Anyone larger should be warned. But it's super comfy!"
4.0,Dont know why this says 2 pcs.  Mine was only one pc.  Other than that it did the trick.
4.0,"Just wish mine was Navy blue and black, but still love it regardless. Pls, make sure to buy a higher size, by at least two extra sizes"
4.0,This dress tends to be longer than I would have expected and cannot be hemmed with losing the pattern at the bottom.
4.0,Very<br />Comfortable
4.0,"Well as much as love giraffes, I have to love this key chain. The giraffe is a solI'd metal piece with lots of cute details. The ring is a thick solid key ring that doesn't bend easy so I don't worry about it falling off my keys. The rope is cute and attached to the rope is the giraffe and swirly dodads. I'm not sure about the little rectangular saying that comes on it. The saying is I feel about you makes my heart lone to be free. I don't think it has much to do with the Keychain and the translation of whathe ever the original language was to English is not good. I will be taking that piece off. Other then that this is a cute Keychain and I love it.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,"I bought these pants because of the price.  I had never heard of this brand before, but fit okay.  Very long and I had to hem them.  I am 5'7"" and though they would be the proper length, but they were not.  After hemming, they looked okay."
4.0,"The vest arrived on time, in very good condition. However, the product is not the higgest quality, but it is OK. Just take into account  that the vest is a little bit big! I bougth this for my boyfriend, who usually wears M-size, I ordered in S-size because the comments said the vest was big, and even S-size turn out to be a little bit big for him."
4.0,Only wore one pair once. I like everything about them. I wear them mismatched.
4.0,"ordered this boot as both a winter waterproof boot and a hiking boot.  Will see if it is too warm for hiking, worked well for late winter slop. The tread might be a little hard to get a grip on icy surfaces. from MN btw- we get to test.."
4.0,"ordered black- like the brindle coloring- wish they were longer, go up in size. XL, is like size 10, not a lot of stretch.<br />i really do like very much, warm, not hot"
4.0,"This sweater is exceptionally soft.  The blue color is beautiful and it works for the price point.  It does run small...so size at least 1 size up.  The stitching is not high quality at least not on mine.  Around the arms the stitching is not very neat, however it wasn't enough to send it back.  I still like this sweater."
4.0,"When the band on my Vivoactive 3 wore out after two years, I balked at the Garmin $30 replacement price (or much higher for more stylish choices). I decided to try this $5 band. It has a more interesting appearance than the stock Garmin band, and it only has to last 4 months to match the value of the Garmin band. After one month of ownership, it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />As for quality, the band material seems durable enough and should last quite a while. There are two things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars. First, the attachment mechanism is a little flimsier than the original Garmin band. It's harder to get it to attach, and it actually came off once when I accidentally bashed my hand against something. That never happened with the Garmin band, and I'm pretty clumsy. Second, the two loops that hold the end of the band in place don't work very well despite there being two of them. They slide up and down the band. I seem to have to adjust them several times a day to keep the end in place. The Garmin worked better.<br /><br />But for $5 this is a great deal. Recommended!"
4.0,"I bought this necklace because it was just enough to show off my pride. It wasn't screaming to the public my sexual preference, and I liked that. My only issue with the pendant is that the cord came untied within the first day, and I have to keep tightening the knots to prevent the necklace from slipping off my neck. Other than that small inconvenience, the product is great. I actually bought a second one to give to my boyfriend."
4.0,"Wish it had the inner bra like their other suit,  its cute but nothing to rave about !"
4.0,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the light. They used to light up the entire back but now the light is on the left only half the screen gets lit up. Other than that, good functional watch."
4.0,Bummer- had to send it back. My husband wears a lg. but the coat was too tight. Waiting for an XL to arrive.
4.0,Great feel but bands tore.
4.0,"Came quickly, exactly what I wanted although I wish the clip was metal and easier to attach to backpack/purse.  Would have gotten 5 stars if the clip was made better."
4.0,"I was going for a modest length, so I got a size up but it didn't really matter. I think it will go to the knee no matter what size you choose."
4.0,My sister liked them a lot!
4.0,It fits fine the sleeves are too short tho
4.0,Collect wolves and these are very inexpensive; can have 1 for each day of week
4.0,"I love these shoes, it is true you should order up, I did and mine fit perfectly. I've found that they bend your toes more strongly than other high heels I've had, making them uncomfortable to walk around in for more than 1 hour or so. However they look really great and I love how tall they make me (they make my 6'1&#34;). I was surprised at their quality for how low the price was as well."
4.0,"Good for Sleep Bras. Could be more supportive, but they are alright for the price."
4.0,Nice set for the money.
4.0,Perfect for what I needed. Used for hockey tournament favor bags and was able to stencil player's numbers on with a sharpie.
4.0,"I really like these leggings but I gave it 4 stars because the colors are wrong. I ordered Moonlight Ocean and the package was labeled as such, but the actual leggings are more of a plum color. A little disappointed, but still overall satisfied with the quality"
4.0,"I would like to see a second snap option as I found it a little tight once I put my credit cards, etc in.  Overall I really like this."
4.0,"Fit as stated.  Love that there was a small zipper in case he had to go to the bathroom and the printing on the fabric was good (not stellar, but very good)<br />In a sea of Spider-Man costumes that have fake muscles in them (why?!) that I find abhorrent, this was was the BEST!!!!  Like the original spider man!"
4.0,They are really comfortable and the fit is just right.Look good too.I just wish they had the 5 pack. Because I can get these much cheaper some where else.A 5 pack too just saying
4.0,"Good for hot humid climates.  Fits a strong, broad shouldered man, unlike many Fjallraven shirts.  Could be a 5 star, but this shirt is a wrinkle magnet.  Plan on ironing after every wash.  Or, if you take your shirts to a dry cleaners, plan on the dry cleaning fee, rather than just men's shirt laundering.  Or, be like me and take out of dryer early, hang to finish drying, and live with some wrinkles.  I iron it if I'm wearing it around women who admire things like pressed shirts."
4.0,Love the fit and length but the gray lining of the hood rubs off and I find gray fuzz everywhere.  Annoying
4.0,Very cute.  My son Loves them.<br />They seem a little long .  Not sure how well<br />Made they are.
4.0,Purchased this costume for our trip to Disney in October. Wanted something that wasnt going to be too hot.  My daughter loved it. Costume made of decent quality.  My daughter is seven and on the small size.  I purchased the small (4-6) and it was snug but fit.
4.0,Looks great and heavier than expected.  Good quality.  Can't beat the price.
4.0,"I can't believe this dress fit me! When I pulled it out of the package I laughed at how small this dress looked, but it fit. The waist band was surprisingly comfortable.<br /><br />I will probably have this dress hemmed to a bit below knee-length. Order 1 size up and you'll be happy."
4.0,The bows came undone on both sides. Outside of that this outfit was perfect .
4.0,The dress looks great.  I normally wear a size 4 and I ordered this dress in a large.  I can put it on without unzipping it.  It is very comfortable.<br />Care: Wash it on delicate cycle in cold water.  Shake it out really good.  Lay it flat or hang it to dry.  Then put it in the dryer to fluff any wrinkles out.  I gave it 4 stars because the material is not the best but is good for the price of the dress.
4.0,a Little on the small side but then i lost a couple pounds and it fit fine.
4.0,"It's very pretty but it is a little big  on my sister.  My sister wears a size large. The arms would stick out awkwardly and look like ears on your shoulders, they didnt have enough fall. Idk if it's because you have to wear it some more because the fabric itself isn't that bad, the print a beaitful and doesnt feel like cheap plastic satin but an in between high quality and cheap plastic satin.  Unfortuantely my sister is very picky on polyester fabric and she did not accept this shirt even though i tried to force it on her cuz she looked good in it lol<br />I'd wear it if it wasn't too big.  in the mean time it's just sitting in her closet until I figure out how to resize it or make something new out of it :)"
4.0,"Fairly nice band. I believe it is real leather, but the skin-facing side seems rubbery. However I did have to punch a new hole in it which leads me to believe that it is real leather.<br /><br />I did not have to punch a hole due to the band being sized incorrectly. I have a Sony smartwatch 3 and had to buy a new 3D printed housing for it and a band separately. This watch face is fairly large which is what led to this... So if you'r buying this band for a fairly large watch face and have small - med wrists, either have a leather hole-punch or be ready to cut one with a knife."
4.0,"Adorable boots! They work great for hiking, however, wished they came in half and whole sizes. Order bigger if you are in question - my poor two year old had blisters on the first day we used these."
4.0,"This is a very nice and casual top. It fits well and is a soft material. However, I ordered red and it was more of a copper/burnt orange color. It is a definitely different color than expected."
4.0,Very soft and seems like a good quality pant. Weird smell though.
4.0,make my iphone really bulky
4.0,"LO is tall for her age, so length wise, these are super for her. But, as with most things for kiddos who are tall, the feet are a little big. However, the anti-slip on the bottom is money and worth it.  Just means you have to keep an eye on the fabric at the feet when putting on shoes. Not a deal breaker for us. Now, if only LO would stay out of the mud... (A parent can dream, right?)"
4.0,pretty solid hat but not great audio quality
4.0,Love them they are beautiful and I get so many compliments on them. However. One came broken. Which I‚Äôm sad about.
4.0,"This item was very pretty and looks great on a charm bracelet, the only thing is that they need to put a different ""clasp"" on it, maybe one that you twist around like the ones that are on your keychains??  this one is just one round wire that touches together barely to close, had to tighten and twist around because it kept coming lose and i didn't want to lost my heart charm"
4.0,Very beautiful super softe thight very very good quality the only thing is I ordered the gray and it no where close to as the gray in the picture really disappointed me other then the color problem it‚Äôs so beautiful
4.0,"There are some inaccuracies in the current description on the brown and white ‚Äúdress‚Äù but overall I like the style. I was surprised to receive two separate pieces (top and skirt) and also disappointed that it is polyester, not cotton. Since I read the reviews and debated this purchase before committing, I am disappointed to not receive a cotton dress but will keep it because I like the print and don‚Äôt want the hassle of a return."
4.0,"These glasses do really work, my eyes are not fatigued and there's no spots after.... awesome."
4.0,"So I put &#34;Fits as expected&#34; because the bottom half is somewhat too small, while the top is somewhat too big. I had read in other reviews that it's a bit short, I had figured since I'm 5'4&#34; that I maybe wouldn't have this issue. I was wrong, I had a frontal wedgie. Not attractive. After I got that all taken care off (the straps are adjustable - so I loosened them to give me more length), I must say I do like this romper. I am working on losing weight so maybe that will help the bottom not be so tight. I have high hopes!<br /><br />Asides for that, the fabric is sheer - nothing a black bra or tank top can't fix. And the lace detailing was nice. No holes, or any damage."
4.0,"These are so cute, I got a second pair for my sister. I have a fairly narrow foot, but they fit great. Wore them to a family reunion and got lots of compliments."
4.0,"I like it a lot.  It's comfy and feels much nicer than my last hat.  It would have been 5 stars but the description says 65% wool while the tag on the hat says 50%.  I did get this hat because of the wool but I wouldn't say that 15% is a deal breaker or anything, it just seems like a weird fact to mislead your customers on."
4.0,It was too big for a chain...
4.0,slightly wide for my face
4.0,"Gorgeous color! They sent a free gift with the purchase as well! I gave it as a gift so I can‚Äôt speak to how it is holding up, but the quality looked great as well."
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous and beautifully made.  I usually wear a size 12 or 14 in fitted clothing, so I ordered a 14.  There is no &#34;give&#34; to the fabric and I couldn't zip it, ordering up a size would not have helped since the bust area was too large for my 38C boobies.  Waistline falls at rib height.  The length was incredibly generous, I am 5'10 and would have needed to hem it or wear heals.  So, if you have a full breast, and super slim waist, go for it!  It is lovely!"
4.0,"I'm ordering these glasses for the 2nd time.  I really like them because they are very lightweight and comfortable.  Hopefully the blue lenses are helpful too.  This more recent order was made differently, though.  I frequently wear my glasses on top of my head when I'm not using them.  This pair traps some hair in the hinges and pulls my hair out when I take them off of my head. Not great since who wants to lose hair but also kind of gross to have loose hairs stuck in the hinges of your glasses."
4.0,"Very pretty and feminine...a light on the tight side, tho.  Will probably layer it with another shirt or jacket.p"
4.0,"Material is not as soft as I'd like, it's pretty stiff. I really like the design and color choices. It's also true to size, M is roomy, but not too baggy on me (130 lbs., 5'5"")."
4.0,"Surprised at how well it fit! It looks really good on and I love that you can change the straps into anything! The only reason why it's a 4 star instead 5 is because of the material. Though it is stretchy, which is nice, it's not the best quality. I'm 5'9 and wear a 10-12 dress size. Would highly recommend for a fancy event but not a gala."
4.0,a bit small but they are good quality n as expected
4.0,"Very nice shirt, super cute and comfortable! It is very long!"
4.0,"Very pretty, comfortable, and flowing. Definitely needs an accessory of some sort to break up the one color. A belt, scarf, or something like that makes a huge difference."
4.0,Socks are very comfortable.  I have them a 4 because the are somewhat large.  Everything else is great.
4.0,Decent case for my Rx Ray Bans - lasted a little more than 3 years and then the hinge broke - so just ordered another one
4.0,"I love these! But I have to hide my piercing for work, and the only one I could hide was the retainer. The other horseshoe shaped rings don‚Äôt have enough space in between to push up."
4.0,"Ordered 2 sizes up and they fit great. The only thing I didn't like about them is that they are high rise jeans. I have always liked the low rise. Other than that, they are exactly as pictured and very comfortable to wear. Just be sure to order up!"
4.0,"This Pure Cotton Rabbit Stripe Baby Cap from Spikerking is precious. My husband and I are expecting our first child in December and we are very excited. We‚Äôve been buying little things here and there like this hat. It‚Äôs still very early on in my pregnancy and I don‚Äôt know the gender of the baby yet so I went with a gender neutral color of yellow.<br /><br />It‚Äôs very soft and seems like it will be warm. The baby is due when it will be winter time so I need to make sure I have lots of soft, but warm things. The design on the hat is just like in the picture. The only thing that was odd to me is the words on the hat which appear to say, ‚ÄúPremier Four‚Äù. I‚Äôm a little confused as to what this is supposed to mean. Other than that, it‚Äôs really cute.<br /><br />I ordered a newborn size, but the size I received in the mail seems like it would be quite large for a newborn. That‚Äôs okay though because it‚Äôs better to be a little larger than too small. This comes in blue and pink as well if you happen to know what gender your baby is going to be or if you‚Äôve already delivered.<br /><br />Another thing that I‚Äôm not crazy about is that it‚Äôs hand-wash only. I can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôm going to want to hand-wash many things as a new mom. I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôll be exhausted and barely have the energy to get them clean in the washing machine, especially at first.<br /><br />Overall, it‚Äôs a cute hat. ÔÅä<br /><br />This product was provided to me at no cost (or at a discount) in exchange for an honest and unbiased Review.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01D7BYEZU Spikerking Baby Hat Pure Cotton Rabbit Newborn Baby Cap Stripe Hat,Yellow]]"
4.0,"Broke within a month, was very disappointed"
4.0,Decent value for the price! I like the mauve color--not garish.
4.0,Super soft fabric and nice colors. The fit is slightly larger than expected. I wear an 8 and it is not tight.
4.0,"Super pretty, but a little tight and uncomfortable after awhile. Lots of clips. Still going to wear a lot because it‚Äôs so pretty though."
4.0,Beautiful cross.
4.0,"The reviews are right- it runs two sizes small. I'm petite and generally wear Small, but I ordered a Medium. It fits but it's snug. This M would usually be an XS.<br />Otherwise, the material is great. All the zipper pockets are great. It looks nice. The only bad thing is the front zipper-- seems pretty cheap and doesn't run smooth."
4.0,"Because replacement bands for the Gadget are chronically out of stock or when you can find them they're sell for $100, I decided to try and replace just the crummy plastic clasp that has broken twice.  Initially I purchased the 16 mm buckle which fit the band just fine, but was too narrow to comfortably slide the remainder of the band in to.  I reordered a 18 mm band and it fits the watch great and the band slides all the way through to allow it to be adjusted to fit the smallest of wrists. It just doesn't look quite as nice as the original clasp."
4.0,"Soft and comfortable, fit true to size"
4.0,"Quite happy with these earrings (and the matching ring).  The rose gold color is very nice, the earrings are a nice size, though I'd like them a little larger as well.  The backing is the small metal type, as shown in the photo, but for those of us with longer nails (and clumsy fingers) it's easy to use one of the larger backs from a stash I have at home."
4.0,They're super cute pants and I can still fit in them ordering the size I normally wear but they are tighter than I feel comfortable with so I would order a size up
4.0,The dangling part fell off after the first day; but I love the piercing part still. Eye catching without being &#34;skanky.&#34;
4.0,They are huge.  I looked like an alien.  But they worked really well and are very comfortable.  I don't always want to put in contacts so I bought these to fit over my glasses and they were perfect for that.
4.0,Good quality shirt. No loose material and shipping was very fast.
4.0,Slightly small for adult face
4.0,The dress was lovely but a bit small for an xl
4.0,"I think this band is not bad, I like the color and the stretchy fabric of the band, however I think the fastener is a little awkward and so I like the infinity band style much better, which I also purchased on Amazon. There just isn‚Äôt the variety of colors available just yet so I thought I would try this one.  I‚Äôll wear it for a little while, but I think I‚Äôll get annoyed as the fastener is in a bad spot, and feels a bit scratchy"
4.0,I reviewed another version of this product earlier. The sizes run large. Order a few different sized ones and try them all. Otherwise good quality!
4.0,"I love this dress  and was amazed at the fit. I felt so comfortable,  even people was complementing  how  Gorgeous I looked. However the fitting around the shoulders have a flaw, you can see the bulge on either side of the shoulders."
4.0,Its very similar with the one 007 used in the movie No time to Die ...
4.0,"Muy buena inversi√≥n, sencillo y f√°cil de usar."
4.0,Love this shirt but the buttons are smaller than the button holes! So the top keeps popping open! I‚Äôll just replace the buttons to larger open because I love this top it‚Äôs super cute and fits great otherwise!
4.0,"I loved - of course - the price right away, however once I got them I totally fell in love with the quality and fit.  It's VERY cold around here now and they are doing their job in keeping my hands relatively comfortable.  Not a problem driving in these gloves since they fit snugly and are not bulky."
4.0,Super comfy and would buy again. I wear them under my scrubs and sweaters. The only problem is one is falling apart because the stitching came loose in the washer or dryer. And if I dont pull them down they ride up
4.0,"I purchased 2 dresses, size small, the Royal Blue Chiffon and the Green Leaf Chiffon. They are very pretty and very long. I am 5‚Äô 8‚Äù and both dresses touch the floor with 1‚Äù shoes. The dresses also run a little large they should be listed as plus sizes; and the slip underneath is too short, it reaches an inch or two above my knees; I wish they at least reached below my knees.<br /><br />The dresses are so pretty and the material is nice, I am keeping them, because I cannot wear heels anymore, I will hem the dresses and wear a long slip."
4.0,"It‚Äôs awesome that this band comes with the equipment for swapping out watch links, I‚Äôve gotten $100+ watches that didn‚Äôt come with something that helpful. Deducting one star because the side buttons don‚Äôt push quite right imo, they just fee a bit off compared to the default blaze band. Overall I can live with that for the price though, and everything else about this band is great! I got the standard silver/metallic color."
4.0,"This pendant is cute but very small.  The dimensions are correct however, just don't use the picture on the mannequin to judge.  It looks much larger there.  I will keep it because it was my error for not paying better attention to the dimensions.  I would love it if it were bigger."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress but it runs small. I suggest to order one size up. I wear a medium but a medium in this dress was very snug and kind of uncomfortable.  Then I ordered the same dress in large and it was a perfect fit. For reference, I am 5'5&#34; and 134 pounds. All my friends loved this dress and I received a lot of compliments."
4.0,Surprisingly good quality socks. Should last a few years as I wear them only on games days. Go Zags!
4.0,"Great lenses. The do,however, have a very slightly different shape that required some getting used to. Great color and good fit. They are great lenses!"
4.0,This product is in the process of being returned
4.0,"This dress is very light, stretchy and fits well to your body. It really is worth the cost. I will buy again."
4.0,"This swimsuit is so cute!! I bought this is a small and the bottoms fit but could have been a little tighter so I was hopeful, but the top was just way to big for me.  I am a 34 B and it just wouldn't work.  I was hoping to order this again in an XS but sadly they don't have one in that size.  For reference, I am 5' 5'' and 122 lbs."
4.0,"great workout shirts, vert light airy material, not compression at all. I got the small and have to make a knot at the waist because i wanted a more fitted look but really comfortable overall. you do need a sports bra underneath."
4.0,first pair of reflexology sandals. my feet like. good enough arch support. i wear around the house mostly instead of bare feet. it feels like a treat.
4.0,Yummy on my wife. Spice things up and make her feel sexy in this. The blue is a Great overall skin tone match. Of course the material is thin and its flimsy thats kinda the point.
4.0,The color is as-shown and the quality is that of a $10 tie. The keeper loop on the back (where the tail is tucked in) had very lose stitching and will need to be repaired.
4.0,"Good product, looks great!"
4.0,"For those that are wondering the tag on this OS is labeled a Medium.  I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  It's cute, warm and seems well made.  The only thing I find odd about it is that the sleeves are soooo long!  They're as long as the robe itself!  Like, they were long on my monkey arms and I often have to order tall sizes to get proper sleeve lengths.  Now I understand why it's shown with rolled sleeves in the photo (but not how it's packaged).  The robe just passes my rear on my 5'9"" frame.  It'll be a big for my daughter but she won't care, it's got llamas on it and that's all that will matter.  LOL."
4.0,great  looking
4.0,Very comfy. A little longer than I expected from the photo.
4.0,Cute thin shirt that is really comfortable on my son. The color seems to stay even after multiple washes. The size is also true to size. Easy to play or sleep in.
4.0,"They're fine. A little big through the leg, leading to some baggy looking pants, but otherwise good. They're breathable yet warm and all the pockets come in handy and are placed well. Wore these for a long hike in Maine around Halloween and didn't get cold, but also didn't get overheated. Will definitely wear these on more hikes."
4.0,Great value! I wish it had more than one polarized lens!
4.0,It looks good but I believe you need to have a wide core for this to look propee. My chest is a bit bigger than my core and so the shirt is shaped slightly odd
4.0,They fit as is but I probably would size up for a bit baggier look. Would recommend
4.0,Fits just right. Be careful if you have larger wrists. Shipping package was slightly damages
4.0,"These work great under helmets. We took our 5 and 7yr old to a tubing park and they wore them under their bike helmets, but they do run very small. I ordered a kids and a junior thinking the junior would be a little big for a year on my 7yr old but it fit perfectly and the the kids one did not fit my 5yr old, we didn't have time to reorder so we made it work but he said it was tight and it didn't pass the crown of his head, I was mostly concerned with covering his ears which it did, but I would return if we hadn't been pressed for time."
4.0,I love the look of these! They are a tiny bit small so get a size up
4.0,purse was a gift for Christmas.  The only thing I don't like is that there was no invoice enclosed.
4.0,It ok i love it
4.0,"Wish it was completely round, I stead it has two flat sides..."
4.0,Very flattering to your figure.  Good quality fabric.  I‚Äôm very happy
4.0,"Very comfy, great compression, the seam feels bulky at the pinky toe, but that may be because I need a smaller size. I wear a U.S. women's 8, but the medium are too big."
4.0,"This is an easy dress to throw on and either dress up or wear more casually.  And although I was a little nervous about the high slit, it is actually different than I expected from the photos.  The skirt part is much like a faux wrap with layers that overlap enough that I don't worry about flashing people as I'm walking.  It's also nice that the straps are adjustable.  This makes for an easier fit."
4.0,"Theyre good quality and super cute, theyre a little big of me so i have to take them out if im going to sleep which is no big deal but theyre pretty heavy."
4.0,Cute but too small for my size 11 foot
4.0,Great looking and comfy but takes forever to dry.
4.0,Very comfortable. Cool. I could use a couple more of these in the closet for hot Arizona summers.
4.0,"Looks great, good quality but it is not 8.6 inches. Was to small so I had add a link to make it fit."
4.0,Like this sweater. Lightweight and fashionable.
4.0,"It was definitely smaller than I expected it to be, got it as a gift for my sister. Sparkled and shined though :) really cute. She loved it!"
4.0,I wish it was a little bit thicker making more comfortable to wear.
4.0,Letters a lil warn
4.0,"Very low noise winder, it looks great too!"
4.0,"The band is a little stiff to use, but, overall, I am very pleased."
4.0,Bueno si estuvo bien la calidad. Pero no tiene etiqueta.
4.0,It looks and fits great. The only little annoyance is that the band that lays on your wrist can slide and protrude out from the top band. Also the metal clasp doesn't seem as strong as Fitbit brand but for the process I really can't complain. I would definitely buy more.
4.0,Everything is nice except the material is very cheap and will not last for more than a half dozen wears.
4.0,"make sure you order up... Quality is great for the price and the color (pink) is very pretty - not too loud. I am typically a medium/large -  I ordered 2 sizes up XX-Large and it still fits tighter than what I had expected. I wanted the jacket to not only fit, but to have a loose fit.  By ordering 2 sizes up, it fits as though I ordered medium."
4.0,"Gloves were a gift and haven't heard yet if he was pleased or not, so I left one rating star empty. I personally was very pleased with the product, the shipping and shopping and Amazon over all. Thanks again"
4.0,"These are nice outerlayer pants. The straps...ok the straps are NOT good lol. the straps are made of a low quality material and cant take the tough abuse of a modern washing or drying machine. So....those you should probably cut off....sorry :)  but the feeling of the pants are really nice. ((Id you get the white one yes, they will show dirt...but ...thats not to hard to clean off)"
4.0,Reasonable quality at a great price.  Seems to be sturdy and well made.  Better than I expected to get for the money.
4.0,"Got them quick. Very nice, small earrings but i like small earrings."
4.0,"Can't even get my thighs in these, and even if I could, I didn't realize from the pics that these are hip-huggers, at least they would be on me (I took the legs off and tried just the thong portion to check). The pockets are not very deep, so it's a good thing they zip, and I'd worry about my keys or a ring ripping them, as they are just the thin lining material. I might consider buying another pair if they had 44s or 46s, but I'd bee worried about the thigh situation.<br /><br />Still, I'm not disappointed, because I snagged the last 42s, and @ $10, I figured even if they don't fit. that's a lotta good leather on the cheap, that can be used for crafts. I'm going to hold off on that idea, in case i do lose some of this darned Covid weight, 'cuz I really would like to wear theses. Ah, incentives. There are so many, yet so few of them work."
4.0,Liking this dress!!! Light weight and comfy. Normally a 12 and it fits great
4.0,My son wanted it. Hope it doesn't turn color.
4.0,"My husband looked high and low for a great watch with few characteristics. It had to be solar powered, with countdown timer, stopwatch and alarm, plus it had to be a light watch to wear it daily for work. He was super excited to find this watch on Amazon. It has tons of other features that he, as outdoors man, also considers great advantages. It is a bigger watch, but not enormous like some are. He loves how light it feels on his wrist. It is quite easy to see the time, but smaller symbols and numbers require him to wear glasses, and he uses +1.5 glasses to read. The only downfall of this watch is that if you have lots of hair on your arm and near the wrist, it might be pulling your hair as the inside of the band has grooves. It might be fixed by adjusting the band to the length that you can work with or get used to. One last advice - buy the watch that has original Casio warranty from Amazon (you can't beat their price now anywhere else, and this is quite a new model), and the register it on Casio website for warranty. We did it and Casio gave us 2nd year warranty for free with condition that this watch was not bought from a third party seller."
4.0,I like the comfort the slippers provide. They are unisex therefor my husband and I do share. They are black but a tad bit shiny. Other than that they look very great and provide a lot of support.
4.0,This was a huge hit at christmas. My lady loved it and it is a unique piece of jewelry. Get it.
4.0,Really cute!  But I feel like it looks like a maternity top every time I put it on.  Love the colors.... but think I'll give it to one of my daughter's pregnant friends.
4.0,32&#34; waist measured wear a 30 in pants usually 148 lbs athletic build. these fit in a M only minor thing is they feel a tab long for me at 5&#34;7&#34; since i have bigger calves and the elastic is tight.(doesnt go down to ankle) Materials are alright dont be expecting nike feel
4.0,"I really like this purse, the only problem is that the inner pocket designed for a cell phone isn't deep enough to put in my phone (Samsung Note 3) and zip the purse closed.  They should move the pockets down 1-2 inches."
4.0,"Work well for pruning back my large indoor plants with large, sharp shears. Fair-to-good mobility and hand protection. I wear a size 7.5 in women's gloves. These would fit a woman 8 - 8.5. One star off for being somewhat stiff"
4.0,What they sold me was great fits well
4.0,"Very thin material, but still a nice outfit"
4.0,"This was bought as a gift for a little girl in Africa for her school books.  The size was perfect, quite a bit smaller than an average backpack.<br />High quality materials and a lovely real color."
4.0,This are great value.. super soft snd fit true to size... I ordered another pair!
4.0,"Good shape, looks good, but a little smaller than the number asked... Fits tight"
4.0,I use these for food service.  They are fine.  A little thinner than the gloves I have been using but they are serviceable and fine for my purposes.
4.0,So far I like. small seems to fit me well. Great for kicking the bag. Don't know about longer term holding up and not tearing but will see.
4.0,"This bra was just a teensy bit too tight. I recommend ordering a size up. Otherwise, I love the color and the feel--I even ended up ordering the teal version of this bra as well!"
4.0,"Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Prefect fit and arrived in a timely manner, as described"
4.0,"I wear an 8/10 in clothes, mostly Medium tops.  This dress fit perfectly.  I'm 5'2 and it isn't too long that it looks matronly and isn't so short that I'm showing off the goods!"
4.0,super cute but a little hard to adjust
4.0,Runs a little small but overall a simple yet beautiful dress... It's great for a casual or even a formal setting. Received many compliments on this dress and will probably get another in a different color really soon.
4.0,"The fit is great, and the color is perfect!"
4.0,Adds a little class to otherwise plain shoe.
4.0,"En cuanto al precio es muy bueno, pero necesitan revisar que todas las gafas tengan los enganches de las paticas, porque 2 gafas llegaron con las patas sueltas"
4.0,just what i needed but a little tight
4.0,"My Specs: 5'2 / 124 lbs / Size SM / 32DD<br /><br />Overall, this set is on point. It looks good and more importantly, I feel good in it!  The color is great and the set is super comfy!  I have to wear the top without any undergarments, it fits much better that way.<br /><br />I would say that if you are on the cusp of a size, the best idea would be to size up - the band and elastic are TIGHT so I think if you go with the lower size, you may end up uncomfortable.<br /><br />Did you find this review helpful? Please let me know!"
4.0,It was just as I thought it would be.  Thanks
4.0,"Es fresco , c√≥modo pero no me agrad√≥ mucho el dise√±o de la tela"
4.0,Pretty and original product
4.0,"Real cute shirt! It did take awhile to receive because it's not on prime but it was packaged securely and arrived with no damage. It does fit a bit small so I would recommend ordering a size up, maybe even two. If you want it to fit how it does the model in the picture, I'd go two.<br />I'm about 5 ft 4 inches tall and 155lb. I ordered the XL and it fits perfectly, not too tight but it's not a baggy leggings kind of shirt like how you would think from looking at the picture. If it shrinks in the wash I don't know how often I would really wear it.<br />That's why I gave four stars, since it runs small and I was expecting a flowy, baggy type shirt. It's still really cute though, I do like the style.<br /><br />I received this product from the seller in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review."
4.0,I love it but I lost a leg and it toom awhile to get delivered
4.0,For 5'1'' this is like a maxi dress
4.0,church dress
4.0,Competitive price. Fast delivery.
4.0,"A little too short, overall good purchase."
4.0,Thay are beautiful. Im very happy with them.my daughters want me to get them a pear each.thank you very much.
4.0,"This watch band was exactly what I was hoping for.  The easy release bars make switching between this band and the silicone Withings band much easier when I'm working out.  The watch band comes with the tools needed to remove the band links to adjust the size.  Took a little trial and error to get the sizing right, but the included tool made it a smooth process."
4.0,Decent looking sandals for under $40 bucks. I am 5'7&#34; (160 pounds ) and size 10 fit perfectly.
4.0,"I love the Damero shoulder bags. This is my second. I gave this one four rather than five stars because it's an orangey cognac; the photo and description of the color as &#34;brown&#34; made me think it would be less orangey. It's still nice, though."
4.0,Pretty and cheap in price.
4.0,I wear between a MED and Large. I went L because I like a loose cozy fit on this. Also it is more light weight then I expected.
4.0,"They look very fashionable, but my son could only wear them for a few hours b/c they hurt his ears.  He said they were too tight.  We will have to see if he gets used to them b/c they really are nice quality and look nice."
4.0,Great shorts and fit perfect...for such a great price!
4.0,"Very cute!  Ordered a small.  Fits very well except my waist which is not uncommon.  Decent material, great length, nice cut!"
4.0,"Really good quality hat, didn't expect it to be a little puffy feeling for a trucker hat style"
4.0,The dress is good quality and pretty. However it runs longer than supposed.
4.0,pendant is great and a nice size (if u like it a little big) chain is relatively short so you might want to get a longer chain separately
4.0,I bought this for my kids who LOVE Dino Charge. It's small compared to Riley's. This is more of a dagger than a sword. That being said my kids still love it. And play with it. I would definitely buy it again.
4.0,I wish this organizer worked for my backpack. It was just a bit too tall. Amazing price. I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm not keeping it. This was for the small size.
4.0,I love this t-shirt dress! I felt comfortable wearing it around the beach over my bathing suit and back home it pairs nicely with leggings. However it did shrink up a lot more than expected.
4.0,"I really love that they feel comfy and keep you under ""control"". I really recommend them!"
4.0,They‚Äôre a little tight around my calf but they are so cute and soft
4.0,I like the multi green colors and the price.
4.0,"Fit is great! material on the thin side, might not wear well..we'll see.."
4.0,Washed this scarf but color did not alter. Great for work or casual outting. Will be buying more colors. Definitely recommended.
4.0,"They fit of the 3XL shirt is decent, I would have liked it to be a little looser after I washed it. The main issue I have is the blurry part of the image in the picture. I even went and double checked the picture they advertise with and that one is fine. Overall it is a pretty good shirt, I will check back later if anything changes."
4.0,"I like this base, but still had to clamp it down to our wooden deck so it wouldn't tip over in mild wind (even when the umbrella was down)."
4.0,Chicks dig'em!
4.0,They're cute and seem durable.
4.0,"I quite like the frames.  They look good, fit well, and don't look/feel cheap or fragile in any way.<br /><br />The lenses on the other hand are not very dark.  On bright Colorado days, I still find myself squinting while wearing these.  My eyes are a bit on the sensitive side though.<br /><br />The polarization is good as well."
4.0,Exceeded my expectations. Love these pants!
4.0,Very comfortable and I use it all the time now. My only criticism is that it can appear bulky and when wiping my glasses they fell off more than once but overall they feel great on my nose. Be careful when cleaning your glasses and some may have an issue on the products size but for me it‚Äôs all about comfort and these are very comfortable.
4.0,"Fits well, however it did have a slight odor, possibly due to the dye of the fabric.  Went away after washing."
4.0,The sweater fit as expected. I'm 5'4&#34; 97lbs and ordered a small. I normally wear xsmall but I like sweaters a little bigger to wear layers underneath. It fits perfectly for that. What did surprise me was how incredibly soft it is. I've had many cardigans in this style but none have been as soft as this one. Love it
4.0,"I‚Äôm petite, 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 110lbs. I ordered a small and it fits but the chest is snug (I‚Äôm a 34B) and body is VERY loose/flowing. Comfortable dress for around the house with Pockets!<br />Bought black elastic belt to make more form fitting for going out."
4.0,I really like this product but I gave it four stars because the color looks more grey in person.
4.0,Nice earrings but the catch is always getting loose and won't stay hooked. I just have to move it slightly every time I wear them.
4.0,"This is a really cute mini bag. I would have given it 5 stars except that it will not hold my phone unless I remove the protective case from it. I would have preferred to have it just a bit larger so that I would keep the phone better protected. As an events manager at a university, I will use this case (school's colors) as I am running around campus keeping events running smoothly. It will allow me to have my phone close and keep my hands free."
4.0,"Well constructed sling bag that is perfect for small outings. It doesn't hold a lot of stuff but it's perfect for small adventures.  A big tip- because it is a slingbag style make sure you have it zipped up before you pick it up, I dumped its contents a couple times.<br /><br />As for the front phone pocket, My iPhone 6splus phone barely fits with a slim case in that front pocket on strap. It's a hard zip around it."
4.0,"Size up! Sleeves are more of a snug fitted look and tee is a trim build fit. My boyfriend is 6‚Äô2‚Äù wears a L and it looked shrink wrapped to him. We reordered a XL and it is more of a trim fit now like It is designed for a Muscle-y body, but still looks great on his. I kept the L for PJ‚Äôs or to pair w leggings to match. Great quality shirt and stitch work is beautiful."
4.0,I like this dress. The polka dot fabric has a fun texture. I bought medium because I was concerned small would be too small. The snuggness of the medium shows me I was right. I wish there were loops to hold the oh-so-cute belt in place; the line of the dress goes awry when the belt rides up in the back off of ones waist.
4.0,"I put this on my fit2 and it literally fell off after about 2 hours.  It did not fall apart at a point that I resized it but at the point that was not changed while adjusting the size. 1 star<br />Update: After the company noticed my review from earlier, they contacted me via email.  They apologized and offered me a replacement of the same kind or their other style.( https://www.amazon.com/TOROTOP-Milanese-Stainless-Bracelet-Connectors/dp/B071NPKNF4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1496322358&sr=8-3&keywords=torotop+gear+fit2+band ).  I accepted the replacement of the different type and received it yesterday.  I have been wearing it now for a few hours and like it a lot better.  The only downside I have noticed is that the band does not open enough for me so it is hard to get on and off but it has a strong magnet to stay closed while wearing it."
4.0,Very nicely made but they run large.
4.0,"These are great looking shoes I had never heard of Rugged Outback before buying these shoes. They seem well made to me, and I ordered a pair that was too big for my son. He should be able to wear them awhile so if your on the fence about buying them I encourage you to do so. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4.0,"I was looking for something warmer for winter (well, San Diego winter) and found these searching Amazon. They are a decent extra layer but not very warm at all. Still, for the price, they're worth it. Had to return and get the next size up so they weren't muscle shirt tight."
4.0,"This top goes perfectly over jeans, is long enough to wear with leggings. What I like is that it's conservative enough to wear to the office, but dressy enough for a night out.<br /><br />KEY NOTE: The flutter sleeves are actually sewn in such a way that when you lift your arms, people CANNOT see your armpit/bra through the opening."
4.0,This skirt is good quality.<br />A few things... runs very large!<br />Also the green skirt is not the same color as the pictured one. It's much lighter and not a true green. I purchased this skirt for a St. Patrick's day run and really needed a true green color to match my other clothes.
4.0,They run a little small but they are great
4.0,makes being out side so much easier
4.0,Nice I like
4.0,Very light material slightlty floppy.
4.0,Perfect fit. Kind of like the feel and weight of moisture wicking excercise tees n such. Perfect lightweight summer dress. Color is exactly as shown online.
4.0,"These are ok, not soft enough to be my favorite socks but they do have some extra cushioning on the bottom and they did hold their shape after washing and drying, however I have noticed some pilling around the toe area after washing, not sure how long they‚Äôll last."
4.0,"Love it. .exactly what I wanted, can't wait for my daughter to get it Christmas"
4.0,The bottoms were much higher on the waistline than the pic shows. They came up over the belly button.
4.0,Fits comfortable and as expected.
4.0,Loved the color! It is true to size. I would say it is better if you are not using the longer strap. Really love all the compartments!
4.0,Really cute but it kinda faded just after a month. No discoloration though. It just looked faded
4.0,Socks fit well and wear comfortable
4.0,Just what I needed for my planter fasciitis. I couldn't get women's so I got these and aside from being a touch wide fit great and feel wonderful!!!
4.0,A good deal for the money. They are just fine. Rod
4.0,Well made at a great price! Can't beat this deal!
4.0,I liked the pattern/color but bust area was too big for my pre-teen so we had it adjusted.
4.0,buckle is heavy but the belt is exactly as advertised.
4.0,"This is a very cute bathing suit, and it fits, but it is a tad too small. I love the bunching of the fabric in the front because it helps to hide my stomach. The top is the part that I feel is just a tad too small. To be a plus size bathing suit, it does not seem that they put much thought into a woman's plus size bust! the swimsuit is comfortable and stays in place, so I have no problems with that. The bottoms cover my entire bottom, and I do not have to pick anything out of anywhere if you get my drift! My only complaint is that top. I feel like I am falling out of it all the time and my cleavage is massive! While this may not be an issue for some of you, it is to those who want a little more modesty! But, the suit is still very cute and I would recommend it to anyone who likes that vintage look.<br /><br />I received this item at discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. My review is that of my own judgement and the price did not influence my decision in review of this item."
4.0,ships from china so it takes awhile. i love the versatility of it
4.0,I love it. I tad faded but it had a vintage look to it. I got an XL and normally wear a L. It fit well with room to tuck in the front.
4.0,Great price but they &#34;fall&#34; out of place multiple times throughout the day. Would buy again.
4.0,I love this blouse and fit perfectly.
4.0,"I like the boots!!! but these one is more sleepers than outside boots, the sole is hollow, you can use them outside but not frequently, if you know what I mean :)  other than that LOVE THEM!"
4.0,"Good fit, warm enough, great price.  Functionality of iPhone typing better than expected.  I would recommend this glove .. ."
4.0,"These are a bit more slender than the pic, but I like them as they are very lightweight. The green stone is very pretty. For the price, they are  very nice!"
4.0,"Beautiful handbag, a little heavy to carry around."
4.0,"Order came quickly, it does what it says it does though it should be noted that it us made of a Summerweight material, and as such would not suffice for winter warmoth needs. All that aside I am happy with it."
4.0,looks a little frumpy
4.0,Great for the summer
4.0,Bought this for 9 year old girl as part of a costume fit a little big but was not too big and bulky just danty and pettiete.
4.0,Holds a lot good for the price
4.0,"The material is thin and might get a tear.<br /><br />I tried wearing it on both sides of my Apple Watch sometimes it blocks circulation and not comfortable to wear<br /><br />I got the red one, the color is great"
4.0,"I haven‚Äôt worn this out yet, but it fit well when I tried it on. Fabric is significantly better than what I was expecting for the price. Hugs my curves well and was comfy"
4.0,Good product. Wish I would have gotten black.
4.0,"This was a very nice pair of slacks, just did not fit my body type. I have hips and curves down sides with no butt, normally fit in 16W. This would have been better for a 14 regular."
4.0,"Way big so size like two down. I wore it while I was Pregnant and it was comfortable but had to be sinched a lot. The chest needed to be pinned closed for modesty which was easy enough. The fabric is good, no see through. The length is very long and I'm 5'6&#34;."
4.0,"Good quality, useful<br />The baggers at the grocery store appreciated that it stands up right"
4.0,Great to use. Mine is quite full.<br />Just wish the dividers were heavy plastic like the index guides that I recently ordered.
4.0,These are very much what I wanted. I‚Äôve slept comfortably in them a few times. Mainly because the backs lock on so well they are difficult to take them off. The first time I wore these I thought they had simply become one with my ear lobes.
4.0,"It arrived on time and exactly as expected. The material is soft and the sweater is warm and cozy. I wear a 2X and it's oversized on me, which is exactly what I wanted. So comfy to wear off the shoulders like a wrap, with the sleeves rolled up.<br /><br />Only downside is that there aren't any care instructions, so I had to Google. Other than that, I say it's a winner!"
4.0,Slip on and off easily.  Good seal around face. easy to care for.
4.0,"I have ordered several pewter pendants from Dan's Jewelry and am always thrilled with the items. This pendant is no exception. The combination of antiqued and poliched pewter plus it's adjustable cord is a perfect match. Not too flashy, just an understaded winner with just enough weight to make it work for men to wear too."
4.0,I bought them for dementia residents. They cannot out on themselves. I also have a hard time with the clips. But they are very cute.
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it!
4.0,This is a beautiful and chic band that I purchased for my Apple Watch 4. I will take a picture and update my review once I size it to fit my watch.
4.0,Good thick flannel but runs slim and narrow
4.0,Fianc√© loves the elastic back and the quality of the material told I need to order more
4.0,"I like everything about this red dress except that I need someone to zip it the rest of the way up.  I have long arms but I still can't do it.  The material seems to be durable and the color is vivid red - very beautiful.  I haven't washed it yet but when I do I will update this review. It fits well enough and I'm 5'9"", 147 pounds.  It's a beautiful all-purpose dress that can be worn to semi-formal occasions and at the office too. I think wearing a silk scarf with it would really enhance the overall look too."
4.0,very delicate easily dented
4.0,Very nice pair of earrings. Be careful with the long post and try not to bend it too much.
4.0,"I wear a size 12, I went by the reviews and got a medium.  It wasn't tight,  but a little snug.  But the skirt in itself is gorgeous!  I ordered another color in a large, can't wait."
4.0,"It doesnt have a cotton material at all , but it fits great for the price."
4.0,I wear a size 9.5 and these are a little big.
4.0,huzzah!!!
4.0,"I love the green and black tie dye colors of this sweatshirt, they remind me of an abstract painting. Even though it somewhat looks like a sweatshirt, the material is lightweight, just as described online. It's hemmed at the sleeves and around the waist. As far as the fit, it fits me except for the hem that goes around my waist, it's a little tight (I got a size small and weigh 105 pounds).  And also, since it has the ""look"" of a sweatshirt, I think it would look better if it was cut a little looser. If you're in between sizes, you might want to go with the next size up.<br />'"
4.0,Love my hat! Lots of compliments! Only complaint was the packaging. Came in a bag and smashed my hat. I had to reshape it w a cardboard insert and hairspray! Awesome hat overall my fave!
4.0,I like it but it wasnt what I had expected.. I guess I should've looked at picture better.
4.0,This is a nice slide belt and buckle combination; but it takes a little learning how to release the buckle hold so you can remove your pants.
4.0,Cute necklace for the cat loves
4.0,Dress is as expected. Good fit. Only draw back is that it is very sheer. Other than that it is a beautiful dress. Fits comfortably. Good length.
4.0,"This is a lovely, plain mask in beautiful shades, with pocket for 95N filter, but we were using one with the exact same build with the vent in it, and the difference for breathing is tremendous. Now that the pandemic is starting to decrease, and we are vaccinated fully, I will opt for the vented mask."
4.0,"Comfortable, loose, great dress"
4.0,The quality of the material is not bad for the price. I should have ordered a small instead of a medium. Overall not bad
4.0,Was very happy with the timing  and product  thank u
4.0,"These glasses are definitely better quality than what you may expect. I was quite surprised upon unboxing and had a pleasant smile across my face.  I have shopped from sunglasses from so many retailers but never gave amazon a chance.  Rather than spend $300 on Rbans or w/e other name brand, i decided to try these and i'll tell you right off the bat it's a keeper.  I'm that guy who loses his glasses all the time so the price vs. quality factor makes these shades unbeatable. So why 4 stars and not 5 you might be wondering? well, that's b/c the nose guard is really painful and sits awkwardly on my face.  My face is a little too narrow and the bridge of my nose is not flat enough.  Customer service is amazing and that alone deserves 5 stars.  They quickly responded to my message and took care of the issue.  Unfortunately this 2nd pair has the same nose guard problem.  Maybe I need to wear it more? i'll update once I get used to wearing these.  For now, the polarized shades are simply amazing."
4.0,Nice color and nice quality. Needs to be broken in though!
4.0,"The lace was wonderfully soft and wearable, I loved it. However, the edges weren't hemmed, which looked especially odd next to the little tie sewn in. The tie looked bunchy when used. Overall, the sleeves and the length were much longer than anticipated. I ended up returning it."
4.0,"These ear muffs, I have been told, are just the thing. Mrs. Stone Dog - the ultimate recipient - reports they are comfortable. Though they don't have any size adjustment, they don't seem to need any. The faux-mink fur is surprisingly comfortable and does keep the ears warm while still being stylishly good-looking. They really don't have any weak points. I asked Mrs. if the fur tickled her ears or anything like that and she simply looked at me like I was nuts.<br /><br />So, nice looking accessories to keep the ears warm!"
4.0,"These are nice yoga pants - a bit thicker than a lot of the other spandex pants that I own.  The thickness and the color (I have these in grey) allow me to do a bit of bending without stretching to show the skin beneath - often a problem with yoga pants.  I tend to run pretty cold, so these spandex pants are really nice; I'm a bit warmer in them. I think they'd be best for late spring and fall.  For the apex of summer, they may be a bit too warm.  They wash really well and maintain their shape. I would recommend.<br /><br />I received a complimentary product for review."
4.0,Nice bag.  Love the color and the roominess.  I wasn't in a hurry for it but received it much faster than I expected.
4.0,Nice socks for the price. Right amount of cushioning and traction.
4.0,It is lovely and a perfect Mother's Day gift for my Mom.
4.0,It gave me the look I was going for. However I wish it was just a little bit longer
4.0,I didn!t realize how large the bag was going to be. Being some of the money is to go to charity I really don't care.
4.0,"These no-show liners are great for flats and open-top shoes - only the slightest bit of fabric shows and I did not experience any slippage or readjusting as I walked. The rubber lines the entire inside of the sock which I like as compared to other brands. I am a size 8 shoe and ordered a small - they fit but are a little tight. My only concern is that the material is thinner cotton than I expected - it almost feels like a nylon. I still like them, I was just expecting something else."
4.0,Arrived on schedule  and looks as portrayed  I have not have time to start wearing it and check it's durability.  I look forward with hope that it will be a great fit to my collection.
4.0,Cute but pricey for as simple as it is.
4.0,"Cute shirt, I wish the length was a little longer."
4.0,Love it. A bit snug.
4.0,Love these. Just what I wanted. Will get some more
4.0,I wore them for my wedding. They were great.
4.0,Nice quality plan to reorder.
4.0,"The legs at the calf are tight with no give , I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 the length is super long but over all I love the jeans ."
4.0,decent caps
4.0,"I got one of these for my wife. It was very cheap,  but it's really cute. Would look great with some black or gray leggings."
4.0,I wish they were a little bit bigger
4.0,love them that are very comfortable and the product of this item is very well done and does not feel cheap like other socks. I did like the color option they had a mix of colors for guys and girls. Only down side that I had with them is that they were a Little to long they came up to my knees witch I didn't like as much and down by my toes it was a little bit wide for my feet other than that they were great. I had received this product as a honest and unbiased opinion.
4.0,"The fabric was pretty good but it was wayyyy too big on me. I could fit two of me inside of it. I wish I could have found one that was alittle more fitted. But the wings and ears are super cute. But I still returned it. I am 5' 4"" and 180lbs"
4.0,Its a gorgeous necklace but chain is too thin and the clasp is very small and fragile.
4.0,I love everything but the sleeves. They flap over. If the fabric was the same when it flapped ocer it would look so much better.
4.0,"Very beautiful earrings and great quality!  There was a very slight bend to one of the posts, but it was not an issue.  The backs would not stay on (these are for an active toddler) so we replaced them with specialty backs."
4.0,Has nice warm fleece for neck and face
4.0,Cup size is a little to small and I went up a size. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise I absolutely love it!
4.0,"Wife liked the bag, however she thought it was leather, it says its vegan."
4.0,"I like the way it looks ,but I don't like the fact that the time doesn't show until you press a button,it doesn't stay on the screen."
4.0,"They are such a nice color, good price for how many you get. One thing I wish wouldn‚Äôt happen was color discoloration. I‚Äôve been using one for about 3 weeks and the color is changing, and it never touches water. Would still recommend and would buy again!"
4.0,The product is great and the color print is so vibrant! The 1.5 week shipping time seemed a bit long
4.0,"I typically wear s-m or 6-8, depending on the item. I ordered a Large and it fits pretty well. It is very cute. No care instructions so I feel that I may need to wash delicate or by hand, and then air dry. ?"
4.0,Comfortable light weight shorts. Order a size bigger as they are tight on the waist
4.0,"Very comfortable pants. Some of the reviews had me worried the pants would be too short.  When they arrived though, they fit me well. They look very nice on.  I wish the material was a little softer but is not a deal breaker."
4.0,Liked the weight. Had an issue with one zipper but seems to be self repairing
4.0,"the fleece has a nice weight and thickness, although i had to reorder a larger size to fit properly.  would prefer if the iron-on logo wasn't there."
4.0,"These are perfect little earrings for work. Initially I was not pleased because I thought I was getting some large chunky earrings, which these are not. They are however well made, very dainty ladylike earrings which give you a hint of color and are very work appropriate. I have purchased rings from the seller before, so I knew they would not disappoint in regards to the color and quality of the stone. I have made these my everyday earrings."
4.0,Not bad at all for the price
4.0,"Diameter is pretty small and not easy to install on any volume of beard.  I saw a video you put dental floss in a loop through it first, loop around the beard, then pull it thru.  NICE"
4.0,"A little tight, but I have a big head. Nice wig for Halloween."
4.0,The material with the lines looks different and sophisticated. It's not transparent but has no stretch. The red flowers on top looks attractive. The length is perfect. I wear a size 14 and based on the size chart ordered a medium. I struggled and got my right arm through  and got the dress over my head and the body was very roomy.  But could not get the left hand through completely and got stuck half way. So had to remove the dress and could not try it fully on.  Planning on returning it. Going one size bigger will get my arms in but the body will be too loose.
4.0,I would only like these fingers to be longer like the actual Grinch. But overall it's perfect. I may put pipe cleaners into the fingers to make them look longer. BUY this product
4.0,We are clearing some property with a large number of salmon berry bushes that have very large thorns.  These do not totally prevent occasionally being poked by thorns but they do a very good job. I would definitely buy them again
4.0,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish they would offer more colors.  Pastels and winter just don't seem to go together for me.  Love to see it in a dark red or brown etc.
4.0,"Very pretty, occasionally slip from the ears but not all the time. I use them in my 2nd holes and fix them maybe once or twice daily, it doesn't bother me. I would recommend them."
4.0,These spandex feel real nice. I will buy these again.
4.0,I received so many compliments on this outfit!
4.0,The leggings are not as compression as I imagined they would be and the fit is a tad large.
4.0,i adore this dress! I am somewhat obsessed with strawberries so love at first sight! only downfall is the chest area is a lil baggy almost as if this is a plus size dress. I bought a medium i'm a 36 D and 160 pounds so I just wasn't expecting a medium to still have room is all. still love this product :)
4.0,"This dress was beautiful..but I returned it. I bought a small , but was loose for me on my bust area..which I dint like much..rest of the things were okay..the olive and black color combination was great..<br />For reference incase it helps - I'm a<br />34C- 26.5 - 36, and bought a small.."
4.0,If you wear stockings with this skirt it will tear them. The small metal pieces on the skirt tend to bend and latch on to anything under. Other than that skirt fit as expected.
4.0,Size fits true. Great for winter.
4.0,Beautiful purse. A bit small but beautiful
4.0,"My parents loved it, it was a very funny and great gift for them."
4.0,Love the look.  Needed to punch another hole in the band.
4.0,Perfect for going out or lounging around. Sandals or sneakers  !
4.0,"I really like how it fits, but only 4 stars because after washing it, the material is not as soft as it was; rather stiff"
4.0,Not a bad bra...
4.0,"The dress was cute, but my build is rather ""straight up and down.""  This shape wasn't flattering for my figure.  It also seemed as though the waist was a bit too high for me."
4.0,Pros: pretty easy to wrap<br /><br />Cons: it's slips easily.  I think I may have to sew some clips in so it'll stay.
4.0,"Does the job and bright enough that I should not set this down someplace and not see where I set it - you know, for those Sr. moments."
4.0,"Very cute bathing suit for the price. I got a medium (I‚Äôm about a size 7 or 8) and it was *slightly* large. It still fits fine and I will wear it. I have an abnormally long torso, so I‚Äôm mostly just excited that I found a one-piece that fits me! I‚Äôm not so sure that the loops that secure the straps will remain intact for the life of the bathing suit. They looked a bit questionable, but I still like the suit."
4.0,Nice ring .really wide .order up one size. Glad I did
4.0,Handles are to long for most women.
4.0,"I liked them, but haven't worn them at my workouts yet or washed & dried them yet.  we'll see.  other than that they appear to fit well."
4.0,Very good and as expected.
4.0,"This bra is comfortable but provide zero to little support. Im 32b I order a small and the cups are a tad bit big. The under bra band is also large, could be slimmer. I'm going to wear this bra when running errands so my nipples don't show but its not good to wear going out. Not sexy just comfy for lazy days."
4.0,Normal para su precio
4.0,"The onesie is adorable and fits great! However, the leg warmers fit a child around 2 or 3 years old. They are bigger than my babies legs! The headband is also much too big and would probably fit an older child. However, for the price, the onesie was worth what I paid and I just gave the leg warmers away."
4.0,This is a great dress. Love the fit and cute style and good quality. But I could tell it had been worn and returned because when I opened the bag the smell of B.O. almost knocked me off my feet. I washed in with Tide and a little vinegar on the arm pits just in case and it's fine now. Would have liked to get a discount for that.
4.0,"Fun, reasonably well made earrings for the low price."
4.0,"I am ver satisfied with this choice. It can fit my mouse, cables, connectors, adaptors, flash drives, etc. without loosing them on the backpack, even after log travels."
4.0,For me personally they seem to be a little on the small size. I‚Äôm a big guy but other 3x have fit well these are a little tight. With that being said I will purchase them again
4.0,I liked how it was made and love how it looks on me!!
4.0,Not bad. Did alot of adjustments but it was ok for the purpose
4.0,I bought this band and it is nice.  However installing the little pices neeeded to install it on to my watch turned out to be a bit of a headache.  Furthermore I had to take it to a watch repair to have a couple of links taken out of it.
4.0,"Review at week 1: Great look and feel, a little bulky but expecting it to ease up with wear"
4.0,The camis themselves are cut a bit on the short side (personal preference) and came with a bunch of loose threads but considering the cost it's still a good deal! they are  otherwise just as advertised.
4.0,"So when I bought this I thought for sure it would be kinda cheaply made with the patches and stuff put on with fabric glue, Much like the official minor league jersey I paid over 100 dollars for. Let me tell you this is anything but cheaply made, all patches and emblems are sewn on and very well put together.  I feel like I got a steal for the price I paid for this jersey.<br /><br />It did include the fight strap on the back which i thought was an odd design choice but it is what it is.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about ordering this then just do it, you wont regret it."
4.0,"The product I ordered for a friends birthday arrived in plenty of time, happy with the price.<br />The charm itself was not as ""clear & detailed"" as the picture showed, a bit on the small size I thought<br />when the charm arrived. Otherwise a perfect gift for a perfect friend!!"
4.0,I'm 5'4 145 pounds. I purchased a small and it fits very well. It did come tore so the straps couldn't go through the loop but luckily I'm handy with sewing.
4.0,Little bigger than I expected wish there was a womens version
4.0,I've gotten so many compliments on this dress! The only &#34;con&#34; I have is that the decorative stitching is a little itchy. Wish it would have been covered with some interfacing.
4.0,"I love the color and fit, but wish the material was a bit softer; feels a little cheap. I tried another color from same company, looked to be the same style but had black sleeves and solid body. For some reason the fit was way smaller. Returned that one."
4.0,Fit well. Great light and wrinkle free fabric. Good price.
4.0,"I got a large and I'm a 34C.  loved the top, it fit well and makes everything look great. What I didn't realize was that the pads were not removable. At that price it makes sense so I just cut seam a tiny bit and took them out myself, easy.<br /><br />But the bottoms were too small. My pant size is about a 6/8 or 28. I do have a very athletic body and my lower half is muscular. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I just kept it but next time I'd go bigger since the top is adjustable."
4.0,the material is a little bit off and the length is a littler longer than what i thought it would be but it really nice!
4.0,"I am 5'4 & bought a medium and it covers my booty just the right amount when wearing leggings, without it looking like im swimming in it. Which is exactly what it was intended for. I bought it in black, which I love and light grey, which is slightly see through unfortunately. Very comfy and a nice alternative to a plain basic t-shirt."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:aeeeec97ab49090f710ee511a4c07cea]] It's comfortable and adjustable but it has a little bit of a smell and still pulls my ears down
4.0,"No est√° mal, los modelos s√∫per lindos pero pens√© que era otro tipo de tela, no est√° mal pero no me encanto"
4.0,"Good for walking outside in the cold and good for driving, but not the warmest. Your hands will start to get cold the second you touch that steering wheel but it's still better than no gloves at all. Don't expect these to be your go-to gloves for winters in New England. I'm fortunate enough to not have to do much shoveling or prolonged outdoor activities so the gloves are perfect for what I got them for. I just wish they were warmer."
4.0,The bottoms were very baggy but the top was tight. Very cute though!
4.0,"Arrived in a timely manner, packaging was okay.  Like the pendant very much; don't care for the rope necklace it came on but no biggie, I took it off and hung it on my own necklace. Its a nice weight and was good buy."
4.0,A little darker than I would have liked but other than that image is great and Mother and x3 children very visible to me and it's sketched on both sides.
4.0,I ordered two dresses one and a small this one and the black and white in a medium. The small is almost too tight the medium a little loose. I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù and I weigh approximately 116 pounds. I will figure out how to make both work. The fabric was a lot thinner than I thought it would be so maybe if you think you are one size by two dresses and return the one that doesn‚Äôt fit properly
4.0,Very thin & shear. You can see the pockets. Wrinkles very easily. Back zip hard to do alone w/ limited mobility.
4.0,Outfit fits true to size and is very comfortable to my 2yr Goddaughter. She is picky and loved it. Skort is on the long side.
4.0,"It is a little short in the torso, but looks good on."
4.0,"VERY short, but overall cute and comfy."
4.0,Gidt
4.0,The shoe was a little narrow but the heal was higher than I though.  They made a great for my sister.
4.0,The tassel embellishments are kind of cheap looking. But the wallet itself is nice for the price!
4.0,very comfortable not something you can wear out as pictured
4.0,"I like the glasses. My only complaint is that there are no clear glasses in this pack. One dark(normal) set, one blue tinted set, but two yellow tinted sets."
4.0,"very nice looking watch, nice fit clear fave easily read.I wiould buy another!"
4.0,"I usually order my sweatshirts one size up and this one fit pretty good.  One thing I do appreciate about this sweatshirt is that the thumb holes are discrete so if you don't want to put your thumb though the loop it doesn't look like a ripped sweatshirt. This is a thin pullover so it would be idea for when you walk into a room that is colder than what you were experiencing outside. Its light a thin. As a tall woman I am impressed with the length, but I did order a size up so I'm not sure if it would be the same with the large."
4.0,"I'm giving this 4 stars because of how the breast area fits (it's loose in the band). For reference, I am 230lbs, 5'8&#34; and my hip size is about 50 inches or so. The fit is very flattering for plus size women and I would def recommend. The price point is very attractive as well"
4.0,I love this dress it's super cute and comfortable. My only problem with it is that it doesn't have a zipper in the back which is no big deal because it's stretchy. But the back of the dress is really stretchy and you can tell so it looks a bit off but nothing that a cardigan can't fix!
4.0,"I am 310 lbs 5‚Äô9. They fit great but, they are thin. I kind of like thicker legging material usually. Also they are a little tight on my calves. I ordered the 2x. I would say they fit as expected. But if you like looser leggings i would go a size up."
4.0,i like the colors alot.  it goes with every solid color tshirt etc.
4.0,"Well...I got a small and was happy that it was actually smaller than the usual t-shirts that usually wind up being so long that I have to tie a knot on one side. So it's in between a regular t-shirt and a fitted shirt. Of course I did not read the description about it on Amazon until now, which says not to put it in the dryer. So guess what!! Of course I put it in the dryer and now the dandelion wish is peeling off üòî But who is ever going to think they can't just throw a t-shirt in the dryer? I'm sad that I didn't realize because now I probably won't wear it much since it's peeling off already."
4.0,They are  very preety  I both the for my daughter  birthday  my only disappointment  was the latch dont work  one wont open at all and the other opens but it  cant close  now it's open  but she love them  anyway
4.0,It was for my daughter and she likes it so ....
4.0,"They looked very cool and were lightweight, but I found them too tight on my face and had to return them."
4.0,"Fit well, work well for the price."
4.0,Fits great. Not as big as others have said.
4.0,"I like this &#34;night dress&#34; very much.  It fit as I expected and is very comfortable.  The hem stitching was coming apart in one spot so I had to repair it by sewing it.  Other than that, I love it!  I would chance buying another one."
4.0,"Light wait, folds up small easy to store. Not fond of plastic zippers."
4.0,"It's worth what I paid for, but not any more. It's obviously &#34;pleather.&#34;  Some purses and wallets are difficult to tell, but this is definitely lower end. Nonetheless, I do like it. I'm giving it to my daughter, because it's a little funky that way. But, you could pay more, even at Target or Walmart for it. So, it's an okay purchase."
4.0,"I HATED it when I first put it on. It just felt very frumpy and big and.... ugh. But then I decided to try to rehab it... and I realized that I could take of the bottom ruffle part pretty easily with a seam ripper, and VOILA! It was perfect!  Sexy, flowy and lovely. Just what I was looking for."
4.0,Great dress! I wore it at my nephews wedding and everyone loved it. The only thing I was not a fan of was the belt. I had to Bobby pin it so it can stay.
4.0,It has held up well. The material on the inside is really cheap but it has held up.
4.0,Great fit overalls. Material is a little on the low side but it's worth it's purpose
4.0,Loved the style. Wrist was a little small for the tightest knot but super cute and comfortable.
4.0,The only thing that could make these better is pockets!
4.0,"The cut, fit and material is good just the arm holes are like twice the size it should be. Not that noticeable. I do have small arms so maybe I just need a smaller size. Cute shirt though. It‚Äôs flattering."
4.0,"Used for a family photo, great fit but the fabric is thin."
4.0,Well made product ......Recommended !!!
4.0,"Returning these since they were tight, I feel like they look more pointy in person as well."
4.0,Me gust√≥ el estilo y la talla me qued√© perfecta
4.0,Nice shirt. Femine fits nicely.
4.0,"First of all I like the print my son likes it. He‚Äôs almost 3 and normally wear 3t-4t. These swimming suits fit ok. The pants are long and loose. Luckily, it‚Äôs adjustable drawstring type and man it‚Äôs long too. We had a lot of compliments though."
4.0,"Not as green as the photo, but my wife loved them so I guess they are a pretty good gift for discerning wives!"
4.0,"these socks are way too big for 6month old... actually fit the 2 year old???? don't know how the managed to size these, just glad I have a two year old... they are otherwise very cute..."
4.0,shoulder area is not flexible  other wise its fine
4.0,"Super cute, great tie dye pattern but not very soft."
4.0,"its okay but I thought it would be bigger. My wife is small so I gave it to her. she really likes it. It fits her well and she is happy with it. The shipping was great, they ship really fast, Thanks!"
4.0,Looks great and wears nicely!
4.0,These are a good quality hiking/workout pants.  I wear  44 inch waste jeans and the xxlarge is very tight.  I like the feel of them and  still plan on wearing them. The stretch waist band  does have a lot of stretch in it.
4.0,Using these slippers for in-house . Create sound when waking on wooden floor . Large is big enough for my son who wears a 10. Good quality for the price paid .
4.0,Fit well and very comfortable.would by again.
4.0,"Stiff, but does the job! Wish it was a slightly softer material, but decent for the price."
4.0,This was a beautiful blouse but after reading the reviews about it running small I decided to order up a couple of sizes but it was way way too big
4.0,"The model in the picture must be wearing a sweater 2 sizes too big, or she has REALLY short arms.  The sweater is nice, good quality and thick but not too heavy.  I got a 2xl and usually wear an xl in cardigans‚Ä¶it fits like an xl on the smaller side, so I am glad I sized up.  It is a nice color and a good length‚Ä¶I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù and it falls just at the bottom of my hips.  The sleeves, however, are nowhere near as cute as the picture.  If the model pulled the sleeves over her hands, they would probably hang a couple of inches past her fingertips.  When I pull the sleeves over my hands, they just cover my fingertips.  The wrist cuff also isn‚Äôt very fitted, so rather than the cute puff in the picture, my sleeves just look frumpy and sloppy‚Ä¶not a good look.  Otherwise it is a nice sweater."
4.0,"This is probably on me, but I liked it way better in the reviews than I did in the actual mirror. I might make some alterations to get it to work better for me, 'cause the colour and the material are really nice. I'm still not sold on the heart buttons either, but, we'll see what I end up doing with it. Honestly I probably would have returned it but I didn't have time before I moved across the country and now it's too late. Not a total loss, though! Again, it's really cute! Just not sure how I like it on me c;"
4.0,It took me awhile to finally buy biker shirt online and so glad I did. I‚Äôm a size 12/13 and L works well. Really soft. only thing i wish is a pocket
4.0,I bought this bag to go threw security checkpoints and it seems to be well made shoulder straps could use some work but overall well constructed. Just so people know snaps for the 6 side pouches are magnetic snaps.
4.0,"These are very beautiful and so unique. I love how they look. They are a little bit small so I would recommend ordering a size up. My main problem with these is that the straps are not very secure, but this can be easily fixed with a few stitches. Overall, I love them and I would buy from this company again."
4.0,I am so tired of my husband losing glasses in the ocean. So we finally caved and ordered these for him. We both actually worked in the sunglass industry and so this was very out of character to get a non-name brand pair. But even with his very sensitive and particular eyes he is happy.
4.0,"Though this is a lovely sweater and really good quality, however the description and picture was for a blue sweater.  Mine arrived and I thought green.  Under bright light it is a deep green/teal color.  Definitely not blue.  Tried on with various dresses and tops and the blue is not reflected, most definitely a green hue. Fits true to size (I have apple body and wear a size 10 in sweaters), a little boxy.  I would purchase if you accept the color does not fit the description or as shown."
4.0,Comfortable shoes although straps are made out cheap material. They squeak when you walk
4.0,Loved the color I got (burgundy) and the material is great! Loved the cut as well. I think the cardigan would be perfect though if it lost the pockets.
4.0,"Not cheap looking, despite the $4.90 price tag. Fashionable and probably good for parties/whatnot. Or gothic every day wear."
4.0,I like the shape and he straps.  Wish it wasn‚Äôt ribbed material.
4.0,It's cheap material but it had a cheap price tag. Overall happy with the purchase
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty. I purchased this to add as a layering piece to other necklaces, but the color didn't quite match what I was looking for.  The color of the chain isn't grey-silvery like in the photo, but more of a white-silver. It 'definitely more shiny and eye-catching, but not bad for the price and quality."
4.0,cute on
4.0,"This is a really nice shirt. It runs a bit small though. But I like it none the less. I wear an large-xtra large. This is an Xtra large and it's a little smaller than I would like. If you wear an Xtra large, get an xxlarge."
4.0,The band is well designed. Although it has some glue strain but it still rock it.
4.0,"The inner lining skirt is ridiculously short. They may as well have left it off‚Äîit simply bunches up and creates more of an issue. Expect to find alternative means to remedy the issue.<br />Otherwise, it‚Äôs a cheap but cute tutu and worked for what we needed. I don‚Äôt expect it will last through more than a few wearings."
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet, bought for my 16 year old niece, this is something I think she could wear for years to come. Wish I had bought one for myself! Item is as pictured and much more solid and sturdy than what I expected, given that the price was relatively inexpensive. Nicely boxed also. I can get it on and off easily but I wasn't worried about it coming off. Very nice product, thanks."
4.0,It's nice clutch but the quality isn't the best but it was not very expensive so what can u expect?!
4.0,"I really wish the aviator style glasses looked better on my small face. For these, while I like the orange color a lot and the style, they just don't fit my face right. However, that doesn't mean they're not great glasses! The polarized, mirrored lenses keep glare at bay on the brightest of days. They're not top of the line, but they're good to toss in your car or purse! They even come with a case so you don't accidentally scratch the mirrored frames. They're light and comfortable on my ears and have adjustable nose pads. Overall, I really wish this style fit my face better, because I'd love to rock these glasses more often."
4.0,"cute... but spaces for ID, etc are tight"
4.0,"This is a very pretty band, and it allows a lot more airflow than the one the Apple Watch comes with. I‚Äôve only worn it for a few hours now, and I‚Äôm concerned about how thin the enclosure chain is.  This definitely won‚Äôt be my everyday band, as I‚Äôm not sure how the chain that keeps it on my wrist will hold up. Also, I thought this would be a dark grey metal, but it actually is black."
4.0,"No instructions ,so I don't no how to set things like the calendar."
4.0,"Looks great, bottoms are a little snug, but overall it is what I expected. You can beat the price. And it is super cute. Go with the larger size than normal and it should fit."
4.0,"Very Pretty, my granddaughter wil love it"
4.0,"I loved the look of these online but unfortunately had to return because i rolled the dice on a size that was too small because mine wasnt in stock.<br />i have to admit when they arrived they seemed to be extremely cheaply made, but i should have expected it. In person they look and feel like they should cost $20 max. I didn't re-purchase them later.  crocs seem to be overpriced nowadays, i guess they have people hooked so they can up the prices."
4.0,Good basic belt.
4.0,"Bought this fo my friend she loves it, fit reallt good"
4.0,This was basically the only Jersey for Cruz Azul that I could find. My dad seems to have loved this soccer team my whole life.<br />He absolutely loved it.<br />My only complain is that it is very see through<br />He's no a short sorta wide dude so it fit good but just a tad long
4.0,Size was good and quick shipping
4.0,"Nice little watch for the money, and its white great for the summer."
4.0,Very pretty but too large. No smaller size available.
4.0,Bellos! Pero cuesta much√≠simo colocarlos xq la parte de atr√°s es una bolita y cuesta encontrar la abertura para ponerlos
4.0,Could be a little more elasticity around waist but overall good fit
4.0,Nice for travel and like overall. The straps on the front are decoration and you have magnetic snaps. So not as secure as I like.But a nice carry on bag for weekend getaway.
4.0,First corset and I love it. Smaller than expected but it does the job. I know what to expect now. Great buy nonetheless.
4.0,"It's a wallet, it's made of leather, probably on par with any $10-20 offering you might find at your local flea market. I have no complaints about its construction, it's great albeit a little on the large side.  What I really can't get past with this thing, though, is the smell.  It appears to be coming from the outer flap, and a polite way to describe it would be to say that it smells like bad shrimp.  The first whiff I caught of it coincided with my wife opening the refrigerator, and I immediately thought something in there had spoiled. When I smelled it again later that day I checked the bottom of my shoes in confusion. That evening I caught a third whiff and excused myself to the bathroom for a hygiene check, worried that the smell was coming with me- it wasn't, but it was traveling with me. It wasn't until the next morning that I realized the smell was coming from the wallet.<br /><br />The outside of the wallet smells fine, as does the inside, it's the rough interior of the outer flap that the smell comes from. Is it the dye? Some sort of chemical treatment? Did this cow rot for weeks before the skin was harvested off of his putrid body? Is that just what it smells like in China? I have no answers, but I've enjoyed getting all of my friends to smell the wallet.  8/10, worth the price for the smell alone."
4.0,Covers to much of my forehead honestly. Looks like it swallows my face if you don't let it fit loose on the top.
4.0,I received it on time but there were two empty holes as if someone wanted 1 pair but not the others....
4.0,Just wish it had the side nylon pocket outside to hold water or phone.  Using it for vacation.  Otherwise everything looks great.
4.0,Cute but I can't wear them!
4.0,"The pros - really nice material, good quality<br />The cons - tight arms, too boxy.<br /><br />I am 5'2"" a true Size 12 - the large was TOO boxy and arms were tight. I would size down but the arms couldn't fit. Just too much material to be flattering for me. But I loved the material and grid design."
4.0,A little larger than what came with the watch but works perfect. I wear it everyday
4.0,Comfortable. All day wear without issues.
4.0,"Overall I think these boots are great, but there are a couple things that kept me from giving all five stars.<br /><br />One, the sole of the boot is like a rainboot material - so it is soft and flexible. I was hoping for more of a sturdy sole like you would get with other boots. After wearing less than 20 times the left one has sprung a leak. I think it's probably fixable, but it's frustrating to already have to fix them after having them for only a few months.<br /><br />Besides these two things they are very cute and great for keeping your feet dry and stylish when commuting to work."
4.0,"I definitely agree with  &quot;K. Shelby Skrhak&quot;'s review. If you have any squish to your mid-section, it will show it.<br /><br />That's not the dress's fault, it's my own for eating junk and not going to the gym like I used to. The dress it self is soft, smooth, and comfortable. I ordered a XL (10), and my measurements are 5'6, 171, 35-29-41 (dat trunk got some junk).<br /><br />I've never worn Spanx in my life, but I'm considering venturing into the world of shapewear in order to make this dress look as good as possible. I ordered it in both the grey and the teal, and I don't want to return it because they are both comfortable, well-made, no snag/tears/issues with the craftmanship itself, just with my own poochy belly.<br /><br />To the gym I go! (after I write a few more reviews)"
4.0,"It‚Äôs ok. I ordered a small but it was too tight on my chest. For reference I‚Äôm 120 lbs, 34D chest and 5‚Äô4. I exchanged for a medium and it‚Äôs better but lose around the stomach area. I wish it was fitted with the entire shirt. I think you can find better"
4.0,"Very comfortable, flips with good arch and heel support,  These are my second pair, I finally wore my first pair out after 3 years of continuous wear."
4.0,Love it!! Enough room. I said that when I first got it. I still love it but it has came apart a little inside and lost a metal button already. :/
4.0,"A little small, but I will keep it.  It is so pretty and I will lose a bit of weight to wear it.  Thanks!"
4.0,"I really like the fabric and the fit and i'm so happy that this dress is lined.  I'm small up top so can easily go without a bra, but a strapless bra would work too because of the lining.<br />My only concern is that the outer (sheer) fabric is wrinkled even after washing.  I'll iron it before wearing, but I hope those aren't permanent b/c it will probably just mean I either go out all wrinkly or I won't wear it much."
4.0,"Very pretty,but much smaller/shorter than they looked."
4.0,"I like the way it looks but the material is rather thin on the green part, there's  not really a lining across the abdomen. It fit as I expected for the size I ordered."
4.0,As stated. Good quality. Runs a little small.
4.0,"It‚Äôs light weight, makes me sweat, price is fine.<br />My only issue is that even I bought size L and i have plenty space for my tummy, it‚Äôs small for my chest but it‚Äôs not really uncomfortable."
4.0,"I like the quality and fit of these shorts. So far, I expect to buy another pair!"
4.0,My guy loves these! He wore them our whole vacay and he looked good in them. The packaging was really nice too!
4.0,This top is amazing.  It's well constructed and fits well.  I have long arms and wide shoulders and more importantly it makes my tummy area look flatter.  I would buy more if the top came to more colors
4.0,Runs a bit short.  Otherwise very cute.
4.0,I love these! But unfortunately they tune my ears green which is a big disappointment but other than that they are so cute!
4.0,"I've got a booty and bought an XL. They barely fit. My advice is to size up or if you really have a booty, please know that they will go on, but might not be the comfyest.<br />Good quality otherwise."
4.0,Dressy watch. Comfortable & perfect fit. I have a small wrist. Able to read easily as well.
4.0,"I got this set of jewelry because I started doing chakra flow yoga and I started to learn more about them. I'm also doing a Reiki course which involves chakras as well, so I wanted to acquire some chakra jewelry.<br /><br />My favorite in the set is the metal beaded bracelet. It fits well, it does not tug on your arm hairs and it looks very pretty on.<br />This is cute set of jewelry, but i did not give 5 stars because not all of the stone beads are genuine. I do not feel as though they could be beneficial to the chakras unless they are real, so it kind of defeats the purpose. The regular beaded bracelets is a bit bigger than I expected but it still looks very nice, and i like the style.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
4.0,"Love the sweater, going to get one size up as it is tight for a large."
4.0,"I like my shirt. It is a little big. The sleeves are too loose and the back goes down to my knees. I ordered an XXL. I'm 5'8&#34; and 200lbs. I probably should have ordered an XL or maybe even L. But it is comfy, and I kept it. The shirt is very soft. I washed and dried kind of hoping it would shrink a little, but it didn't."
4.0,Very nice and looks great with everything! Had been looking for ear cuffs of a certain style and glad to say that I found them. I have ordered more already!
4.0,Not what I expected but I love that you can take the bar off. Two earrings in one!
4.0,"The material is really soft and, while my measurements are a little bigger than the model's, it fits really well!"
4.0,"Love these gaucho capri's!  so comfortable.  Color is exactly as shown.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are already starting to pill and I haven't had them very long.  I also NEVER put my clothes in the dryer, only hang dry them, so this is a bit disappointing.  That said, I still wear them all the time.  I am 5'3"" 112 lbs and they fit perfectly."
4.0,Love these gloves. Superior dexterity and much more comfortable then city issued bargain bin gloves. Leather of the palms has started to deteriorate and fall apart after approx 4 years of hard use. Time to replace.
4.0,Such a cute bathing suit & it fit me like a glove.
4.0,These clips work very nicely to cover the silicone stopper for your beads but I will say I never received the round clip stopper that they show as advertised I don't appreciate that.
4.0,"I'm giving these four stars because, with the addition of an insole, they are quite nice. However, be aware that these are not comfort shoes. They don't feel very good when walking and I did have to add that insole in order to make them usable for me. At under 150 pounds, they really shouldn't have been so uncomfortable for walking short distances. Without the insole, they are a three, as to comfort and usability, with the insole a five, and, since most of us have insoles laying around the house, I am giving this four stars, splitting the difference, because they are quite good with the additional insole."
4.0,Love this dress although the arms are a little tight.
4.0,It's really pretty live itüòç
4.0,I didn't like the way it fit me but the material was good. I gave it too my daughter in law and she loves it.
4.0,"Size runs large, a little loose on me, but the quality was better than expected."
4.0,I love the X-Men series. The only two things I did not like about this were the $50 price tag and it wasn't the 4K UHD that I thought I was buying. I don't plan on buying any more movies from Amazon.
4.0,Tiny but adorable
4.0,"I thought they were pretty, a bit larger than expected, but still ok. I wish I had ordered the black & gold ones, & may still do so. First pair I received was damaged & bent but Amazon sent another pair out right away & they were fine. I thought they were a fair price for what I got."
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 , 200 lbs, and I ordered both the XL and L which were way to big. The material is nice and light and the torso runs long, the arms can fit slightly snug if you have 18 inch biceps. If you want it to fit your form, I‚Äôd recommend two sizes lower."
4.0,This is more like a shirt on me.  I wear size 10 normally and it fit shorter than anticipated and already bought black shirt kind of like it so really wish I would have purchased a black dress I was looking at instead of this.  It will be okay with leggins.
4.0,I think it's fading....
4.0,It works well with my gold and silver. Not many cloths have the feature for cleaning gold and silver. It's either or and this one I like.
4.0,"It's really cute just like the picture but way too large for a small and extremely thin, material is nice tho but highly doubt it'll keep me warm much at all"
4.0,"I love the way the dress is made. The material isn‚Äôt too hot. The only downfall is for people that have big upper arms, like I do. It felt a bit snug when I tried it on, but once I actually put it on to wear, it felt more comfortable. I wore control briefs (I think is what they‚Äôre called‚Äù to control my muffin tops, but I like the style of the dress."
4.0,"Love love love! I ordered a size up because I read that it runs small and it fits pretty well, I could have even ordered an extra size up but it fits and looks great."
4.0,"Pretty great. Took this on a backcountry canoeing expedition and managed to put a lot of pressure on it with portaging, etc. My two pairs of glasses never seemed affected by it. The only negative is the clip. I replaced mine with an aluminum carabiner."
4.0,"This dress is so cute! It‚Äôs a little on the thin side, see through and gets wrinkly easily but it‚Äôs perfect for the beach to go over your swim suit. The material isn‚Äôt the best (obviously) but if you‚Äôre like me and get tired of clothes fast then it‚Äôs great. Such a cutesy dress for Instagram pics, I paired it with a bamboo clutch and bam!"
4.0,For ok. Just as it looks in display
4.0,Really cute. Very happy with purchase
4.0,"Pay attention to the size in the title of these, didn‚Äôt know what size I ordered until it was too late. But the shoe is super nice. Comfortable! True to size:)"
4.0,I bought a size 10 and it was more like a size 8. Would order a size up. Nice fleece pants.
4.0,I like it because fits perfect ! But I wish have more  pleats.
4.0,I love these! But they are not pink.
4.0,Algo opaca. Falta m√°s resoluci√≥n
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34;, 135 lbs, athletic build. I grabbed a large. Wasn't a compression shirt in that it was snug or tight all around; the mid drift area was loose, however, arms fit well length wise as did the body. It is a thinner shirt so works well as a base layer. Keep in mind; the shirt itself isn't cotton, however the threading at the seams is - if you dry it, the seams shrink a bit resulting in a slight puckering of the shirt. Overall, I was very happy with this purchase - went glacier hiking, spelunking in lava tubes and snorkeling between the tectonic plates of North America and Europe in Iceland wearing these as my base layer in 30 - 40 degree F temperatures. Wouldn't work alone but great as a skin layer with other layers on top. The colours as nice as well and didn't run or bleed in the wash. Great purchase for a great price."
4.0,"This is a well made hat, good for someone with a larger head than mine, a bit more masculine than I prefer."
4.0,This sure does make my stomach area sweat! The only problem I have with it is that it's a little too big for me because I have a short torso. Im 5'2 and the band goes slightly up to my chest so I have to pull it down.
4.0,"I LOVE how warm this hat is. It's so cute and the quality of the fabric is amazing! However, it's a wee bit small for being a slouch hat. Maybe my head is just large, but it doesn't slouch anywhere near the picture. Would definitely buy again, though."
4.0,"These are great underwear.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they have a tendency to stretch out during normal wear and become a little baggy by the end of the day.  I personally don't find this too much trouble though, but next time I order, I'll probably order one size down."
4.0,This brand is dope when it comes to the Samsung gear 2 bands.
4.0,Cute bathing suit. My measurements are 32-29-43 I ordered a LG fits ok
4.0,The material is nice but you must be careful washing it as it falls apart easily
4.0,"I thought this item looks great. I bought it as a gift and my wife thought it was a knock off. She thought it felt too light, but is that not the purpose. I would not want to carry anything heavy, especially if it's already filled with stuff lol. I like it."
4.0,"I have received so many compliments on my gecko. It is a little difficult to get it to wrap around your ear, but once it is done, it is stunning."
4.0,"Ive never ordered jeans online, but I have to say I'm very happy with these. Said low rise in description, more of a mid rise....id prefer them low rise but overall they are great.<br />Also went with a size larger as recommended by other buyers, I'm 5'7 and pretty curvy, usually a 13, 15 was perfect"
4.0,"Quality work on the pendent, but the rubber chain was wavy out of the box and would only straighten after heating in very warm water.<br /><br />IBLUE's shipping price reduction for multiple items was the only thing that made a four item purchase good. Four items had $4.95 S&H each, but their multiple purchase discount dropped the total freight to $7.00 and made the deal a steal."
4.0,I needed a clear bag for an event. This bag fit the bill perfectly. I recommend. It's a thicker vinyl than others I've felt which I love.
4.0,Bought these because we were having a pajama day at work and they were cheap! Thought they were going to suck but I was wrong! They are super comfortable! I used them everyday specially when I get home from work I take off my shoes and put my slippers on!
4.0,It‚Äôs my 1st time buying Maven Thread headbands and I love them. They are so comfortable and don‚Äôt come off when I am running. I just wish they made one with a little bit thinner width
4.0,Pretty dress. I ordered a size too large but it still looked good on
4.0,This was a present. She likes it alot.
4.0,Loved the shirt but it runs small so it had to returned.  Size up ladies.
4.0,"I really love it shipping was fast , and the seller stayed In contact with me and answered all of my annoying questions it's a really cute accessory for your hair."
4.0,"It's very pretty and shiny, but it's much smaller than pictured. It's really difficult to see the infinity symbol unless you know it's there and you're looking up close. The packaging was very nice, and it has worn very well. It's still a very pretty item just for the silver bar."
4.0,"The Tyr drops work. I use them on racquetball goggles, which were always fogging up on me, until I tried the Tyr drops. BUT don't follow the instructions about rubbing the lenses until they are clear. Instead just blot them lightly in order to leave as much as possible of the compound on the lenses. ALSO using spit with some phlegm in it works pretty good too, if used the same way as the drops."
4.0,Great looking hoop earrings. Just wasn't the size I was looking for; slightly bigger than what I was looking for.
4.0,"Good fit . . but next time I would go one size up . . am 160 5'7"" it fits nice . .but just for my own comfort 1 size up be nice"
4.0,My son like them and he is comfortable wearing them.
4.0,"Works well, wish it could fit a few more cards/items in it."
4.0,"Fit is great, the spring in the clips very cheap."
4.0,"My wife loves these, but I am disappointed that the pendant opal is able to spin within its setting.  Fortunately it does not look like it can come out.  The stems are also slightly crooked on the earrings, but the set looks perfect when worn."
4.0,Purchased for a party couldn‚Äôt attend waiting for another event to wear
4.0,These look great but one of mine came cracked.
4.0,"Nice--- the white pattern print is pretty bold, so these will always look bright.  I would have preferred a more subtle print, but these will work.  They are a good size-- as described."
4.0,Good glasses for the price. Looks decent and has nice polarization. You have kothing to lose with this purchase.
4.0,Hat was just as pictured and fit great.  Fast shipping (arrived in time to wear to concert).
4.0,"The only complaint I have (and it is a rather big one) is that my girl, after mistakenly showering with the necklace on for about one minute, found that corrosion had formed on the back."
4.0,"I've only had the watch 2 days. Keeps great time, feels sturdy, and looks great."
4.0,"Because the sizing tends to be too small, I ordered a Medium (I'm a Small). It was tight around my hips (which are 38&#34;). I like the green dress a lot and returned it (for free) and ordered a Large. Now it fits the way it's suppose to, like a glove!<br />It deserves 3 ‚≠êÔ∏è because of the wacked out sizing. But the FREE RETURNS (easy and convenient) earn it a ‚≠êÔ∏è<br />I will say, in conclusion, though the returning was easy, getting the right size the first is a game of slots. The reviews reveal that the red dress has consistent sizing not the green one, which is the one I wanted and purchased."
4.0,"Fleece lining, cuffed sleeves, well made.  I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and fit is perfect.  A bit overpriced but have not found one similar that I like as much."
4.0,Cute! G-son loves it!
4.0,Nice color and very comfy.
4.0,Very nice three tone bag.
4.0,Works well with my husband's sunglasses.
4.0,"The color was not as seen in the picture, but was darker: picture is light/steel gray and actual color is almost charcoal gray.  I do like it though so all is well.  Size (large) fits me fine as I usually wear a 7 3/8 in actual size.  100% wool and appears well made.  Also arrived quickly!"
4.0,I liked it a simple thing and very nice
4.0,"This bracelet fits perfectly without sliding off, and I have small wrists.<br />It seems to be made of faux leather and soft ropelike cord. It was fairly stiff when  I first wore it, but it's become much more pliable in the months since. The charm has not turned green, lost plating, or anything else that usually goes with inexpensive 'fun' jewelry.<br />In fact, this little bracelet has outlasted TWO others that were (seven times) more expensive, even though I wear it every day as my 'lucky charm'. While the others lost their plating and came apart, this little trinket hasn't done that. In fact, this bracelet survived a caving trip, and it's so light that I tend to forget to take it off at night.<br />There IS one issue with the bracelet, but it's part of the design. The point at the end of the bird's tail has a tendency to get caught on meshes. It doesn't get caught on clothes or large things, but a bit of caution is necessary. Because of that tail, the charm did come off once, it got caught on a screen door. It was easy to sew back on.<br />So, an adorable little bracelet at an extremely reasonable price. Yes, it will eventually break, no bracelet of mine has survived more than two years (even the most expensive ones...), but until then, I'm going to wear it every day."
4.0,"Product looks great!  A little worried about the flip out upper holder ring.  As a suggestion, maybe it can be designed a bit more robust like the rest of the buckle.  Can‚Äôt wait to try it out."
4.0,My shoe size is 12.5 DDD so they are still a little tight.
4.0,Great looking. Holds a bunch of cards. Just a little bit of a pain to get out a single card sometimes.
4.0,"Love the colors. It's a little stiff. I washed it first and that helped. It retained it's color and did not bleed. I would have loved if it had been 6"" longer for not wrap options."
4.0,"Wow! I‚Äôm so glad I bought this, if fits so well on me, it hugs all my curves. I‚Äôm thick in certain places and this dress just makes it even better. I will update some pictures later on. One more thing this dress was $38.99 but with the coupon I got I bought for only $11.70.<br />I weigh 118 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1."
4.0,Really rolls at the band. Otherwise nice fit
4.0,"kinda of clunky and very straight, but still good"
4.0,Affordable comfort. A little big
4.0,"They're alright, looks better in the photos but they make for some comfy watch bands to wear at home with"
4.0,Beautiful and comfortable. Only giving 5 stars because although my backside was covered I kept feeling like my breasts would be exposed at the sides.
4.0,"Smaller than it looks in the picture, but still cute!"
4.0,Bought it last week and I love it! Except that I need it to be a size smaller it‚Äôs a bit loose around the chest/waist area so it makes it look crinkled up. Based on the size chart and reviews a M should have been perfect for me ( I am 5‚Äô4 and 130lb) I have a small waist to but big hips and bottoms so I figured M would be perfect. But since it‚Äôs strecht I‚Äôm sure a S would be a much better fit!<br />Giving it a 4 until o receive my actual size :)
4.0,A+ great üëç
4.0,They feel really nice once you get them on. I don‚Äôt wear them a lot because they are so difficult to put on. The quality is really good
4.0,"It does fit true to size, I like the way it supports my dad size lol, like the cup fit. I have just ordered another and recommend to all to try it."
4.0,Good quality! Very soft! They do glow very well in the dark.
4.0,"The dress is absolutely gorgeous. It is definitely worth the price! I gave it only 4 stars because the chest area is too low compared to the picture. Too much exposure, I will either have to wear a tank top underneath or sew it together a few inches."
4.0,Great light tactical pack. Well made..
4.0,the product fits the bill
4.0,"Love the price, love the look! Isn't as heavy as the actual J Crew necklaces, but at the same time it doesn't look cheap. And if I remember right, the shipping was SO fast. Maybe within a week! I recomend this buyer for sure!"
4.0,I like the shirt. The quality and the design. I washed cold and hung dry. I have a long upper body and the shirt was just too short. So I can't wear it unfortunately but for people with normal sized torso's I think you'll like it.
4.0,Nice quality shoes but they fit a hair small. I shouldn't need to tear out the insoles to fit into a 16EE.
4.0,Very nice. Would by again
4.0,Kind of funky looking with the flat front but I am going to put a logo on the front and see what it looks like. It does have vent holes on the side and is 100% cotton. Good construction.
4.0,I came as I expected it to look. The quality is better than similar items that I bought online.
4.0,Beautiful colors - bought the teal green with flowers pattern - and the material is very nice. Also love the fringe. Knocked off a star because there were some loose threads sticking out along the neckline.  Looks nice as a cover up for the beach!
4.0,"I‚Äôm enjoying the mask for my cosplay, but the metal button piece keeps falling off, other than that I think it‚Äôs a good mask"
4.0,I love these slippers!!!!! So cute and comfy. The only reason I‚Äôm giving them 4 stars is because the black bottoms are leaving smudges on my floor.
4.0,Wanted a piece of Malachite for a friend having heart issues as a healing stone. He loves it and is doing great!.
4.0,Cute shirt. Size chart makes it seem as if shirt runs small however in my opinion they run big.
4.0,"These fingerless riding gloves are well designed in so many ways.<br /><br />The palm is padded all over, with the added comfort of a gel patch on the ball of the thumb. (Though why they felt the need to cut out some of the grippy surface in order to spell out &#34;gel&#34; is beyond me.)<br /><br />The stripes on the inside of the fingers and palm are grippy, and purely from a design aesthetic I appreciate that they are a swoosh, a curve, and end in feathers, instead of what would have probably been an easier approach, making them a straight solid line. Why not make something pretty as well as functional? (The color-contrast palm stitching is both.)<br /><br />The velcro tab to secure them on the wrist are large, not just a dot.<br /><br />The outside seam on the thumb has a tiny expansion gusset! (And it is made of much more stretchy material than the neoprene.)<br /><br />The fabric for the back of the hand seems to breathe nicely. Will know better once summer rolls around.<br /><br />When I first put these on, I thought they were a bit small, but I realize now that that is how they are supposed to fit, and they do stretch a bit.<br /><br />One thing I would change is to make at least the white piping, and perhaps the black chevron, from reflective material.<br />It is not much, but every little bit helps. And it would be an arrow when signalling a turn.<br />Another place for improvement is that other than the cut-off ends of the fingers, and the palm design, all the stitching is color-matched. Would it be so difficult to color-match the serging on the fingers? It's jarring.<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br />The opinions expressed are entirely my own.<br />Seller contact: sales @ getyourselffitter .com"
4.0,"The only negative was there was not a belt with the shorts as it‚Äôs pictured. Belt was not part of the description, I just assumed based on the photo"
4.0,"It's a cute backpack, but it's a little smaller than most standard backpacks, so my daughter doesn't use it for school. Mostly for overnight sleepovers with her friends."
4.0,"I really love the opalite, although the beads are a bit bigger then i like."
4.0,"For one thing, it's here about two weeks early, which really surprised me.  I bought it for Ren fest, hoping against hope it's be here in time and it is!<br /><br />The picture does not do it justice. The beads are shiny and the little black sun in the middle is so pretty.  I have a feeling I'll be wearing it as much as possible. It is also very soft to the touch.<br /><br />Now for the con:<br />The clasp isn't the sturdiest thing. I attempted to put the necklace on and the clasp promptly feel off and I had to put it back on. A pair of pliers or scissors did the trick to fix it, just something to be aware of."
4.0,"I primarily wanted this to block the sun and keep my ears warm. This does both very well. I‚Äôm leaving one star off because the ear flaps although warm are light and flexible enough that a breeze will lift them up and chill your ears. However I found that the flaps are actually pouches and I‚Äôve placed paper towels, you can experiment and find what works for you, in the pouches which stiffens them a bit and actually adds some thickness and insulation making them even warmer, with no wind flapping."
4.0,"This fits well and has a lot of stretch. The material is soft and looks more expensive than it is.<br /><br />It also has the longer in the back feature, which is nice. The bust area is also gathered to add sone interest.<br /><br />This will look nice with a jacket. The only thing that would make it better would be a slightly more flared stomach area, but that‚Äôs more my problem than the blouse‚Äôs.<br /><br />This will make a nice addition to my summer wardrobe."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, but runs very small. It was much too small for me. I had to give it to my daughter."
4.0,"This coat is well made, lightweight and the length is perfect. It is really warm and the design is beautiful. I wear a small but this coat is a bit roomy. I think I can also wear the xs."
4.0,The material was not as expected. I thought it was a sweater material but it‚Äôs not. I like it though.
4.0,Quality made and a nice size. The appearance is questionable. It seem little too much details going on with it to throw off appearance. I would still recommend purchase but know it may look a little too busy.
4.0,Yeah they're okay but I was hoping for a little bit more clarity
4.0,I love this top! It is a bit thin but I'm glad it isn't see-through! Try wearing a bra that is similar or same color as your top just to be safe.
4.0,"I do like them they are comfortable, lightweight but not so much as waterproof, but I do like them"
4.0,Fit snug as expected good quality. Would order again!
4.0,"Love the shorts. But they were just a tad too big. If I had gone down a size, they would've probably been too small though."
4.0,"Likes- fits well under daughter‚Äôs scoliosis brace. Snug but not too tight.<br />Dislikes- expensive, especially when need several. Also, got a hole very easily within 1st week, but IÔ∏è can repair it.<br />Will get more since they work well, but wish were more affordable."
4.0,I listened to the reviews and went a size bigger. My daughter then had a perfect fit.
4.0,As a 58 yo mature woman it‚Äôs nice to find something as comfortable and cute as this skort. Most of the time skirts fall too high on my full thighs and/or the shorts ride up and roll. I‚Äôm really happy to have something that is appropriate and comfortable!
4.0,"Pros -<br />Super comfy<br />Nice price<br />Removable Pads<br />Cute design<br /><br />Cons -<br />I constantly have to pull the bottom band below my boobs down<br />The removable cups don‚Äôt stay in place when you wash the bra so you have to put them back where they go each time.<br /><br />I‚Äôm on my feet all day at work lifting above my head, bending down etc. I‚Äôm a rather small girl 5 feet tall, 150lbs, my chest size is a 36DDD at Victoria‚Äôs Secret and a large in this bra fits perfectly! This is the comfiest bra i‚Äôve ever worn!!! It makes me dread having to put on a bra with underwire because of how comfy it is all day!"
4.0,"they could have fitted a little better in the behind , but fits well every where else , fun to wear with high low tunics , they were delivered very quickly  and I  did purchase 3 other colors, black, fuchsia, deep purple"
4.0,Had to see the snap on. Would be problem if you don‚Äôt sew
4.0,Ordered a XL still was a little small
4.0,Fun... Used it at Halloween Town in Oregon. Fun that it glows in the dark. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,Super cute and decent quality for the price point! Got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"Love the style! Arrived on time. Its an ok fabric a little on the thin side, does stretch. I would say to order your normal size. Overall i like the dress!"
4.0,I wish I would have ordered an XS (I ordered a small). Unfortunately it is too late to return. This is a great coat!  Its keeps me so warm on below zero days. I have since gotten rid of all my other jackets as this on does it for me. Other than it being a little big I highly recommend this coat! I love the thinsulate. The jacket does not feel as heavy as other Carhartts and to me I feel it keeps me warmer. Now they just need thinsulate gloves and I would be all set.
4.0,A smaller fit than expected but my son really likes them.
4.0,It feels kind of weird on one arm but its for work anyways not a big deal.. I bought an xl do to reviews and I'm glad I did. I'm 5'4 height and 160lbs
4.0,"Well, these seem a tad too tight but I still can wear them.  However the padded inserts are terrible, thin and wrinkled and I was unable to get the pads inserted so that they looked right.  It was even worse after they were washed.  So I took them out completely which of course causes nipple show-through.  So you can't wear this with t-shirts or other clingy styles.  I mostly use them for around the house or under sweat shirts or heavy sweaters where show-through isn't a problem.  They seem to wash ok, inserts not withstanding.  I can only recommend for use with loose or bulky clothes to avoid show-through."
4.0,"Very pretty, bright color, and fit me perfectly. My only complaint is that the gold leaves looked really cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4.0,Easy to use. After cleaning. The item with detergent polishing with this gives a good sheen without too much efforts
4.0,"Great gift! Strong metal, pretty color,  all in all nice gift definitely worth your money!"
4.0,"Does what it says, well! Good quality zippers, too. Great value."
4.0,"Very cute, fits like the picture but I wish it was a little baggier. The back has a nice detail that I love...very cute overall."
4.0,"Great quality. Durable. Not cheaply constructed. The lining is thinner than I expected, but not an issue as we're dealing with coastal chill not freezing cold"
4.0,"First the good part; as one can expect from this brand, the ink flow is smooth and reasonably consistent; it's easy to write with, though you want to limit your pauses unless you want to have some dark spots.  That said, this model has a screw-on cap (a minor annoyance in my book, but some people like them), it has a thicker-than-usual body that may make it hard to grip comfortably for those with small hands, and the slightly broader than usual nib means that it doesn't do really fine lines well; if your penmanship tends toward the very compact end of the size scale, this implement is going to produce a lot of run-together lines.  I initially tested it with Noodler's Black Swan in Australian Roses ink, and it worked well with it.  Although this will not be a first-choice pen for me, it's more than good enough to earn a place in the briefcase."
4.0,"I love this bag and looked very nice. I was looking for a rose gold/ pink bag and its really so pretty. it was just a bit small. I had to squeeze my iPhone 7 plus in it and take the case off, and at times had to like move it around to try to get it to close. it was a little annoying. but I really loved the look of this bag and couldn't find this color any where else. was really so pretty I would recommend if you have a smaller phone then the iPhone 7 plus."
4.0,Little big for just one size. Awesome quality none the less.
4.0,It's a little snug across the chest area.
4.0,"The pendant itself is lovely, the chain is very cheap looking! I am contemplating buying a better chain."
4.0,Warm gloves!
4.0,"So are, so good.  The quality of freshwater pearls seem good and the string is well done.  Our son is deployed and wanted these for his girlfriend.  He asked us to order them for him and wrap and present them on Christmas Day.  We'll do a follow-up review after they get worn for a while by her.  That's the only reason for a four-star review right now.  I can't do a full review until they've been worn for awhile."
4.0,The band is a bit delicate so have to be careful but otherwise very cute looking headband!
4.0,"i wish it was more like a rope chain, than a bunch of links making a rope. but it still looked like a og dookie gold rope from the 80s when worn."
4.0,"Decent shirt.  Kinda soft, and not bad for the price."
4.0,Very nice accessory. Stylish.
4.0,"Super cute dress. Had to sew the seams at the armpits to make it tighter, since it's sewn wide. I'm a petite and it's sewn for wider chests. The upper half consists of cotton, bit the skirt is definitely polyester. It's a thick, kind of shiny polyester. The description advertises the whole dress as a cotton blend. However, it looks great on my figure for a cheap dress and I'm keeping it anyway. I love the deep v at the neck, it's flattering for my shape."
4.0,"Nice shades, very comfortable. One of the rubber ear pieces pulled off. I don't know if it stuck to my head or pulled off when I took them off but I noticed it is missing."
4.0,"Very soft and cute, but the cut is very wide."
4.0,Beautiful necklace very similar to a famous brand. The stone is muti-faceted and looks much more expensive than it was. Necklace can be worn with  casual or work outfits. Overall very pleased with purchase.
4.0,Looks great and works very well. Perfect as a gift to my made. She loves it and wear it every day.
4.0,"Very stylish and attractive watch. Apart from that, it does what a watch is supposed to do, lets you know what time it is."
4.0,Beautiful but‚Ä¶.the colors are not like they‚Äôre pictured. But I‚Äôm happy.
4.0,"Nice enough bracelet for the money. Its not solid silver, of course and is a little on the thin side, but then it didn't cost much. I am happy with it."
4.0,Each one is beautiful and comfortable to have in
4.0,Fits small. Get a size bigger
4.0,it's cute but color change after a while
4.0,"Very cute. I get many complements. The only thing is after a few weeks, the right sleeve has a loose string. Little cheap, but still worth the money."
4.0,I use it every day and am very happy !!!
4.0,What you see is what you get.  A nice inexpensive luxury watch.  Well built.
4.0,"Cute inexpensive jewelry set.  Metal is a little shiny/cheapy for me, but DD loves them and price-point works for starter jewelry items."
4.0,Tight but nice fit. After the shimmery parts will flake off the pants in time w wash though.
4.0,Very small. Expected then to fit a belt loop but they will not.  Other than that they Seem sturdy and well made
4.0,It is super cute while making me comfortable about wearing a swimsuit!
4.0,Mine came with a little scratch on the surface of the case. Will try to contact the seller to see if I can get a replacement.<br />However love the design and weight and just overall a really good product. I wish they would‚Äôve used a little better material so it won‚Äôt get scratched easily
4.0,These are nice shorts but are not sized correctly.
4.0,"Nice quality fabric, flattering cut. I am normally a small, but wish I had ordered a size up so the waist did not sit so high. I am 5`3 and the waist starts right under my chest. I wore a wide belt with it wi ch helped disguise that, but not ideal. I am keeping it anyway, but just know that it runs a bit small."
4.0,Great idea with these multi purpose kids convertible gloves.  One thing that is a bit disappointing is there is no cover for the thumb while there is for the other fingers.  For this alone gave it a 4 star instead of 5.
4.0,Could have more elastic on top
4.0,"Got these as a gift for my sister and she loves them. They are soft material and look cute. The fit at the ankle however is not as it is pictured...it does not taper for a tight fit at the ankle, but rather is more of a straight fit. Still cute, but a little different than the picture."
4.0,very pretty but runs a bit small!
4.0,These earrings are pretty. The stones are a very dark sapphire set in a nice setting. I like the lever back as they tend to not slip or come loose on your ears. Good quality silver.
4.0,Pretty good. I'm not sending it back but it won't be my favorite jacket. It's 100% polyester. Would be much better if it was something else and elastane for a little stretch. Color is great.
4.0,"I ordered these because I hate when my thighs rub while wearing dresses. I wanted something that was going to come up high and not roll down. These do exactly what I wanted them to. The top doesn't roll down and the legs don't roll up. They are light enough that they don't cause you to sweat. The only issue I had with these is that the butt area doesn't seem to stretch any extra, therefore causing the waist in the back to be slightly lower than in the front. Still a good product and will likely order another pair."
4.0,"Returning them b/c to small. Will see if they have larger size, I do like the fit and feel."
4.0,"I like this wristlet, but the pink stones will fall out with frequent use very fast."
4.0,They work well. Feels like they are stronger than what the spec calls for. Magnify more than I need.
4.0,The material is really soft and comfortable to the touch. The fit however is a bit loose and length of the crotch is too long.
4.0,"These were so cute and such a big hit among friends and around Halloween. The only thing I have to knock is the smell, the leather of the earnings has an odd smell that hasn't seemed to go away yet. I wouldn't let that stop you from getting them they are super cute and great quality!"
4.0,"I am 5'7 and weigh about 189 lbs. I ordered this dress in white in the long sleeve version, in a size large. I'm usually able to fit a large just fine, & this fit me pretty good except, the back connecting button. It was stretching to the point I really thought it was going to pop loose, the sleeves were tight as well. The length was good. I did however receive the dress with a tiny grayish stain on it. It might be able to come out with a couple washes, I'm hoping so anyway. The lace in the front of the dress is enough to cover you without any under garments showing, but all in all, it's fairly thin flimsy lace. The dress itself is pretty, just wish the lace was bit more strong. I did LOVE the design of the sleeves, they were just a bit too tight."
4.0,"soft, nice quality  colors are very vibrant.  I like it"
4.0,"Good polarization on these, and a nice case and cleaning cloth. These are small for extra-wide heads, so they probably fit like a straight-size male head for U.S. sizing. But they look pretty cool and the metal frame will bend and widen a bit if you need to extend the size."
4.0,"Its kinda cheep looking but it was cheep to buy, what can you expect? But, my 10 year old daughter loves to play with it."
4.0,Confy though a little odd feeling. Can't quite describe but basically pretty nice.
4.0,This is a fabulous wallet.  Phone and everything else fits great and I like that it is all contained in zippers so I don't lose anything.  Some of the stitching was already pulling when it arrived which is the reason for a lost star. I can keep this in my purse but also use it separately when I don't want to lug around my big bag.
4.0,Like it nice buy
4.0,"I'm murder on sunglasses. Drop 'em, scratch 'em, lose 'em. And I don't like polarized glasses since I spend a lot of time doing video with LCD panels. These have held up really well, the coating still looks new with plenty of cleaning, and they don't seem to have a big color shift, very neutral gray color. Excellent value."
4.0,"I like Baretraps because of their overall comfort, and have several pairs. Every pair I have, fits me a little differently. Even the pairs that are the same style, but different colors. I don't know why that is. These Baretraps are a bit wider than I like, but not enough to go through the hassle of returning. I like that the straps go almost to the ankle (or just beneath). It helps to keep the shoe on my foot. I wear sandals nearly every day, 12 months of the year, in Florida, so having comfy sandals is a must. The color is deceiving. They call it &#34;auburn&#34;, but the true definition of auburn is: most commonly described as reddish-brown in color. These are not. These shoes are tan. So be aware of that. The one thing I don't like about these shoes is the foot bed. It is made of a vinyl/plastic? material. It would be so much more comfortable and practical to be made of a suede type material, so your foot does not slide around. All-in-all, I enjoy these shoes. Good feeling to them. It did take 2-3 wearings to feel comfy."
4.0,Ordered as gifts. Arrived promptly and the recipients liked them.
4.0,Crinoline was just what my daughter's dress needed.  Perfect length and just the right amount of fullness for her dresses.
4.0,"This was a great product when it was being sold for $5, but now they doubled the price and figured it's not worth the extra cost."
4.0,These earrings are quite large. So if you do not like large studs then these might not be for you.
4.0,"These gloves are lovely and soft. The only drawback for me was that they are a bit small. Not so small that they are u wearable, but more snug than I would have purchased in person. I have decided to keep them because they are so soft ‚Äîso they must not be too bad! I will be using them when I dress in Victorian and Edwardian costuming (I am a historian so this is a frequent occurance) üòÇ"
4.0,"I love this top! However, the top portion is measured smaller, therefore I couldn‚Äôt button the top half.  I improvised by wearing a Cami underneath and button it under my breast.  Looks and feels great. The bottom fall as expected."
4.0,This is great for a little kid. I bought this for my dog to be little red riding hood's grandmother after reading reviews. Don't buy this for your dog. For a human yes.
4.0,They do what they were intended to do. They‚Äôre not going to change your life but they work as intended.
4.0,great item... thin enough for a tight belt loop
4.0,"This umbrella is nice looking and perfect for my small patio!  I originally ordered a larger one, but realized my patio walls are only about 6' wide and they wouldn't even open..  This is just the right size."
4.0,Not much to say. Genuine Nike. Fit as expected.
4.0,"Big for newborn, but will grow into them!"
4.0,Tight on the neck
4.0,"This lady is creepy as all heckums and worked out well in our small haunted trail we did for the grandkids. It is hard to understand her voice though, which actually might be an glass half full kind of a thing under the circumstances."
4.0,Really nice cover up. I love the colors and that it has a tie closure.
4.0,Surprisingly comfortable and good grip.
4.0,"Made well, cheaper material, very clingy, but also very comfortable and breathable. Can‚Äôt see through material but can see underwear lines/bra lines."
4.0,"e-rings could be smaller, but it looks really good, it is formal but really attractive"
4.0,"Fits well, comfy enough to wear for hours if I need to, good support with no unsightly bulging under the arms. Feels like a good bargain. Will probably be buying another one of these if it continues to wear well."
4.0,"These sneakers are super fire.üî• they just pinch my bunions üòï, especially the right foot. When I wear them longer than a few hours I've got to take them off and give the bunions a good massaging. üòÖüòÖ I get compliments all the time though...üòäüòä"
4.0,It‚Äôs warm. Not for summer
4.0,Pants are sooo soft!! Cutest little outfit! Runs a bit small. I would say the 5T was more like a 4T.
4.0,"Bag is very cute, but is quite small.  Did not hold my cell phone.  Otherwise very pleased."
4.0,"I bought this product because my 8 1/2 m/o puppy is a determined biter of all things, and I was looking for rubber toys touting themselves as indestructible. This toy fit the bill based on its description, but, unfortunately, it turned out to be destructible. I give 4 stars because this isn't necessarily the fault of the manufacturer or of the toy, but my dog was able to bite through the rim (as pictured) very easily. Word to the wise for those who have biters like my pup ‚Äì¬†this product can be consumed if your dog is determined enough."
4.0,Does come loose and needs to be readjusted. Once secure the magnet stays in place all day. Comfortable!
4.0,"Beautiful ring! It only started turning my finger green after a year or so, which is okay considering the price!"
4.0,"It‚Äôs a nice scarf it‚Äôs a nice size I ordered the red but it‚Äôs not a true red it‚Äôs more of a barn-red or a rust-red, which will go with a couple of things in my closet but not with what I intended it to go with so I‚Äôm still searching for a true red scarf hard to tell online."
4.0,I bought a size small white and it fit as expected. I am a 5‚Äô7‚Äù female and it was slightly oversized. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs pretty thin . I could see my sports bra through the sweatshirt. I have a vintage Russell sweatshirt and was hoping it would be nice and thick like that one but it wasn‚Äôt.
4.0,Too small  but pretty
4.0,"Looks like a piece of plastic in person, but was recognizable to my friend who I gifted this to. She enjoyed it."
4.0,"My boyfriend absolutely loves these! I got these along with a nice watch and he was so happy:-). They are a little heavy, but they are shiny, they draw attention, and they are stylish."
4.0,These shoes fit fine and are comfortable.  The only thing I did not like too well was the silver rivets at the toe but it is part of the decorations.  Very nice shoe for summer and will go with anything you wear.
4.0,"Awesome 360 Men's Cotton Stretch Classic Fit Boxer Briefs: These are wonderful briefs made from 70% polyester and 30% cotton. They are true to size and fit very well. They do not ride up or bunch up. They have a nice comfortable waist band. They are just plain ultra comfortable wearing them all day. They have become my new favorite underwear in my drawer.<br /><br />The only drawback I would note is they do not have a fly opening (or whatever the term is for underwear). This may turn some people off, depending on your likes. I didn't have any problem with this as I do not use it anyway. The other thing I will note is at the time of my review, there is no pricing on the web page. Therefore, I cannot give these 5 Stars.  I try to be a wise shopper. I tend to buy things that I feel present a good deal and thus I cannot give these boxers 5 Stars. They may be over-priced when they are priced. As always, I hope this review helps others in their shopping decision."
4.0,"Super cute and unique hoodie. I really like the style and fit. Unfortunately it came with a small hole in the seam of one of the armpits, but I just sewed it up myself rather than dealing with the hassle of returning."
4.0,"It's a nice enough shirt, but definitely order a size bigger than what you are. It's tight."
4.0,I was unable to get the touch to work on my iPhone but otherwise no problems.
4.0,"I liked the no tuck, it is a fine shirt but is pretty snug for an extra large in comparison to other brands XL."
4.0,Not made for fat guys
4.0,Large but the print is beautiful. Will order next size down
4.0,The sweater is soft and a good length for being cropped. It is the perfect purple lavender hue to transition from summer to fall. Can be dressed up or down.
4.0,"Bought M size for my wife, but it's huge for her. Im normally L, but seems that this M is ok for me."
4.0,"I normally wear an 8 on my middle finger and that is the finger I was hoping to wear this on, ordered my normal size, but maybe because it's thick, it doesn't fit and I need to wear it on my ring finger instead which would normally be a 7, so basically size up one size to get the correct fit.  Otherwise it's fun and stylish, looks good, but isn't marked at all in the inner part."
4.0,"This bag is just as advertised. Very nice color. The size is great. I can carry my phone, kindle and tablet all at once.<br />Love the outside canvas material. The only negative is the inside. The lining is dark brown and a little hard to work with.<br />Otherwise it is a great bag."
4.0,30/5000<br />it's ok the size xl that I ordered
4.0,Very cute dress and is very comfortable
4.0,Great quality but cannot wear them in Pennsylvania.
4.0,"I love the look of this band. I literally want all of them! They are so my style! Unfortunately I haven't been able to wear it yet because it's a bit too small, probably 1 more link would work, so I wish they came with extra links. Other than that they are so pretty!"
4.0,Cute! It looks weathered and it adds to its charm.
4.0,"I really loved this bag and the finishing, but it was much bigger than I could picture.. had to send back, sorry."
4.0,It has helped keeping the vest away from my body.
4.0,"Gift for my daughter, she likes it"
4.0,"The fabric is soft. I don't feel the elasticity of spandex enough. Also, the polyester and spandex combo should have it a bit different. The sizes run a little big and long in my opinion. I kept reading it fit well but that's false. M fits like a large. But it's a pretty good shirt overall. I'd say it'll help for shrinkage."
4.0,I love it but it‚Äôs lighter I‚Äôm the photo than in person.
4.0,"MY HUSBAND DOESN'T GO A DAY WITHOUT WEARING THEM AND NOW WITH A NEW SUPPORTIVE SHOE, HE IS DOING BETTER."
4.0,Nice fit and the fabric was very pretty.
4.0,The boots fit perfectly the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because of the material.
4.0,To small it‚Äôs nice but smaller than I expected.
4.0,The light flare at the bottom of the dress. It's just right for the occasion.
4.0,"beautiful earrings! a little 'tight' on my ears to where they 'squeeze' my ears after wearing them all day at work, but I get complimented on them all the time and they don't hurt, I can just 'feel' them a little more than I can other earrings, if you know what I mean :)"
4.0,This is a really cute shirt. The material is nicer than I was expecting. It fit as expected and was perfect length to wear with leggings but not too long to where you couldn't wear with jeans. The only thing that sucks is that the skull faded really bad after just one wash. So now it looks like an old shirt with a light grey skull on it instead of black. I still wear it but I just wish it didn't fade so bad. I would still recommend though because it really is a cute shirt overall.
4.0,Fixed just right
4.0,Great earrings they are still holding up.
4.0,Loose and comfortable. Thick material .  I bought other colors as well.
4.0,"I got the pattern.. Toy store kool thooo.<br />I couldn't get a, biepa insteady... The K L white black lame.. Why my stitchin dont exist in the belt area interior"
4.0,We bought for a costume and it is a good buy.
4.0,I like the blouse a lot.  It's beautiful.  But I ordered a blue one<br />and was sent a gray one.  I guess I'll keep it.  A little disappointed.
4.0,"I had received another Jastore¬Æ clutch wallet (same price) for review purposes and the workmanship on it was much better than this wallet. This wallet is a little puckered in the back where the material should lay flat.<br /><br />It is still a cute, useful wallet. I received the rose red wallet. It is made of PU leather, which is a thin piece of leather overlaid with polyurethane.  It has two gold metal hearts on the corner fronts of the wallet and has &#34;Yodas Leather&#34; and a gold heart printed on the front of the wallet.<br /><br />The inside of the wallet is a tan smooth faux leather. There are 9 credit card slots and a windowed slot for your driver's license or ID. There are also 2 long slots for cash or receipts or ??<br /><br />In the middle is a zippered compartment with larger slots on either side of the zippered compartment. My Samsung Galaxy phone fits perfectly in one side. It closes with a nylon zipper that has a short gold colored chain attached to a small gold metal heart pull.<br /><br />The wallet itself measures 7 11/16&#34; long x 4&#34; tall x 1 1/8&#34; thick (when empty).<br /><br />I'm glad I received this wallet in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,"The product is a bit thin, but for the price, it is great!"
4.0,These swim suits are very cute and seem like high quality material. Unfortunately my daughter who usually wears a size 10/12 doesn‚Äôt fit in the size 12 suits.
4.0,"Lightweight and breathable, but a little flimsy-feeling."
4.0,They kinda look plastic idk what it is it has a plastic look but doesn‚Äôt feel plastic. Still love them they‚Äôre actually oversized like the description says
4.0,Nice for the price !!!
4.0,"Decent quality shirt. Great for embroidery. Moderate fading and pilling with multiple washings even when washed inside out and line dried. Bottom hem in 1 of 5 of these shirts is unraveling after 10-15 washes. Shirt is light weight and breathes well. Doesn't wrinkle. Cut generously in shoulders. Normally wear an XLT in casual shirts to accommodate broad shoulders/chest and long torso but had to purchase 2X as this isn't offered in talls. Fits comfortably, slightly loose but still looks professional. Recommend sizing up one size for talls/long torso."
4.0,Pilling is my problem
4.0,The bag is really large and holds everything I need. The only problem is I didn't receive the print/color that i ordered but I still like it
4.0,The socks were so colorful *and* comfortable!
4.0,I was surprised at the look and fit of this dress. I'm much older than the model in the photo and it's still very flattering. Fabric is comfortable and easy care.
4.0,Es un buen detalle para regalo .
4.0,Arrived in a timely fashion.  Was perfect for the occasion.
4.0,I ordered a large and it was too big for me. I recommend going one size down. The material is stretchy.
4.0,Product is cute!
4.0,I'm a size 8 and it's tight
4.0,These function for the costume I bought them for well enough. I'd suggest buying one size larger than you normally wear though.
4.0,"Bought the sweatshirt for my teenage son. He loves it. It is not a thick sweatshirt but the material is soft. My son is skinny and wears a Medium, but I ordered a Large instead which fit him perfectly. So I highly recommend getting one size larger for a good fit, or 2 sizes larger if you like a baggy fit because the sizes run small. Overall im happy with it."
4.0,As its one size fits all it is big dont like the material but t colors are true and is very pretty
4.0,"Very light weight.  Like the color. Good size for me but, too small for my husband."
4.0,"The top was a little big, but I love this swimsuit!"
4.0,"I like the watch, but the buckle is weak. I had to use super glue to strengthen it.  It worked."
4.0,It is really nice to wear both work and out.
4.0,"Great summer casual shirt.  Very comfy and soft,  thin enough that I have worn on 90'+  days to work but it's not inappropriate.  Looks good with leggings or tucked into shorts."
4.0,Very cute but need slender hands to wear.
4.0,"Love. Love. Love. The top. The bottoms fit a little odd for my body but at the price point, I am 100% ok with just a great top! Wore with different bottoms."
4.0,"shirt was comfortable, nice color and has lots of stretch.<br />the only thing i didn't like about it was it fit kinda weird around the neck.<br />i've purchased other shirts with this company with the same brand name but for some reason just fit different."
4.0,Great dress.  Fits perfect.
4.0,"Good quality and cute style, but fit smaller than other off-shoulder tops in the same size. I suggest ordering one size up."
4.0,"If your looking for a chunky cardigan sweater to keep you warm...look no further.  I ended up ordering another for my teenage, because they liked mine so much.  This cardigan also held up beautifully in the washer and dryer."
4.0,Was too big at first but I made some adjustments and I love it
4.0,torso was too short but nice product.
4.0,I expect to be bigger.. but its okay.. looks great..
4.0,Great product and wonderful gift. Wish the gear turned though.
4.0,"I am usually size 5XL. But, both 5XL and 4XL said have same size between 42-46. But those pants were very small. The sizing was wrong. The material is the same as the others is good.<br />The price was great, again the sizing is wrong. The company needs to workout it‚Äôs sizing like other pants.<br />The pants run very long, you have to hum the length of the pants to your tallness."
4.0,Adorable bonnet that reminded me of my childhood.  I loved the style but the size ran a little small.
4.0,This shirt is super cute and allows great airflow.  You can dress it up or down and it is comfortable.
4.0,The retractable key chain is strong and contact less key chain is sturdy but the stylus at the end fell off. Hopefully they can fix that.
4.0,This was for Halloween it was perfect just very light weight wrinkles very easy it was perfect though
4.0,Well made. I like it.
4.0,These worked great as a base layer for skiing!  They were very comfortable and slim enough to fit comfortably under my insulated ski pants. My only hesitation in giving 5 stars is that these sit lower on my hips than I like for leggings.  Purely personal preference. Really great leggings!
4.0,This dress looks like the picture in person. The sizing is large by maybe one size though.
4.0,I like the length and the fit.  I wish it had a two way zipper and have the hood come off as well.  The fur does remove which I like.  It is warm and does not shed like the down filled coats.
4.0,"Product came enclosed in plastic case with lens cloth. The clip-on glasses slip easily over my glasses, and the clip is a clear color so it is not as evident that I am wear a clip-on."
4.0,"Shipping was extremely fast, great product. The wig is as pictured with slight differences as expected, of course like with any wig it's cut slightly different, I'd say the sides are not quite as long as pictured. Also as expected, it's going to need some slight trimming along the bangs, there's a few locks of hair that are just way to long an are uneaven with the other side. Honestly these are not things that would really bother anyone I dont think, but I'm a hair stylist so it drives me nuts so I must fix it. lol! The color could not be more perfect! purple mixed with black, and fits just fine! I say it's more then worth the price and would deff recommend the product!"
4.0,"I love this dress and have gotten so many compliments when wearing it!  The top is a bit looser than expected, but I can still wear it.  The belt does not come attached to the dress, which for me is a con.  As you deal with your daily routines and infant it tends to slide around and get in the way a bit.  It would help if the belt was attached to the dress."
4.0,"Love this material and the fit.  I always struggle to find a long sleeve shirt comfortable for golf, but this is quite nice and comfortable without looking baggy and sloppy."
4.0,"Nice, soft, fit perfectly , easy to get on my granddy"
4.0,I have had this toe ring for over a year and I never take it off.
4.0,Just a slight bulkier than I‚Äôd like but I still think it‚Äôs beautiful
4.0,I had to buy another one of these belts!  This looks great on me and fits as expected.  Very happy with it  Only downside is that I am a curvy girl and so it stretches out a bit and I am worried if I wear it too often it might eventually give out so I ordered a spare and another in a different color.
4.0,I like how looks same a picture
4.0,This item would not be for a middle school size girl. For small children probably up to maybe kindergarten age if they are slim. Fit the child I was working with. So I was pleased with the item.
4.0,"The ""night vision"" is not as glamorous as all the photoshopped pics out there. It just tones down the white lights a bit. Wearing them during rainy or cloudy days is where it's worth it! It's like turning on the sun. They are very comfortable to wear and look great."
4.0,Quick shipping and cute shoes! The only negative I have is that the soles don't have a real grip and it's easy to slip around.
4.0,"I decided to take a star off just for the fact that they do not have a petite size! It turned out longer on me but other than that I really like these jeans! It is somewhat stretchy but not to much, so either order your normal size, or order a size up if you're worried about how it hugs on your legs."
4.0,"Halloween costume accessories.  Don't wear them for too long, they can hurt you."
4.0,Great Shirt light feel
4.0,"Case is fairly shiny, looks just like picture. Just what my stepmom wanted. Great look, lightweight, and easy to install."
4.0,Very thin but fit the purpose.
4.0,"It's colorful. Not too small, just good size for smaller bag/purse."
4.0,I bought these earrings for my granddaughters who have sensitive ears . So far no reaction. These earrings screw on and are not easily removed. I will get the other colored stones and shapes. Perfect for finicky young ladies.
4.0,super comfy but i would size up maybe two sizes
4.0,These were a good value.  My son was happy with them for his class.
4.0,Still very pretty.  It is worth doing some alterations.
4.0,Sometimes the kids want to feel special and have the same fun as mom. This lets little ones feel as though they are special but with a cuter style than the boring adult sleep masks.<br /><br />Pros<br />*Great for travel<br />*Super Soft<br />*Car or Home<br />*Cute design<br />*Kid approved<br /><br />Cons<br />*Doesn't fit adults who wanna have cute sleep masks<br />*Needs to sit out of the package in order to fluff up a bit.
4.0,A very nice wallet however after only a few uses the leather straps holes have started to fray.
4.0,Great the only issue i had was it was leaking when i put the liquid in it other than that very adjustable
4.0,Very nice and good looking but also its see through. You can see everything under it.
4.0,"I like this suit I just need my body to be a bit better. I would rather the skirt was a little longer in the back, apart from this it was nice. I do prefer some of the other Cocoship suits."
4.0,They are kinda uncomfortable to wear but they look amazing!
4.0,"I‚Äôm a curvy 5‚Äù2, 125 lbs so ordered a small. Surprisingly it fits but is just a tad bit snug on the butt but not surprising because of my curves. I actually love this dress. A medium would have definitely been too big."
4.0,"It's &#34;one size fits all&#34; and has a little give in the waist. I'm a size large and it fits but fits tightly. Thankfully it has a beautiful style and cut and has plenty of room for larger hips. It also wrinkles extremely easily, so be prepared to iron it."
4.0,They're not as big as I thought but they are very pretty and I enjoy them.<br />I haven't had them long enough to make sure that the diamonds stay and the color doesn't change but will update if it occurs.
4.0,Super cute! A little on the snug side but not bad. Saving for our honeymoon!
4.0,"Gave a gift, because I have one and really like the cross body strap which is adjustable."
4.0,"feels flimsy, but work fine"
4.0,They're comfortable.
4.0,But soft and not hot...expected it to be a bit thicker though.
4.0,I love this mask......the extra layers make it a little thick but great fit and super cute
4.0,Love them !!! Everyone compliments me on them . They look like real diamonds !
4.0,"This dress is actually very cute! Amazon clothes are hit or miss. But this one is more of a hit. I purchased a size medium in beige.  I'm 5 foot 8 inches, a size 26/27 in jeans, 4/6 in dresses,  and a 34D. I was worried this would be too short. Even though it is a mini dress, it still covers my booty. Plus the color is as pictured. My only complaint is that the material is a thin t-shirt cotton fabric and the arm holes are a little too wide. Aside from that,  it's perfect for summer!"
4.0,"They aren‚Äôt fancy or high end eyeglass chains.  Each chain is long enough ( 29 inches) that when I wear it around my neck, there‚Äôs still plenty of room such that the eyeglasses aren‚Äôt practically choking my neck.  The chain is attached to the glasses or masks by silicone loops.  It‚Äôs tightened with a metal loop that you can adjust.  They‚Äôre okay, but after several rounds of taking off and putting on your glasses, they start slipping.  That‚Äôs the reason I gave the rating one fewer star.  The chains are pretty and would complement any style of glasses or outfits.  Good stocking stuffers.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a bit awkward to put on.  What I do is I put my eyeglasses on and then swing the chain over my head.  Less chance of chain getting caught in my hair.  Speaking of chains, I haven‚Äôt had any allergic skin reaction after wearing them for a week.  For 6 chains, I think it‚Äôs a decent buy for the price."
4.0,"A bit narrow, but overall a good looking pair of glasses. I've had many complements on them :)"
4.0,Comfortable soft fabric. Did well bring washed and dried in dryer on permanent press. Not too form fitting. Light weight fabric.
4.0,Over all good quality; length covered well above my elbow. Fingers could be a bit longer. Good value for the money.
4.0,Very good hat for the money
4.0,Just like it said it was
4.0,I loved my Necklace
4.0,"Super cute, great quality, but fit a little larger than I thought they would. I am a 10/12 in jeans and I ordered the XL. They were comy but were a little too big because I did have to pull on them every once and a while."
4.0,"Nice, faux leather skirt"
4.0,The globes run short and the socks run a little small; they make me hurt between my toes right after I put them on.  I am a 7 1/2 and I have small hands too.  Pretty cool design though.  It does not work as one size fit all
4.0,"Speedy delivery and husband, who is blind, is excellent.  Product works well."
4.0,"According to the size chart, I should be a 3XL(35&#34; waist). It's a bit loose on the waist so I'm going to order a 2XL. Also the boning on one side of the front is coming out."
4.0,"I really like this dress, it is pretty wrinkly when coming out of the package so you will need to iron it but once on it looks great!<br /> The color is pretty and it isn‚Äôt real sheer which are both awesome.<br />Be cautious when washing to follow directions as the dye does bleed (I now have white pants with pink spots ‚Ä¶LOL)<br />In general‚Ä¶ great buy for the price"
4.0,He butt part was a little small but it still looked cute. The crocheting was really nicely done. The strings that tie the back are not connected so don‚Äôt lose them.
4.0,For the price they are great.  I needed a splash of color to use with some travel outfits.  These fill the bill for me they are so versatile
4.0,"Lay witness. I am a man and I carry a purse.<br /><br />Call it what you want if it makes you feel better about carrying one. Go ahead. It's OK to call it a man bag or whatever you want if you want to. But I like to call it what it is. A purse! :-)<br /><br />It's well constructed of quality material. However, I did manage to break an interior zipper. That's the reason for taking off one star. It shouldn't have broken. But it did break and I'm not sending it back for anything. I think it's a great bag. There. I said it for you. I just called it a bag. Reminds me of a grandma purse though, at least, when I had a grandma. She had a purse that looked a lot like this. It was big, brown, and leather with a large strap. And you could tell she loved it. She carried everything in hers! I get that. Because I carry EVERYthing in my purse.<br /><br />Sorry. Back to the review....<br /><br />But it's stylish and holds a ton of stuff. So, well worth this minimal investment. If you're interested in a purse, stop looking. This one is great and don't cost much. At least it didn't for me. I think it was likely up for about half the money it is now. But I would be happy to pay what you all are paying. Heck, I'd pay more! Much more than it's selling for now. So, this bag is highly recommended whether you're considering your first purse or want to upgrade. Yes, I said upgrade. This is very high quality for such a reasonable price. MUCH higher quality than I had anticipated.<br /><br />I expected to get something I'd have to return because it looked nice in the pictures, but it was obviously very cheap when you saw the actual product. That's what I was expecting. So happy to report, this purse exceeds expectations! That's what it does. And what it did when I purchased it and not to mention how great it was to use. I no longer leave anything missing when I grab my purse. I have everything I need and then some in my purse.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that I'm happy with my purse. At the time of this review, I am 67 years old and had never carried a purse (or anything slightly resembling a purse). But if they would have had something like this when I was in my twenties, I likely would have started carrying one then! I can't say enough positive things about this item to do it justice. The only caveat, is mentioned in my sixth sentence.<br /><br />The worrisome part of that is, I did nothing special to break the zipper. I wasn't cramming a ton of stuff in or anything like that. I simply attempted to open it after closing it twice. That's right - The third trip of the zipper ended being its last. Not enough of a bother to return, as it's very functional without the zipper. And, as you can tell by my review, I actually like this bag. And you'll like it too! Quit reading and click that Add To Cart button before they discontinue this product or some other silly reason it's not for sale. You'll like it. And it will last for years to come.<br /><br />I rubbed mine with some petroleum jelly for water-proofing purposes. You never know when you're going to set your purse down in a puddle of water or something. Made it a little darker. But not much difference. And the water protection makes it all worth while.<br /><br />Thanks for reading. And enjoy your new purse!<br /><br />( Edited on this 4th day of February, 2019. Just cleaned things up a bit. And tried to add a picture. )"
4.0,"They feel slightly flimsy when empty but have had no problems with them and they make packing easier/helps to condense your clothing so you can fit more. Overall, I find them a good buy and they will be out to good use :)"
4.0,These shirts fit and feel good despite being a little on the thin side. My only complaint is its difficult to tell which side is the front or back of the shirt when putting it on. their is no tag or label.
4.0,"Colors were great. Liked the material. The crown was a little short for my taste. Definitely keeping it, but not consistent with the other Alpine Stars hats I have or have ordered."
4.0,"Though ScotteVest are very expensive, this one is affordable. The quality of the material is very good. There are several pockets, but for me the outer pockets are more useful; if you fill up with items into all the pockets like they suggest, my guess is one looks ugly. The only gripe I have is hood, which makes it look less attractive. It is going to be very useful for travel, since it is very cold inside flights. It is also going to be useful at security, so one can put all lose items into the jacket and remove at security point, avoiding searching all pockets to make sure they are empty."
4.0,I bought this mask because I am having a Halloween themed wedding & wanted a mask I could wear with my wedding dress as my costume.  The mask is very nice & arrived in good condition.
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, about 150lbs, and a large chest. The L fit great! The only issue is that it looked a bit more like lingerie than a romper. It's great to wear to the bar, but I was looking for something a little less revealing. (The white stitching is see-through)."
4.0,"Great product,  the cut of it does make it a little hard to stay up when trying to wear it as kakashi does,  but the headband is well designed and has a nice weight to it."
4.0,we just got this dress today and I love it---I bought this for my daughter.  She's tall (5 foot 10)  and slender and it looks beautiful on her--however it is a bit short. She'll need to wear biker shorts under it.  But this is going to be a perfect summer dress for her.  It really is a pretty in person as it is in the picture.
4.0,Great size and color. The straps are sturdy and comfortable. Didn't give it 5 stars only because the inside lining is a bit on the thin side and one of the zippers keeps coming off track. Well worth the price. I would but another!
4.0,Bought it for my step-daughter  the button on the front was uncomfortable for her so I removed it but she loved it
4.0,"Feels a little flimsy, but I actually like that it's so light. The fit is adjustable, and the part that can be detached to make it into a visor is a nice addition."
4.0,The dress fit great.
4.0,"These leggings give, so I have to dry them after one wear or they get kind of loose. I really like them though and they‚Äôre super comfortable."
4.0,"I returned my case cuz it had some ink or something all over it and it doesn't fit 100s as it says it does,but customer service was very nice and helpful with my return!"
4.0,"Great dress!  Very cute!  Fits well, hangs well.  My only complaint would be that the straps tend to slide off the shoulder.  I wish they were made of a stretchy material that would stay on a little better.  But other than that, this is a great purchase!"
4.0,"The product arrived according to the specified schedule, and the zero-friction fittings were easy to assemble and install, according to the provided directions.  The new fittings placed additional pressure on the tops of my feet, but didn't significantly interfere with my running ability."
4.0,"Love the fit, fabric and now I'm a stud!"
4.0,Works great really makes white soles white!
4.0,Good quality and right length. Seems to be a sturdy construction.
4.0,"This necklace is large and clunky but if you want a big blingy elephant (which I did) - it is great.  The only reason it got 4 stars is because the elephants eyes were missing on both of the necklaces I ordered and I had to glue them back - luckily, they were loose in the bag.  I have a larger neck and it fit me fine."
4.0,"Pretty and lightweight, but the backs seem loose. Worried about losing an earring while wearing or knocking it off, but hasn't happened after 4 wears so far!"
4.0,Very easy on the ear lobed
4.0,"I was surprised how big the topaz pendant is, almost the size of my finger nail!! It really stands out. I got this necklace and wore it for the first time today and my boyfriend noticed and complimented me. =D<br /><br />My only complaint is the topaz is not sparkly enough, rather dull even when light is shined on it. It could be the way the stone is cut. There aren‚Äôt enough facets. The color of the stone is a nice light blue between a pool of clear water and the blue sky.<br /><br />The chain is made in Italy, not sure about the pendant but it definitely does not look like fake jewelery! For the price it better not be!"
4.0,True to size<br />Used for my 1 year old dd and she loves them<br />Nice soft quality headbands
4.0,"Very pretty band. Looks great. My only issue is that the clasps seem to loosen easily. It fell off of my wrist a couple of times. Because the band comes with so many extensions, I was able to switch out the clasp for another whenever I noticed it happening."
4.0,I get compliments every time I wear this bracelet!  Its very cool and it looks exactly as it appears! :)
4.0,This is a very nice shirt and recueved product as pictured ....too large for me ....
4.0,"The slippers are really cute!! They seem to be made well and they're very sturdy and cozy. I would buy them again, I just wouldn't get a large. I bought an L thinking the shoes would run small. I'm a size 7.5-8. A medium would have been best. The shoes make me feet look large but I'm chalking that up to them being a size larger than I would normally wear. But they're just slippers, so it's not big deal. Order according to your shoe size and it should work out perfectly! Definitely the cutest adult bunny slippers I've ever seen."
4.0,I liked everything about this dress except that there was no stretch in the hem. I was not able to walk up steps. The rest of the dress was slightly stretchy.
4.0,"Nice product, well made, sturdy, should last.<br />Recommended."
4.0,"Has a pretty strong odor unlike other leathers I've had, but it does lessen over time.  Otherwise very comfortable.  100% prefer over any silicone band."
4.0,The coat is made of quality material its not US sized and approximately 1 size smaller.
4.0,Very happy with the second pair of glasses. Great speedy delivery and quality product!!
4.0,"I bought this item together with another one in silver. I like the product for the price. I was charged $13.82 for both. Not bad BUT, BUT, BUT they charged me double for the shipping! Both products was in one box, one package. Shipping should just be $6.90 plus 2 cents for the price of two pairs of earrings. I suggest you don't do this to people..."
4.0,"These are very nice, although a little smaller than I expected them to be. But overall, I really like them!"
4.0,I wear size 12 and bought L/XL. It was surprisingly comfortable despite boning down the sides; so comfortable I worked out in it! No rolling either but it did feel as though it would slip after the 3rd wash. Very smooth fit
4.0,"WIFE LOVE'S THIS ,"
4.0,Love them and fit great. They are really fluffy.
4.0,"Stylish but very hard to open.  The guitar pick that comes with it is flimsy plastic; I had to use a butter knife to open it.  Otherwise, looks great.  on the plus side, you don't have to worry about losing your Fitbit."
4.0,"Love it, just as pictured. I will have get jacket altered run big."
4.0,Liked the price and son has no complaints.
4.0,"Looked absolutely wonderful on my girl, but she said it felt a little itchy to wear."
4.0,The material is soft but the color is more pink then the picture show. It's a little smaller than expected. It has some stretch.
4.0,"Excellent quality for the price. Pleasantly surprised. Nice hard and soft case plus the cleaning cloth. Hard to beat. Only reason I took one star off is because they are slightly, and I do mean slightly crooked. For me being so extremely obsessed  about things being straight, it‚Äôs just noticeable. But for the less obsessive, not noticeable at all I‚Äôm guessing."
4.0,Not a bad necklace. It's a little smaller than I expected but it's still cute
4.0,I love this watch its really pretty and I get lots of compliments on it. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because its difficult to pull out the side to adjust the time.
4.0,"They fit true to size so buying a size up is a good idea to help them last. Otherwise super cute, and sturdy."
4.0,Finally a piece of jewelry that is quality. I have been wearing this toes ring for a few weeks and still looks great.
4.0,they were a little bigger than I thought but still BALLER! good service and quick shipping
4.0,For a cheap suit on the quick on. My son looked cool going to his freshman homecoming
4.0,These were very pretty with lots of shine to the silver and crystals. I have gotten many compliments on them.
4.0,"This dress is cute. Material is thick enough. However, i should have ordered a medium to make it a perfect fit."
4.0,"These are great ballet shoes for a toddler, rather than investing a lot and having them not want to dance.  Size up!! My daughter wears a 5-5.5T in regular shoes; I bought a 6 in these and they just fit."
4.0,"I love the dress! Purchased a large (I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 170lbs) and it fit perfectly until I washed it and forgot to remove and hang dry. It did shrink, so now it is a slightly tight in the chest are. Also noticed that the color faded quite a bit after just one washing. It is still a beautiful and comfortable dress."
4.0,Only problem was not knowing to pull the tab on the chest to activate the battery and tying up a few loose threads but is as described.
4.0,"Pro: These keep earrings in place and look great.<br />Con: The metal is cheap and tarnishes to easily, like after a week! sometimes the fan shape falls to bottom of ear and needs adjusting but when the the metal looks so gross... youll want to make sure it gets adjusted right away to hide!"
4.0,"Love the color and the design. I didn't give 5 stars because they're very small. If they were twice the size I could wear them but I have long hair so my daughter, with short hair, is enjoying them."
4.0,Cute sandals and fit true to size. I'm a size nine don't have super slender feet so I fill them in but my feet do slide around a bit which is annoying. Other than that they're comfortable and cute
4.0,I like the product and I would recommend it to others.
4.0,I've had my tims for about three years and never cleaned them. They got embarrassing to wear. I found this cleaner and it did the trick. Cleaned them in ten minutes. I have before and after pictures for reference. The after pictures were taken about five minutes after I used the cleaner. I would recommend. The smell of the cleaner was a little strong but didn't bother me too much since it was quick cleaning them. The only reason I put 4 stars is because the clear zippered bag pictured in the listing was not included. The set still came in plastic holder but not as great quality as the one with the zipper.
4.0,"This is a nice watch, with these caveats: band is a bit bulky, and the hands are a little difficult to read in some light conditions. My wrists are quite small and I need reading glasses so what is my minor negativeness may not even be noticed by others. Keeps time extremely well, but you'd expect that from the Casio brand. I have worn Casio's for decades and rarely needed to set them. The square shape reduces bulk and is more ""classy"", if you will."
4.0,"just like it shows, comfortable. not a big deal, but not even sewn hem, just cut off piece of fabric‚Ä¶ like another review i saw, looks just like someone cut up a sleeve. but worth what little it costs"
4.0,Great for your President‚Äôs Day party!
4.0,Beautiful. Just like picture. Have to wear a camisole underneath when wearing it to work cause the neckline is lower than it seems in the picture.
4.0,Nice dress but the v on the  top part is a little low
4.0,Great for feeding those small fabric pieces through the machine.<br />Cost was a little pricey but it does work as stated.
4.0,Like this jacket. Wish it was a little longer. Have not worn it yet so don't know how it will do in the rain
4.0,Color is beautiful...stylish for any event
4.0,A tiny bit small but she still loves them
4.0,"The wide headband is very very comfortable. The visor looks nice and offers effective protection from the sun, but it's somewhat fragile. It'll require some TLC to survive long-term..."
4.0,"I bought a size up for this sweatshirt and am glad I did. The body fits a little large, which is fine, I actually prefer it a little baggy. What was tight was the upper arms, they did not seem to match the size of the body of the sweatshirt. If I had gotten my normal size, the arms would not have fit. So keep this in mind when ordering."
4.0,Super affordable and very cute sunglasses. Love them!
4.0,These are nice overall. They're simple and tasteful and don't cause allergies to become a problem for my wife. Good product for a good price.
4.0,I love the look and I'm looking forward to using it. I purchased this for a trip because of the RFID feature and that I can put every thing in one wallet. Security is important. I wish it had a pen slot but I'm sure I'll make due.<br />I might even use it as a regular wallet when I'm back from my trip. I like that my iphone can fit in it so I won't have so much to carry.<br />I'm only giving 4 stars right now as I haven't used it daily yet. If it works out for me I'll come back and update.
4.0,These are good quality pants. They wash well. Retain their color. Are warm enough for cooler weather and comfortable in warmer weather. My teen son loves them.
4.0,Beautiful dress. I sized up based on the reviews and found it to run too big on me. I‚Äôm a size 14 and bought an xxl. Based on the fit i may repurchase in a large. I bought the green multicolor and it looks exactly how it‚Äôs pictured!
4.0,This dress fit great and I love the color!
4.0,They stated it had metal inserts which was misleading the only metal is the bar the strap attaches to and that's paper thin. The plastic adjusters had the metal paint flaking off.
4.0,Sadly did not fit my husband as I was hoping
4.0,"For the price, you really can't complain about this dress."
4.0,Loved everything about the shoe.  Only lil problem is I feel the color of the shoe is very easy to come off
4.0,Thought I was ordering flip up clip ons. Please do not flip up
4.0,Nicely made but the fingers were shorter than my hands and I had ordered a L/XL. Maybe it would stretch? I returned them.
4.0,"This hat is awesome, looks great and wears well"
4.0,This design fit a little too close but the zip save the day for getting in and out the garment.
4.0,"I really like the styling, it's just a bit small. I did read the dimensions just trying to figure out how to fit everything I need inside. I purchased the solid black clutch wallet of the same material and need to put it in vertically or there would be no room in this purse. Nice pocket in the back.  Just have to figure out how to fit the wallet, 2 sets of keys, a cell phone and epi-pen in here along with a few very small necessities."
4.0,This pullover is soft and comfortable. The scallop detail on short hem is very flattering. Color is true to image...wish it came in more colors. Sleeves run a little short. Wish they were longer and with thumb holes.
4.0,Love the look of this shirt but it is a bit big even though I ordered a smaller size. Also seems a bit sheer even in the black.
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for! Compression pants fit perfect. I'm 5'5, weigh 135 and got a Medium. I can't wait to run in these! I already feel the difference just wearing them on a recovery day"
4.0,Love the material. The pocket is challenging. It is one large pocket like you would expect on a hoodie.. so it tends to puff out from your chest to the bottom of the top. I would size down.
4.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!!!!! The E is the perfect size for anybody, big or small. Matches with just about anything and can be worn to parties, school, etc... The only thing I would do, is make the chain a little thicker/heavier because it's very light and if I lost it, I probably wouldn't realize right away."
4.0,"Real nice shirt! Great color, soft material. Fit is somewhat small though. I would order again if I could get one size bigger... but I don‚Äôt think a bigger size is available, as I got an XL."
4.0,They aren‚Äôt really durable- they unraveled at the seam the first time they were washed. They also stretch out 50% or more. And doesn‚Äôt get better with wash. They no longer fit my daughter as it‚Äôs way too big and at the beginning they were a snug fit.. we‚Äôve only had them a couple of weeks and they don‚Äôt wear them all day long..
4.0,My daughter loves it. It was a part of her bday outfit it came really fast and I will order again.
4.0,"The dress is nice, but bust is a bit snug. I removed the bow because I didn't like it on the dress, it is very easy to remove it. the red color is so beautifully bright, prettier than I expected for the price! I ordered red, blue and purple and wish that I had ordered the black also. though they are all the same size dresses, they have different fit (I think someone made a mistake when making the dress! Beware of having problems with the zipper and also know that it is absolutely impossible not to have wrinkles in this dress, no matter how many times you iron these cotton dresses wrinkles keeps coming back easily. These dresses are still worth more than the price of purchase for $12.99 though!"
4.0,I ordered a 3X which apparently is not a usual 3X in my world. It was waay to small.
4.0,just helped me with a herbiated disk problem  without the compressiion socks I would not be able to walk
4.0,It is hard to get jewelry on line. They are tiny flowers but the girls looked great in them at my daughters wedding. They looked beautiful against the deep purple dresses.
4.0,"This was exactly what i expected. I wish it came with pins, but that's a non issue. They are comfortable and look very elegant when installed. very happy with this band. Anyone with a black moto 360  will enjoy this!"
4.0,I like the fit but the fabric is cheap.
4.0,"Great dress I did return it because of the size, cut small. I would have reordered in a bigger size but decided I did not need another dress. Great quality"
4.0,It‚Äôs a little big I ordered 6 months size it looks like it can be for a 9 month old or 1 year old and by then it will be summer time and my son can‚Äôt wear it. But I gave it 4 stars because I absolutely LOVE the outfit overall!
4.0,Good ol' regular black shirt. It's cute.
4.0,"Very flattering, nice fabric.  I ordered size large as is my typical size.  Plenty of stretch in back panel so might have gotten away with medium."
4.0,"This is a beautiful tote purse, I really love the color. It seems well sewn together however I didn't receive the pretty Keychain that was on the outside. I really thought it added much more to the purse and without it it leaves something to be desired about the final result. I like the bag and will be keeping it, I wish there was a way I could get that pretty Keychain charm though..."
4.0,"Nice shirt and soft, but sleeves short. Not Long looks in this model."
4.0,"Nice product I felt the siding runs small, product well made, maybe order a size larger"
4.0,For the price they were great.
4.0,Pretty sharp.
4.0,The tassels came off right away tough to secure
4.0,"It is right size. I really love this pants but material is not good and sewing either. If company upgrade these things, it will be perfect.  I want to get another one anyway."
4.0,Well .. I like it ... although it seems small for men
4.0,Two of the charms came broken. One wing off of the base on each. But these charms are absolutely beautiful.
4.0,"This dress is very pretty and sexy fitting. If you want to show your curves, this is the dress. I am 5'4 and about 125-130 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly."
4.0,"Very cute! The lace looks adorable. (I am 5'7&#34; and 130lbs and normally wear a small in tops for reference). I ordered the small and it fits perfectly around the bust and waist, but it is a little short on my torso. If you don't mind a shirt that's a little shorter then this is perfectly fine."
4.0,"These leggings are great if you're trying to get a Tracer cosplay together quickly and/or on a tight budget. The fabric is very easy to see through, so you'll want to layer with other solid colored leggings or tights. I only had black leggings to layer with, but fortunately the design was still super vibrant on top. I'm 5'4&#34; and I wear a 2 or 4 in jeans and these fit comfortably- not too tight or too baggy. They were a little short, stopping about 4&#34; above my ankles, but they're fairly high waisted. Biggest complaint is that the straps on the back of the design do come up higher than they should and it's not the most flattering, but that's exactly how they looked in the product images. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase and I'd recommend it.<br />I've attached photos of my casual Tracer cosplay. Please do not repost."
4.0,Beautiful dress just didn't fit for me and it didn't come in a size XXXL
4.0,"comfortable fit, even for large breasts. The ""cup"" in the front is not that large and was wrinkled when I got it, so  doesn't lay right, but maybe upon washing & wearing it will smooth down."
4.0,I like the watch band a lot and looks good on my Apple Watch.
4.0,"I ordered size Small, and it is a perfect fit. It's not as soft as I expected as compared to other brands, but it's soft enough. I like the fit, which gives me room to stretch without any restrictions. It's lightweight and warm."
4.0,"Not sure how much good luck it bestows. Bought it for my wife for when we go to a casino. Hasn't worked, but she is still around, so maybe it does bring luck!"
4.0,Love this shirt. It‚Äôs exactly as described. It did take a long time to get here tho and the package even said it was lost but it still arrived
4.0,Needs more arch and stiffness too sandle. Good fit and value
4.0,Would have preferred a zipper over buttons but it is soft and cozy
4.0,Good size and seems well made.  I added a piece of velcro into the outside key pocket so I felt secure stashing some bills in there - it seemed too loose otherwise.
4.0,Very cool mask but a little tight from the nose and chin. Can be fixed though!! And its good for the price!
4.0,"Fits fine and I like it, but the arms seem to have been made for a monkey -- they were waaaaaay too long and I had to shorten."
4.0,"I have a tendency to lose sunglasses. So I dont like to spend a lot on them. These worked perfectly. They are not the highest quality of materials but they still look really nice. And at the price point it is perfectly ok if I lose them. As a size note, they do scratch pretty easily. I keep them in bags or on sunglasses clips in the car."
4.0,Like the fir. Just took a while to ship:)
4.0,This pretty summer dress has vibrant colors and flow but the sizing is a bit small. Wish it came bigger she can only wear it as a coverup.
4.0,Very nice sneaker just run a little small
4.0,It fit a bit large. I think I should have ordered a medium but somehow I believe that may have been a bit tight. Overall it is a really nice dress and I cannot wait to wear it.
4.0,The fit was fine. I just looked horrible in it!
4.0,"It looks exactly like the picture. I thought I could adjust the length on the front a little bit but it was not possible. That was the reason I got it. The fabric has no stretch. Too short for me. It's a nice, casual top, just not for me."
4.0,"Its very well made, more like a dress to me because i ordered it big but its very nice and roomy"
4.0,"I enjoy these earrings. Very sleek, light, and doesn't budge or fall off. I have very short hair, and was not sure if these earrings will look right or not..but it goes so well for any length. It isn't too big, and isn't too small. Very perfect for any occasion."
4.0,Didn‚Äôt com with the keychain! But is nice !.
4.0,"Shirt is good quality and cute, it is alittle tighter then I like my shirts but I dont think the size is off by much, atleast not enough to order a bigger size. The mesh is pretty cute on as well!"
4.0,Great material.  Fits nicely up top and very comfortable...but it's super long!  I tried washing it in hot water and throwing in the dryer to shrink and I don't think it helped.  I wish designers would consider that ppl who need larger sizes don't need the extra length.
4.0,Nice mask. Not sure how protective it is.
4.0,This top feels slightly cheap to the touch but actually looks great on. Comfortable when worn. Excellent deal for $10!
4.0,[[VIDEOID:f95012b4d96549dcaf22a59288eaec7b]]
4.0,"I really do love these leggings. I had luluemon leggings that were gifted to me and when I went to purchase another pair they were $100....ummm NO haha<br />So It sent me on the adventure to find another pair of leggings that I loved that wouldn‚Äôt break the bank. I will start out with the one thing I wish was different: they don‚Äôt have a seam in the crotch area so when you start to workout the crotch starts to get a little weird. If you keep the crotch part of these leggings dropped a bit it helps. All right let‚Äôs get to the good stuff: they look amazing on, the color, the pattern that follows your rear end is on point. The fabric feels great and looks great on. When you sweat they don‚Äôt look like your sweating through them.  They are high waisted so if don‚Äôt like things hitting your stomach just keep that in mind. I personally feel like the high waisted leggings are great for getting your belly to sweat. I will Purchase again!"
4.0,"Purchased for a 2 year old Hulk Maniac. They are a little large but he likes being able to ""Hulk Smash"" without giving someone a concussion or breaking his action figures. Goes great with toddler Hulk costume!"
4.0,"It's a bigger bag than I'm used to using, but I couldn't pass up having a Boba Fett BH purse.  It's doesn't scream star wars, but if someone's paying attention they'll notice it"
4.0,"Decent product for the price. Definitely helps keep the bugs out of your eyes,nose and ears during a hike!<br />Very roomy<br />No problems with shipping<br />My only issue - the netting is little dark."
4.0,Very cute but runs small. Buy a size larger. Well made.
4.0,In good shape and what I expected
4.0,My son giggled!
4.0,fun bag - something different and i am happy to be putting money toward a great cause
4.0,I would give a 5 but it was way to small for my lip and I have the Ashley piercing
4.0,"I really like them, but I was disappointed to see this loose thread as soon as I opened the box. Also, I had big problem with delivery, waited to long and finally after one week had to go and pick them up from ups."
4.0,"need to replace the ones I have, but X-large wasn't available. Loved one asked for a pair as well, in a size 5-6. They arrived in perfect condition yet were a tad too small for her feet. They were returned and a larger size will be ordered.<br />These slippers are warm, cozy,supper comfortable and have a thicker bottom than others. The best ever."
4.0,Based on reviews I ordered a small. I am typically a medium or large. I'm 4'11 and 146lbs. Dress fit great. The breast area is a little weird fitting but I love how the dress flows and it's super comfortable. Straps are adjustable. Added a cute silver belt.
4.0,While the other pieces were fine the necklace (even though it is a choker) was small. Other than that the other pieces were fine!!!!
4.0,"If it's one thing that women seem to get grossly overcharged for, it's swimsuits.  Some retail stores charge as much as $200+ for a two-piece!  This suit was of good quality and fits REALLY nice.  I'm pretty sure I will be looking to Amazon for suits in the future as my first option."
4.0,Gotta love all things superman. Why not a big belt buckle.
4.0,I really didn't know if my pain would be affected by this ring but I was ready to try anything.  I am pleased to say that this item has lessened the pain and I can do more things with my left hand now my thumb is much better and easier to grasp with.  Now I need a ring for my index finger!  I am very happy with this purchase even though my finger turns green!
4.0,Was very pretty once chain was on.
4.0,"I absolutely love these earring; however they were a bit heavy for my ears.  I will wear them again, however I will be sure to bring a back up with me just in case my ears lobes need relief."
4.0,"Eh, not my favorite. If you get wet it's almost transparent."
4.0,Really beautiful earrings. I wore them every day for 7 months and didn‚Äôt take them off except for cleaning and they just broke (the pearl fell off the stud). A little disappointed that they broke but they are great earrings otherwise.
4.0,"these are incredibly small and don't look like the picture... but for $15 they're great. i use them for my 3rd and 4th holes, and was at first afraid that they would go right through to the other side... but all good. These are probably baby sized..."
4.0,"Fabric is viscose. Feels amazing. However the bottoms are NOT capris like the picture unless you pull them up extremely high, almost to your bra. They would work as pants, but then you have the issue of the long crotch making it look awkward.<br /><br />I'm 5ft 5in, weight 120lbs. I ordered a small. I usually fit small for bottoms."
4.0,Love the color. Don‚Äôt have an OEM Alpine Band to compare it to for overall quality and feel detail by detail but the material is comfortable.<br />Biggest thing I noticed from trying on an Apple band is the ‚Äúg‚Äù clasp on this one isn‚Äôt as nicely finished or shaped. Overall a good option for the money.
4.0,"It's just what I wanted from when I started shopping for my gypsy outfit for a Halloween party, but<br />it wasn't suppose to arrive in time but it did the very last day.  I tried to order others in case it didn't<br />and had to return them cause this was so cute."
4.0,"Love love them comes in a cute draw string pouch and a lens cleaner, both feel heavy and feel like quality. They work very well in deflecting sunlight They looks great too!"
4.0,"Very stylish, nice closing buckle"
4.0,"Works great, and I am super active. I have broken two of these (hard impact and stress, ripped the armband). Currently wearing my third. I work with my hands a lot though, and this is fairly durable. Shower with it daily. Swimmings fine too. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a digital watch. Just maybe would make that band a tiny bit tougher."
4.0,"This hat seems to be well made and is extremely lightweight. Perfect coverage for yard work or a long day at the beach. It doesn‚Äôt have a liner on the inside, which is fine with me. But my husband prefers the lined hats as an extra layer of sun protection since he doesn‚Äôt have hair. I deducted one star because it is pretty snug for an adult-size hat. Too tight for my husband and even a bit tight for my preference. Anyone with a larger head ‚Äî bigger than a fitted 7 3/8 ‚Äî should probably pass on this one."
4.0,Loved this dress! I just wish it was a a longer fit. I‚Äôm not tall but it sat well above my ankles
4.0,These were so cute and easy to slip on. Fit as expected. Will buy again.
4.0,"It fit well though the collars are plastic. But by fit well, I mean the fit was good - not that the sizing was true. I normally wear a 12 but I read the reviews which said it ran two sizes too small - and it does. I ordered a 16 and it was a snug fit."
4.0,"The pouch is very attractive and well made, only drawback is the size is much larger than it needs to be. My fob is one of the larger ones on the market and even it dwarfs next to the pouch height. Removed one star for oversized size. It does block signal while in pouch, tested by walking up next to truck with fob in pouch could not open doors."
4.0,Have put about 100 mi on shorts. The pad is great. The fit is good. I don‚Äôt care for the outer pants fastener. I would prefer a snap. But no big deal. I would recommend them
4.0,"I like that they were larger than I thought, nicely made and lightweight so they don‚Äôt pull on your ears."
4.0,It's nice but fragile.
4.0,purchased 12 rocks and received 11 rocks and 1 broken rock
4.0,They are really nice but small in size
4.0,My daughter says it's comfortable. Wish it was a little less padded though.
4.0,great for July 4th celebrations.
4.0,"These fit perfect in the legs, butt, hips, etc., but they were way too long. even with high heels. I have a long torso and short legs, so I often have this problem. Regular lengths are too long, but short or petites are too short. I am 5'7"" and I weigh 145 lbs. I am pear shaped."
4.0,They are nice but too many duplicates.
4.0,"Stitching is fantastic, colors look great, my only issues where that a snap on the pad strap popped off and the size is just a bit small. Depending on how you want to wear it would determine the size you should buy. Overall, I love my new jersey."
4.0,The bracelet is very pretty‚Ä¶ But after reading review after review of customers getting a bonus stone‚Ä¶ I was very disappointed that I did not receive anything‚Ä¶
4.0,The size is small ordered a side up and it‚Äôs just about the same as the first one.
4.0,"They stretch to fit, and do not  make you overheat"
4.0,Good watch.  Enough said.
4.0,These run small! I would get one to two sizes up.
4.0,Slightly short and wide rather than slim and long.
4.0,But they were apparently more comfy than my hubby thought they'd be. He was surprised that he liked them.
4.0,"Band is flexible, light and I love the color. I am happy with my purchase so far."
4.0,These earrings are perfect for the look I wanted. They are decent quality and look the same in person as photographed.
4.0,"A low cost bikini bottom for my use as my expression.  They fit me well,  a man about 31 inch waist."
4.0,Make sure you look at the specs because they are small. Perfect for my 12 year old. Very pretty tho!
4.0,"Good travel wallet, too small for everyday but great for trips."
4.0,Fits my phone well. Wish it had a way to distinguish which side is which when zipped.
4.0,"Cool fabric for price..nice dress,  a little shorter in front didnt hit the floor like picture"
4.0,Great watch.  Keeps accurate time.  Never have to worry about batteries or solar power.  Like the simple to read watch.  Can be wore in casual to dress situations.  Never understood these watch bands.  So I replaced it with a leather one.  That's why I gave it four stars versus five.
4.0,Nice Quality material. Clean sharp look. Will order more.
4.0,"I own two of these, one in black and one in burgundy, and wear them a lot. They're stylish, comfy and light. My only complaint, and hence deduction of a star, is that the material also tends to pick up *everything* very easily. So if you're picky about lint, animal hair, dust or anything else that likes to cling to clothes - either resist buying this or bring along a lint remover wherever you go."
4.0,"Very cute hat.. I received tons of compliments on it! Easy to clip into my hair and it stayed put all day.  My only gripe, the netting was very stiff and at times would just stick straight up in the air. No bueno. I wore it on a trip and was worried it would crush or lose it's shape packed in my carryon. But nope, it traveled extremely well. Great hat!"
4.0,"I bought these for a 4 month trip to Southeast Asia, they‚Äôre very comfy, I‚Äôm a 32 waist, medium seems a little big and small seems a little small, overall it‚Äôs a nice product."
4.0,Not nearly as long as the photo.
4.0,"I wish it had different nose piece,the pads dig into your nose some.I like the half readers a lot.Bought a pair for a friend."
4.0,"I bought these to replace my previous pair from 2014 which finally gave up the ghost.  I like these better than the 2014 pair, as the leather is oiled instead of polished, and they don't have the platform soles.  Note well:  Grinders run a full size big and a bit on the wide side, so even though I wear orthotics and wool hiking socks, they still feel big.  In comparison, current Docs run the same, but Gripfast boots seem to run true to size.  Also, I have an old pair of England-made Docs, and they also fit on the large side as well, but are made as well as these.<br /><br />The leather quality on the Grinders is great!  So much better than what Doc's are currently putting out.  The exception is that the leather toe caps were not equal and seem to be in the wrong place, especially in comparison to Grip Fast or even my old Grinders.  They look a little goofy to me.<br /><br />Quickly received to the States from GB.<br /><br />Have no clue where they are made.<br /><br />In summary:<br />Pros: great leather, quality for the price.<br /><br />Cons: sizing too large by at least 1 size (American).<br />Possibly quality control issues (toe cap)"
4.0,They fit well a bit of a problem tho is the fluff in the slippers likes to stick to socks and feet but after a few wears it stops with plenty of fluff still in it to make it comfortable
4.0,Everybody loves my watch. I can combine with every clothing I have.
4.0,"Fast shipping, still adjusting to wearing a ring again, but loving it so far. Pictures definitely showcase this ring better, almost looked as if it has stones. Not disappointed one bit."
4.0,"I've owned these bras before and was just replacing one and ordered. Perfect bra except it was not white, but had a stylized, brightly colored design on it (you definitely could not wear beneath a white or light colored T shirt). I contacted the seller and they are refunding, however I needed to further contact because I was going to be charged postage to return when I definitely did not get the style (white) of bra I thought I ordered."
4.0,I like them super happy :)
4.0,Product Worked out really well
4.0,"That's what I think every time I use my shoe tree. I just purchased one and swap it between my black pair and brown pair of shoes. Looks great, feels smooth and sturdy...<br /><br />My only quibble with them is that they are not quite tall enough in the toe box to completely fill my shoes (I like a more rounded toe shoe). I know they were going for a one-height-fits-all design that would work with low toe shoes as well, but that still leaves other shoes with a little less support than they need. But until that fine day when they produce ""thicker"" shoe trees, I'll be quite satisfied with using these."
4.0,"First I'll say they were very comfortable.<br />They were described as not being see-through however the white pair I purchased are a bit see through and it wasn't due to the sizing as mine were not tight at all. I had actually considered purchasing a smaller size but in a darker color.<br />They are also the type of leggings the show every little dimple in the skin.<br />I happened to be wearing some lame panties when I tried these on and man, they were pretty unforgiving. :)<br /><br />For the price these are great, though.With a quick panty change they looked fine. Keep in mind though that if you happen to have textured skin or cellulite etc, and you are self conscious of that,  these would show that texture. (I can only speak for the white pair)<br /><br />The fit was true to size. The waist band was wide and did not dig into me. Very comfortable but a bit thin."
4.0,"I love everything about these pants except they indeed run small. Colors are great, they are so comfy and soft just tight!!"
4.0,"Pros:<br />-higher quality fabric than I expected<br /> ‚Äì comes with hygienic liners so you know it hasn't been used<br />‚Äì nice thick swimming material that is it see-through<br /><br />Cons:<br />-finding the correct fit is hard<br />‚Äì tie and drop-down fabric piece is very weird fitting<br /><br />I have very mixed reviews about this swimsuit. Firstly let me say that I did use the size guide and measurements. I am a size 6 to 8 ‚Äì when ordering this it does state that it's going to come in Chinese sizing so I expected the item to be a extra-large or two XL with the sizing adjustment. However when the item came in the mail it was a 3XL. I double checked with the measurement died and what I ordered to make sure that I didn't accidentally order one that was way too big, however I didn't. I have emailed the seller to see if I can receive a replacement in the correct size ‚Äì and I will update my review based on what they say. As far as the quality of the swimsuit I'm very impressed. Although the some so I got was it too big for me I can tell you that it comes in a nice thick fabric. I was worried that because the product cost is so cheap it was going to be a see-through black fabric and it's not. One thing that I did notice is really weird about the top is how the pieces are sewn together. As you can see in the picture there is one piece that goes below the rest of the swimsuit top and then underneath that there is a tie, however the drop-down piece of fabric is sown in a way that it creates an awkward bump on the side of the swimsuit. Also underneath the bus portion there is not near enough elastic. I don't have that large of a chest and the swimsuit was still allowing my breast to fall out the bottom. If you order the swimsuit I definitely recommend reinforcing the bottom portion with some more elastic to make it tighter or thicker so you don't have to worry about any accidents.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for the promise to give an honest review after I have thoroughly tested the product.

4.0,Fits my 2 year old's converse shoes perfectly
4.0,Beautiful fitting dressy stitching @ the waist is really loose though and I anticipate needing to restitch it soon.
4.0,"It was ok, didn‚Äôt wear it that much on halloween."
4.0,"I love this model, too bad they're so hard to find. Very comfortable & lightweight."
4.0,Took a little longer than expected and a tad smaller than just thought. But product was nice altogether
4.0,These shoes being in European sizes can make it hard to translate into American sizes especially for someone with a wide foot.  They do well and bend well for our karate dojo time but ultimately we had to buy a couple of sizes too big to fit the wide foot!
4.0,I wear this every time I step outside and sometimes I have to take it off because it really do keeps you and get you warm ..
4.0,"Worth the money, but when lit up, did not look pink. Not sure if the wires are just colored pink, but when lit up are just regular white LED looking, either way it suited my sons purpose for Halloween."
4.0,"This sweater is so cute and fits well, it get a little itchy after a number of hours of wear so that's why 4 stars instead of 5"
4.0,Fits perfect.  I'm short so it's hard to find pants that fit.  I would recommend.
4.0,Not for large wrists. Will gift to smaller wristed person.
4.0,Exactly as appear on-line. Long red soft satin gloves. Come in other colors
4.0,Fit's a Little big but it's still nice.
4.0,"Inexpensive, just what I needed"
4.0,"Beautiful box, lined with what looks and feels like velvet. I would have given 5 stars if not for the funky odor it comes with, will definitely need to let it air out."
4.0,"I really like the necklace even though the chain does seem a bit cheap. Also, I realized that the chain is actually shorter for the turquoise piece rather than the bar, so they're the opposite lengths."
4.0,"On the advice from a friend I ordered one size larger and was pleasantly surprised that the fit was decent though a little wide, length spot on.<br />A very light weight shoe good for kick around and serious jogging."
4.0,It was a gift. Very nice
4.0,I like the different colors the Seller gave me variety of different colors and patterns which is great!
4.0,"I am a size zero with a 34 D chest and it fits perfect, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the material is thinner so I will most likely have to wear a slip under it."
4.0,"Like the dress, don‚Äôt like the lining because it doesn‚Äôt go all the way down with the rest of the dress.  Very disappointed, had to take it to be altered and add more material to the lining to go all the way down."
4.0,"A very comfortable, casual dress for summer. The navy blue color is stunning. The side pockets are a nice feature.  For the mature woman, it might be nice to have the front a little longer in order to to cover the knees. But the length will suit younger folks just fine."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings, perfect for my baby girl. Unfortunately we lost the back to one. I was hoping the screw backs would stay on well and not over-tighten. One stayed on fine so maybe I just failed at screwing the other down tight enough. They are really beautiful and I'm sure if you tighten them enough they'll stay on."
4.0,Cute outfit only one complaint the logo on sweatshirt was off center!
4.0,"I accidentally ordered the rose gold and white when i thought i was ordering gold and white. The rose gold is pretty too, although i don't care for the bangle that comes with it. The instruction provided to adust the size of the watch is very easy to follow. On first impression, and so far everything looks good. However, i've only had it for a few hours so only time will tell whether it was worth the money."
4.0,Come off a little too easily.  A little thin.  Need to be sturdier to help more.<br /><br />Ok for the money though.
4.0,Way to cute under large neck sweatshirts
4.0,"Had to get a make large for my 5‚Äô2‚Äù petite daughter. Nice costume, nice materials."
4.0,Could‚Äôve went with a smaller size. Cute back and nice material!
4.0,Make sure its on your toe and won't snag and come off.
4.0,Beautiful. Runs very smooth. No stretch to material.
4.0,A little tight in the toe box
4.0,Great glasses like it. I bought it for a friend and he really enjoy them. So want to Thank You.
4.0,"The band is great. I have a black and a blue also. The orange however tends to show daily grime. The orange band really ads to the watch. Do not expect much from the watch protector. It is for a large watch otherwise it does not work. It does its job I guess, I do not use it. It hides the beauty of your watch. Buy a cheap Timex or Casio if you do not want your nicer watches  damaged while at work or play."
4.0,Didn't keep the shoe as tight as I liked but it kept them together well enough.
4.0,"Sooooo adorable!!<br />I was tired of taking my readers on and offf...on and off. So, it was time for some bifocals.<br />They are super cute, great size, and do exactly what I need them for, which is primarily when I'm out and about.<br />I do, however, not like them for reading books or at the computer, as I feel I have to look up a lot in order to get the reading area into view.<br />From what I hear, that's an adjustment issue, not because the reader area is too small. I feel that area is just fine, and I'm probably just being difficult.<br />On a serious note, though. The glasses appear well made, came with a little pouch, and for my purposes are a great bargain."
4.0,The over all for was perfect. I only wish it had under wire.
4.0,"It seems to be well made, but the bill slot is too small for USD. If the dollar bill was shorter, it may have been perfect!"
4.0,"I love these because you can mix and match them, but you may want to but new backs for them as the ones that came with the sets are cheap and can fall apart in your hands."
4.0,"It definitely pushes in and up. I look thinner when wearing it. However, I wish it was not so low cut in front. I feel like the &#34;girls&#34; are going to come up and out when walking. Actually, when I bent over they did. I wear it under a body shaper and that solves the problem. Glad I bought."
4.0,Really cute and flattering cut. However it rides up super easy and becomes very short.
4.0,"Very thin inexpensive fabric, the dress is nice just not quality material."
4.0,They are a little top-heavy
4.0,"They were really big on my son, since they were wide and I was not so sure of his shoe size at the time.  I used an insole (foot pad) and it worked great!  The shoe is very soft and look really nice!  Would buy them again!  Overall, very happy with this purchase!"
4.0,For the price this is a very well made and generally great hat. Many compliments from others as to the uniqueness of the style. Only concern I had was that the XL I ordered was too small. I normally wear a 7 1/2 hat and this XL topped out at about<br />7 3/8. I had to stretch it out by putting it over a large bowl for a couple days so it would fit properly. It did stretch and now fits. It is now my most favorite hat in my 30 hat collection.
4.0,"I purchased a couple of different styles of this sock for a gift and the recipient seems to like them very much.  Personally, I loved the color and the idea of the almost-matches-but-not-quite theme.  The recipient told me they felt very soft and comfortable.  Which is good, because I think they're quite expensive.  Still, a fun addition to the sock drawer."
4.0,I like the fact that it is thin transparent and light!<br />It is suitable for very warm autumn and spring!
4.0,"Since receiving these  I have saved myself  so much time and aggravation  by not having to hunt for my glasses!<br />They seem to be good quality and work very well. The company followed up by email to make sure I was happy with my purchase, now that‚Äôs service!"
4.0,"These are cute leopard print frames that have a classic styling aesthetic. I got these for my 11 year old daughter who has outgrown all of her ""kid"" sunglasses and needed something designed more for an adult face. These definitely do the trick. The lenses are easy to see out of and definitely cut down glare as advertised.<br /><br />Wish list:<br />The frames slip on the bridge of the nose, so I wish there were little rubber pads inside the bridge so they'd sit still. Also, the arms are flimsy and basic metal...they're not as comfy against the temples and can sometimes snag hair. I wish it was thicker plastic all the way down. Lastly, these do not come with a case! Seems like an easy oversight to fix."
4.0,"Nice sunglasses, great color. Just don't match with everything but they look super cool. Recommended."
4.0,This seller seemed to have an aversion to give you a size selection which was not a real bad thing as my fingers are different sizes but a couple of the designs including this one I would have liked to have in a size 9 or 10 rather than the size 6 than I received.  The stone is a very nice shape and the color was wonderful  (good luck since color can vary greatly in natural stones) not to mention a very pleasing design in the ring setting itself but I just wish it was a larger size but the price was exceptional so maybe I'll try again and see if what I get something larger.
4.0,"Very cute suit. Got the purple looks more like blue and a little dull. Love the top, great coverage and holds everything in place. Bottoms are definitely not enough coverage for me but still cute."
4.0,Nice skinny belt.  Good quality for the price.
4.0,I love this little choker
4.0,I came apart after a month of wearing it. The bottom of the ring lost color very quickly and the lightning bolt has sharp points to where it cut me at one point. Definitely not a childrens gift. The clasp that holds it shut was worn out on the second day of use. I really liked the ring but the make quality could have been better
4.0,De buena calidad me encantaron...
4.0,"I am 4' 11'' and this dress is actually not a bad length. The issue I have is I would never wear this without something under it because of the top. It is adjustable in the straps but shows too much unless you are model thin up top. Still, I really love it. Its super flowy like the picture."
4.0,"Cheap material, it smelled but the graphic and color are amazing that is why im giving it 4 stars"
4.0,"looks soft and flowy, decent material"
4.0,It's very pretty and comfortable  to wear. It's a bit small for my wrist though. I wear a size 8 bracelet so I am used to that. It just looks a little wonky if you look close. I usually wear it with another wrap bracelet.
4.0,"Looked great, but it was a size small/medium instead on a medium large"
4.0,"I'm typically a size XS or S, 0-2, and this fit well. I am long limbed and it's a little short in the arms, but I just wear it with a cardigan and it's great."
4.0,"Received fast. Just as pictured. Bows fell off both pair after first wear, but I anticipated that, so I wasn't disappointed. They still look fine. I wear a size 11 shoe and have very long somewhat stickly legs. These have good stretch and are indeed thigh highs. I didn't have any problems with them rolling down, as of yet. Overall I'm happy with this purchase."
4.0,"The first dress I purchased was according to my measurements and the review suggestions, and unfortunately was  too small. The seller was easy to reach and replied in timely manner, offered to refund money. The second dress I received fit much better.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service."
4.0,Very cute looks just like the picture. Shipped quickly. The bar is a little short for me personally but not uncomfortable at all! Would highly recommend :)
4.0,Loocking good
4.0,I love the fit. I wear a 14 and I got an XL. Fits great but the only thing I didn't like was the buttons were too far up and they can't be unbuttoned.The length was perfect. covered the butt.
4.0,"Very soft, quite flexible. The pockets weren't quite what I was expecting but that's on me, they're shown pretty well in the product pictures. The paperback book (Garth Nix's ""Sabriel"") I have inside one of the pockets is 7""x4""x2"" and there's still room for me to shove more stuff around the book. The color is more yellow than light tan, which is a little off putting, but I bought them for a cosplay (Raven from Teen Titans) and I'll have them on under a long sleeve black leotard while wearing shoes/black socks. I am 5'4.5"" tall and I typically wear the 7/8 leggings (those hit right at the ankle for me). These would easily fit someone 4 or 5 inches taller than me. If I don't pull them all the way down around my foot they're super baggy in the ankle and I would need to roll them. I have US W8.5-W9 feet and they're an inch or so shy of hitting the middle of my arch. If they wear well I'll certainly buy more."
4.0,Returned due to size being to small. I will be repurchasing a size large once I receive my refund.
4.0,This was a gift and her size was given. But was to big but what she wanted. Thicker flannel would have been better. But she is happy!
4.0,A little small for a 2x
4.0,"I'm a 38D in almost every brand I've tried. This particular one is a tad small but it will work and I believe it will stretch given some time. I love the design, especially the lace on the back. I intend to break this in."
4.0,These run small. Size up.
4.0,This looks almost real. Nice ring to wear.
4.0,"Great feel,fit and thickness ... product is as desired by seller, I would recommend for winter"
4.0,Cute Look great on!!
4.0,Really like the quality and feel of these. They are snug but not too snug and hold everything in place nicely while the legs don't ride up. Will definitely buy some more.
4.0,"Cute shirt for Halloween trick or treat night with my kids.  Seems to run a little small. I normally wear a medium in most name brands. This is a large and fits well with a little room. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 170 lbs, small chest.  Haven‚Äôt washed it yet but seems to be a nice material"
4.0,it is very nice cross. it was small for me but if it is very high quality.i recived in less than a week which is very good.
4.0,Watch was just as described but the color is off. It is not as yellow as seen in picture its more of a cream. Here is a pic. Anyways its a great watch. And the second hands line up most of the lines each tick. For the price and value I would recommend it. The black on this watch is very durable and seems scratch resist and to light things.
4.0,Runs kind of big but doable. Beautiful on.
4.0,Super cute. Camo is slightly different then expected. Wish it was thicker like a sweater but with long sleeve under did good on my walk in 45* weather. Go by size chart for perfect fit
4.0,Handle smaller than I thought but very nice
4.0,"Good gloves, I didn't like the sparkly material. It looks cheesy."
4.0,"This is a great value watch for the basics.....time, alarm & timer/stopwatch. Been buying it for decades....hard to find now. This latest purchase is fine except for the lite, which lights up only the left edge of the watch surface, but OK for my needs."
4.0,"This scarf looks a lot smaller in person. On the model it look like a blanket scarf, but the dimensions are off. Its very beautiful, but not like a blanket scarf."
4.0,My mom couldn't find dog ears anywhere in stores so this worked for what she needed.
4.0,It‚Äôs cute. Material is very thin. size up for a more loose fit like the picture. Too short to wear as a dress and I‚Äôm not even remotely tall. I wore exercise shorts under.
4.0,"Very nice, I do like this"
4.0,"small, but good for travel..."
4.0,"This dress is great, for the price. I would have given 5 stars if there weren‚Äôt a couple of issues. 1) The dress only comes to my knees, I was hoping for tea length as described. 2) It is also a bit loose and I was thinking it might be too snug... I am not petite by any stretch of the imagination however, I would rather the dress ‚Äúfit‚Äù than hang. I would send it back but, my event  is on Thursday and although, the dress arrived EXREMELY FAST, I don‚Äôt want to take a chance on not receiving the smaller size in time to wear it. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 170lbs. I ordered the XL and could have worn the large. The fabric is smooth and very stretchy, perfect for a full figured woman. I was hesitant to order the dress because of the ‚Äúwaist lace‚Äù. However, I am very happy that the lace is made from the same fabric which does not appear cheap at all. I would totally order this dress again and/or a dress from the same maker. I am pleased with the purchase overall."
4.0,love the knitting of the beanie.
4.0,"I love purple!!!! I wasn't sure what to expect with these.....They're ok.... They're a bit flat but bc the insole can come out I can put a different one in with arch support.<br /><br />They are not waterproof, I wore them out to walk my dog and play in the wet grass... I just came in and took them off and my toes are wet. They might be water resistant but definitely not waterproof! The listing should be corrected.<br /><br />Not sure how warm they will be once winter comes, it's only Sept, but they feel warm. Size 8 is my normal and fits great.. I have wide feet and these are not too tight and don't hurt my bunions!!!! The grip on the bottom seems very good and non-slip.<br /><br />I'll update in the winter once I've used them with ice and snow!!!<br /><br />Update: returned them although they were cute I need water proof for my needs!"
4.0,"This skirt is super cute. The material has stretch and is a light to medium weight fabric and comfortable to wear. It‚Äôs perfect for work attire. It is long so if you‚Äôre a shortie like me at 5‚Äô4‚Äù, this will come pretty close to your ankles. This is nothing hemming the bottom can‚Äôt fix to get a length you like it. For the price, this alternation wasn‚Äôt a biggie. I can sew and did it myself but you can‚Äôt, this is an inexpensive alteration to get done at a dry cleaners or elsewhere.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for needing some alterations to get the fit I needed and wanted. We already talked about gemming it (but hey, if you‚Äôre tall, that‚Äôs no concern for you) and there are 2 other alterations I had to do to get the skirt just right for me. If I‚Äôve still got your attention, tune in below:<br /><br />1) There is not a vent in the back of the skirt. -_- And with a skirt this long, it really needs one because, without it, it limits your range of walking and ability to comfortably climb stairs. Can we say unintentional, resistance training? Lol. Luckily, I know how to sew and I put a vent in mine. No more penguin walking for me.<br /><br />2) If you are curvy, the waistband may gap in the back for you. If you have a flatter butt, this may not be an issue, however if you have a booty, you‚Äôve been warned. Lol. My waist is 25.5‚Äù while my hips are 40‚Äù and I have booty. I couldn‚Äôt have gone any smaller in size or the skirt wouldn‚Äôt accommodate my hips and booty. Again, I can sew, so I took the waistband in which is a super quick and easy alteration. It‚Äôs a fairly inexpensive alteration if you cannot sew yourself.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this skirt and want to buy more colors/styles but I have to make those alternations to make it fit me how I want on me. So for me, this isn‚Äôt a ready to wear skirt but for the price, those small alterations aren‚Äôt a hindrance. Hope this review helps someone!"
4.0,My mom loved this I got it for her birthday I would recommend
4.0,"I love the suit but did not fit per the sizing chart.  So I returned (very prompt refund) and reordered a larger size. I'm hoping it fits properly,  it's a cute, well made suit."
4.0,"This dress is very flattering on, but sheer in the back, so any undergarment you wear will show. FYI the sleeves are also sheer. It's cut very low in the front so i pinned it."
4.0,"I bought these socks for my husband, who LOVES them. He wears them all day and night long and has replaced his former compression socks with these. Apparently the high copper content, which you can actually SEE, works with his grounding pad that is placed at the foot of his bed. We cut off the top band of the socks because it was too tight. Otherwise, the socks are perfect!"
4.0,I slip these in my pocket and go.  The only gripe I have is the nose piece guards come off easily.  My solution to that was to bend the nose pieces out of the way so they don't dig into my skin.
4.0,the quality of these ear rings are great. however they were a little too big for my liking. but they are still great ear rings
4.0,They key chain is very cute I give to my mom and she love it
4.0,"A little small on my right hand, which is a little big because I do construction."
4.0,There is a slight yellow tint to them but not bad. The frames feel like they could snap easily if I‚Äôm not careful. Overall they seem ok
4.0,"These work great for what they're being used for. I have my mask around my neck all the time if I'm not wearing it. I did have some issue with those tiny little hooks but probably more my arthritis than the hooks themselves. For the $ they are great. Yes, i'd recommend them."
4.0,Didn't like that it was see through
4.0,"Fits nice, thin fabric , but not see thru."
4.0,I ordered a medium and that's what I normally wear. Fit perfect. The material through me off. It's kinda of a silk/polyester something. Reminds me of a night gown. But its ok. I'm keeping it.
4.0,"A little heavy on the face, but they are no e otherwise"
4.0,"Excellent feel, even in the hottest weather.  However, they do run a little small... I should have ordered XL instead of Large, even tho I'm 5'3"" and 150 lbs."
4.0,"The size is incorrect. I ordered an Xl, and XXL arrived. This is the second time this has happened. Also too short. The length is a bit short, and they shrink a bit.<br /><br />Other than that great fit and the fabrics are very good."
4.0,"The orange is more of an 'electric salmon' - a smidge of pink undertone, not a 'safety orange' hue.<br /><br />The green is exactly what I wanted; my kid is obsessed with this color. He's a mens 7.5 and these are really almost too short/small. I've stretched a tiny 'run' into one on the first attempt at putting his socks on him. I'd definitely say these are sized more for womens feet, specifically the typically smaller womens sized feet found in the country of manufacture (the average womens shoe size in the US is either an 8.5 or 9 and in Asian countries I believe i read it's more like a U.S. 5 or 5.5.).<br /><br />Can't comment on the compression value unless they calculate compression value with algebra, spandex percentage and the foot size the socks are manufactured for ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4.0,"This is a nice belt. The belt came packaged in a sleek black metal tin, it was a very nice first impression.  The belt itself is nice, it is made of real leather and has a pleasant tanned leather smell.  The buckle seems well made and looks shiny and sharp.  The leather portion of the belt has no flaws that i can tell and seems to have a little bit of stretch engineered into the buckle end to help relieve some stress.<br /><br />I was able to try out this product for a discount or free in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own and not influenced by the seller or the offer in any way."
4.0,Never owned a two piece before.  I am a size 16 and am well endowed 42DDD.  I have a larger top than bottom so I ordered the 3xl for my top. Top fits well but bottom is a little big but not too big that I can't wear it.  Can't wait to wear it.
4.0,The words/lettering is odd but not very noticeable. Cute color!
4.0,"size is true to a store bought L but not seemingly slim. print is nice, color slightly brighter in person. worried blue print might read old man but my guy is young-looking/ tan complexion & it looks nice on him, a very FL-like shirt."
4.0,As described. Worked well on grass and cobble stone for wedding. Wore for 10 hrs.
4.0,"Very nice blouse, comfortable and stylish."
4.0,I really like the fit of these in the legs and butt but they are pretty loose in the tummy area. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù weigh 192 and I got a large. I guess these really aren‚Äôt supposed to fit like shape wear but some compression in the tummy area would be nice.
4.0,Appears well made and nicely designed to fit my needs.  I'll be very satisfied if it holds up well (only time will tell).
4.0,I am an exact 10 and with all the cushion inside the slippers fit a bit tight.  But they are very comfy and I think after a couple of times wearing them the cushion will hopefully press down so they fit better.
4.0,Sparkled and shined. It's just kinda heavy. But was exactly like the picture
4.0,Beautiful to wear.  Really nice size earring.  Not so big is gets in the way.  I've gotten a number of compliments on them already.
4.0,The strap over the shoe is a bit too roomy (too high).
4.0,Great weight and price !!
4.0,comfortable but a little small
4.0,"I love the look and the quality of this band. The only problem is getting the links out. The pins seem a little flimsy. Other than that, nice product. Also, more for a man than a woman, in my opinion."
4.0,"These bracelets are very pretty!<br /><br />They seem well made with quality materials. They are just the right amount of stretchy and come back to size quickly and easily. The little velvet pouches are a nice presentation touch.<br /><br />I really like that there are three different bracelets so that the teachers don‚Äôt feel like their gift isn‚Äôt unique to them. I also love that the tree of life pendant doesn‚Äôt feel like a cheap charm. It actually feels like it will last without chipping or tarnishing.<br /><br />There is not uniformness to the sizes. We got three different sized bracelets in our set. One is definitely suited to a slender wrist, one is probably a more universal wrist size and one is quite loose. I don‚Äôt know if this comes across in the photo of them all together but it was very obvious in person and when trying them on.<br /><br />One of the snaps on one of the velvet bags does not have good closure and was affixed awkwardly. Thankfully I think it‚Äôs more for presenting rather than storing the bracelet because I don‚Äôt think the snap is going to hold onto the fabric much longer.<br /><br />Other than those two issues, this a wonderful gift set! Even with the sizing and one defective snap, it is a terrific value for a quality gift and I will be purchasing another set for mother gifts in the future."
4.0,"I was looking for a plain, unlined, black leather bucket bag that had a black or neutral color interior. This was almost it. The size was good, but the drawstring was a little difficult to use.  The strap was also quite thin, like a string, with a larger rectangle or piece for padding over my shoulder. However it could not be adjusted and was a little too long for my 5 foot 2 inch height (landed just below my hip if wearing over my shoulder).  Also, it was hard to tell in the photos but the bag has a rectangular edging or framing on the front and back exterior that gives it a slightly boxy shape. I was looking for something a little more slouchy and unstructured. The leather was decent quality for what you pay.  But because I could not adjust the strap, and that rectangular frame, I ended up returning it."
4.0,Shipped fast and is good quality for the price.
4.0,"I purchased this as a nursing top and for that purpose it worked and looked great. The fold across style also worked for snuggling up the baby close to me while sitting together (although of course it doesn't function as an actual baby wrap).  From a general style point, the bottom of the sweater was somewhat small and it rides up all the time, which I don't love.  Aside from that it looked nice and the price was right."
4.0,I really like the size of these and the polarization is great but they are a little more flimsy than I‚Äôd like.
4.0,"Pretty swimsuit, good quality."
4.0,"Great band, holds well. Had it for a while and no problems. Good for business, not for activity obviously."
4.0,"Ok, I have to start by saying that this dress is stunning. Next, I have to say that not every one of these dresses is created equally. I ordered this in navy for a wedding guest dress. The first one i ordered looked ragged, maybe it had been worn, maybe it wasn't in the best condition. It fit perfectly, so I ordered another one, same size and color and it was in much better condition. I'm petite, 5' and 100lbs, and the XS falls just above my knees. Definitely not too short. I highly recommend this dress. It is classy, cute and stylish at the same time."
4.0,Just like a pair I have used for years so I am satisfied to get a new pair .
4.0,I thought this Tounge bar is really cute the stone is a little rough on the top of the mouth but its not terrible. Other then that its comfortable.
4.0,"Liked the quality and style but fits to tight for a medium, I like room in my overalls so will need to go to large"
4.0,"The bag is adorable and is good for occasional use. It‚Äôs not sturdy enough for everyday use; it‚Äôs somewhat fragile. The strap for the phone is a very soft plastic with snaps. Although I just purchased it, I may consider taking the pocket book to my local shoe maker to have the phone strap strengthened.<br /><br />The colors are nice, can be coordinated with practically any color outfit. Storage is good, but I wouldn‚Äôt overload the bag.  The telephone is functional and if you prefer a phone you attach your cell phone to, you can order one online and just run the cord from phone in the bag to the attachable hand telephone.<br /><br />I may purchase another pattern. I wish the bags were less expensive, they should be priced arount $40.00 to $50.00. You pay for the novelty more than durability."
4.0,"Love nursing t-shirts and this one is perfect. Fits well, I like the color. It did seem to take a little longer to get it, but I am happy with it"
4.0,"Although I like this dress, I will be returning it. It fits too snug in the bust and I am afraid it may shrink when it is washed. Overall this is a nice dress. The material has some give, but not enough. Update: The dress will not be returned. I tried it on again after my husband got home and he loved it!!! I also put my petticoat on with it, I fell in love with the look. Great dress!!!!"
4.0,"This is a very pretty bag and has lots of room.  So much that I can almost get away without a separate carry on.  I travel a lot for work and my current laptop roller was nearly 10 years old and was falling apart.  My laptop is a 17&#34; so doesn't fit in the designated area, but it does in the back portion of the bag. My only real complaint is that this bag is too large to fit in small commuter planes overhead bins.  It does fit under the seat in front of you - but you need to put it under sideways so your seatmate has room also.  My previous laptop roller didn't have this problem, but then I couldn't get as much into it either.<br /><br />I have noticed that if you aren't careful and keep the back handle inside of the collapsing puller, the back handle will scrape the ground, this caused some of the black to wear off the handle.  Now I use the pull handle to keep the leather handle up (as shown in the picture).  But no other signs of wear."
4.0,"Just got the dress today. I like the stretchy material. It‚Äôs very comfy, very cute. Two cons are that it‚Äôs long but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 so everything is, and the color isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs pictured. The orange is more pink and the green is more teal. Still cute though."
4.0,"Best deal ever! I needed a red dress for a charity event. I ordered one from StyleWe. That one came in way too small, from China. No free returns and a pain to order from. Never again, spread the word.<br /><br />This dress, is perfect!"
4.0,This top is a nicely snug. but doesnt work too well when you are Top heavy.
4.0,They were very nice and enjoying them very much.Thank you.
4.0,The color was beautiful and vivid. And plenty of card slots. The only downside is there are no pockets or zipper pockets.
4.0,Very comfortable but beware it is very short
4.0,"I have been wearing my CDI sunglasses for a little over a year and been very happy with them.  They did get a lot of scratches in the lenses though from a bit of droppage and a bit of heavy use as safety glasses while painting, grinding, riding the motorcycle etc.  So it was time for some new lenses, these snapped right in and have revived my glasses to a new life."
4.0,"These were perfect glasses for me to play Santa in with my cat rescue group.  Fit well, didn't make me blind when I wore them."
4.0,"Looks like these aren't being sold at the moment, but just in case ...<br /><br />The size 32 I received is labeled 32x34. The waist measures 34"" inside and stretches out to past 40"". Size 32 usually measures 34"" now (because we're bigger there than we think), so that's about right, with plenty of stretch if needed.<br /><br />The inseams measure 32-3/4"".<br /><br />They ride a little low, not a lot.<br /><br />The legs do get progressively skinnier as they go down. Above the knees they're a couple inches thinner around than my regular-fit denims, what I'd call slim. Below the knees they get several inches thinner. The opening at the end is 12-3/4"" and stretches out to 16"".<br /><br />The fabric stretches quite a bit widthwise and on both diagonals.<br /><br />Lightly pre-distressed, including being roughed up above the knee.<br /><br />Machine wash cold with like colors, gentle cycle, non-chlorine bleach if needed, tumble dry low heat, cool iron.<br /><br />Made in Bangladesh."
4.0,This worked perfectly for our fairytale-themed event (I was Gretel) even won the best costume for it so well worth it!!!  My only issue was that the sizing seemed to run a little on the small side...I was able to fit in it but it was a bit tight across my shoulders.  It would be worth ordering a size up if you can as there is a corset-like set up on the bodice so can snug it up so that it is tight where it is meant to be tight.
4.0,"Very comfortable.outfit color as pictured.the pants are thin,maybe even see thru..but very cute. The fit is just right."
4.0,"The top was okay, but the shirt was so big.<br />She looked very pretty in it."
4.0,"I like this dress, not the material too much but it doesn't matter because it is a small cut, so it doesn't fit and will be gifted. Design and colour are great, but fit is not for anyone who wears beyond a size ten."
4.0,"They are nice, just bigger than what I was looking for, keeping them."
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, but still pretty. I really like them."
4.0,"Shirt is absolutely lovely. Super comfortable, not too thin, and just cute all around! However, it is a bit larger than expected, so order a size down (unless your boobs are huge). For reference, I'm 5'4, 100lbs, with 32DD. Ordered a medium to make sure it wouldn't be too tight on the girls. However, I had to wear a padded bra with it, and it was still too loose (around both boob and stomach area). Adding pics so you can see how much extra material there is. This is without pulling on it or stretching the material."
4.0,This was a gift for my niece. She loves it.
4.0,"Bought this top needing something a little more formal for work. I'm 5'6 and 140 lbs and bought the medium - it fit well, but I did have some problem areas. The bust is a little small and the sleeves don't go all the way down to my wrist, so I wear it 3/4 sleeve style and have another layer underneath to prevent my bra showing. There are only 4 buttons so the end looks a little weird, but honestly I love this shirt and don't mind the weirdness because it's a great option for the price (:"
4.0,Overall quality seems top notch. There are NO instructions to show you how to lace them and You Tube was no help. For that they got a 4 star and not 5 star rating.
4.0,Nice coat but could be roomer.  Runs small.
4.0,"Cute dress, looks just like pic and as others write it does run a little small. I ordered a medium based on reviews and it fit me perfectly. Typically I wear a 4 or a small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 134, athletic build. A busty person may have a hard time with this but good for me. It is also above the knee, not super short but def will show your legs off. does have little room for stretch. I gave it a 4 because the zipper sticks a little and the cutout around shoulders shows a little more back than I‚Äôd prefer. That said, great price for a cute little black dress that could be worn to a variety of events."
4.0,Comfy and soft but for long legged.
4.0,"I love the wallet's functionality but unfortunately the quality is very low. The top zipper broke after a few days of use.<br /><br />UPDATE: Exceptional Customer Service! I have been contacted immediately after I submitted the fisrt review and they had already sent a replacement. This is outstanding service! I have thus updated my review rating to 4 stars, based solely on their commitment to quality in thsi product. I will update it further once I receive the product, in a few days."
4.0,"I have the Terox flip flop.  I wanted something that was a tad dressier - if you can make rubber sandals dressy!  The fit is fine, but overall, I like the flip flop better.  This shoe doesn't seem to support my arch as well as the flip flop - surprisingly.  I do like the look, and I do wear them.  If I ordered another pair, though, I would go back to the flip flop."
4.0,The wood makes the bill seem a little heavy. Otherwise a nice cap.
4.0,"I love these, they are so comfortable it's almost like not wearing anything.  They do run a nit small but did fit."
4.0,Need to return it. Size is too large. I reordered a smaller size
4.0,material is good but its very small. product returned. 4 starts for quick return and customer service
4.0,"Very pretty bangle.  Didn't come with any instructions, so it took a minute to figure out how the class opens. It's a bit difficult to open."
4.0,Sturdy and well constructed... Slightly small fit given measurements... But dead sexy.
4.0,I had hoped it would be a little heavier material but it is very cute and sized well for my boy.
4.0,Love this top recommend one size down.
4.0,"They were quite large in circumference, otherwise great quality! Definitely would recommend."
4.0,"Very nice and delicate, I only wish it was 17inches long instead of 16 inches.  just a little more length would sit better on my neck.  I like it because I can take it on trips with me and look stylish but not worry about taking my good jewelry."
4.0,"Size is perfect. Not too small or large. Fits crocs as expected... the color and quality is great with all the characters except Mr. Professor, the color of his skin was more yellow/greenish."
4.0,Love it...but i ordered two and only got the one so far....so my daughter is disappointed hers hasn't arrived.
4.0,I have purchased several pairs of Jvini pants and they have all fit the same until this time. These pants were tighter than normal and not as comfortable. I'm not sure if they changed their fabric or what. I didn't return them because I decided them give them to my mom who is smaller than I am.
4.0,nice necklace to wear with many tops
4.0,They were nice but had to send them back. Had a hard time trying to get them in my ears.
4.0,"So Sweet, but was disappointed no change and no gift box. This was for a memory of our deceased kitty!"
4.0,I love the design on the shirt! The fit is a bit snug due to the percentage of spandex in the fabric. I‚Äôm not a fan of the material.. it‚Äôs definitely like wearing spandex!
4.0,"I haven‚Äôt worn it yet. However, I can‚Äôt wsit. It is soft and very warm."
4.0,The gloves work as advertised.
4.0,Not super excited! But good for prize.
4.0,"The glasses arrived promptly as promised. They are larger than expected, but fit my face well. A classic, contemporary style. The bifocal is placed well and clear. The lense color saturation is dark. I chose because I prefer spring released arms, which are good quality for the price. The case is soft fabric, formed, zippered, and fits glasses well. A good buy, I am pleased."
4.0,A nice simple ‚Äútie‚Äù for the waist but do not expect it to hold up your pants. This is purely an accessory for looks not for function. It work well for what it was needed for.
4.0,My daughter really likes it. It is pretty good quality
4.0,"I have tried so many, and these are light, yet effective, and do energize the legs.  It easy on if you use a sock butler,  its fantastic little plastic frame that helps you put compression socks on.  Just wished they came in different colors."
4.0,"Great pants, particularly for the sale price! Fabric's thick but not heavy, so it's nice & opaque and smooths over any *cough* not perfectly toned areas, but isn't too warm. Happily, the waist sits a bit lower on me than the model and doesn't annoy at the elastic top - not compelled to fold it down as with some other pants. They haven't been worn & washed them many times yet, but they don't seem prone to pill. One quibble with them is that they are a bit weirdly loose at the back of the knee and very slightly at the crotch as well. They fit well at waist and butt, though, so sizing down wouldn't solve this. Still, a great buy and I'm happier with these than with some pricier brands I've worn. I got a Med, and for size ref also wear a Med in Soybu & Prana, 6 in Zobha, 29 in low to midrise denim - waist 26-27, hips 39."
4.0,"Super soft. Have not washed yet but expect to be able to machine wash gentle and dry flat without a problem. I'm 5'6&#34; 135lbs-ish and got the M white striped set. Bottoms fit great, top is a bit big. Just a warning - if wearing around people besides your SO, you may want to wear a bra because the top is slightly big and because it's slightly see through (may only be an issue with the white striped pjs)."
4.0,"It is pretty small, but the quality was much better than I expected."
4.0,"Waist is a lil small even with ordering a size up, but not enough that I cant wear it. Light enough so you don't sweat to death but just enough to keep you cozy"
4.0,It is sleek and fits well and perfect as it is not bulky but still protects the phone.
4.0,"Although this skirt was a little small on me, I was able to let it out a little.  I'm just happy that this was normal American Sizes where I did not have to buy 5 times my usual size."
4.0,"I am sorry, I can‚Äôt give you my opinion on this product, it‚Äôs a gift that I bought for my son in law for Christmas.. I know I shop early.. I can say it arrived on time, the hat is very soft.. Thank you.."
4.0,Not bad looking ties and alot of choices for every look and occasion.
4.0,I like the print and the construction of the gown but it was a tad bit small for my tastes.
4.0,Product is good but bigger than expected. I was looking for a case with belt clip but this just had a hanging clip
4.0,Quality was great matched the outfit I bought for my child
4.0,"These gloves are very comfortable and on ething I noticed is that my hands got very warm within a min of putting the gloves on. The insulation is very good and I expect these be work great in the nasty winter coming soon to my area. The downside is that the touchscreen material does not work well. I don't mind this because I don't use my phone with gloves on, but if you buy gloves for this function I wouldn't recommend these. The touchscreen only reacts maybe 50% of the time. Knocking off a star for that but these gloves are great if you want a well insulated pair of winter gloves"
4.0,Awesome tee shirt!
4.0,"Cute little feather earrings are lightweight enough to be comfortable, yet heavy enough to be elegant. They compliment any outfit."
4.0,"I like how one is flexible and the other isn‚Äôt, nice and lightweight too. The colors are cool too."
4.0,Light weight and good design. In one earring small stone was missing. Came with 10 pairs individually wrapped in a zipper bag. Value for money if you like lengthy ones.
4.0,These are slightly baggy and loose fitting.  I gave it a rank of 4-stars mainly because the pants wrinkle quickly and I had to take out the iron to smooth out all those wrinkles. But they are comfortable.
4.0,"I usually wear an XL in t-shirts and that‚Äôs what I ordered..I would advise ordering 1-2 sizes up cuz it was too small for me, wish I would have gotten a 3X honestly..definitely cut a lot smaller..I ended up giving it to my teenage daughter who usually wears a large in t-shirts and it fit her just right"
4.0,Great for days with snow or rain. Daughter does fold down the long length. Nice they can be worn both way.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù pant length was great for me, the material is also pretty nice. My only kind of complaint is how shinny they are. It‚Äôs not annoying enough for me to return them, but I do prefer matte clothing. Would totally recommend if you want to save time bedazzling your pants."
4.0,It‚Äôs very attractive light and compact. I wish it was a bit deeper but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker!
4.0,Fits great length wise but are really wide
4.0,Soft & furry.
4.0,"Shoes arrived securely packaged. I wear a women‚Äôs 9.5 in shoes so I ordered the large swim shoes. They fit perfectly and are pretty. They‚Äôre not heavy on the foot. I‚Äôll try to update my post after using during water aerobics class. Thus far, I would purchase again."
4.0,Longer in the waist
4.0,I'm 5'4&#34; medium build. Size medium was too small. I think the large may have fit properly. Size medium distance is 16&#34; circumference with velcro completely overlapping the other velcro. My  nose is definitely smashed when trying to barely connect the velco. Also the picture is not correct. The entire mask has the design on it.
4.0,The fit was a little snugger than the other Bali cotton panties but I thought the cotton was of better quality.
4.0,"This is a good product I've been wearing it for almost a year and the only problem I've had is that the secondary ring on the strap is broken. As well as it runs a bit fast now, when I first got it, it kept perfect time. It looks nice and I have gotten many compliments on it. It is well worth it for the price."
4.0,Very pretty...just a bit too large for me
4.0,"Good quality fabric, well made top. It was just too big (too long) on me. Color was as described."
4.0,While these are gorgeous they didn‚Äôt come with backs and one of the posts is  bent. I used Gold backs I had.  But they are Silver. I‚Äôll update after a few weeks to see if they stay sparking or tarnish.
4.0,Great looking but don't stay up. :(
4.0,"Product was very satisfactory but could have been somewhat longer, perhaps an inch or so."
4.0,I like these earrings however the post that goes through the earlobe is rather large and a bit uncomfortable.
4.0,Very pretty and looks amazing. I didn't give 5 starts because the lock it's a little bit difficult to open.
4.0,"Cute and comfortable, especially since it fit a little larger than expected, but that's actually okay. Just wish it had pockets since there's plenty of room with the cut and lay of the fabric. The straps are also not adjustable; fits me fine, but worth noting!"
4.0,"I ordered this because it's about the biggest backpack you can find. Not disappointed.  It can hold some gear and its rugged too.<br />I hate Made in China CRAP, but so far this pack has served its purpose.<br />I ordered on line and received it within Four days. I had no problem with weight distribution and the straps held up.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because it's made in China. My concern is: how long will it actually last? So far so good."
4.0,"Extremely cheap beater sunglasses. I wear them when I don't want to ruin my Maui's.<br /><br />Lenses are borderline terrible though (to be expected). I would not recommend these for normal everyday use. Great at beach, pool, and not much else."
4.0,"I got these earrings as a companion piece to go with the necklace, however, it looked a whole lot smaller than it actually is & it's just way too big for me.  I'll give them as a gift soonest.  They're beautiful and the symbolism is spectacular.  They're beautifully made, it's just that I don't do huge earrings and these are just way too big for me."
4.0,It was what I expected and needed
4.0,"I bought these for my petite 92-year-old mom who has small, narrow feet. Others were falling off of her or getting turned around to where the non-skid pads were no longer making contact with the floor. The full coverage dots on the bottom of the foot give better coverage. These have not lost their snug fit after lots of wear and many washings. I am delighted with this product as it has increased safety for mom at an age where a fall could be devastating.<br /><br />She has had these for about 5 weeks. I will follow up in another 2-3 months on the wear of the sock. They will earn a 5-star rating if they last."
4.0,It really helps keeping the clasp in place while trying to hook it.  The color could be nicer but it works.
4.0,Leather!
4.0,"The dress did not fit at all. But they were extremely communicative and were great about getting it done quickly.  Basically - lesson learned. If you order the dress (which is made from gorgeous thick double layer -fully lined satin) --- be sure to take a whole bunch of measurements and be very specific about the measurements where you are measuring EXACTLY.  The bustier was too high (long) so I had to have the dress altered to take out length in the white section.  Also important to note -- if you are expecting the hem of the dress to be stiff with the shape shown in the picture... You will be disappointed.  There is no stiffener or horsehair in the hem, so the dress just lays and drapes. It's a completely different look. It is well-made though and the hem is stitch and turn so to take up the length I had to have someone take it apart at the waist and shorten from the top after adding reinforcement to stiffen the hem"
4.0,"The price is very good for parents like me who don‚Äôt know long kids will stay interested in iceskating. The quality is ok, but can definitely be improved. The fabric started piling already."
4.0,It's a cute shirt that looks just like the picture. But the bodice of the shirt is not fitted. There's no stretch to it so it hangs a little loose on me instead of fitting to my body. I'm a size 0 though and it still looks nice on me.
4.0,"Material is alot thicker than I thought it would be. Need it for summer wear, but to hot."
4.0,Comfortable material but it‚Äôs not very breathable. Good for the price though.
4.0,"Fabulous, luxurious .I did have to exchange for one size up."
4.0,The only 2 things that I wish I would have known is... the pants are see through and the waist band is very snug!
4.0,Wish I had realized how much this looks like a swimsuit or I would have bought red shorts to pair with it. Still very cute though and I love that we can use the tank throughout all of summer- not just for the Fourth of July!
4.0,"They are really pretty.  They are a nice size and look more expensive than they are.  The only problem is the color, I was hoping for a bright yellow, not a golden yellow."
4.0,It looks exactly like the picture. I ordered a size larger than my usual and it fits perfect!
4.0,I've been very impressed with this Batman themed wallet I purchased for my oldest son.  This wallet is great quality with good stitching.  The quality of materials for the price is quite impressive.  The Batman symbol on the outside of the wallet feels like it's made of quality and looks very sharp.  This wallet would work well for a men's wallet for those that are big fans of Batman.  Great wallet.
4.0,"Actually, is warmer than I thought. However, for winter or cold days is perfect. Wash it before using to feel comfortable; others,  is stiff and uncomfortable."
4.0,"Unique style and good quality fabric, it is just not for me. Hate to return it, but Modernmiss becomes my favorite place to shop now."
4.0,This good quality skirt. Got the leopard print and really like it. Order up. Im glad I got the large instead of the medium.
4.0,"my only complaint would be quality of shirt.  The wrists stretch out immediately requiring me to roll up sleeves and still streches out, but i still like the graphics"
4.0,"The top had too much extra fabric and I'm a 34DDD! The bottoms fit great, I wish I could've just kept the bottoms and returned the top."
4.0,Exactly what I was expecting.  Arrived a week later than expected due to snow storms.  Perfectly sized for my maid of honor to accent her dress.  I would recommend this item to others.
4.0,"Looks great, doesn't feel great though. The material isn't comfortable to hold on to, so I tend to hold the wheel more by the side now."
4.0,I followed other reviewers and ordered 2 sizes larger just to be safe. I might have been ok with just 1 size larger but I am happy with it.
4.0,"Product is fine quality, but I'm removing a star since I ordered a size 6, and received a size 8. Otherwise it's great and my daughter loves it."
4.0,"I ordered an XL and I am a medium, I could of got away with a Large, but this will shrink, for sure.  I like a flowy, roomy top so I ordered up.  It's great quality.  Gray is a nice, dark, gun metal - ish gray.  The material is fantastic.  It is cotton, for sure.  Almost like linen so great for a warm climate.  Looks awesome with white skinny jeans.  I have several Mordenmiss tops and this one did not disappoint."
4.0,Bought to embarrass my kids when I bring the bling.  Works better than expected.
4.0,"The fit seems true despite what I read in previous reviews.  These are extremely light-weight rings, which I wasn't expecting but doesn't really matter to me either way.  Mine are blemish free and very shiny and pretty.  The engraving is much tinier than in the picture, which also doesn't make much of a difference unless maybe you can't see well.  What I particularly like is the fit.  Very comfortable and rounded out nicely.  Happy with my purchase.  Can't beat the price."
4.0,"They work well for me, good value, decent quality."
4.0,I love it. So warm. My friends want one .
4.0,"Liked the color, fabric& style. A bit large though."
4.0,"It was a very pretty dress, but shorter than expected, and smaller than expected. I ordered the navy color, but had to return it."
4.0,A great dress and pretty design. Fits as expected but longer than I like  (5&#34;3&#34;)  Good fabric and a fun summer dress which can be worn in different settings and events.  Worth the money.
4.0,"I received the dress this afternoon. I tried it on and it was a great fit. It arrived on time however to my disappointment there was no belt for it. the style is not the same without it, This dress is definitely NOT pleated!!!!!"
4.0,"This dress is really cute and great for a night out. The fit is flattering and the shade of red is deep. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is it took a really long time to come in the mail. So if you want to get it, plan ahead!!"
4.0,"Great pants. They are extremely comfortable, lightweight, and fresh. I would describe the fit as slim.<br /><br />The velcro around the snap button is supposed to be for reinforcement but we'll see how long it lasts, and that's the true worry of these pants. They pilled on the leg after the first time in the dryer. The theory is the velcro rubbed the material, so they damaged themselves. So who knows if these will be good for more than a season of regular use.<br /><br />The waist elastic is very stiff but I think it's good because the pants definitely stay in place."
4.0,liked it but unfortuantely was to heavy and to large for me .would be great if they could duplicate it on a smaller scale .returned for a refund
4.0,"Very pretty dress, made very well. The fabric is decent weight and the appliqu√©s are sewn on well. I did have to iron it quite a bit prior to my daughter wearing it due to being folded in the packaging. i was disappointed it did not come with crinoline underneath, but it works very well without it. My daughter loves this dress and felt like a princess in it!"
4.0,"I really like the cut and, length and the way this skirt fits my full-figured shape, but I had 2 issues with this order.  First, I ordered olive green, but got a black one.  I could have lived with that, but the zipper on it kept getting stuck, even when I turned it around and pulled it up to my ribs, with the intend to turn it back around and slip it down to my waist.<br /><br />That's a bit disappointing, but I'm having good luck with the Grace Karin brand, so I'll continue shopping with them."
4.0,The shirts run small in size. The shirt looks great and the fabric is better than what I expected.1
4.0,Love the hoodie itself and it really is quite warm but if you plan on buying it you might wanna get it in a size bigger.
4.0,fit as expected. Material was a bit cheap
4.0,A bit smaller than I would have like but not bad at all
4.0,it was thinner than i thought
4.0,Me quedo excelente
4.0,"Love the golf shirt.  Fits as expected.  Just wish it was a little thicker material.  I wore a base layer under it to keep warm. I am 5, 4‚Äù and weight 124.  I bought a small."
4.0,"I ordered the XXL, the fit around the bust was perfect for my 42Cs but at 5'9&quot; it was shorter than I would have wanted and so the pockets were higher than they should have fit on me.  Nevertheless the material is nice and soft and I like the product."
4.0,"cute, use as a sleep shirt"
4.0,"I like these! They are very comfy! Just wearing a bit in time, but for this price I think they are really good!"
4.0,"Item was purchased as a birthday gift.  Love the color and style.  Like that purse is structured style.  I hate sitting a purse on the floor but sometimes it's unavoidable.  This purse sits upright and won't fall over plus it has four metal studs on bottom so it doesn't completely touch the floor. However, jury is still out on quality and durability since I've just began using the purse. UPDATE: after 6 months of use (I don't carry this bag on a daily basis), the handles have begun to crack and break at the sewn joints at the metal rings.  Trying to slow the progress of the cracks with clear shoe glue.  Not sure how long the handles will continue to last."
4.0,Glasses are really nice. We put proscription lenses in them. My son loves them. One minus is that optician couldn‚Äôt  bend them behind your child‚Äôs  ears(since it‚Äôs silicone). So they slip sometimes.
4.0,This is one of my favorite dresses! Medium was a perfect fit for 5'8 140lbs
4.0,"Loose fitting.<br />Fabric is soft, but eventually doesn‚Äôt ware perfectly with snag or fabric balls from pulling."
4.0,I like this for the most part. But my only issue is that it‚Äôs too loose. I have to tuck it a couple times for it to stay up on my nose.
4.0,"The dress fit at expected, but the zipper was a little stiff. I really wish the &#34;belt&#34; on the waist was a different color. I didn't realize it was red and green."
4.0,Somewhat small but very cute
4.0,"Awesome inexpensive gift to give away, to anyone on holidays<br /><br />PROS<br />‚óò tells time<br />‚óò connects handily to keychains<br />‚óò provides entertainment when handed to random strangers in the mall still in the box when you tell them not to shake it and its a clock<br /><br />Cons<br />‚óò nothing very nifty gift"
4.0,"I got this because it says it has the metal free loop that actually opens and closes, unlike the rest of the replica ocean bands. While that piece still isn‚Äôt on the level of the apple brand loop, it‚Äôs better than all the rest that are a single piece of metal. The strap material quality was also good, and fit correctly into the watch. Better than expected."
4.0,"Arrived as advertised.  Easy enough to cut the excess with scissors and melt the end with a big.  Belt material certainly strong enough to carry gear without dashing.  However, the buckle is extremely light weight and will not be surprised if it eventually cracks.  Will update should that occur.  It does secure/release quickly and easily."
4.0,This runs very small; I wear 10-12 & had to order XXLg!  Nice style & plenty long.
4.0,"I use these for cycling for both compression and sunburn protection.  The lightweight 15% Spandex-85% Polyester blend is cool and breathable in warm weather.  So far they have proven to be durable.  I ride without a chamois and wear a pair of compression shorts under under the tights to eliminate chafing and to make them a bit more modest since they are a bit see-through when stretched.  They are cut so that the seams do not  cross my saddle. The waistband rides down more than I would like when cycling, but to fix that I would have had to pay a lot more for bibs. These work OK for the price."
4.0,"It's very cute, goes well with swimming suit."
4.0,Really good quality! Love the cut and shape. They are just a little small compared to what the sizing said. But it does still work. I would buy again.
4.0,"Good price, fits as expected, arrived as expected... no complaints."
4.0,"It is a little hot in theat chicken head, but I guess it's not for every day wear."
4.0,"The dress was fine, problem was me, need to loose the weight. üòÅ Although it wasn't too bad on me.<br />Material is stretchy and light weight."
4.0,I got some Philadelphia Eagles patches and made a bad ars Eagles hat that looks like an extremely expensive NFL product
4.0,The shoes looked even better in person. They were well made and great looking shoes. My only problem was that they were a bit too small for me to keep. I was sad that I had to return them.
4.0,"I have used a brief case since college. My first, filled with heavy science text books, was a solid luggage-like case that I still have. It has stood the test of time, I still have it and use it sparingly because it came into existence before laptops, tablets and any electronic devices. New bags need to address the need to protect electronics from damage while traveling via car, bus, train, and plane. This bag does the job. It has several cushy internal slots for a tablet and or a medium-sized laptop. The quibble I have is it has magnetic ""snaps"" to keep the straps in place. Many laptops have magnetic hard drives and magnets can corrupt data if they get close to the computer. Fortunately, my MacBook has a solid state hard drive so using this bag to carry it has been problem free. If it wasn't, I would be reluctant to carry my laptop in it for fear of data issues. Other than that, this bag is one I can recommend.<br /><br />As part of this evaluation, I used it on It a recent 6 day business trip (all by car) and the papers, pens, and laptop all survived nicely. The bag still looks like new and seems like it will develop a nice patina with age.<br /><br />Other than the concern about magnets (there are several) I think this is a reasonably priced, attractive and stylish bag that would be acceptable in any business atmosphere."
4.0,These run long. I could cut 3- 4 inches off!
4.0,"My step daughter is normally a 12. After reading reviews, I sized up 2 sizes, to ""1 Big Kid"", and they fit great. They're super cute though!"
4.0,"I bought this dress for our small courthouse wedding. Given the situation of Covid it was very small. I purchased this dress cause it looked pretty, off white, flowing and just casual but feminine enough for my style. I added a bridal belt because it is very plain so that helped the look a lot. Over all it was very pretty. Color was as expected and fit. I ordered a small and it was perfect and length was good. I am 5‚Äô3 130 lbs. I would recommend this dress , just wear nude under garments and a slip to cover up."
4.0,Love it!! A little tight especially after drying. But good purchase !!
4.0,"They run small, but are very cute. Order 2 sizes up if your child has a wide foot and 1 size up for narrow."
4.0,this could of been a little longer
4.0,The black and gold hoops were fine but the silver hoops clasp broke as soon as I opened it.
4.0,"shirt will shrink in the dryer so just be aware, overall live this shirt."
4.0,"I have to admit I was not expecting much from a purse that cost $10 but I loved the design so much I was willing to take a chance on it.  This purse seem to be a good quality PU bag. I checked out all the hardware as soon as I opened it and everything worked great. It's roomy and I thought at first sight well constructed until I noticed some loose stitching in the corner that opened up to a hole to the interior of the bag. I returned this one and order another one hoping it won't have any problems. It is such a cute bag and the perfect vintage look that I want for an outfit I am designing. There is some oder from the material but that is to be expected from a new product.  I'm sure after a few days it will air out. Kudos to the manufacturer for making such a cute, affordable and I hope well constructed  (we will see when the next one arrives.) PU( leather backing covered with polyurethane) bag.<br />Pamela<br />Honolulu, Hawaii"
4.0,"Slightly larger than expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and weigh 115. I order the size 1 and they are just a tad too big around the waste. I don‚Äôt know that they do anything magical for my butt, however they don‚Äôt flatten it like some jeans do. They‚Äôre definitely designed for curves. They seam to be good quality, but I haven‚Äôt had them long enough to really know how they‚Äôll hold up.<br />Being short, I thought I might be able to unroll them and wear them as full length jeans, however they do not have a real hem. I can‚Äôt really complain about that, since that‚Äôs not the intended use, but just a heads up if you‚Äôre short and have the same idea."
4.0,The fasinator Hair Clip was pretty until I opened the package.  At that time a section of the feathers fell off of the clip!<br />  I had to glue it back into the bunch in order to wear the clip.
4.0,Leather belt is narrower than I'd expected
4.0,These work well.  I would have like slightly larger balls on the screws to make it easier to grab and twist.  However they certainly increase sensitivity and are a nice visual.
4.0,"Great purse, a little cheaper material than i though it would be though."
4.0,"Ordered the brown one and pulled up the reference picture after putting it on. It is Not the same brown as the one in the picture. The one I got in looks kind of like a red clay kind of brown. The one in the picture as an actual darker brown. This is the only reason I gave it 4 üåü's. Other than that, it fits, it is flattering to my body type! And I really like it, so I am keeping it! I probably could have gotten a meduim. Not sure but it fits well anyway!<br /><br />Reference: I am 5'7 and between 186 to 190lbs."
4.0,"Great packable kids jacket to bring to Disney World.  I got 3 of them for my 3 kids.  There is a nice soft liner inside.  I ended up putting rain ponchos over this jacket so I can't comment on the water proofness of it however it was perfect for our trip and took up little space in the back pack.  My only reason to drop a star is that the sizing is really small.  I ordered two size 9s and a size 7.  The 7 fit my 4 year old well but the size 9 was not much bigger and barely fit my 6 year old.  My 8 year old ended up not wearing hers because it was too small.  The size on the jacket is EU and was listed as 120 and 140 on the others.  Size up if you buy this.  Even it is big, there is growing room."
4.0,the socks are colorful and comfortable.
4.0,Was good quality and well made but was very small for a 3x
4.0,Okay shirts for the money but 2 issues that I have... the deal breaker is the collar... maybe if you have a small neck it's good for you but I feel like I am being choked.. another issue that is likely true of most compression shirts is that in the tight areas like the chest the fabric stretches to the point that it really doesn't provide much insulation
4.0,"It's beautiful and has kept its shape well, but I have only had it since January and it has already lost many of the stones.  I guess that's to be expected with such an inexpensive ring.  Still, I'd expect it to last at least a few months..."
4.0,Would have been great but calf was too small and foot part was too big.
4.0,Bought as a birthday present for my husband who is a trumpet player.  He loved it!
4.0,I'm 5'8&#34; and it fits well. My boyfriend is 6' and it is a bit short on length of where it is for me. Otherwise we like them.  We use them for the hottub instead of using towels.
4.0,"I'm 5ft tall and 135lbs, ordered a medium and it fit very well."
4.0,"Based on the previous experience with the same flip-flops, this time my wife ordered 1/2 size smaller than her actual size and they turned out perfect. The top of the sole is 10-1/2 inches long and 3-7/8 inches wide at the ball of the foot. She wears women's size 9-1/2 M, but in some brands a 10 M, but she has a low arch. Previously she ordered a 10 and they were too large and too loose; however, the turquoise ones were even larger than the black ones.<br />They are very comfortable. The only thing she doesn't like about them is the boldness of the straps - they should be narrower, since unusual width gives an impression of a bigger foot."
4.0,"Cute and fit as described but it was crazy puffy, doesn‚Äôt lie anywhere near flat."
4.0,This is a little long but it fits everywhere else very nice.
4.0,Love these but some nights it is not cold enough & they cook me.  Very cold weather P.J.s  Runs a little large.
4.0,Works very well very stylish
4.0,Love it mane
4.0,Like the bathing suit...the only draw back was the insert cups were weird. But overall a great purchase for the price
4.0,"Love the material and the cut, however, you will definitely want to order a size or 2 up depending on how loose you want it."
4.0,Very cute.. But small
4.0,I do like these shoes especially the rubber grip bottoms however they were big for my baby who was 10 months old when purchased. They made her feet look huge.
4.0,"Noce, made well, but runs small- make sure to get a size up."
4.0,Wish it had beltloops. Will probably buy another one.
4.0,Nice but not very clear
4.0,Shirt is fine. Will not take discount  and order again because message Jolt would be<br />sending more products automatically.
4.0,Long and can't hem becuz of design! So cute tho
4.0,Real pretty. The loop that holds it on chain broke and I will have to<br />put my own on. This was a gift. Heavy also.Would actually make a real<br />cute key chain.
4.0,"Cute pattern, the fabric was fine"
4.0,"We only purchase dress up clothes from<br />Little Adventures because the items are well made, are soft and lasts through multiple washes .<br />This particular dress and embellishment near the neckline irritated my daughter thus only 4 stars but it's a really cute dress ."
4.0,"Nice and starchy, sort of thin, definitely had to wear an undershirt and missing white button in middle?? I was wearing a vest anyway so didn't matter for me."
4.0,"Works and is pretty comfortable, but It caused me to majorly break out near my hairline. Through no fault of it's own, really, that's just what happens when you have fleece against and oily forehead for 8 hours."
4.0,I liked this top fine. I usually wear it under something else. It isn't exactly soft but it doesn't irritate my skin at all.
4.0,"It has a great design, and looks great on, but it did come large."
4.0,"This is a nice, lightweight, no-tacky-logos, pretty blue bag.  I love the two large zippered compartments, one has a double slip pocket and the other has an additional zippered pocket.  The outside open side pockets are tall and narrow, good for pens and glasses.  The strap is just webbing, it's not covered in the same fabric like some similar bags.  I have a very similar black bag that is a little longer, more &#34;dumpling&#34; shaped, that I actually like a little better but this one is nice too and I am using it.  You can stuff a lot in it but it doesn't look silly if you don't fill it.  If you like washable, organized, lightweight purses, you'll probably like this one.  The blue is a nice alternative for summer."
4.0,"I liked the garment, goodfeeling material and very comfortable.  I found I needed a smaller size since I wanted a very snug fitting garment"
4.0,"Cute sweater dress, but  Printed glitter. Not really glitter. It‚Äôs a picture of glitter<br />True to size."
4.0,The grandkids love them.
4.0,"It looks nice, but not easy to close and the end of a bracelet it doesn't  fit in a little metal loop - i don't like that"
4.0,wonderful fabric
4.0,"EDIT: I‚Äôve been wearing this hat for a few days now and it is so light and comfortable you forget you‚Äôre wearing it. This hat is totally winning me over, strange bumpy issues aside.<br /><br />I was looking for a hat just like this to pack for vacation and this seemed like the way to go.<br />Got the hat today and overall it‚Äôs pretty good. Super comfortable, lightweight, and easily foldable.<br />My only issue with it is the construction. It‚Äôs not super precise so there are these little bumps on the top and near the brim.<br />It was packed in an envelope and really wrinkled when I got it so I figured that is what caused it.<br />I lightly steamed out all the wrinkles and they disappeared but the bumps remained.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not totally dissatisfied with the purchase, but for $25 I figured the construction would be a bit better."
4.0,"Turned out to be a great product.  Much better quality than I expected.  Definitely designed to be a costume not to fight other ninjas while wearing. Ha. I was worried about the sizing.  I did not get an email asking my sizes like another reviewer claims to have received.  I ordered the Medium and it fit like a perfect.  I wear 30/30 pants, 8 1/2 on shoes, 23 inch headband, and 36 1/2&#34; chest.  The shirt is a little tight.  It came in about 2 weeks.  I give the 4 out of 5 stars just because of the ambiguous sizing."
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very pretty dress but i had some issues with it. One being that there was a tear in the tight shoulder. Luckily it was on the seam so I will be able to sew it back. The other issue was that the sleeves we a bit too long. It wrinkles pretty easily. Overall not a bad dress, but definitely not my favorite."
4.0,Great shirt graphics are awesome
4.0,Cute but ran a bit small in the chest area causing the buttons to gape.
4.0,A bit tight on the top elastic part but sure it will stretch out a bit with wear. Love the color and design!
4.0,"Colors are great, very comfortable, love the style"
4.0,"Really like this pattern a lot, but if you put your phone in your pocket often while wearing denim it will taint the white coloring."
4.0,"Cute jacket, well-made, arrived on-time.<br />I would give it 5 stars, except the jacket is navy blue, not black as described.. I still like it, though; goes well with jeans."
4.0,"Would have liked to have it a little longer being a tall girl, but that's hard to find in general! very comfy!"
4.0,pretty darn good for a cheap hat. Used it on a cold Javelina hunt.
4.0,It is a simple black dress. It has stretch so I fit nicely...not like a sack.  I like it because i can wear it with sandels or dress it up with patterned stockings and heels.  My husband whistled the first time I wore it.
4.0,"Loved the material and quality. However, it just didn't work great with my body type. I'm petite, with a short torso. The front fit fine, but the back bunched up and the legs were a bit long for me to wear with flats (I need to wear flats for my job.)"
4.0,Nice for price! I only wish the shape was less Abe Lincoln and more Moulin Rouge. But it can work especially for the price!!!
4.0,"Nice for a steampunk costume. Fit well, good material."
4.0,A couple of them snag on clothing. However they do not make my belly button itch or get a rash like some do (the ones from Spencer‚Äôs sometimes)... & they have not broke even though I wear the dangly ones 24/7. No color turning yet. Worn each dangly one atleast a week.
4.0,"I bought this in February of last year and was instantly overjoyed when it came in the mail. However, if you're not careful, the pendant can be lost easily, as it is very small. I had to cut the little chain down to size because it was disproportionately long. Also, the thing I was most disappointed about was whatever kind of paint they use for the chain because it started wearing off inside a week. The pendant was fine until I lost it at a crowded fair.<br /><br />All in all, good product, but may want to cover in some kind of sealant before frequent use."
4.0,"Quality is amazing , def waterproof and oil / slip resistant. Only problem is it runs a bit big , probably one size big as I am usually size 8 and I have about a half an inch space at the tip of my toes. I cannot return because I used already in the machine shop. Very comfortable , breaking period take a while but that‚Äôs  good sign of quality and wear resistance. Worth the buy even with the size being a bit big"
4.0,"Cute nose ring, but the edge is a bit sharp. Otherwise I really like it."
4.0,"Only reason why I'm not giving 4 üåü is due to the fact that this bag does not stand up on its own. Must be propped up against something. Otherwise it is great quality, fits my hp 360 13.1 inch laptop perfectly, even with a laptop case. Plenty of room for charger and lots of other necessities."
4.0,They were a bit more fitting around the hip/butt area than what I was expecting.
4.0,Dress size runs a little larger than I expected
4.0,"The description said approximately 6 LOL, I had a hard time putting a 2 liter bottle in this bag but it does look very nice and I'm going to keep it for my clothes but I was hoping to put my tent in it."
4.0,"For the price I paid this is an amazing piece of jewelry. Compared to other pieces of jewelry, it's nothing special. I think the metal isn't the best quality, but if you're not too rough on it it should last fine. I've worn mine multiple times and it still looks beautiful and shiny. Plus it's gained me more than one compliment."
4.0,Love This shirt. Wearing it now. So light and comfortable perfect for me to wear on casual fridays to work. (:  casual and professional.
4.0,"good condition in package, it should work for what it was bought for..i would recommend this product to other buyers"
4.0,"Lightweight and compact, this hat is super comfortable. I got a medium, and it's a hair too big, but it's only noticeable because I don't have any. Hair, that is. Seems to run true to size."
4.0,"I bought these pants for my husband who wanted a pair of fleece pants for working out/playing tennis in the winter. The pants are great, except they are way too long--too long for him to work out in without tripping on the legs. Since they are so comfortable he decided to keep them as pajama pants, and wears them rolled up."
4.0,Looking for a nice lounging style of pant or pajama pants? This is it. These feel good on and quite comfortable. They are just a bit on the large size but that is what I was looking for in the fit. I do have to keep them pulled up as they are a little long in the inseam. Easy to roll them up one turn if needed. They are super soft as well and I would buy them again. Size ordered was large. I just checked them on the site and they are sold out of the large size. I wanted to buy a couple more of these.
4.0,My boyfriend loved this wallet. Really nice and thin.
4.0,"This brace is very cute. It's well made, the combo of gold chain and macrame string is really a chic bohemian look. The only downside of this bracelet is that the clasp does not stay super well. It's not unwearable and I have what I would consider average to small sized wrists, and I would have to work at it for the bracelet to simply fall off. It does come loose a lot, though."
4.0,‚ÄòThis will be an oddball review but I bought this case as a travel case for disposable contact lenses. It is the perfect size for 4 packs of 5 ‚Äî 10 days worth. The magnetic close is nice and I like that I can easily see what is inside.
4.0,"I got a size small, the top fit great but bottoms were wayyy too big. I wish they sold the pieces separately. I usually wear XS-S in bottoms, depending on brand, and I would say these fit more like a medium. The top fit pretty true to size. (I'm a small in most sports bras)"
4.0,"Love the style, definitely fits nicely and isn‚Äôt too tight. Got these for after I pierced my nipples and they did a great job holding in place while I slept. Only thing is, they pads they came with are poor quality but they‚Äôre removable, which is great!"
4.0,"I like the material, it has a crinkly design look to it. I actually turn the top around for the elastic part to be in front. Someone else had mentioned the fit is better, and it is. It was worth the price."
4.0,Very cute!! I had to pull them up a few times during the day.
4.0,Easy to install. The brown color  is a little too light. I had to add brown shoe Polish to darken the strap.
4.0,"Not big tittle friendly. I got a medium which is usually my size despite being a little on the chunk side, but holy heck my boobs feel suffocated. Other than that it‚Äôs super cute and fits everywhere else fine"
4.0,"overall pretty good, one of my pair was scratched before I opened them, but they were super cheap so I'm not too worried about it"
4.0,"This is true to size! Which makes me very happy. So many times I‚Äôve purchased clothes online and more then half the time, it runs too small.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äù10, 220lbs. I bought a 2x.  This fits perfectly. It even has a little stretch to it so it‚Äôs not tight.  It comes down a little past my knees. It‚Äôs a Perfect classy cocktail dress, wedding dress or even for work in an office with a cute jacket. I‚Äôm excited to wear it!<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead 5 because I have not worn or washed it yet. I don‚Äôt know how well it will hold up after a few wears. Although it does look and feel like it‚Äôs made well.<br /> I‚Äôll come back to update my review if I feel the need.<br />I‚Äôm going to look at other clothes this seller/designer has online since this fit so well."
4.0,"Rose gold has been my metal of choice for jewelry in the last year. This ring is really quite nice. It has the comfort fit that has become popular. The rose gold is super shiny and it does not lose its luster with everyday wear. The CZ stones are incredibly beautiful and look real.  The only thing I noticed that is not beneficial on this ring is that the stones are not deeply set as in the picture.  They rise over the level of the ring and can scratch the skin or clothing.  The ring looks MUCH more expensive than it is and I have been wearing it daily instead of the much more expensive jewelry I own.<br /><br />I purchased this rose gold cz ring at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it. All opinions are truly my own and it is my pleasure to be able to offer others my thoughts so they might be able to make informed decisions as to whether products are appropriate for them. I am not a paid reviewer and I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. I gain nothing by giving this item a positve, negative or neutral review. If at any time in the future with prolonged use of any product my opinion changes, I will leave an update to my review of the product (as you can see by past reviews, that happens)."
4.0,"Nice & very pretty......Fits as expected, except:<br />But, Verrrry Long (even for an average tall person). Consider cutting it to your desired length."
4.0,"a nice thin robe..very bright and just what i wanted...fit as expected,and much nicer than  expected for the cost"
4.0,Just what i need good product
4.0,Works fine for summertime house to spa.
4.0,Great for the price. I have done some modification myself but nice bikini
4.0,"Nice watch.  Feels a little cheap but for the price I wasn't expecting a heavy, expensive feel.  Came as advertised...great for watch for what it cost."
4.0,"Nice hat, keeps the sun off my face. I'm really pale and need all the protection from the sun that I can get, and this helps. Only problem is it seems a bit small around my head, so I don't wear it as much as I probably should just for comfort reasons. It would be nice if if had a little more give in the band around the head, but it's not bad, especially considering the price."
4.0,I really liked this dress but had to return bc it was too small in the busy.
4.0,"I really like this dress, but when it came, the bust area was too small. I'm a 42DDD and I ordered the 2x, but it wouldn't button up at all, let alone without bunching. I did really like the dress though, so I ended up giving it to my sister, who is smaller than I am in the chest region, and she really likes it as well. She is only a 38D though, so it fits her much better."
4.0,"Short length imo. Feels go on skin.  Stretchy.  For all true muscle bodies, go 2 sizes up"
4.0,I am truly enjoying this item as it gives me the freedom to enjoy the various views of daylight and visuals.
4.0,"VERY cute. And short! But super cute for a bridal<br />Shower. It runs a little small. I got the biggest size (10) and could hardly get it over my shoulders. I usually wear a 10-12 due to my hips. I‚Äôm<br />6‚Äô tall, athletic build.<br />I would have probably needed a 14 to fit comfortably."
4.0,"Lightweight, and good fit"
4.0,These were extremely comfortable and very good at sweat wiking! My only problem is they kept rising up and would not stay in place
4.0,I was pretty big put I still like it.  Its a cozy sweater! The color is quite pale but I still got lots of compliments.
4.0,"Great dress, fit as expected for my measurents and height/weight (5,5&#34; and 150 lbs). My bust is 36 and waist is 31 and I went with the large since I figured a medium would be to snug around the waist. It's fits me almost perfectly (a little baggy around the sides of my bust but I expected that). I'm long in the torso so I was pleasantly surprised it when down to just above my knee. It might shrink a little once I wash it so I will update this and let everyone know the results.<br /><br />Very cute and easy to dress up for a wedding or down for work. Four stars because the material isn't too soft and it had a vague smell that reminded me of when I first bought my camping tent. Still would buy again"
4.0,"I like this. I don't like my legs so I like to cover up when wearing a bathing suit. This fits me well and is sheer so it is cute but hides all of my imperfections. The slit is not very visible on me and the ties I find to be way too long, but they can be tied in a bow. I am also 5'3 and its a bit long on me, so I just moved it higher up on my waist. Overall I think it is a good value."
4.0,I really like the color but I was kind of disappointed because the picture showed that it was more blousey than what it actually is
4.0,"Beautiful tie set very well made. The bow tie is a bit &#34;droopy&#34; when worn, like its heavy and kind of faces down even when tightened. Otherwise a great set!"
4.0,Great Looking mask!! You just have to be careful you don't drop it.... I got it from my son I've had to glue it back together four times....
4.0,looks larger than it is but they are gorgeous
4.0,Looks good on and made of good material.
4.0,"Clothing for different sporting teams can often be dull, plain, & almost too masculine at times but I loved that I could still support one of my favs but still look girly.  Very comfy!!"
4.0,I wish i was able to get it in a bigger size but it fits just fine. And its cute for a simple halloween costume without spending too much on an extravagant maid outfit. Although i will say that the fabric isn't of the greatest quality but it is durable as far as i can tell
4.0,"Update 11/14/2020<br />Customer support took longer then expected to get my first email but after that they've been incredibly responsive. Myself and other reviewers seem to all have the same feedback about these running quite large. They scale in height and girth almost proportionally. So for me I'm normally an XL but in these the large is a little too big and the medium is a little too snug.<br /><br />Just know that going into your order that these do run quite large. I'm amending my star rating because of their customer support making things right and acknowledging their sizes are big. I'm still leaving it a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />If these had a chest drawstring, double stitched seams and additional belt loops I would be rating this a 5.<br />With the fabric they choose depending on how much fishing you do you'll probably get 2 or 3 seasons out of these.<br /><br />UPDATE - 10/20/2020<br />Customer support finally responded and sent me a replacement set.<br />We reviewed the dimensions and my size. Based on how large the XL was (which was weird) they sent me a medium. The medium was so small I could barely get into it. I'm increasing starts from 1 to 2 because customer support responded. The size chart is not even close to correct.<br /><br />Original order -<br />I ordered these to replace boot-foot waders and upgrade to stocking-foot and use dedicated wading boots.<br /><br />The PRO‚Äôs for these waders is they‚Äôre VERY lightweight. 2lbs exactly. They‚Äôre also breathable. These would make fishing nice because a heavier unbreathable wader is pretty miserable on just about any weather day. Because you end up hot, tired and soaked from your own perspiration.<br /><br />The seams and zipper are both sealed so that‚Äôs a nice touch too.<br /><br />The CONS;<br />The seams are only single stitched. Other brands at this same price point are double stitching. You can see in my photo showing both the seam sealing and single stitching that there isn‚Äôt any attention paid to the quality of stitching. It‚Äôs all haphazardly tied off and loose thread all over.<br /><br />There is only one belt loop on the back. It‚Äôs VERY thin and also only single stitched. This will fail quickly and become a leak point.<br /><br />Sizing is way off. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 1‚Äù, 230+ lbs, 36‚Äù waste, 32‚Äù inseam, size 10.5 to 11 wide shoe. Based in their sizing chart recommendation to order my inseam +5 inches I did and ordered the extra large. It‚Äôs comically large, every point of measurement is wrong. Like staypuffed fisherman large. My wife saw me in them and burst out laughing. Their sizing chart needs to be changed and/or stop recommending 5+ inches because it‚Äôs not just the inseam, the sizes increase exponentially.<br /><br />Customer support - they boast in their listing responsive customer support. Their packaging also says 24 hour support. I‚Äôve emailed them to see if I can swap for a smaller size because Amazon won‚Äôt replace for a different size. I‚Äôm still waiting for them to respond and it‚Äôs been several days. There‚Äôs no business website that I can find and their email address is a generic ‚Äúoutlook‚Äù email address.<br /><br />Overall these are very cheaply made and cheap feeling waders. I will be cautious considering any future purchases of Mountalk products."
4.0,love the shine
4.0,"These were purchased for my wife.  She likes them, as they allow her to clearly see the dashboard gauges while driving or reading while riding as a passenger.  She tells me that they seem well made enough, but a little pricey for the build quality.  Finally, she would like them more if the tint was a bit darker.  Overall, she feels that they look nice as sunglasses go and that they have helped her with reducing eye strain from driving or riding during bright sunlight.  We would purchase them again."
4.0,"The fabric is a little see though on the lighter parts of the pattern.  Also, I sized down and I shouldn‚Äôt have. I have DDD chest and it‚Äôs tight. I should have gone with the large. It‚Äôs not too bad so I will keep it. (5‚Äô1‚Äù and 158 pounds)"
4.0,"Comfy , soft material as expected"
4.0,"It's very cute, the pattern and color is good! Also the material is good. I'm a 14 in pants and around an 40D in bra and I got a XXL the top is a little loose but it fits well the bottoms fit ok they don't really agree with my hips but over all it's a really cute swim suit. :) It's pretty much what i excepted"
4.0,For the amount I paid I‚Äôm kinda upset it couldn't have come in a box.  No bubble wrap or anything. Over all though it shipped fast and it was exactly as expected.
4.0,"I was really hoping this to wearable as an everyday dress. It is decently made,  I was surprised the buttons are actual working buttons and zipper seems pretty decent like it won't get stuck or break and moves pretty freely. The collar and cuffs are an ok material but the dress it self is cheap polyester, only slightly better then costume material. Better then most if your looking for every day but I think for that I will probably keep looking for the dress by itself and pair it with a collared shirt"
4.0,"This dress is really cute, however it's a little larger than usual. I typically wear medium-large, medium when I know the material will be stretchy. I have a bigger bust and hip size than average so I should fit a medium well but have to wear a large because clothes aren't made for my body type. I ordered a medium expecting some stretch but the medium ended up being too big. I would exchange it for a small but I feel like the length in the front is already short enough, if I get a small it might be shorter than I would prefer. All that being said, I love the dress so I'll probably just try to tailor it myself."
4.0,It's cute looking but the material isn't that comfortable.
4.0,I bought these for my daughter.<br />She loved them.<br />The shipping was fast and they packaged it nicely.
4.0,Nine year-old grandson loves it!  Hood definitely too small - had to add an extension.
4.0,"I like it, but it was 2 small.... about a good whole size too small. I will save it and gift it out because it is soooo pretty. I would say this piece could be unisex as well."
4.0,Nice duppata pleased
4.0,They‚Äôre alright. Normal tall socks.
4.0,"I like the choker & earrings, but the choker barely fits around my neck.I can secure it, but it is tight. I will have to use an extender to be comfortable. I suggest you make this necklace/choker longer to fit most women."
4.0,Super cute sassy tshirt! Good value for the price. I am pairing it with this item:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M4OFUKD/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_AQygfuANL7jDr
4.0,nice i liked it stands out had lots of comments on it.people always asked were i get it.lots of complements.
4.0,Nice snowman pin. Very cute. Well made.
4.0,My issues was resolved by the vendor in a very professional manner..I am happy and satisfied by the way my concerns were handled..I love the watch it is elegant and very functional
4.0,Made for a tiny Asian wrist
4.0,"I ordered clip Not pierce; Although they are beautiful, I am stuck will earrings that I cannot use."
4.0,My daughter is a &#34;fashionista&#34;! The style and quality of the shawl is perfect for the occasion for which she purchased it!
4.0,I went to a party tonight and was told I had a pretty bracelet  I‚Äôve been wearing it for more than a month I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt faded it‚Äôs really cheap and worth having
4.0,"This hat covers your face nicely<br /> Had skin cancer surgery on face and needed a hat with alot of coverage from sun and frankly embarrassment from scar..  This does it and has tie on chin to stay on. Good price, not hot, I like it"
4.0,"Love these. They're comfortable, soft, and the adjustable straps are great, as I've always had a problem with regular spaghetti strapped tank tops slipping off my shoulders. Will probably be buying more in the future and getting rid of all my other ones.<br /><br />edit: Updating my review as I've had these a while now, three of them have broken slide adjusters, on one side. I still wear them, but it's frustrating that after only a few washes they started to slowly break."
4.0,Used for Bendy Halloween costume. Worked for intended use. Tie came unhooked a few times.
4.0,"Overall, a wonderful bag - sturdy, lots of compartments, big enough for what I need it for.  I primarily bought the bag for my commute to work and needed a bag that would hold my travel mug.  Sadly, the attached pouch is quite snug on the diameter for my Contigo mug.  While the design makes it detachable, it also allows the pouch to 'roll' so it doesn't stay parallel to the bag - ending up at a 30 degree tilt.  However, I do use the pouch to drop my keys in when I get to work so I don't have to go through all the pockets to find them at the end of the day!  I would definitely rate it 5 stars if I hadn't purchased it specifically to hold my travel mug!"
4.0,It runs a little small through the shoulders & sleeves.
4.0,"Strange material, a little sheer/see through, but very cute"
4.0,"I live this dress so much I've bought two of them, one in green and one in burgundy. It a true to size. I'm 5'7'' and it lands about halfway through my knees. The fabric is stretchy but still holds its shape.<br />I have only two things against this dress. First is that it wrinkles very easily. Second is that the cleavage is meant for a pretty busty woman. I'm a c-up and it looks a little awkward I have work pins and suck before. That aside. I really do love this dress and get lots of compliments when I wear it. I've owned the green one for a year (and just bought the burgundy) and it's still in great shape. Overall I would recommend, but be wary of the cleavage."
4.0,My husband always wears Russell - happy with the quality although the sizing on this one was a bit larger than usual.
4.0,"Good quality, sleeves are really pretty, comfortable and washes well. Can‚Äôt wear in 3rd trimester though because I‚Äôm busting out of a DD bra at this point, and this shirt doesn‚Äôt have enough room in the chest to lay properly."
4.0,"it's beautifuland gorgeous, but it came with a black spot on its silk circle...a little upset"
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for and the fit isn't bad. They are a bit big, but they didn't have my size so I ordered up so I knew they'd be slightly loose, but they'll still work fine. I needed them for a running costume and they're exactly what I wanted. The price wasn't bad either.  Nice fabric. The waist band is wide cut but I can notice the narrow elastic along the top, which I don't notice in my other running tights.  They look like they'll hold up OK. I would try this brand again, but I'd like to try a pair in my Medium size so I have something to compare."
4.0,"The second pair I ordered were a slight let down, they had no fly and no belt loops, elastic waist bands are useless and wear poorly, draw string or not as I walk or bicycle and not drive."
4.0,If you're tall these will fit small
4.0,Not bad for the price but you can tell they are cheaper.
4.0,I Loved this product it is So cute. Fit well. It came with shoulder pads which I thought was weird but other than that it was a good buy.
4.0,"Good boot, husband likes them except they seem a little tight"
4.0,I was very pleased with this product. The product wasn‚Äôt as durable as I would‚Äôve like for them to be.
4.0,They are made good! Love the colors! But they were wider than I had hoped they would be.
4.0,"I was very impressed by the appearance and packaging of this watch.  It definitely is meant to feel like a first class experience and comes across that way.  The seller also sent follow up emails to make sure the watch was okay.<br /><br />The watch feels fairly well made.  The metal accents catch the light well and I can see this getting a lot of attention when you wear it. (which could be good or bad depending on how you feel about it getting attention)...<br /><br />One important note is that 2 of the 3 complications on the watch are for show (top and left) and don't actually move and/or do anything as far as I could tell.  The lower complication is the seconds and the one on the right shows the day/date.  In the pictures of this watch it shows the day of the week in red, but only Sunday is red, the rest are black.<br /><br />Setting the watch was a difficult experience.  I never did get it quite right and there wasn't a lot of information on how to do so - as close as I ended up getting was purely by accident.<br /><br />Although I liked the appearance of this watch, I ended up returning mine because the chronograph wouldn't reset to the midnight position.  Otherwise, for the money and given the overall presentation and sapphire crystal, you could do worse than this watch.<br /><br />[EDIT: see comments for clarifications on the complications and instructions on how to reset the chronometer second hand position - increasing review by 1 start as a result]"
4.0,"Fit was what you would expect. Good product, but the waistline went a bit high for my preference so I returned them."
4.0,"Fits great, material is a little odd, kind of like a wetsuit material."
4.0,Fits good!!!!
4.0,A really nice for the price
4.0,"I wish these came with a lanyard so I could put the container around my neck, but other than that, it's a great product!"
4.0,"The length is perfect, fits true to size in chest, I like how it is loose at the waist but it makes me look bigger then what I am."
4.0,These are good like the color.
4.0,"Ordered this mask on a Wednesday for a Halloween party, got on a Friday right before the party. Very prompt delivery! The mask is very cute, I didn‚Äôt expect the spikes to actually be so blunt but they are so be careful around others! All in all this mask is cute and great quality"
4.0,"it is a hippie chic nice watch, love it! nice color, good quality, great for my summer dresses. very good time for its value."
4.0,This was a nice Christmas present. My daughter loves it.
4.0,"Very pretty!  A bit daring in terms of cleavage exposure, but heck, its for a vacation in Cancun!"
4.0,The body of the jersey fits me perfectly. The problem is the sleeves. They are way too long. All of my other hockey jersey‚Äôs sleeves end just above my wrist. I‚Äôm not sure why this one is different.
4.0,"Wish I can select the design.<br />Some of them are easy to match the close, some of them just not my tone."
4.0,"Love everything about this, but wish the bottom had more of a flare to it! It would have been more flattering!! It appears that it had that flare in the picture, but is more hugging to the hips and mine are not that big! I totally love the halter look! Works for great support for my cup size!!"
4.0,The sandal looks nice but is a little too flat for me with no arch support. My fault for not reviewing first!
4.0,"I really liked the dress and thought about ordering in a different size. Just haven't yet. Because i haven't washed it yet, not sure how the flower will hold up."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable, & light weight. No cushion with these socks but will be good for summer."
4.0,"I admittedly have a lot of tutus for goofing around with my girlfriends at festivals, charity bike rides, 5Ks, etc.  This is one of the nicer ones I have purchased, and definitely one of the least expensive.  It was a perfect length and the material wasn't scratching. The only drawback is that I ordered a black tutu, and the waistband was white. (Thus only 4 stars) Thankfully I was wearing a black tank top with it, and it masked it a little bit."
4.0,"Nice , for the price."
4.0,"Solid wallet overall, it is a little on the wider side in comparison to what I have been used to but the wallet is sleak and has a number of pockets. The leather is good quality and has that rustic look I was going for as well. It did take a while to ship but not long enough enough to not be satisfied. The price is on point and the quality is great."
4.0,"I ordered a Medium and Large  because ordering a swimsuit online can be tricky. I am 5'3, 137lbs, 36B and kept the Large. Either size suit is cheeky, but the Large felt like it fit my torso length better, slightly loose but at least not pulling down. Cute suit, excited to take this on vacation."
4.0,"Not sure if it shrunk a little bit after the first wash, but it was a little small on me. It is a nice shirt though. Will just buy XL from here out."
4.0,"Very nice nose rings. I really like that the click closed, and you don't have to struggle to bend the ring, or fight with a screw post. Very comfortable. Can't even feel that they're in."
4.0,"I got the smallest necklace. It's very cute and dainty. The chain is pretty thin, but its held up well so far.<br />Would be a great gift."
4.0,"I'm 5'2, I DON'T have a large head, it was tight but the MASK looked great with my costume....if you have THICK HAIR or really long hair, you may HAVE an extremely difficult time wearing this mask. I have a short natural afro."
4.0,"Gift for my cousin! She absolutely loved it! Said it fit a little tight, but she liked everything else."
4.0,This dress fit perfect and was the exact style I was looking for. It is really low cut so you can't wear a bra but has great coverage so no slips will happen . I also don't have big breast so that helps. For those with bigger breast I may stray away from this dress. The material is stiff and doesn't give on the top of the dress. The bottom half of the dress is roomy and flowy. I was worried about the length being too short but it was past my ankles.
4.0,"5'5&#34; 170lbs bought an xl. Very cute dress. The pink was pale, which I preffered, but shimmery and flowy and cathes your eye. It's definitely a shorter cut dress, but that was expected. Arms were a little tight, but not unbearable, and I also have larger arms, so that is something I deal with normally. Could be worn with leggings as an alternative outfit too!"
4.0,Arrived on time good quality look just like picture but need to order one size up to small
4.0,Pretty true to size but maybe a little large. Kind of a silky slippery material.
4.0,Very soft and comfortable fabric.  The color and pattern is bright and very pretty!
4.0,"great with turtle necks, I had to pick a lot of extra beads off to make it lay flat. It was also a good bit smaller than I imagined."
4.0,"I had previously given a low rating for this because when I transferred my device to the band, it refused to sink. After going through a reboot everything works now. I do like the convenience of the clasp which is much easier than the one Fitbit uses. It fits my Flex perfectly and I love the extra colors"
4.0,"Quality is great, but runs about a size behind. I bought a size larger to have it looser, so I didn‚Äôt have to return them for being too small."
4.0,"I ordered the short mesh tights, but I recieved the long ones. I'll keep them and reorder the short ones again,  hopefully they don't mess up on that order"
4.0,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and about 135 pounds; I ordered the size 6-8, which seems to be the correct size for me. If anything, it might be looser than I am used to.<br /><br />This swimsuit is fully lined in the front. The front has the appearance of being a tankini, but it is a one piece. What I mean by this is that there is an opening where the bottom of a tankini top would be. When pulled up, the white lining is exposed. The swimsuit is true to the pin up style and provides me with modest coverage while still being sexy and flattering. The bust is lined and has molded cups that give the appearance of lifting without actually lifting. Larger chested women may not find this offering enough support. Sometimes I like to wear silicone inserts, but this swimsuit does not have the opening to insert them inside the layers of fabric (it would be rather easy to make those slits, however). I don‚Äôt have much in the rear end area and this suit is a little loose at the bottom. It‚Äôs actually more comfortable this way, but it does need to be readjusted. The seams are done well and fabric is silky and comfortable. I do think this suit helps to disguise my ‚Äúmommy tummy,‚Äù and I would feel comfortable wearing it at the pool or at the beach.<br /><br />I received this swimsuit for free in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not obligated to write a favorable review. I have used this product myself, and all words in this review are my own."
4.0,Works for what I wanted it for
4.0,"The sunglasses arrived two days earlier than expected which is always a pleasant surprise. They seem to be good enough quality especially for the price and they arrived in a cloth case inside a tight fitting box to prevent braking and scratching. They are definitely polarized but not the best polarized glasses I've worn but hey, they're only $5 a pair. I mostly wanted a cheap pair of polarized sunglasses that I can just toss in my purse or wouldn't care if they got damaged or lost, and these are perfect."
4.0,Great fit. Wish these also would have come in blue or faded.
4.0,Used for a felt dog paw craft.  Also made earrings & a necklace
4.0,"Meh, ok it is a little pricey for just one headband.  Maybe some wristbands for the same price and it's ok"
4.0,"The material is very soft and light. The colors match the picture. Unfortunately, it was too big for me. I am 5ft 120lbs. So i had to return this item because it is one size."
4.0,"I wore this top with a long black skirt to take some formal pictures, and it looked beautiful! My only complaint is that the material was a little scratchy, especially on my neck. Also, as a small-chested person (32B), I wish I could have worn some kind of strapless pushup bra with it, but you really can't wear anything under this. For this reason, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is small-chested and self-conscious of their size OR for anyone larger who would require support."
4.0,"They do fit, but they are a smidge snug around the legs."
4.0,"Love the style, I should have ordered smaller. Will buy again!"
4.0,Like it over all
4.0,Nice Dress.  Material not as expected but fine for the price.
4.0,My only complaint is that it's a little small. I would order a size up. Other than that it's comfortable. Perfect for summer time or just lounging around the house.
4.0,I like that I can decide on how loose or tight I want to wear it. It hangs nicelyaround my neck
4.0,Works great for a costume I put together. :)
4.0,It is a good inexpensive gift as joke for people you work with or if your a Raven fan. Fast service
4.0,"They do look pretty much like pastel Ronald McDonald shoes. Cute, especially on a little kid. They have a very nice gripping foot sole, which since my Granddaughter is walking on hardwood floors is a great feature. Those bottoms would be a must, I would think, if you are dealing with tile flooring. They are fairly heavy knit and so are nice a warm.  Basically they are a very heavily bottomed knit sock. They stay up about as well as a knit sock too, so you will be pulling them up every now and then. I'm no expert in what a child needs on their feet to learn to walk, but these seems rather like a barefoot style walker--kind of a kid version of what the barefoot runners use.  I suspect this is better than sticking them in non-flexible sole shoes which seems to make them pretty unbalanced. They soles are thick enough you could easily use them outside for what little walking a toddler actually does outside. A toddler can also pull them off quicker than it takes to type this--which is why I gave it a four.<br /><br /> I received this at a discounted price with the agreement to evaluate it.  Whether I give a good or rotten evaluation has no impact on my receiving other such discounted offers so my evaluations are totally honest. Believe me, I‚Äôve used that 1 star rating a few times now! (Some of these ‚Äúdiscounted deals‚Äù are just rip-offs which really pisses me off.) The only difference between this review and what I normally review is that generally I wait a couple of weeks before posting an evaluation but with discounted stuff I‚Äôve agreed to do the review in three days.  Which is why I frequently revisit these reviews and add information that only time can give."
4.0,Bought it for my husband he wears it every day really good quality for the price. Really cool cross :) thanks
4.0,Need a size up
4.0,"For the money,this wallett aerves the purpose"
4.0,Nice cover up but runs really small. I will be returning due to this.
4.0,"La apariencia es buena, lindo dise√±o y los n√∫meros son grandes, a mi sobrina le encanto y lo usa a diario, hasta el momento todo funciona y va bien."
4.0,My husband is 6'3&#34;-6'4&#34; and these were a good 4 inches too long when I got them.  However they're still a great material to wear and he loves them even if they are long.
4.0,"Wore these daily on a river trip.  Kids' socks showed wear, mine stayed nice.  Saved my feet."
4.0,"Kinda cool, not too small for Fatty (me)--is only as long as a t shirt. will barely cover the butt."
4.0,"I have used this once, it is priced right, classy, simple, I like this good initial quality."
4.0,Nice wallet edges start to wear soon but not that bad at all still a really good money clip I'm happy with it
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I received this. So very soft and just the right thickness. Appears to be well madeüëç I cant wait to give it to my teen daughter for Christmasüíö I would definitely recommend this....
4.0,"Love the way it fits. Comfortable flows well, the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is because the pockets stick out and make it look funny. But if you pull up the skirt part to your waistline it hides it very well."
4.0,"It's a little more boxy than it looks in the picture, because the fabric isn't stretchy, but it looks nice and is easy to wear.  The pearl beads on the front tend to drag the neck forward by their weight-- I might remove them for that reason, but it's a pretty blouse."
4.0,"Belt is actually nice for the price, includes a hole punch and instructions for cutting down length of belt, Kind of like Camp Crafts. Would buy again."
4.0,It‚Äôs. Mask
4.0,"It's cute although the shoes are too big. She'll just have to wear the outfit with out them. The Reds on the stockings, bow and dress were a little off but no big deal because you can't really tell in the pictures only up close in person.  Overall it's a cute little dress and everyone thought she looked adorable in her pictures. She's 4 1/2 months and I purchased the 3-6 M"
4.0,super elegant and light
4.0,"It is fine, it's a headband and does what it should do."
4.0,The fit is a little small. I ordered I size larger.
4.0,"These fit really well and I had a fun time using natural dye on one of them so far. I was disappointed that they aren't GOTs or Oeko-Tek certified, which is why I just ordered the white and will try dying them myself, and which is why I only gave them 4 stars."
4.0,Got this for my spouse starting a new job to put on keys to remind them that I love and support them. The link broke about a month in but I was able to repair it.
4.0,"The good news? The necklace is beautiful.<br />The bad news? I was sent a different necklace than the one pictured. Instead of receiving the Banks mixed coin lariat, I received another necklace from the Banks collection.  The seller needs to be more careful about how they package their products! The packaging actually had the correct label on it, so whoever is responsible for packaging doesn‚Äôt know their inventory very well."
4.0,"Really cute, but expensive compared to what you can get it for at the manufacturer website. Some reviews spoke to the battery being white and not blending in, my plan was to use a black sharpie on it, but ours were black so no issue. Would order again, but not through amazon due to price."
4.0,"Very cute outfit.  Just FYI, not a onesie."
4.0,The fabric I is very soft.  Good strong elastic at waist.  Not for dressing up but great for quick trips to town and lounging around.  Certainly worth what I paid.
4.0,My 7 year old wanted a 'hot magenta' choker for Christmas. Though I was not sure what color that was this hit the mark. Exactly what she wanted. Delivery took a bit long but still arrived in time for Christmas.
4.0,"i like it and it looks good. it fits according to the size sheet but for people with higher arches, it does not provide support there"
4.0,It's thin but my husband likes it.
4.0,Fits perfect and I like the open back to show off my cool sports bra.
4.0,Nice material. Little clingy at the midsection after washing.
4.0,It was beautiful. The hook was oddly shaped though.
4.0,"hugs every bump and roll o have, not flattering on me, I am returning it. It runs small too."
4.0,I love sharks and these are so cute. I always get such cute compliments for them
4.0,the Glasses are excellent but the cleaning cloth was not there !
4.0,This case basically just slipped over the back of my phone and barely goes around the sides to the front of it. It almost looked like it wasn't going to fit right when I put it on and I wasn't sure that it would stay on properly. But I've been using it for months now without a problem and it's stood up to multiple bumps without an issue as well as a few minor falls. The design is also beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.
4.0,I like the way it fits. I will wear it to church.
4.0,"Really nice and good quality just a bit big, I'm 5'2 and 160lbs"
4.0,"It's true to size not too small not to large, it's just right. Also this has the same quality of North Face or possibly better."
4.0,My wife likes it but order a size smaller then what you think you need. It dies look good
4.0,Nice and compact easy to put away
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; and 180lbs and normally a size 12 tall in most jeans. I ordered an x-large in olive and they fit. The waist hits right at my belly button and the ankles are just a little higher for me. I have pretty thick thighs and more narrow hips. For me, the crotch is slouchy but the butt is fitted. They are tight in the thighs (the fabric has enough stretch for comfort) and then baggier at the claves. I dig em. I like how the fabric sits but I deducted one star due to how scratchy it is."
4.0,Didn‚Äôt think I would like this bikini as much as I do but wow I love it! I will say though that it is a good thing that it has strings for the bottoms because they are not very small but they work fine once you tie them tight enough. I get lots of compliments on it as well. I also want to make sure to point out that if you are not comfortable with more of a thong type bikini then I would not recommend.
4.0,Love these goggles!  They fit great over my eye glasses.  Only complaint is the strap on one of the sides comes undone often.
4.0,Teeny tiny. Order up a size or two!
4.0,It was a little smaller than I though bit a very pretty stone
4.0,AND IT LASTS A GOOD WHILE SO IF YOU HAVE SILVER OR GOLD THIS CLOTH REALLY SHINES  THEM VERY NICELY
4.0,They were a little small but good for a party favors!! Everyone like them.
4.0,Color is beautiful but it is small
4.0,I like it but it is a tad bit small.
4.0,Very cute Christmas dress
4.0,"Scratchy material. Woven material so you have to wear a shirt underneath. Otherwise, colors match picture."
4.0,"Cute dress, runs a bit on the small side.  I would definitely order a size up if you're well endowed up top.  I'm a  34/36 D/DD and it's a bit snug through the bust."
4.0,I'm very happy with this buy. I actually bought it as a dress for me to come home in after I have my baby. I figured it would be comfortable and cool. So it's actually a little bigger than I would normally buy but for the purpose I am buying it for it fits great.
4.0,Good Quality. Fit my Daughter well and looks really slimming with the design.
4.0,"These sweats are nice but over priced. They are comfortable and soft but could have bought the same thing at Walmart for 5 bucks! But, overall they are nice!"
4.0,Great dress but does dip lower in the front than expected for had to be pinned.
4.0,"The cat is adorable and bigger then I thought it would be.  The chain is horrible but wasn't expecting much for .99 cents. But the cat alone is worth it, going to buy a new chain for it."
4.0,Cute commodity<br />Moves by any ones voice though<br />Fits well<br />Good quality material
4.0,"I bought a heather gray t shirt. I loved the look of this shirt. The patch is heavier, seems to be good quality, and has held up through several washes. This seems to be a unisex sized shirt. It definitely isn't fitted like a woman's shirt and the sleeve length seems to be unisex. However the length on the torso of the shirt of the shirt seems slightly shorter than most unisex shirts. There is no stretch in the shirt. So if you teetering between two sizes, size up."
4.0,"Love the color, doesn‚Äôt look cheap... why did I think three zippers worked?"
4.0,Came in cute packaging and love the set
4.0,Nice boot just did not like the texture
4.0,I have been on a search for more comfortable underwear.  These aren't the most comfortable but they are not the worst.  I wear them several days a week and I have no complaints.
4.0,It's really cute but the downside is how short it is.
4.0,"These are super cute!  I would say the small fits like a 2. The fabric is great as well, very dense without a ton of stretch to providemore structure."
4.0,Muy lindo le hace honor a la foto
4.0,This is a nice camisole and the color is very pretty. My only issue is that it's a bit on the short side.
4.0,good product for a good price
4.0,Love these! Perfect size for nail art!
4.0,"very light weight, I was expecting something of better quality"
4.0,Just arrived. They look great.
4.0,Super cute!! Love it! I would give 5 stars but haven‚Äôt had it but maybe a week.
4.0,"The ring is very pretty, but keep in mind that it is thin and fragile.  I love it, but I don't wear it while doing housework or playing with my son.  It's worn when I don't have to worry about breaking it."
4.0,A pretty dress for Christmas. I would say fits pretty close to size. I'm 5'4&#34; and it his me right at the knee. I'm going to be very careful when washing it though. The quality seems so-so.
4.0,"I've been shopping and buying armor and medieval items and i took a chance on this item to see what inexpensive chain mail might bring. The specs i read when i ordered disappeared soon afterward, replaced by a ""report incorrect product information"" tag.<br /><br />I thought it said made of steel originally.<br /><br />Well, it's not, its aluminum.<br /><br />Reading reviews i saw all sorts of comments  that indicated to me this would be butted ring chain mail. The photo isn't clear but that's kinda what it looked like. Some said it was aluminum.<br /><br />I read most of the reviews and it looks to me like there is inconsistency on the product received.<br /><br />That said, Im very happy with what i received with this combo round/flat RIVETED replica (see photo). It's lost 3 rings only so far, and its  half the weight of the real steel haubergeon i recently purchased. It came coated in black dusty grime but after a simple green wash it gleams like silver.  It fits me perfectly (im medium), not too difficult to get on and off once you learn the method. I only paid $51 dollars with my amazon rewards, so im thrilled to have this perfect LARP, cosplay chain mail for the price.<br /><br />I hope you get the same item."
4.0,"The material wasnt what I epected, but that was my fault for not reading the entire description. Aside from that it was a great.!"
4.0,"Even though I've sized up, is still fitted, I prefer my cardis relaxed. Great quality, love the style, the color is darker than the photo."
4.0,"Nice hat, little small for my liking"
4.0,I think all the kids loved this toy.  It held their interest for more than 5 minutes and gives them the challenge of reading instructions and completing the procedures to make and remake the different types of lightsabers... All in all a great toy and I highly recommend it.
4.0,Great price for the amount. The only thing is the material might rub skin if where all day long. I wouldnt recommend working out in them.
4.0,Cute and comfortable. A bit shorter than I expected.
4.0,"Nice texture, kinda shapeless-but hey its a poncho -what would you expect?"
4.0,Keeps hand warm even in the coldest part of the night
4.0,Still to small?
4.0,I wish there was more red . It looked less rainbow and more greenish blue than a rainbow.
4.0,I always wear a size 7 and that's what I ordered and they are too small. I'm having to return them and get a size 8.
4.0,"waaay to small...but i am a 38 C. gave it to my gf who is an A, fits her perfectly. otherwise i wouldve loved it"
4.0,"They are very pretty and they don‚Äôt look chip at all.  Good material, price unbeatable.<br />I would recommend them for various uses: on scarfs, hats, open sweaters, or just as a discreet accent on a jacket collar..."
4.0,"1st, the shipping for this product was faster than I expected which I was really happy about. The material is quality and seems it will last a while.it is exactly as pictured and super cute. Knocked one star off bc the fit was a tiny bit smaller than I hoped for but still looks good. Will be wearing this for my beach trip!"
4.0,This is a pretty dress and the material is what you would expect. Just beware that the dress runs a little small.
4.0,"I bought this to go with the yellow Belle gown with tiny red roses, it's a perfect match. The way the tiara is designed it should fit just about any little girl. When it arrived it was quite bent out of shape but took just a few minutes to straighten out."
4.0,"Nice shades, not very sophisticated, yet, its a nice everyday pair"
4.0,Band color wasn't as pictured. But still a great product
4.0,They fit as expected. Their light as a feather. They are waterproof as described. Perfect to fit warm clothes underneath in colder weather and durable. Comfortable.
4.0,Great specks
4.0,"It's a good band. A bit thinner than Apple's leather bands, but still good quality. I bought it to match my authentic saddle brown iPhone 7 Plus case, buy the color is just a bit off. Therefore I removed 1 star. Otherwise, a solid purchase."
4.0,"I order two sizes larger than what I normally wear because I like having loose-fitting clothing.  The shirt is very soft and comfortable to wear but it is tighter in the hips than I would like.  The shirt has a darker band around the neck, arms, and waist.  I wish they had the measurements of the waist listed on the description as well."
4.0,I like these pants but the sizing is off....for me...my but is extra meaty so I guess that‚Äôs my fault but decent items!
4.0,"The pants are comfortable and the length is good. I am 5:7 and they fit well. The material is comfortable, but the white is a little see through. I just have to wear longer shirts and be careful with the panty colors!!"
4.0,"Nice play jacket for the price. The collar does not pop like shown in the picture. Definitely a t-shirt, jeans, and tennis shoes type of jacket."
4.0,"It fit under my seat perfectly, glad I ordered it."
4.0,First let me talk about how soft these are...OMG!!! I mean buttery soft. They have a nice drawstring so you can adjust the fit around the waist and that‚Äôs a plus but I needed no adjusting for myself as they fit straight out of the package. Also these have POCKETS!!! Definitely winning with the pockets. I love pockets. The most beautiful part about these are although they are labeled as ‚Äúyoga pants‚Äù I can see myself slipping into these for a day at the office. Like...WOW the comfort and functionality of these pants. All good stuff... now to the not so good (and this is my personal opinion). Now this may have to do more with my size than the product itself. I did experience some riding up when I walked and I absolutely HATE that but it‚Äôs the reason I took away a star. That and the fact that they weren‚Äôt long enough ( again this may have to do with my body type as I am a little hippy and thick in the thighs). Not an absolute deal breaker. Just for reference I am 5‚Äô7 and 193 pounds is that helps anyone.
4.0,"Fits well, very light, works as deigned."
4.0,"This is a very cute, little girls romper style out fit.  The color is very bold.  The color is must better than the color in the picture.  This outfit has an elastic waistband.  It is well made.  It has cute little fringe balls around each leg.  The fringe around of each leg does not exactly match the material in the used in the romper.  The romper is a is a darker, deeper pink and the fringe is a hot pink.  It also comes with a headband.  It is a really cute head band.  It also does not match the outfit too well.  The band of the headband is a light pink and the bow is another shade of pink that does not match either pink in the romper.  I does not look too bad when wearing it with the romper.  It is very cute to wear with another outfit.  I received this item for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"1/2 sizes would be so good.  The first pair too small, the second way too large.  I like the sandal so well-just hoping he grows into it before it‚Äôs too late to wear them."
4.0,Very nice shade of red. Ordered size up as per other ratings so fit is good.  Good summer weight.  Works well for by need
4.0,"Fit is slight off but other than that we like it.<br />The leg arra stitching was slightly loose, concerned it would show too much in swim class, after a wash it shrunk just a tad and made it work.. Child loves it and one of her favorite swimsuits."
4.0,Didn't realize that I had to buy the clips for the shoes.<br />Otherwise they are great
4.0,Good quality shoelaces for the price. Also the seller was very helpful which made a difference for online shopping experience.
4.0,"Fit well, falls nicely but zipper is a bit sticky. Will use as a pull-on skirt instead."
4.0,These are exactly like pictures..delivery was on point..but we're toooo small!..
4.0,I didn't dislike their rings they were just smaller than what I thought but that was my fault that I didn't check into it further but no the service was fine the delivery was fine they are just what I wanted just a little too small everything that you done was right on thank you
4.0,"Liked this cover up very much, however it was chilly on the cruise and I didn't get to use it."
4.0,Just tried it on and it fits nice. Covers my tummy like I was hoping decent material might have to wear a slip bc it looks a bit see through even with the slip. Highly recommend not sure how it will wash bit def wouldn‚Äôt dry it in machine
4.0,Cute.nice color
4.0,This hat was cute!! Also better quality than i was expecting.  It is a thick knit :)
4.0,These are cute and look handmade.  Nice quality and are truly waterproof.  Thank you.
4.0,Its very nice design very thin material
4.0,A couple were torn and worn in areas but otherwise good product
4.0,"I purchased it for my boyfriend, he liked it and it fit! Score for me!!"
4.0,"Had it before, great leather- buckle im not to sure it would last before the leather wears out. My last one buckle split apart"
4.0,Really cute necklace. It‚Äôs on a short chain and isn‚Äôt of the best quality but looks nice and for the price I‚Äôm not mad
4.0,It is what I need to wear around the house. Like the pockets.
4.0,Should double the fabric on the back of the dress like the front. If you don't have a beautiful butt. It's not for you.
4.0,My sons gave me this as a Mother's day gift and it is a very nice bag. It is roomy and can fit every basic need to go in a med size purse. I  went and bought the key chain that matches the bag. Nice.
4.0,This dress is perfect and exactly what I was hoping for!! I bought it for my elopement and it‚Äôs just what I had in mind! I did have to buy a slip to go underneath it because the solid part under the lace is straight up see through (why I‚Äôm only leaving 4 stars) but overall I LOVE IT!
4.0,"The bracelet  comes packaged in a little suede-like bag - no box.  So when I received it,  it was a little bent and looked very small.  Once I bent it back into place, it really is quite pretty.  Similar to a beaded bangle<br /><br />It will fit most women easily.  I do wish it had a little clasp to keep the bracelet on.  The way it is,  if I brush against something, it could fall off."
4.0,I HATE buying products like this that I would normally try on first. In this case the glasses are GREAT! I think they are ever so slightly too big on MY face but they aren't ridiculous and are comfortable to wear for long periods. Love the wood accents (I got the wood with orange lens) People WILL try to &#34;borrow&#34; these!! :)
4.0,"This is a really great product. I've been wanting to get a septum piercing for awhile, but I didn't exactly know how it would look on me, so I decided to get one that doesn't require piercing first. Best. Decision. Ever. I bought two of these, and the shipping was very fast. Also, to my surprise, I got one for free! (I don't know if that happens when you buy more than two or just because you have to pay so much for shipping... Don't forget to check the shipping price first btw). These do tickle my nose a bit, but I believe it's just because things aren't usually in that area."
4.0,Like them. Although they fog up.
4.0,My only issue is they are to small at top for me would like them wider
4.0,Ok this shirt pleasantly surprised me! As soon as I put it on it felt nice. Great material but I would advice doing too much moving cus it was just a tad bit hot. The sleeves were convertible and could be long or short sleeved. Looked perfect with my white cargo fitted pants. I'm very curvy in the back and I liked this shirt covered up my curves without being too long.
4.0,Did what it should. It was huge on my 3yo though
4.0,Love the colors. They seemed kind of stiff but were quite comfortable when I wore them.
4.0,Perfect for my 5th grader.  She loves how light they are.  As expected Nike works great for narrow feet.  They are plastic - so if they get wet they really smell.
4.0,"This dress fits a little short on me (I'm 5'6"", 140 lbs, 28 waist, 36C bust; ordered a size 6). I am wearing it to work today and the dress is shorter than I expected, so the side slit is riding up a little higher than I would like it to, but the rest of the dress fits well, so ordering a size up would not help."
4.0,Perfect minus I had to take in the elastic so it would fit me
4.0,"Great watch after you get the pins out, the pins can be a struggle to remove."
4.0,It is the look I'm looking for but it is a gift for my mother for Christmas so I will not be able to know how it functions well after December. My mother loves owls. Thank you.
4.0,"These look great and are comfortable for the most part.<br /><br />The seam that runs below the waistband across the backside makes me think my underwear is slipping down and I'm always trying to pull these up. Yeah I'm a weirdo for wearing underwear with these. Even if I didn't, the seam would bother me.<br /><br />I'm still wearing them, I'll just be thinking about my underwear constantly while I do. They look nice."
4.0,Cute! Can't go wrong for the price.
4.0,"Good purchase if you are looking for something with the extra length.  I am tall so I am always looking for a shawl over 33 inches long, because anything shorter does  not drape down over my rear and hips  It‚Äôs  got just enough silk and cashmere to make it not scratchy, and somewhat of soft, but the majority of the knit is  a polyester or something similar  ( I detest shawls that make you feel all  itchy).  I like it because it could dress up an outfit or look great with jeans around a campfire.  It‚Äôs a nice lap blanket,  cape and can cover your whole torso, under armpits to knees in in an emergency  like answering your door  in a hotel or cruise cabin.<br />I think it‚Äôs over priced at 42.00,  a good price would be 29.00  or close to it.  However I bought it just because of the increased length.  I might even buy another cooler because it‚Äôs interchangeable with so many things.  Overall I‚Äôm happy with my purchase,  but would rather see it priced a bit lower."
4.0,"Review of: Hicomlor Compression Socks, Grey<br /><br />These look, in real life, exactly as they do on the sales page.<br />They were a bit larger (longer) than expected which is not bad for me and could be beneficial for tall people. If you‚Äôre shorter than average you may want to order a size down.<br /><br />These socks compress, seriously! Getting them on your feet will be a bit of a challenge, as it should be for socks that offer so much compression.<br /><br />The one thing that concerned me is that there was a bit of piling, after just one wear, you can just about make it out on the sock at the top of the picture in the light grey circle.<br /><br />Still, not bad at all. I‚Äôm removing one star for the piling and for them being larger than I think that they should be, but these will definitely do the job for you.<br /><br />Recommended"
4.0,"First, I will start out with the positive that this is a cute shirt. I love the tied look in the front. It's not really tied, it's sewn that way so you don't have to worry about it coming undone or getting messed up in the wash. I did order a medium per the chart and it was a little big for me. I will keep it and wear a cami underneath. I also ordered the ""pink"" color. It isn't a solid color and I wouldn't call it pink. It is more of a peach color with white streaks through it.  I attached a photo to try to show the color. Overall, it is a cute shirt which I will keep versus the trouble of sending it back, however, I think I would have ordered a different color had I known this wasn't a true pink color."
4.0,A little big but look pretty decent.
4.0,I liked these earrings and the way they went up my entire lobe. You need to press the back of the earring to secure it to your ear. I gave these 4 stars since they tend to rotate in the hole and I had to keep checking whether they were in the correct position. When they are in correctly they are very cute and simple.
4.0,"To be honest the fit is on the ok side but the material is not good it's a bit thin, I'm trying to love the outfit but can't sorry."
4.0,This men's apron is funny and cute to have for any man who wants to wear it in the kitchen to cook. This apron has a nice basic design and is of good quality.
4.0,"I really like this bracelet, and yes it looks really stylish my only problem with this was it is like a millimeter to small for my husbands arm. I would recommend this but make sure you measure his wrist before you order it."
4.0,Run very narrow - my daughter did not like the fit at all
4.0,I didn't realize how short this dress would be.  The material is lovely.  I took it out of the little bag it came in and it was nearly wrinkle free.  The color was what I expected.  I'm just not a short dress person.  I might wear it around the house.
4.0,Great detail and design.<br />well worth the money
4.0,"Very durable, no issues yet. Levels actually work pretty well and are solid convo starter at work.  Surprised I didnt find this in yellow liquid as that is the standard color."
4.0,I was given this product at a discount for my honest opinion. This outfit is amazing. I am a size 8 and ordered a size 10.<br />I do think I know where the sizing issue may come up for some. According to the measurement chart that the company give us to go by I should have ordered a size 1X  I ordered a 10 after reading others reviews on here I feel dressed up but like I am also wearing really comfortable pajamas. I plan on ordering 2 more. The quality of the fabric feels like cotton bed sheets. I am very satisfied with this dress as it will last a few years.
4.0,I like it's softness
4.0,"Was looking for and found socks with' a little flair' as opposed to solid colors. Fit well. Will have to update later on life span , wear & tear."
4.0,It‚Äôs really sexy and comfortable as well I bought 5 packs one after the other but stitching üßµ was coming off so I don‚Äôt know<br />Over all if stitching is right ... I would buy the same all the time ...<br />love the style
4.0,This is a cute suit but I would recommend sizing up. The top is okay but the shorts were very small and short on me so I ended ordering a different pair to wear with the top.
4.0,The only thing I didn't like about the robe is that it didn't have the ribbon on the inside to keep it closed.  I sewed one in - problem solved!
4.0,"This is not a bad set but they are much smaller than I thought they were going to be. We are taking a much needed vacation next month and I thought these would be great for keeping some &#34;odds and ends&#34; in them so they don't get lost in my suitcase. Well, they don't hold much. I have packed some pain patches in the largest one, for my back. They are individually wrapped so the outer packaging makes them a bit big. I was able to fit ten of them in the largest one. The medium one I am using to put in a microfiber towel for using in the car. It folds very small so it does fit into this one nicely. I have not yet figured out what to use the smallest one for as it is very small. Maybe cash or a small sewing kit or small and basic.first aid kit would work for it. I ordered the pink set and although I am not a big fan of pink, I thought it would work well for finding them quickly in my suitcase. Plus my husband will not be so apt to &#34;steal&#34; them from me LOL. Each bag comes with a clip attached to it. Not really sure what I would attach them to but it could be handy if you can think of something to use it for. The bags are well constructed and seem to be very durable. I have not tried the waterproof part but they are pretty thick so I think you will get at least some protection from moisture.  My fault for not reading the size description better. Overall very good bags and will be useful for me."
4.0,"not sure its the best deal, quality is just ok."
4.0,"Fits fine,  Just a misjudgement in ordering the stripes.  I am a larger person so it makes me look huge, but I guess no larger than I am. lol"
4.0,"Great for a beachy look, awesome case, a little storage bag, a cleaning cloth.  They feel very comfortable, lightweight and well made.  I love the bright lenses against the dark frame and wood ear pieces. Overall a really cool set of shades. Get ready for compliments."
4.0,I purchased this to have the clip to carry it on my lanyard and it comes in handy because I use my glasses for driving and it's always on hand where I need it and won't lose it more important. Took my grandmother with me last week on a day trip and she saw my case and was really into it. I showed her the huge pull out cleaning cloth inside and now I'm ordering her one too. It's definitely one of my favorite carry options for my glasses. Color wise I wish I chose something other than white but I had to get the Cali flag to rep my state but I am messy so it did get some stains but I think it will take to a wash with no issues so I'm not worried. These would make great stocking stuffers or small gifts for somebody who needs a nice way to carry their glasses. The clip is what really what made it a solid option for me though.
4.0,"I bought this for my baby shower and it hugs my bump perfectly! Such a pretty dress. Only hard part is keeping the top part flattering. If you have a bigger chest, I definitely suggest a strapless push up. Keeps the design of it in place! Overall, I love!!"
4.0,"This is a cute shirt. I personally don't think it has enough stretch and it definitely isn't fleece. I would call it a run of the mill t-shirt with stars. The stars printed on are shiny, so it looks sort of cheap...not the best quality. It isn't oversize. I would call it true to size, a bit on the slim fit side of things. I don't love it or hate it. I'll probably keep it as a wearing at home type of shirt but on the whole I'm not thrilled with the quality of texture."
4.0,"seems like a quality product. the depth of the hat is a little deeper than i expected. originally purchased for my nephew, but according to him, it was too big, so i just kept it."
4.0,"I bought these gloves to wear during cold weather when riding my motorcycle. I had an opportunity to try them out just a few days ago. I wanted gloves that would work with touch screens because I have both a touch screen cell phone and GPS unit that are mounted to the handle bars. Of course, I ordered the gloves based on the measurement around my hand as shown in the sizing instructions; however, I find that the thumb and all the fingers on each glove are about an inch too long. That makes it tough to operate the touch screens or flip switches while riding. They are very warm and comfortable otherwise, but the fingers are simply too long for me. I'm 6'4"" and have large hands, too, so it's not like I have abnormally short fingers."
4.0,"Not highest quality material, but looks great for a one night event!  Love it!"
4.0,Great Faja just runs extremely small. Order three sizes up.
4.0,Great dress fits as expected.
4.0,"The dress is cute and appears to be well made. It is a bit plain though. For the price of the costume, I would have liked matching hair bows to be included."
4.0,"So stretchy and comfortable. Feels like I‚Äôm wearing nothing. The fit is pretty good. I ordered an xlarge but should have ordered large. Fits my body shape (very curvy) through the legs, hips, and butt without stretching too much. Only issue is the xlarge is too big around my waist so they slide down lots throughout the day. I plan to order a large and hope that size fits nice at my waist. I normally wear an xlarge in other yoga/exercise pants. My measurements are approx 34ddd-26-42."
4.0,They were nice but too expensive
4.0,durable and biker looking.  Magnetic clasp help tight.  Wore it all day all night and it wasn't cumbersome on my wrist.  Like the quality of it.
4.0,That is a slip that is under the lace dress. So you have the slip and then the lace dress.
4.0,I love the look and feel of this purse. You can see the quality put into the making of the bag. My only complaint is that I wish I could have purchase the same design in a medium size bag. I looked and cannot find the same design in a larger bag. I just like it so much I want two sizes now.
4.0,Very warm and well made. The only complaint is the bottom hem on the top rolls upward when sitting or moving.
4.0,Got these because the strap keepers on my smart watch broke off. These are quite a bit thinner but way more flexible than the factory ones from the LG. Doubt these will last as long as the originals they're replacing but they were easy to install and the pack contains enough for maybe a couple years of daily use.<br />I'd like them to be thicker and a little stiffer for longevity and not having to adjust the keepers every couple of moments.
4.0,"I am enjoying wearing this tunic blouse.  It fit as expected, although I did order as large a size as I could.  My only comment there is that although the body of the blouse is amply sized, the sleeves fit just a trifle tightly.  It drapes beautifully and, paired with leggings or any other sort of pants or slacks or jeans, it's a great addition to my wardrobe.  I'm glad I bought it."
4.0,"Fits great, the material is a little thinner than I was planning on but also flattering at the same time.. I'm happy with my purchase"
4.0,Very nice umbrella. Easy open and close. The size is much larger than a ‚Äúpersonal umbrella‚Äù. It also has a very good slope - like u could get under it and not get your shoulders or purse wet. It is a bright yellow. On my computer didn‚Äôt look that way but I‚Äôm keeping. I would give 5 stars if I could put it back in the cover sleeve easier. That requires a lot of pushing down which makes me feel like I‚Äôll break it.
4.0,Sizing in inches is not accurate. I‚Äôm pregnant and measured my waist at 37 inches at this point so I ordered the 40 inch waist because I figured I would grow a few inches by the time I need these pants (two weeks). I got the 40 inch pants today and they were pretty tight around my 37 inch belly. There‚Äôs no way I would be able to wear them in two weeks.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:9fa554c5d0da0d71d89cb799a339085c]] Over all solid back pack for price and weight.
4.0,not so bad for the price..got a very good deal. I bought two one for myself and for sister in law however the other one quality is poor but I cannot complain for it really cheap.
4.0,I love it I just came in really small packaging and I almost threw it out when I didn‚Äôt find it in the box
4.0,"Pros:<br />- Leather looks and feels great.<br />- Comfortable to carry.<br />- Well constructed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Leather is easily scarred/ scratched (Will not rip though)<br />- Credit card holder is useless. Who puts their CC in these things? I'd rather see another pocket for storage.<br />- Non-adjustable laptop pouch.<br /><br />Overall it is durable, but it will get a distressed look over time due to the leather so easily scarred."
4.0,It fits really snug. You could actually see my lips when talking. The advantages are it doesn't fog up my glasses and you could breathe easier in it.
4.0,"It's comfy and kind of stylish, but I don't think I can wear it and go to work. (I'm a teacher.) The material is soft, airy, and rather thin. I decided to use it as a loungewear or pajama trouser."
4.0,"Love the neck cut of the dress, and it‚Äôs a good length, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and a small cake just below my knees. Only caution is that there aren‚Äôt any actual pleats worked into the skirt lining, it‚Äôs just folds that are very easy to iron out."
4.0,This pajama set is very nice and beautiful. I would definitely recommend you buying this set
4.0,My son loved his ring
4.0,"I bought an XL for my sister who is normally an XL/2XL. I could immediately tell they were very small. So I asked my mom, who is a medium/large to try them on and they are almost too tight on her. I just gave them to her and now will have to buy from somewhere else as I‚Äôm sure an XXL will not fit."
4.0,Size is ok and is cute but is smaller than it looks. Is kind of a pinky ring.
4.0,i got it for my lil sis and she loves it but didnt fit as expected but since its batman she still loves it
4.0,Fits great  and  its comfortable
4.0,I bought this shirt as a gift.  It did have a spot on it
4.0,"Good quality for the price, but it is smaller than expected"
4.0,"I'm 5' I wear this a dress with shorts or leggings, very cute."
4.0,"These pants are okay but not great. For some reason, they only have one pocket and the front is lined up weird so the pattern is one elephant walking into another one. The fabric is very comfortable but the look is a little odd. I am 135lbs and 5'7"". I do not have a completely flat stomach and on these pants, it shows. The waist band and ankle elastics of these are very tight. Although I do not have to worry about the pants falling down, I had envisioned a drawstring waist instead of a tight elastic. I do not know if the pants are supposed to be high-waist like the model, but at 5'7"" they ride up into the crotch area if you try to wear them higher than the hip. The feel good if you have them on your hips but the design of the pants makes a big balloon of fabric at your crotch when you have them down that low. I had to check if I was wearing them backwards (I wasn't, the tag is at the back).<br /><br />I will wear these around the house because they are cozy but if you want the look the model has, you might not quite get that look (or at least, I couldn't). They still wash well and feel comfortable when worn at the hip. They are also extremely soft and comfortable. If you are taller, just note that you will have to wear the legs a bit higher but these pants will stay up."
4.0,"They look exactly as pictured; I would even say that they colors are comparable in person. However, as soon as I put them on I heard a stitch pop on the lower leg seam. I wouldn't do yoga or work out in them, but they look cute and fit me well. I'm 5'7&#34; and 125lbs. Overall, I'm happy with my leggings. üòä"
4.0,good bag
4.0,"nice socks, you get what you pay for. Arrived quite late, but that's to be expected. The material is exceedingly cheap, but good overall."
4.0,"I bough this for my 13 years daughter, the top is a little bit small. The shorts are perfect."
4.0,I love miusol dresses! They never disappoint! My only complaint with it is as all miusol dresses... the zippers are very poor quality. But that can easily be replaced. Otherwise beautiful :)
4.0,"A pretty decent pair of socks. Not too tight, but did the job in a recent long flight"
4.0,Good quality & looks great!
4.0,"I saw reviews saying the coloring was not as pictured. This was just as pictured. I saw reviews that said this is higher in the neckline. It is higher in the neckline. I saw reviews that said order a size up or a size down. I ordered a size up. Glad I did. It is long on me but I am 5'1"". Too long is how all my clothes come.  In the summer I like more of a scoop neck. The arm holes are not so big that your bra shows. I will gladly trade a higher neck line for  arm holes that fit. If the neckline really was scoop, I would have given this 5 stars."
4.0,My son-in-law likes them a lot.
4.0,I bought these for my grandson and he loves them.  The look adorable on and are made of high quality material.  The seems are all good and I haven't found any lose strings.  The only reason for 3 stars is because they were too big for him and that frustrated him.  He had roll the top over and tie them extra tight to get them to stay up.  He wasn't happy feeling like he had to hold them up as he swam.  I washed then a couple of times on hot water (which I never do).  Dried them on high heat 3 or 4 times and they fit much better.<br />Over all they rwrqf-4943490835@sale.craigslist.org great quality and if your child is a minions fan he will live these shorts.
4.0,"Lightweight but not see through. Bat wings will show a little bit of a bra if you held up your arms beside you and someone looked directly into your armpit. Otherwise, no one should see them. Cute shirt"
4.0,Bought this to use for our engagement shoot. Love the skirt but cut out the lining as it made it look weird. Ended up not using it as I couldn't find a top I loved but kept it because it was super cute and not too fluffy!
4.0,Cute glasses. Great quality. The only thing Id change is that the red would be brighter. Its more a darker red and not a Texas or American flag red. But overall these are a great buy
4.0,Good and in the perfect condition as expected
4.0,"I ordered 3 sizes of this suit and ended up keeping the Uk 54/ US 20. I am a 42DD with about a 43&#34; waist, 49&#34; hips and 52&#34; around the thigh/saddle-bag area. I probably should have kept the US 18 but I wanted it a little loose to cover all of my humps, lumps and bumps. I listed it as 'Fit as Expected' but I really don't know what size I am. it depends on the brand. This suit fit fine in the chest, I guess. There is absolutely no support. I actually laughed out loud when I realized that the cups were sitting off to the side above my breasts like little mini skull caps. I took them out and may insert them into the bra (below). The bottom layer of material is mesh-like material over the stomach area. it isn't very restricting to help suck things in, but it works. At about the hip level, the material changes to black swimming suit material. The shorts are shorter than i wanted, but I just don't pull it up as far as it should be, hence why it starts at my hips instead of my waist. The seem feels a bit weird over my tush, but I think it will work. Overall, i do like the suit. I'm just hoping when it's wet it doesn't sag to my ankles since it's a bigger size. Our trip is the end of March. If I remember, I will do an update when we get back.<br /><br />I ordered this 'bra' in a 2XL to wear under the suit. It actually looks pretty cute. I probably should have ordered a 1 XL for extra support, but I don't want to deal with return and exchange.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PV2K6VU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
4.0,I like this robe and would like it more if it had long sleeves instead of 3/4 length.<br />Size XL fits like a Medium...comfortably.
4.0,It is too small to use a daily purse but I will keep it to use for small things to carry.
4.0,"Very cute item. Larger than appeared in picture. The only downfall, the. Racelet portion does not stretch, unless you have a tiny hand, it won‚Äôt fit. You‚Äôll have to hold the bracelet."
4.0,"Two things, runs big and be prepares  for your belly button to be on full display. Super comfy and fun costume though. I would buy a size smaller next time to make sure it‚Äôs giving a lifting effect and staying in place instead of falling off."
4.0,"These are definitely oversized 70s aviator sunglasses lol. For a costume these glasses are great! But using these as actual sunglasses will leave you highly disappointed unfortunately. The light pink tint these glasses have don't really provide any protection from the sun. The sun goes right through the lenses and blinds you... but you still look cool wearing them nonetheless haha. I have a wide round face, and these glasses fit great... so those with smaller heads might find these to be too loose perhaps. They are very pretty glasses, very nice quality of craftsmanship, don't feel cheap at all like most glasses you find! They also come with a nice cloth carrying pouch and a microfiber lense cloth. I love these glasses, but sad I won't be able to use them as my daily sunglasses."
4.0,Size 5 fit perfect on my thin son who is 5. If he had and extra weight it would have been tight. Other than that this is an adorable outfit.
4.0,"The rings that are attached to the fishhook and the earrings themselves were very loose. Wore them for the first time, and one of them popped off the ring. Luckily, I was able to find it and reattach, but at the time I was very sad thinking I'd lost a brand new earring. Cute aside from that"
4.0,"This is a nice top, but it fit a little tighter than I like."
4.0,"Loved that these actually stay on my feet! Love the fun tie dye colors, but wish they came in neutral colors for my dressier work outfits."
4.0,"small/low profile compared to some others<br />note that can show behind certain brooches/pins that are ""open""<br />I like that it feels snug on the pin so it won't slide back and forth - note that it's wider on one side than other which may allow you to put on such that it reduces the pin's ability to tilt downward (i also bent the pin on one pin to make it more snug)<br />I like that it pivots so you don't have to buy two different types of converters - can also accommodate a slanted pin.<br />measure your chain - the smallest end probably the ring the clasp goes in - to be sure can get through the hole."
4.0,"Fits pretty well, even on my thick arms!"
4.0,"very pretty, small, good for pencil case, small lipstick bag, or good for lip or eye liners."
4.0,"I read the reviews AFTER I ordered.  Nice shirt, but runs small.  Size up at least one size, maybe two sizes.<br />We needed larger shirts for a few people.  Wish they ran larger than 2x.<br />I also wish this design was a brighter/lighter color of purple."
4.0,"This coat is extremely warm though the actual product does not chime with the image. I ordered the Wine Red which looks like more of a deep burgundy based on the image but it really is Wine Red when it comes in the mail. Also, it's not as long as it appears which was a bit of a bummer for me since I was hoping for a coat that would reach to my lower thighs. That being said, the coat is rather warm and comfortable though the colour is a bit off."
4.0,It's very cute - especially for the price.  Brings back memories of my hippie days!
4.0,Roomy but not overly large. Nylon material so splash proof and easy cleaning.
4.0,"It is a cute, colorful dress. I really liked it, but I‚Äôm very short and felt it was overtaking. On someone a bit taller I feel it would be perfect.<br />Also, the bottom of the dress was more of a silky material. I didn‚Äôt love the mix of materials."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but works for what I wanted.
4.0,Fits well. Just wish it had real pockets. That was a bummer.
4.0,"They don't indicate the size, so they fit tight on my fairly average size man's wrist. With no ability to adjust, they really should put the length, which is 8.5&#34;. To fit the average Men's size of 8.5, they should have made this 8.75&#34; or slightly larger, and also clearly indicated the size."
4.0,Only giving this 4 out of 5 stars because the picture made the blue color look a lot lighter but in person it is definitely a dark navy. Love the top though. Super comfy!
4.0,pretty good watch for its price
4.0,A tad large for me in XXL<br />6ft 280lbs
4.0,"Really good pair of leggings, fits a little bit small, i am size M, i ordered a size L and it still fits small."
4.0,Very pretty and figure flattering.  It is very long....all the way to the floor....wish it had been Tea length.  Nevertheless its very nice
4.0,I have this on a 24&#34; inch chain and it looks great. It looks like real turquoise too.
4.0,"The material was thinner than I expected, but if it keeps me dry, I'm happy with it."
4.0,Its super cute but if you don't wear a mesh shirt over it you may have a nip slip. I wear it with a sheer long sleeve and it help keeps it snug against me.
4.0,Just as described. My wife loves it
4.0,Little snug in bust
4.0,"Just what I wanted! Good coverage in the armholes, fabric is stretchy but not skin tight. Hits at the ankle and looks great with dressy flats or strappy sandals. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 145 pounds and ordered the small. Perfect fit. No see through of underwear or leg silhouette and the pockets are a nice plus. Good drape."
4.0,Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the pull cord in the hood.  The color doesn‚Äôt match the top.  I will probably replace it.
4.0,"This shirt is okay. It's a nice silky, drapey material, so it feels nice and cool. The waistline is not very slimming, though. I bought one in the mustardy color and one in the dark green. The mustard shirt fit as expected - maybe a little snug around the cinched waist area. But, the green shirt was looser - specifically in the chestal area - I had to sew it a little there so my ta tas don't pop out. For reference, I am 5'2"" and 170 lbs. An XL fit comfortably."
4.0,daughter said they were itchy
4.0,Very pretty!  they were a xmas gift
4.0,Good product/quality but super small. Smaller than a mini backpack.
4.0,Love this belt...wish it were shorter.
4.0,Fits great.  Flattering.  Material is nice.
4.0,I ordered Two pair of these an xl and a xxl. The xl is bigger then the xxl which i thought was odd. So i checked the tags in the gloves and there right. So i don't know.
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 and got the white one in small. Fits perfect and I got compliments on it.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a pretty ankle bracelet, but it‚Äôs super big on my 19 year old daughter ankle, she‚Äôs 5‚Äô2 and weighs 138 pounds.... it‚Äôs pretty though."
4.0,"This shirt is super cute and the material is not cheap! It is exactly what you expect. This shirt is a flowy tunic and fits a little big on me, but that's okay for me given the style. The length is perfect tunic length. I would say just a tad bit longer than the piko style long sleeves. It is a little big in the rib cage, but nothing where the shirt looks too baggy. I ordered a medium and I am a true medium. I am 5'5, 150lb, athletic build. I probably could order a small, but I do not plan to return because I like the style and don't want the small to end up being too small. I am excited about this because it can be made to look casual or professional. The see through part of the shirt does not look like cheap material and really is fashionable. Really like this shirt and recommend it."
4.0,Something better than the average dollar tree pair.
4.0,Was hoping that it would glow more in black light.  It did a little.  Fits well and still had fun at our event.
4.0,Very nice - tough and cheap.
4.0,"This is the 2nd purse I've bought from this brand and I love it almost as much as the first...the style is really cute and theyre washable, which is nice. The first one I got was a lighter color and it started to look sort of grungy, and after repeated washing it did get a little worn, so I went with this one since its darker and hopefully will last a little longer..my only issue is that this particular style doesn't have an inside zipper pocket, but other than that, I think its super cute and I'll probably end up buying from this seller again"
4.0,Where  good but  broke
4.0,Good sturdy construction. Came exactly as pictured
4.0,"Use it as a head scarf and for a cosplay, good material, very stretchy"
4.0,"Really like this dress. I didn't expect the sleeve to be detached and separate pieces, but it actually is pretty convenient."
4.0,I bought this for one of my brothers.  He never told me how he liked it.  But no news is good news.
4.0,They scratch really easy....
4.0,"Very soft fabric , not see through I‚Äôm a larga and got a medium and fits tight but well. I like is flattering doesn‚Äôt feel boxy!  Just order your usual size I guess."
4.0,"Very nicely made and super high quality for the price. These sunglasses are VERY dark, and for me they were only useful in bright daylight - otherwise my view was too dim. The darkness and polarization of the lens made looking at a bright sunny sky very easy, no squinting at all. The lens face is very flat (not curved to fit the face) so you will see reflection in the sides if light is behind you. I can't stop seeing the side of my face, which is a bit distracting. However, all this considered, still would recommend due to high quality for low price. Bonus: They come with a nice soft carrying sack and a small repair kit, and the packaging was very nice. Also love the fact that part of the cost goes to giving an eye exam, glasses and sunglasses to those in need. Bravo!"
4.0,Love the color selection. It is comfortable
4.0,They are beautiful agate slices. Maybe a bit on the large size for some people
4.0,"Very cute - small, so they don't look too &#34;blingy&#34;"
4.0,Need a larger size please
4.0,Cute but it was way too short for my nose
4.0,"Color is not what I expected, the picture is misleading. I wanted it to be white-gold as the picture, when I received the item it was a very cheap looking gold. I returned it. But the purse overall was a pretty good size and could've fit everything I carry around."
4.0,What a deal. Was a little skeptical (by default) despite the reviews but this fit perfectly! Ordered 2 anchors and black cherries in a medium (typically a small) but the fit was great! Looking forward to rocking these all summer long!
4.0,"Looks the same as picture. Bought it for my daughter, it almost fitted her. Material was not cheap."
4.0,"I'm 40ish, 5'4 and 150 lbs. I bought the grey in a size large. They're snug in a good compression way, so excellent to contain any jiggle when running, but a little too snug to wear shopping (maybe with a roomy hoodie that covered my rear?) Anyhow, I'm super pleased with them, plus they're matte and not shiny at all! I haven't washed them yet, but they feel like they'll launder well."
4.0,This is my second order. I love it. My first one was pink. Looks just like the picture. M 95lbs and 5'4 and ordered small.
4.0,"As another reviewer wrote it is a bit tight across the bust, Knock off a star for the smell of exhaust fumes it had upon arrival, but that could have easily been a result of shipment as the bag had a small one inch tear. Other than that, the garment arrived in good condition and was actually nicer than I expected for the 13 usd price."
4.0,"This is a nice, heavy keychain.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt realize is the print is quite small to get the whole sentiment on."
4.0,"I generally don't review my purchases on Amazon. I find that everything I buy has good and bad reviews. I make my decision based on my perceived value.<br /><br />The ties I ordered had some negative reviews, and positive reviews.<br /><br />Bottom line, anyone who orders these ties are getting nice ties. Not, spectacular ties, but very nice ties.<br /><br />Those people who write negative reviews for a 6 dollar purchase... Shut up...<br /><br />Go find a new hobby, like playing with rocks.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the ties or the price.<br /><br />I'll order more colors.<br /><br />The ties don't feel cheap. They look good.. They tie perfectly.<br /><br />I look awesome.<br /><br />That's all that matters."
4.0,Good for its price
4.0,I bought it for my niece who is a nurse supervisor at a mental health facility. She  is an excellent nurse and has great empathy and compassion for  her patients.  She has two other bracelets similar and I know she will enjoy this one and wear it well.
4.0,"Very nice, smooths the fat rolls, is wrinkly but I can probably work with that before I wear it. It is a tiny bit high in the waist but I am 5'7&#34; so that is pretty standard. Would be nice if the sleeves were just a wee bit longer-they seem to break at the largest point of my upper arm."
4.0,"Likes: Lightweight, rich color, warm with faux fur all the way through the boot and waterproof. These boots are easy to put on and take off, they dry fast after wearing them in a few inches of snow.<br /><br />Dislikes: I wear a US women's size 9.5, half sizes were not available so I ordered a size 10 and it is a little too big. I was expecting the sole of the boot to be harder like an outdoor boot, it feels more like a house slipper and I feel everything I step on. Delivery took a month so you'll need to have patience if you want these boots."
4.0,True to size. Nice colors and quality. I love it!
4.0,Very nice style!
4.0,Nice heavy chain. Perfect length.
4.0,I have two intrusive cataracts and the yellow tint helps to reduce the glare of the oncoming head lights. Very helpful driving in the rain! A corrective measure while waiting for surgery or anyone sensitive to night time driving!
4.0,Very cute! Not as flattering as on the model when you are not model shaped but it's different from most of my closet and I like it!
4.0,Beautiful material.  I was looking for a large oversized  shirt so I ordered 1 size up.  What I received was a  shirt that just fit.  Not a waste of money but it doesn't fit as I wanted.  I should have ordered 2 or 3 sizes up.
4.0,Love this outfit I just don't know how to tie a bow....it just comes as a strip of fabric
4.0,Hatley sleepshirts are favorites of mine.  This is a cute one. It fits generous sized woman comfortably.
4.0,Bought this so I could be The Fox for Halloween. Nice quality.
4.0,"I ordered size large because I have a 29-inch waist.  It fits large but I will keep it because I can comfortably wear thermals or leggings underneath come wintertime.  Will purchase again in a size medium.  It's nice material, not really see-through, can probably wear without a slip."
4.0,Nice quality and fit well. Will buy from this company again. I will wear this with Capri leggings.
4.0,"So far, sturdy and good size, I would like that they all were different sizes. But really like them"
4.0,If I wore this at the ankle then my feet would swell after 12+ hours working/standing. I pulled this down and wore more like open toe stocking with just the tips of my toes exposed. Worked great.
4.0,The bag was lovely and just as expected. I like the side pockets! Perfect size for me. I just didn't like that it arrived later than originally expected
4.0,"Bought this to replace my wife‚Äôs lost key chain.  Leather strap is a lot thinner and skinnier than what I expect.  It doesn‚Äôt have that robust, rugged feel to it as I was hoping.  But that‚Äôs just aesthetics.  Quality is par to what you‚Äôd expect for the price."
4.0,Not bad at all... I like it it ... depends how u wear your hats... stylish to me<br />... looks  cool to me ...quality is good enough.... but amazon is price on delivery.. they say 10 bucks u end up paying 20 ...
4.0,Just was a little small for a 2x
4.0,Not bad but they sent me the wrong size and the gray doesn't look like the picture. There also pretty thin.
4.0,A little big. Great for sunny day but they are really dark.
4.0,I shoula bought the bigger one to be more satisfied
4.0,"Love it, just read reviews on what size to get."
4.0,I am a 36 C and I ordered the D and absolutely could NOT go any smaller.  Nice packaging.
4.0,It fits as expected.  But it is a little short.  Kids may have to wear shorts under it.
4.0,Got these for my wife. She said they were a bit too big but that they were warm and cozy.
4.0,"However, perfect look for a character im creating in my show def adds that classic mobster setup. great for the hitman."
4.0,Looks great nice product it definitely runs small so buy a size up I always wear a small but this is really tight so I should have gotten a medium
4.0,I like them but they are for my son and he won't get them until Christmas.
4.0,"Great dress for the price. Wish I would've sized down. I think the material makes for a loose fit. That being said, it is the softest dress I own! The colors are beautiful. It doesn't have as much shape as I'd hoped but it's wearable and still cute. I think if I would've sized down, it may have been more flattering.<br /><br />5'3, 155lbs, Large"
4.0,"Soft, stretchy but a little small. Hopefully wearing it will stretch it out so it stays on my head."
4.0,"Fit my 5‚Äô4 106lb 12 year old perfectly. Purchased for orchestra concert. Arrived wrinkly but so cute. Great price. She says it‚Äôs a little itchy, otherwise would be a 5!"
4.0,This was okay I mean it was cute but the green and black isn‚Äôt a great color combo
4.0,Cute but too little
4.0,The cover up runs small but very pretty
4.0,I love the fact that you can wear it both ways!
4.0,Me gustas
4.0,"really good rings, kinda big for me though"
4.0,These are so cute and I got a great deal on Amazon. These do run big though a 1/2 size or maybe closer to a full size. They are built well but maybe a tad bit stiff. These will match so many outfits!
4.0,"I like the simple stylish look of the dress. You can dress it up or wear it casual. It is very long. I am 5‚Äô5 and I ordered a size XL. I wore 3 inch heels and the dress touched the floor. I tied the dress at the bottom in a knot. Worked out fine. Please note, this material continuously gets longer in length. It is that type of fabric, so when you hang it, use two hangers or simply fold . Nice dress."
4.0,"This is a very beautiful blouse, nicely made, and it looks like the one in the pic, save for the fact that it is not as long. It does not cover the hips but the waist. I ordered an XL, I'm 5'5&#34; and 187lb, and it was fine."
4.0,It looks great on.  He wears it all the time.
4.0,super cool looking ring i've bought 4 because I figgured they'd break quick. I was right down to my last one. They look killer though!
4.0,Shirt fits great but the black isn't a true true black when it is paired with a sweater that is black. It almost looks more brown. I LOVE the shirt and it's a great price but it does look a bit faded.
4.0,"It‚Äôs a very beautiful product but if you have small wrists it may annoy you. Even on the tightest setting after a while it tends to loosen and slip and slide up and down my arm. I bought it to wear to work, so it‚Äôs a little annoying having to keep stopping and tightening it back.<br /><br />Other than that it is a beautiful product and I LOVE IT. I‚Äôm the biggest hello kitty lover ever. If you do not have small arms you won‚Äôt have a problem"
4.0,"I love the color,and the lace is gorgeous,but the only concern to me is it's a little small, I'm gonna still order more.Amazon your delivery is the best two days.Wow"
4.0,This is a beautiful layered necklace. You can wear them together or separate. I like the quality of the set. It lightweight and can be dressed up or down. I really the the price and it packaged nicely.  I definitely recommend this product.
4.0,... my son is getting blisters on the outside toes.  I'm hoping its just because he has to wear them in ... time will tell.
4.0,This runs very small. I ordered the size based on another reviewer's suggestion. The little girls small fits a girls 4T.
4.0,Had a great time and was the hit of the Family christmas party. WE (Mrs. Clause also) had people texting us to go to their house for their kids.<br />Maybe next year I'll rent out as a traveling santa and Mrs. Clause.
4.0,"I had to buy this to replace a purse that was too small for my needs and was falling about soon after I bought it.<br />This purse is doing very well sofa. I've had it now for over a month. No tear, no rips, and no stains. Its holding up very well. Its is roomy on the inside. I don't need much room. But the room I do need I like not having to maneuver my things to shift them out of a narrow opening. This purse has 2 major compartments on the inside, each with its own zipper closure. I like that I can separate my wallet from other things. and I am able to close off my wallet since I don't take it out of my purse as frequently."
4.0,"This robe is super soft and comfy! I love the length of it, it‚Äôs long which is perfect! The Only thing driving me crazy rn is the static electricity from it. It was bad when I opened it I could hear it. So I sprayed it with static spray and it didn‚Äôt work that well but washing it and hang drying it will hopefully do the trick. Comfy but not worth getting shocked constantly."
4.0,It well fit to expected size.<br />My mother loves it and fabric feel soft and not cheap
4.0,Absolutely gorgeous! It is the perfect size and it hangs perfectly.<br />I only wish that the opal in the center was a little bigger!
4.0,It‚Äôs nice. Very long. I had to go up a size to fit my bust area. It‚Äôs not stretch material. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it.
4.0,kind of wide but pretty good
4.0,"Very cute. I thought they would be fluffier. The photo shows 2 different styles and no option to choose a style. The ones I received are the flatter ones. They're cute but I didn't get a choice so I risked it. They velcro closed, so they pretty much will fit any adult."
4.0,"Cute but my little girl found it scratchy on her head after awhile, as there are sequins on the band. Me, too. Fine for an hour, not great for all day."
4.0,"This particular cut ran a bit small. I ordered a large instead of my usual medium. Love the vibrant color and the banded pattern though, very flattering. I have numerous pieces from Sunsets Swimsuits and I really love the brand. Nice quality!"
4.0,"EXCELLENT Print, High-Quality Hanes Beefy-Tee, but runs a size small."
4.0,"Materials are soft, and feels great on. Good weight to the fabric, but not too heavy, and it's very warm."
4.0,I had my doubts about the product initially. You kinda have to play around to get the right feel. Other than that I'm glad I invested in it!
4.0,Fits as expected back tag is a bit itchy but easy to remove if it bothers you too much
4.0,So the bra is very comfortable and gives a lot of support. I‚Äôm small 38d but the band in this bra is tight so if you run on larger side might be too tight
4.0,I love this dress I thought it was supposed to be a solid gray but it ends up being checkered white and Gray and I think the size chart is accurate you just have to read and make sure you get the right size
4.0,It's really cheap and cute. Unfortunately the material is kind of cheap but that's kind of expected at its price. I don't really see much a problem with it overall.
4.0,"True to color, but small fit"
4.0,"They feel nice and were the right size, but slightly inhibiting in movement. If you wear cotton boxers then this definitely won't be a problem and is definitely worth getting. If you have had these types of boxers before you might be downgrading slightly"
4.0,Like them so far they don't slide and are easy to use. Time will only tell to how they hold up.
4.0,"Good quality and workmanship, but this thing just takes up way more space than it needs to for men's glasses.  I bought this to put in a drawer and take out for easy access to my backup glasses.  But it takes up 3 times the volume in the drawer that the glasses in their cases would, and the glasses slide around precariously when I lift it out of the drawer due to the compartments being almost twice as wide and three times as tall as they need to be for my glasses.  The dividers are less than half the height inside so glasses don't stay in their slot if you lift it at an angle.  It looks like most other glasses organizers have the same footprints for glasses, but most have less height.  I gave up and just decided to use the glasses cases instead.  It is also annoying to control freaks like myself that they only include one key for the lock.  I wanted a sports car, got an SUV."
4.0,My daughter wears a 6 juniors. I bought this bathing suit in a large and the bottoms are still a but snug but the top fits perfect. Well made for the price but definitely runs very small
4.0,Nice & roomy
4.0,Gift for my wife. She really likes the shirt and said it fit well.
4.0,"The bottom fits perfect! However the top runs small, wish they could have been ordered separately, but its definitely a cute outfit."
4.0,"Although my chest isn't quite large enough to fill the cups, this top did cover me. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,Great fabric. Great tailoring. Got the XXXL. I am a 46R American. Can't button up. Can leave it open.
4.0,"I bought the pink in medium for my daughter and she liked it, only it was a bit awkwardly big in the crotch area. Also too see through for my liking on an 11 year old so she will be only using it at home instead of for running like we planned. However i also bought one for my self in the green which i liked but had the big crotch area issue like hers. Overall id probably buy these again for my daughter just in a darker color probably."
4.0,My preteen daughter really likes the way these look and fit
4.0,These look expensive. The colors are bright and the sparkle. I don‚Äôt like the backs. These earrings have to set up and not droop in order to look nice. I used backs from another set of earrings.
4.0,Good for people who are sensitive to materials other than wood.
4.0,"I got so many compliments on this Gir dress. It fit nicely. I added a corset belt to help define the curves. Yup help for sizing I'm 5'1"" between 170-180lbs it was a lil loose with extra room so adding the corset belt helped a lot."
4.0,I love these! I just wish they came in a bikini style. One pair fit a little snug and the rest were a little big. I do not have much of a butt so there is extra room there. I will buy more.
4.0,I love this robe! I bought an XL and am happy to say I loved how it fit. It was roomy and very comfortable. The material is as soft as mink and feels really good next to your skin. The color was just like it showed. I am just thrilled with my purchase.
4.0,"I like the hat. Looks good and is well-constructed, considering the price. I have already gotten a few compliments. Whether or not this is a &#34;summer&#34; cap&#34; depends on where you live. In Canada or Maine, etc. it probably is. In South Texas, it's more like a 2.5 season cap, Spring, Fall and the milder days of winter. If you wore this in August, it would be saturated with sweat in about 15 mins. Then again, if you're mainly wearing it for appearance in an air-conditioned space, it will be fine. Finally, I usually wear a 7 5/8 and that size was too big for me in this cap. The 7 1/2 fit perfectly. Thank you Amazon for your free return policy."
4.0,Comfortable.  Prefer more chest room.  Ironing a must!
4.0,"Pleased so far.  Had to add another clip for the watch to ride in my pocket, connected to a belt loop."
4.0,A little big/long but the Opal is pretty and it's been the best ring out of the few I bought at once.
4.0,"I had been a little leery of these boots at first since one reviewer mentioned that they were stiff like cardboard and clearly fake but for $45, I figured I'd give it a try. I had found a list somewhere that had said that 6pm.com was an authorized retail of UGGs and so I had faith. Right out of the box they did seem heavier and more stiff then my other UGGs that are a different style (Bailey Button's ordered from UGG.com) and when I slipped my foot into these, I could understand what the other reviewer was experiencing. The bottom part of the shoe is made from a harder material and when you slide your foot into the sweater-like portion, as your foot hits the edge of the bottom part, it feels a little odd, like you're putting your foot into a cardboard box instead of a shoe. Once your foot is in all the way, the edge is completely not noticeable and the boots are actually extremely comfortable. They keep my feet very warm in our often frigid New England weather here is Massachusetts. I took one star off my rating because I originally thought it would be great to have more versatility and be able to wear these either up or folded down, however, I am not so much a fan of how they look standing up. The sweater part gets a little slouchy. Someone with a wider leg than mine would probably not have this issue though. My friends also mentioned that the souchyness didn't look bad but I will still probably only wear them folded down. I ordered a size 5 Big Kids as I normally wear a 7 or 7 1/2 in Women's shoes and they fit perfectly. I can see how some people say they run big. If I were closer to a 6 1/2 or 7, going down a size would probably have been fine too. All in all, I'm thoroughly happy with this purchase. Thank you!"
4.0,After reading reviews a lot of people said to order a size up. I‚Äôm usually s medium so i ordered a large. Had a bit of room in the mid section so it wasn‚Äôt as fitted as it could be but i made it work. Will definitely order again and definitely in a medium. *it‚Äôs a little itchy but i was prepared for that from the reviews.
4.0,This is a fine scarf for the price.
4.0,"Tight fit. Elbows are a little weird (I'm short, 5'), so the design doesn't quite line up with where I think it is supposed to be. Snug. Thicker material, keeps me warm!  I'm not a fan of turtlenecks, so the raised neckline is not my favorite. Overall, money well spent."
4.0,I really like this pants! I got compliments everywhere I went in these pants! They are very small fitting! I wear between a 2-6 in pants and I bought a large and they are still a bit tight. Also I am pretty short 5' 3&#34; an these go to the top of my ankle.
4.0,Order a size down and runs long but nice fabric!
4.0,Rolling stones
4.0,"This looks very cool and is pretty much awesome :) my only disapointment is it seems to be made for a bigger, longer ear than mine. I had to bend it and then it fit. It was also a little heavy. A little disappointing, but alright."
4.0,"They fit beautiful,  however if you have a small Waist you may need them altered."
4.0,calendar needs to be magnified.
4.0,Had to order a size up.  For the price the dress is a good value.  I will be visiting the Eastern Med and going to a Mosque and because of dress code this is perfect.  Don;t know that I will find much other use for this dress.  It is lightweight and will pack well.  If you are into Maxi dresses this is a good buy and would recommend
4.0,"Nice lightweight cooler. I was hoping it it would be a bit bigger, but it works well. We took it to the beach with us for about 4hrs with 3 ham sandwiches, 2 apples and some grapes with a medium ice pouch and everything stayed reasonably cool until we got home. It was about 82 degrees outside. I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"My son liked it, that that's all I wanted. It is exactly what it shows."
4.0,Nice and covers trouble areas.
4.0,"The color of this shirt is nice. The embroidery is really pretty and it‚Äôs one of the good things about this shirt. Beyond that though, I have some anxieties about the size. It was a bit smaller than expected. And after one wash, it did shrink a bit. Both of these issues aren‚Äôt a major problem for me because I‚Äôm a small person to begin with. I‚Äôm just not sure how future washes will be handled."
4.0,Good product and would get a 5 star if main zipper was better and oriented correctly. Is a great value though.
4.0,A little to big for my wife. She doesn't like how it fits and the pockets are kind of pointless.
4.0,Pretty scarf I wear as a hijab. Idk why I thought it was a chiffon because it clearly says it‚Äôs cotton so that was my mistake.
4.0,I thought this had a dedicated laptop compartment but the back zippers connect to the main compartment. Super nice bag too!
4.0,Nice case makes it easy to keep tract of.
4.0,"The wallet is slim, so it fits easily into handbag. The 8 slots for cards are readily visible, and there are other areas to store cash and other cards. My only negative is that the card slots are slightly small in width so that it takes some effort to get cards back into place. Also, I chose it for the RFID protection, but the wallet didn't not include a confirmation of this feature."
4.0,Wish there was a full costume.  So now having to purchase the Santa  suit.  The costume does look very good it does not have the cheap look.  Reindeer looks good
4.0,I like it but its a bit awkward to put on...maybe im doing it wrong!<br /> I ordered an XL. I'm 6'2 34-27-42 and fluctuate between 155-165 lbs.fits perfect and is nice cool fabric
4.0,"I love huggie style hoops with the masks I am constantly wearing for work.  They are way more comfortable than hoops with a post since the mask strap is around my ears.  These black hoops were a different from all of my silver and gold hoops.  In person, they are not a true deep black.  They do sort of get lost in my dark hair, but they were something different.  They snap closed securely and are just sturdy enough that I don't feel like I am going to bend or break them.  I think they are a little overpriced for what you get but I feel that way about most earrings."
4.0,"It's pretty good, considering the price I paid for it. I am happy with this product."
4.0,"Pretty print, large size.  Holds lots of books, etc."
4.0,"I bought this dress to do a pirate Halloween costume and it does the job. I got a size small, which is my normal size, and it fits fine. It is a little see through, like if you don‚Äôt wear a bra you can see your nipples. But with a nude bra it is not noticeable. It‚Äôs nothing exciting but it works for my costume!"
4.0,It's a nice and my granddaughter liked.
4.0,"I have a hard time finding a bra that fits, just in general, my size is not usually sold in stores and buying online is quite the hassle. To get away with the fact that I can't find a bra that fits, I buy one as big as I can find that does not have underwire and make sure it is plunging. Then I wear a genie bra, similar to this one to go over it. This gives me the support I need while keeping me from, ahem, falling out the front.<br /><br />I was hoping this one would be like the genie bra and I could wear over my sports bra that does so well. I put this on and it was tight but it seemed to work. It certainly held me in place. My husband pointed out that I was sort of squished out the side, I am very busty but not a big gal so it is hard to find something that the band goes around without causing issues there. I am only a size Junior Medium to a Large but my bust is (at true measurement) a size J cup. I can usually get away with a DD if I wear two and make sure it's a very plunging front.<br /><br />I bought the biggest size this one came in hoping it would be like the genie bra. It goes on fine but it is very tight on the bands.<br /><br />When I took it off at the end of the day I had huge marks/dents along where the bra line is. It hurt and was red, but I figured it just needed to be broken in. I tried this for a few more days on and off and just couldn't handle the pain anymore. I got it on fine but it runs small enough that it digs in  too badly to wear. I tried giving it to a friend who is not so busty but about the same size around. (Junior medium to large in tops) and it was still too tight for her. I ended up having to give to another friend who is a lot smaller and about a size B at most. It finally fit someone.<br /><br />Aside from this it is very well made, it feels sturdy and the material is thick and stretchy. The bands are wide enough for support, though the whole thing is not big enough for someone who really needs the support. My friend loves it and uses it for yoga, so I'm glad someone is getting some use out of it<br /><br />I think if it was bigger I would have loved it, but it runs too small for me.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF. I HAVE TRIED THIS MYSELF AND EVALUATED IT ACCORDINGLY"
4.0,perfect size for me. not too big and can fit a bottle of water and extra items in with my essentials. i would give it 5 stars if the smell was not so bad. i am hoping it will go away.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8e5adde626633b000d5519711d1b7da4]] Glasses itslef look great, but the hardshell protector seems flimsy and just not legit. I'm not sure if this are 100% legit Chopard Glasses, but they look pretty good."
4.0,Very pretty and are exactly as described.
4.0,The sweater was a big hit at Christmas the only draw back is you have to wash it by hand.
4.0,Shoe runs a little narrow. Other than that she loves them.
4.0,it is such a cute top.I hate to have to mail it back.but it was way to small.please help
4.0,"I really like the color, fit well.<br />Over all happy with purchase pants like these are hard to buy online because they never look exactly like the picture. These were pretty darn close"
4.0,These are small and simple. You 3 in this set. They are very lightweight but well made. I dont have nose ring but seems like the back would be bulky for the nose idk but they are perfect as an ear cartilage accessory.
4.0,Fit is definitely small compared to what I'd expect a Large to be.  Order one size larger than you think.
4.0,"These are not only adorable, they are sturdy as well. They have a good rubber sole to keep her feet safe. I am able to slip them on her feet easily. The 4-10month size ended up being a size 4, so it took some time before my girl could wear them. These are a great next level start shoe for when your baby needs more than a crib shoe but isn't ready to wear a heavier shoe. I have washed these half a dozen times in the washer and then let them air dry.  They have held up great except for some minor pilling. I have found that because they are white, they get dirty fast. We love this shoe so much that even though she can now easily walk with heavier shoes, we still put these on her often."
4.0,Great novelty umbrella on a drizzling day.  The heart is small and doesn't require a lot of coverage (it's hear shaped after all) and can only fit one person.
4.0,Arm on top was seen a little crooked but love it.
4.0,These are shorts
4.0,i received this necklace back in summer 2015. I love the color but the materials are cheap. It looked more exquisite online. I've worn it and have received many compliments.
4.0,"I bought this item because of the colors that were represented: black and red.  I was looking for a red/gray, because I am an Ohio State fan, so this red/black was the closest I could find, and plus I liked the style.<br /><br />When it was delivered, I was anxious to see what the style was.  I love the way the material can be spread out, and be twisted, so you can make different options to wear ‚Äì I had it on with 1 color wrapped around the neck, and the other hanging off the side ‚Äì both colors twisted together, and worn twice around the neck.  I had many other options to do it with, and my daughter even wore it to see if she can come up with any more styles.<br /><br />You can‚Äôt take the 2 colors apart, as they are interlocked ‚Äì but the material is soft, didn‚Äôt scratch my neck or rub it, and it has some stretching material in it, which I guess is why you can twist and wrap.  I know I won‚Äôt be going to an Ohio State game anytime soon, as I am in AZ, but I am looking forward to wearing this when it gets cooler here, or if I happen to visit somewhere that is.<br /><br />#ProductDiscount<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for review.  I wrote an honest product review based on my experience with this item.  The seller had no influence on my opinion."
4.0,"Great buy for the price. So far, I‚Äôve only worn the few that I initially liked and often get compliments."
4.0,"I love the pants but I need short, and they were not available in short length."
4.0,"Little bigger but Nice and comfortable, order one size small"
4.0,"Color is BETTER than  in photo! Does have a plasticky odor but airs out. Nice exterior, no lining of any sort inside and no pockets. Handle looks very nice, will def hold up. Going on a carribean cruise. I will prob use for that trip and discard. One is perfect size for beach and other will be my &#34;hand bag&#34;.  Only cons- interior is plasticky, no pockets. Will need to be careful with snap closure so not to pull it out of bag fabric."
4.0,Ok first off I actually do love this top. It's extremely soft and I love the color. The only reason it only got 4 stars is because it looks NOTHING like the picture! I am a pretty slim girl and I usually wear xs so I went with a small just in case. Oh man this thing was tight! There is no way for it to look ANYTHING like the picture unless you go up at least three sizes. It is very stretchy so I just stretched it out as much as I could so it didn't look super tight and like I said it really do like the top it just isn't what I expected.
4.0,the sleeves are a little short but that is because i'm so tall. i love it so much!
4.0,I knew these socks would be too large for me but I ordered them anyway.<br />They're made for Women's shoe size 9 and up.  But I wear a size 7. Please also offer  these for the smaller shoe range sizes. They are so nice and warm!
4.0,Nice watch second loop on band broke after a few days.
4.0,"These fit like your standard lounge around the house pants. A little too thin for me to be comfortable wearing in public, but good enough to work out and do the house cleaning in.<br />It has a high waist that you can wear as is or fold down depending on how you feel about you tummy. The boot cut is rather slight, which I prefer since I don't really like too much extra fabric around my ankles to trip over.<br />This hit nicely at the ankle for me, and I am 5'9 with a long torso."
4.0,Love the glasses. Big and dark.
4.0,I didn‚Äôt think it would be as short as it was but it looks great underneath a T shirt.
4.0,Love this soft comfy top..
4.0,I ordered because of my big hips. They were too big . Perfect for wearing around the house and relaxing.
4.0,"This is fairly comfy and soft. It runs quite large, so it's best if you like baggy clothes. The waistband has wide elastic; I'd find it a little comfier if the elastic weren't so big."
4.0,I love the set but it's cut a little smaller than I expected.  I'm keeping it but only because I'm losing weight that will make it wearable soon.
4.0,"It's a lovely dress but the smallest size was still a little large. Still flatters my figure but it does leave a lot of room. I have a 26&#34; waist and 34&#34; bust (32DDD bra size). I'm also 5'3&#34; and this is way below my knees, so a long dress. Very good quality material!<br />EDIT: with photos after slight shrinking after multiple washes. Now fits better!"
4.0,Functional versatile just wished it was bigger
4.0,They look nice but like all Nikes with this fabric they won't last long if you wear them daily. We bought them as &#34;play shoes&#34; I guess you'd call them. My son can slip these on & go out to ride his bike or shoot some basketball for a few min. or take out the trash etc. For this purpose we should get a bit longer out of them.
4.0,"I was given a gift certificate as a gift and had eyed these boots as a possibility. I normally wear a 7.5-8 size shoe with regular sweat socks, and I was a little worried that they wouldn't fit. The fit was perfect. I tried a heavier sock and they were a bit tight though. The thing to keep in mind with these boots are the ties. If you'd like to keep the sides together without your jeans or socks showing through the sides, then lacing them up can be a challenge in the beginning because the front flap and back flap are only held together by the ties. I wore them at night to an outdoor movie where we were sitting still for a good 2-3 hours. They were not warm enough for my feet/toes. However, it was a low of 20 degrees that night! I wore them outside in the daytime yesterday while walking outside for a few hours and they were warm enough. It was a high of 30 degrees.<br />So I would not recommend them for warmth if it's too cold outside. They were comfortable though and warm for daytime and I've had many compliments on how cute they are too. I ordered them through Amazon's site that they teamed with called [..] as they offered free 24 hour shipping and I needed them in 24 hours versus waiting on Amazon to ship for free in a couple days. They were the same price.<br />I'd recommend them for fashion and casual wear over needing them for warmth or for trudging through snow."
4.0,"The shirt was more sheer than expected and not the size I was expecting. It fits, but is made weirdly, it was loose around the torso but the straps were a little small."
4.0,Love it! Had to pop open the foot pedal to reseat the button that operates the doors. Put a little glue under it and it's fine now. Tip: there is a rod that the pedal hinges on that slides out.
4.0,"As advertised. Perfect for a hike, fishing, any outdoor activity where you'd like the sunglasses to hug your head and block the sun from nearly every angle."
4.0,"arrived promptly.  Beautiful, lots of sparkle with true color in the star settings.  Fits perfectly on my Pandora bracelet."
4.0,"They were pretty small, but I bought them for my bf as a Christmas gift and he loved them ! Also, they look pretty decent for the price."
4.0,Sick 8 bit design. Good solid colors. Could be a slight but larger for the adult but still pretty sweet.
4.0,"Super cute, but order two sizes up unless you like it extremely tight. Seems to be well made. The large fits my size 6 sister."
4.0,"This is my 3rd pair, and I'm very satisfied overall, and will likely purchase again as these wear out. My first pair is over 1 year old and still going strong... the other 2 were purchased ~3 months ago, to replace a couple of much older bib shorts that had simply worn out.<br /><br />Riding daily, about 10-20 miles on paved roads/trails, I find these quite comfortable and supporting. I rotate 3 bib shorts in the warmer months, and they seem to hold up pretty well over time, and I expect to get years of use at that rate.<br /><br />I'm not sure these will be best for longer rides, however. I'm preparing to do some century rides this spring and summer... first a ""metric"" (100Km), and then ""standard"" (100mi), so as I up the weekly and daily mileage, I'll report back with how these work out.<br /><br />The sizing of these is exactly as noted in the description... they are cut to a much smaller size than is typical for the general USA population. I usually wear a mens XL  in other brands, but this XXXL fits just right."
4.0,Blouse isn't as long as I had hoped - needs another 2 inches to cover my tush but the fabric is lovely.  Easy transaction and fast shipping.
4.0,"fits well, just a tiny bit small but love it~"
4.0,Used them a few days on the mountain was really impressed with the price .Clear lenses comfortable like my highend ot
4.0,Wanted to love this. The material was pretty decent. I have thicker thighs so unfortunately I had to return.
4.0,Gave as a gift. Came quickly and printed nicely
4.0,"These are so comfortable. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the shirt, ran a little small. The pants fit perfect."
4.0,Good quality for the price. The cups don't really have shape to them so it kind of lays on my boobs awkwardly (I'm a 32B) but besides that it's fine.
4.0,"The Satin Chemise Sexy Lingerie Halter Dress Lace Nightgown Sleepwear for Women is beautiful; but for me, it's too short. I have a long torso so even with adjusting the straps my butt still showed lol"
4.0,"This is a soft beautiful scapular.It is however,super long! It kept getting caught up in my clothes so I attached two medals to help weigh it down.It‚Äôs soft enough that I don‚Äôt feel it throughout the day or while sleeping at night so that‚Äôs a huge plus.I would recommend the brown straps though,the white straps get dirty very quickly!"
4.0,"A Overall Functionality<br />A- Craftsmanship<br />B- Overall Quality<br />C+ Size/Weight<br />C Materials<br /><br />If you want/need a big, basic, functional watch that looks pretty cool and won't break the bank, you'll enjoy this watch. Not someone to wear a watch daily, I purchased this to take with me camping, hiking, biking and paranormal investigating. I like it so far. It's a bit big, but that is the style nowadays and the sleek all-black look is pretty cool, IMO. It features standard watch functions, an alarm mode, a timer mode, an alternate time mode and chrono mode. It has a spongy-rubber band that feels good on the wrist. It claims to be waterproof, but I don't think I would submerge this for very long and I certainly would not press buttons while submerged, as per their description. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review. If you like big watches, don't like to spend a lot of money and enjoy the sleek black look, I can recommend this."
4.0,"Thanks to the other review I read about this item running smaller, I ordered a Lrg. Unfortunately, even though I normally wear a Med, this stills feels a little too tight on me. It's cute so, I will hand it down to my daughter who normally wears a Small."
4.0,It did wear a hole in the butt but it took a year so I suppose it could have been any legging probably unavoidable
4.0,Goes nicely with some other pieces I already have and will be perfect on the cruise formal night!
4.0,"I wear a size 30 and got a medium and it is a perfect fit. Tight throughout the body, but not noticeable at all. Keeps you warm during cold bike rides or runs. For a budget pair of tights it was definitely a good buy."
4.0,Looks as pictured. Purchased for my 14yr old who wears a mens medium and the XXL fit him. I was afraid it was going to be too big so we were happy!
4.0,"I like this dress alot. It is pretty and comfortable. It feels like a cotton dress even tho is states solid rayon spandex. Not the material I was expecting, but still very pretty and very comfortable."
4.0,"This is a nice sweater. It feels very comfortable and well made. I ordered an XL which is my normal size and it fit ok. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the length. It wasn‚Äôt as long as it is in the advertisement pictures, so wish it was a bit longer."
4.0,I needed a strap for my sunglasses  for a trip so I ordered these. They are cute and functional. They arrived promptly.
4.0,The arms are a little too narrow. But the lining is sooo soft...
4.0,"Got these for our kids. They are a great price for 4 of them. They work just like they should, but they did start fraying a bit almost immediately so I took off a star for that."
4.0,Big kipling fan adore they products cute cute
4.0,"Simple, rustic, nice engraving. The watch is lightweight & the leather seems genuine. My only complaints are, the glass cover on the clock face is slightly off center, as is the engraving on the back. It‚Äôs hardly noticeable unless you‚Äôre the kind of person who has to adjust wall hangings that are barely crooked (which I am). 4 stars. Hubby really likes it!"
4.0,"Warm, cozy--perfect for a cold winter's night.  Color is a little odd--very orange/red.  Lining looks like it was spray painted with the dye.  Fit is as expected. I wear a woman's 8www so ordered a man's 8m in order to be able to wear them with heavy winter socks."
4.0,Got this band for my galaxy watch. I like it! It's comfortable and not super heavy. The colors are pretty vivid the only thing I don't like is at the tops of the bands the paint job is kinda sloppy and they are pretty much the most visible parts of the band.
4.0,"I wanted this case so I can take my iPod when I walk or jog.  I don't wear a belt, sometimes have a dress on and most holders are geared for pants or pockets.  The lanyard gives me that option.  It would be even better with an adjustable strap so it could also be secured someplace other than right in the middle of the chest, even though it's around my neck.  It does have a belt clip too so I can secure it to the shirt and I like that.  Overall it's a good, sturdy case and I love the magnetic closure that keeps it tightly covered yet does not interfere with the functionality of my iPod."
4.0,The skirt is cute and well made but it is too tight for me.  It did not fit as expected.
4.0,Very cute swimsuit. I bought a 10-12 for my 12 year old and it fits good. The only thing she disliked is the bottoms. The leg openings seem huge for her and definitely give the suit a cheeky look. She wants just wear shorts over it.
4.0,"I have very high arches and had been recommended Oofos. However, reading the reviews on those gave me pause. They‚Äôre expensive and it seems they fall apart quickly. People seemed to compare these favorably so I tried them. I think they‚Äôre good but still not enough arch support for me. I wasn‚Äôt sure I could do better but last week at a shoe store found Aetrex Bali Slides (also available on Amazon) . The Aetrex are a bit less comfortable just because they‚Äôre a different design and quite tight, but they do have that really large arch support. I‚Äôll be wearing them until my fasciitis clears up then switch back to these."
4.0,"Decent quality for the price. It‚Äôs a nice substantial weight and shines nicely. I think the gold is little yellow-y so you can tell it‚Äôs costume. But really, nobody is going to think it‚Äôs real anyway. One of the chains in the tassel fell out the first time I wore it but you can‚Äôt tell and I haven‚Äôt had any issues since. I get compliments on this when I wear it."
4.0,I love the bag alot the color is army green I thought it would be a tan color none the less I like the bag
4.0,A little oversized but otherwise quality is great. I just need to tuck it in or knot it.
4.0,"These pants are just a tad snug when I put them on, but I can wear them.  The material is really nice - cotton/linen has a great feel to it.  Very summery and gauzy, but not open weave like real gauze material.  The palazzo pant legs are wide and give these pants that long skirt look and feel.  Mine are gray - very sophisticated and with a pretty top and flowing kimono jacket, could go to a fancy get-together or just a camisole, can go casual as well.  A nice pair of pants added to my wardrobe."
4.0,"It looks awesome and fits well on my ear. However, it is kind of heavy and makes my ear itch when I wear it for awhile."
4.0,"I waited to review to make sure I had a full experience with this watch band. I ended up returning it as it didn‚Äôt fit my needs as I thought it would. First of all, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to attach then wrap the band around my wrist. Once I got that figured out, I found that it was either wrapped twice and too loose or three times and too tight...and I‚Äôm very particular with fit. I was also put out that it required unbuckling every time I removed it, I wanted a bracelet band that would stretch on and off. The material did seem durable. This band was just not right for what I was wanting. It was cute though."
4.0,"Works perfectly with my Kate Spade scallop 2 smartwatch<br /> Very easy to change the band and I love the red floral print.<br />Only subtracted one star because I do not like the white loop or the white on the sides of the band, but these are minor complaints."
4.0,Unlike the other tights I bought these were thicker and not prone to snags or runs. Good leggings great price.
4.0,"I swim with it everyday and so far it has held up pretty good in chlorine water. I like the fact that I can wear it a little tight while swimming so that I get a good HR read. I loosen it for everyday use. I wear a lot of black so it blends in well lol :)<br />My biggest gripe about other sports bands from Apple is that they would just pop off and the watch would fall down, no danger with this band. Used it while digging, lawn work, swim sprints and just walking around."
4.0,"Pleased with this bag.  Construction is solid - good stitching, etc.  I've had it for just over a month so not much time for wear and tear to set in yet.  Plenty of pockets.  Looks sharp.  Using it for a Surface Pro 3 and it does the job nicely."
4.0,"Very very cute but runs large! I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù 98 lbs and the top fit but the bottoms are too big in the waist. I added a photo and you can‚Äôt tell but it‚Äôs not right at all and there‚Äôs a gap at my waist. It didn‚Äôt keep me from wearing it, but defintely wouldn‚Äôt wear in any crazy waves. Overall an absolutely adorable moderately modest bathing suit."
4.0,"Its adorable, cute, lenght is perfect. Only downside is that the cover up smells terrible. I washed it and the smell still didnt go away. Besides that it looks great!"
4.0,"I really love it, it comfortable and warm. I‚Äôm 199 lbs and 160cm I‚Äôve ordered a XL and it was a little bit big. My only problem as you can see in the picture is that the threads of the fabric in the crotch come out after less than 12 hours of wearing it. After a couple times, I‚Äôll not be able to wear it anymore üòî. But after that is great"
4.0,Nice tunic the material is a bit seethrough but it is still a nice option to match your leggings with
4.0,Helps hold my phone when I‚Äôm running
4.0,"This is so cute, but the size is rather small. Either my nose or my chin feels exposed. Does not fit close around sides of face. Good to keep in my purse for back up."
4.0,"I get complements on this all the time. It is not over the top or gaudy and looks really good with almost all business attire. I did have to adjust the second set of strings as there was not a large enough space between the two, they were basically laying in line with each other. But once I took out about 6 connecting rings in the second string it fell very nice on the neck. Good purchase!"
4.0,"This foam shoulder pad is durable but, for me it was to large even tough it says small size."
4.0,A fashionable cap ideal for any battle you need to win. I wear it to protect my head and eyes while I jog the streets and trails of my neighborhood. It curiously has a map of China inside the cap. I guess this would be useful if I ever got lost in China XD
4.0,Perfectly simple... just wish it could have been a few bucks cheaper seeing as though it is a very simple piece
4.0,The product was well made but just not what I though I wanted. Decided I didn't want a built-in liner so I returned. If you are looking for a long Board short with liner the these are good choice
4.0,I like the idea of it but haven‚Äôt decided if I honestly like the sleeves.  The trend might make me feel like the coat is too small.  It fits fine and jacket is decent this trend may just not be for me.
4.0,I thought there was nose rings but there wasn‚Äôt but overall I‚Äôm very satisfied.
4.0,It's not the color it shows. Has brown in it. Also its long but runs very small. I still wear it and get compliments often.
4.0,"This fit great across the chest, waist and hips, however i have broad shoulders and it just didn't work for me. Was bummed to return it"
4.0,cute swimming suit
4.0,"I usually wear a large but the large was way too big so I ordered a medium. It fit nicely but still was a little big but not much. Outfit looks like the pic, but it‚Äôs not cotton."
4.0,The clothing was alright
4.0,"Bought these for a Daredevil cosplay for my fiance. good quality. Easy to alter for the costume. Good size (big on me, but perfect for him)"
4.0,"Lots of volume, well-constructed, good design. Close to a dozen pockets I think. Very good for the price, although the pictures are incorrect; the color doesn't really blend from light to dark the way the photo shows, and there's a big huge ""SoarOwl"" embroidery that I wish wasn't there on the top, which seems to be airbrushed out in the photos..."
4.0,"husband said chereskin fit and quality is fine. I'm glad bought large in this (cotton, dryer etc.)<br />(had many ill-fitting experiences bought boxer for hubby ol @amazon;<br />his size is medium on all his boxer bought in usa;<br />the problem with many previous purchases different brand always crotch;<br />not cutting deep enough even when bought it in large<br />I think they made for teen or kids but advertised men)<br /><br />chereskin in the other hand is different story<br />they are accommodate husbands figure. no more pinch or shallow cutting crotch<br />the waistband is comfortable as well (bit loose as we bought large,<br />but good for his tummy scars cost from appendix surgery)<br />the cotton feels like flannel (but these are thin) so they will be good for autumn/fall<br />or working inside fully ac. Not for outdoor in countries that hot all year around<br />we keep it as they are good fit and quality and we travelling to countries<br />that having 4 seasons as well<br />highly recommend for your needs<br /><br />updating: september 2015 already bought another for hubby as he enjoy them"
4.0,Love how they look and how lightweight they are.  Only downside is that they don‚Äôt come with a case.
4.0,"It is an unlined canvas jacket.  Very tough for work wear.  Large fits. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô, 180. Fabric is treated for water repellency, but it isn‚Äôt a rain jacket. I‚Äôm happy I got it."
4.0,I bought the one that says &#34;Mum&#34; and received one that said &#34;Mom&#34;. It tarnished quickly too.<br /><br />I received this product t a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased  honest review
4.0,"I purchased two of these before heading out to Napa to wine taste. It's great that they travel flat on the way out, however they're HUGE once inflated. I ended up needing extra to get another bottle back and bought the flat bubblewrap WineSkin version for a couple bucks there. I packed all three in my clothes on the way back (the two VinniBags barely left enough room for the third WineSkin bottle across the width of my large suitcase) and all three made it back intact! In the future I'll buy the cheaper WineSkin version since they worked just as well (though they're supposed to be one-time use, it's nothing a little packing tape won't extend the life of if you open them carefully) and take up less space."
4.0,"They work just fine, but barley fit my 8 year old.  Hes little and skinny.  I had them all the way out."
4.0,Color of dress was pretty liked the buttons
4.0,"Fit well through the waist. I can tell that the zipper is a bit fragile and will bear some watching. I suggest loosening the ribbons in the back all the way, zipping it on, and then tightening. :) As mentioned by others the top is ridiculously large in the chest area. This would be helped considerably if the neck strap  was adjustable but sadly it isn't. I intend to fix that myself.<br /> Altogether a decent purchase for the price."
4.0,Strong fabric but you have to order a size up or 2 I order xxL  xxxL should fit perfect holds tummy real good
4.0,Beautiful starry night projection for my little niece's bedroom. (3 yrs) The whole family loves it.
4.0,Nice product for a good price
4.0,They are nice and the customer service was great as well
4.0,They are super cute and easy to get on but a little on the narrow side in the front so not comfortable for long term wear i use mine to get to work and change into more comfty shoes right away.
4.0,It's warm. It kept my seat dry. The bottom part of the zipper was a little difficult.
4.0,The skirt I received was fluffy and great quality but not quite what I needed. The company was easy to work with for a refund.
4.0,"Sheer Scarf for summer!  The white scarf and measures 20 inches by 60 inches.  The fabric is very soft and is also very, very sheer.  It is perfect for a head wrap or light neck scarf.  I also wore it around my shoulders with a sundress to protect me from the cold air conditioning.  I do not believe this scarf would offer protection from the sun due to the sheer fabric.  However, I did enjoy it as a head wrap and as protection from air conditioning.  Please note that I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I take pride in my reviews and stand behind them 100%."
4.0,Excellent investment would recommend this others
4.0,"Size XL: 5'5"" and 190 lbs I carry most of my weight in my abdomen and I have long legs (32"" inseam) so the dress looks shorter on me than others. I had to shorten the straps and the bra I am wearing is super padded so if you are like me and buy larger to accommodate a larger abdomen then you might have to adjust the chest a little, but otherwise it is really comfortable and I am happy with it."
4.0,It‚Äôs very comfortable and worth the money
4.0,"The product page says these jeans are comprised on 1% elastane, but I can't detect any stretch at all.  The material is durable jean material but non-stretchy.  I love the color and the distress is well done.  I normally wear 32 x 32 but I could barely squeeze into these.  My other 32 x 32  jeans are much looser.  These are much more like skinny than slim and if you normally wear a 32 think about upsizing unless your are really skinny.  I washed them in the normal cycle and they seemed to come out of the dryer o.k. but I wouldn't be able to tell if they shrank or not since I can't hardly get them on anyway."
4.0,I'm a large boned female and this was too small for my wrist. But I gave it to a friend and she loved it.
4.0,La calidad del producto y la puntualidad y manejo del mismo
4.0,"These socks are pretty and keep my legs warm in the wintertime. Unfortunately, they do have threads on the inside that get caught in your toes and make it hard to get the socks on. I hate that!"
4.0,"This simple, flat, fairly hard sandal, which I originally bought for shower use, turned out to be the cure for my plantar fasciitis.  So now I wear these almost everywhere.<br /><br />But if you are sensitive to fragrance, or go to places where chemically sensitive people go and fragrance is frowned upon, you might have to leave these sandals behind, because at least when new, they emit a powerful aroma of vanilla.<br /><br />I called the manufacturer to ask about the perfume, and they identified it as vanilla, and said it is intentional.  They said it will fade over time.  Two months later, I am still waiting for that to happen.  I believe it does eventually happen, because my first pair of these which I bought in a drugstore did not have any remaining vanilla scent."
4.0,"Good product and shipped faster than I expected.<br /><br />YES, it DOES run small!  All reviews are accurate, but it can be carefully modified (don't cringe, hear me out!).  I simply washed the garment on gentle cycle, then immediately took the semi-dry product (without putting in the dryer of course) and CAREFULLY stretched it to my liking.  lt is pretty sturdy of a knit (but still pretty loose knit) so it was easy to form it,  and then allowed it to dry on me completely just about as shown in the picture.<br /><br />I am around 6' tall man, and was not looking to use this product QUITE as advertised (more of an under-scarf with winter coats for the upper arm warmth) so it does not quite fashionably FLOW the way it would on a smaller frame, but I am sure it will work for most people with a little bit of stretching it around."
4.0,My early teenage daughter started listening to Kiss.  Classic T-Shirt style is perfect with jeans.
4.0,Nice heavy fabric and flattering design. I am a size 14 and 5'9&#34; an XL fit well except the waist is 3&#34; too high. Would rate it 5 stars if the waist was longer.
4.0,"These came looking pretty teeny, but they do stretch well amd fit me, I've gone from 240 down to 198 and they've fit the entire time. Which is honestly mostly shocking. So size wise these are awesome. They look really nice and wash well. I would buy these again for sure."
4.0,"Arrived quicker than estimated which was great, but were bigger than expected. Not bad, just can't use yet. But they are very nice."
4.0,Ordered for my average sized 6 year old. They fall right of her little butt. Will have to save them for next year.
4.0,"I got these to wear to a baby gender reveal party and then removed the color that the baby wasn't.  I have worn the pink one a few times since, although they are smaller scarves they make a nice addition with the right clothing/neckline.  I only gave them four stars because I'm not sure how well they wash up, I've only rinsed the pink one."
4.0,"I purchased these at a different store. Love the fit & feel. They don't stretch out or become misshapen {no baggy knees or fanny}. Wish there were pockets, but can live without, given the rest. I have the purple, green, & black.<br /><br />I accidentally melted plastic on the purple pair {don't ask}. Tried ironing w/paper & other recommended methods, nothing, so finally resorted to scrubbing the crap out of them w/a seriously stiff brush & goo gone. I was devastated thinking about how the oil would leave massive stains & the brushing would pill them irretrievably.<br /><br />Neither happened!! To my shock & amazement, they were as beautiful, vibrant, & strain free as the day I bought them! Practically indestructible, or so I thought.<br /><br />What finally killed them was portions filling w/air & floating a bit above the surface when I soaked them in ""color safe"" bleach. Seriously...that's what finally got them...like seriously?! Massive spots bleached out. I can't find any in purple to replace them to save my life. Live & learn, I guess."
4.0,"The description says it is size 7 US, but this is not a size 7. Make sure you get the next size up! Very upset when I opened the package because I needed them the next day! They were very adorable slippers!"
4.0,This is not a good pants if you have a big booty or cellulite.  I can see my cellulite on the back thighs.  And it is all wrong if you have a big bottom.  I thought the booty lifting feature would be good but it does nothing for me.  Maybe on slimmer gals with small bottoms.  Also because it is not good for bigger bottoms the waist sits on hips not high waisted.
4.0,I ordered a size up as advised by other reviewers. A good thing cause a large would definitely not have been able to go on. I'm 160lbs  and 36D. The xl fits though exact across the chest. This is polyester so no stretch at all. All in all a fairly good purchase
4.0,Works good but the screw holding the arms lossens regualarly.
4.0,Was the color shown. Fit is not true to tag I got the biggest size and it definitely was not that size. Runs small but it still works for me. Just doesn't close in the front like it should!
4.0,Pendant too heavy and too big. Boyfriend did not like that. Want refund.
4.0,does not match ring. they are ok for evening wear.
4.0,"I gave it a 4 only because it said to size down and it was too small. But, I'm ordering a replacement in a medium."
4.0,Very pretty shirt and nice material. Normally wear a large and bought xxl because reviews state that it runs small. Xxl fits like a medium.
4.0,Washed it and it still looks good.
4.0,"I bought this for my wife, she loves Predator items.  She hooked it to her purse and the tusks broke off the same day.  She left it on about a week or so and it continued to chip so she took it off.  She likes the look but it breaks easy.  Not too threatening looking without his tusks."
4.0,"Nice dress- too small for my preference. Long enough but not far enough around. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 160, bought a medium. Wanted something airy that I could easily nurse in. Would work fairly well but definitely need a cami as it‚Äôs too low cut to wear just alone. Does have a cotton-y liner on upper part of dress so it‚Äôs nots too sheer. Heavier material than expected looks like it would wash well. Returning and will order a large."
4.0,Very nice! But do not shower with it. It will turn your neck green.
4.0,"This is a nice cotton round piece with a beautiful pattern.  It works at the beach the way a sheet would, but it is MUCH cuter.  It also folds up super small so it easily fits into a purse.  It is not a large piece but suitable for one person to sit on or two if you like to be close.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Great quality for the price! Matches perfectly with my watch. The only thing I'm concerned about is the band that holds the flap down- it seems like it could break easily, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Otherwise, it's pretty solidly made."
4.0,"My son uses these to wear under his gymnastics shorts so being somewhat small isn't an issue for him, he is very skinny. I can't say that they would work well as just shorts though due to them being on the small side."
4.0,Coronavirus protection
4.0,Zipper in the back worked great for my girlfriends ponytail! Still fit alittle funny though
4.0,"I received good service. I am a men‚Äôs medium (37-38‚Äù chest).  The manufacturer contacted me personally and recommended that I buy the 40‚Äù size, so I followed that advice. I was impressed by the personal communication.  The shirt arrived quite promptly, which is also impressive, since it was shipped from China.  I guess it was sent air freight because it could not have reached that fast by ship.  The shirt fits snugly after the first wash and dry.  The sleeves are a bit short on me, but I have long arms. The fabric is on the heavy side and the colors seem true. Overall I am satisfied."
4.0,I thought the photo did a nice job with making the material look pretty.  The one I received was almost a washed out pattern.  It did fit well and was still cute under a jacket.
4.0,"What a disappointment.  I loved TEROX's flip flops and wear them all the time but these sandals are awful.  The straps have sharp edges that dig into my little toes.  Maybe they would be okay with socks.  Sorry I bought them.  A total waste of money.<br /><br />6-27-14  Well, not quite a total waste of money it seems.  I donated my pair to a monastery of Poor Clare Nuns and they liked them so much they asked me to get them two more pairs.  So I guess they do fit some peoples' feet, just not mine.  They are a big hit with the nuns who usually go barefoot."
4.0,"loved this dress, bought it in 2 colors, it fits perfect throughout. perfect for work or play."
4.0,"I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER.  I AM TRUSTING IT WORKS AS STATED.  I HAVEN'T USED IT YET SINCE I DECIDED THE SHOES I WAS GOING TO USE IT ON WERE RETURNED. I FOUND THEM TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO KEEP.  I WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD NOT STRETCH AS MUCH AS I MIGHT HAVE NEEDED.  NOT TO WORRY, I SHALL KEEP THIS INTERESTING PRODUCT (SHINE) AND GIVE IT A TRY ANOTHER TIME.  THANK YOU."
4.0,"The only thing with this dress is that it is not as long as I expected. I am a 5'11 woman. I usually wear maxis below not above my ankle. Otherwise, the dress is flattering and my husband loves it, so I got two more. The material is great and forgiving. I love it"
4.0,I love these shoes but the soles are so soft they wear out quickly. I love them so much I just deal with it and buy another pair. Great for wider feet!
4.0,Good support for a working nurse on her feetüòâ
4.0,"It‚Äôs VERY warm! A little tighter than I expected, but I love it!"
4.0,Cute and look nice for the price!
4.0,"Ok so i am 5-3 150lbs and ordered a medium. It fits a tiny bit looser than I would‚Äôve liked, but not enough to return it for a small. Also, the color is a little more neon (if u will) than I imagined per the photo, but still very nice for summer. Its polyester, but fabric is pretty thick, not see through. Overall, cute outfit for a day out walking at a festival or maybe an outdoor party."
4.0,Runs big.  I would order a size down but very nice quality.
4.0,Quality pack for the price.  Have done 3 hikes with it and it is comfortable and handles the 30-35 pound loads well.  Will be upping the weight in a bit so hope it does as well<br /><br />Would LOVE to see a gear loop set on the front for clipping carabiners to.
4.0,"Good fit,  good quality,  gave 4 because the color is a little off."
4.0,"It's cute my daughter will like it for Christmas, but it's a bit thinner than I expected."
4.0,"I recently purchased these glasses a second time, in red this time. They are sturdy with flexible temples and adjustable nose pads. It's nice not to have to have them ride low on the nose like granny glasses. Different strengths allow me to focus for reading and at intermediate distance for computer work. I could use even stronger power for really close work, but 3.00 is the highest these come. The price is greater than drugstore readers, but the quality is better than those cheap ones."
4.0,"I‚Äôm disappointed in the Lavender color so I gave this bag 4 stars.  The color is much more blue then purple.  Otherwise, excellent bag! Lots of interior pockets which I LOVE for organizing.  Quality seems very durable."
4.0,"Not the type of fabric I thought they'd be, but still adorable and comfortable!"
4.0,Good quality for the price. Stretch material. Wasn't long as I thought came a little above the ankle. If your a taller girl check the measurements before ordering
4.0,"I have to say, there isn't a lot to this watch, there's no bells, no whistles, no smart connection to your phone.... instead you have a watch of classic simple elegance that pairs well with casual or evening attire.  It defines class."
4.0,Loved the color and quality. My baby is a little on the thin side and the shoulders fall off her but other then that it fits perfect.
4.0,It‚Äôs an alright product but fair warning if your head is to big then this product is not for you other than that its fine and comfortable.
4.0,"Cute sandals, but my son is a size 4. I ordered a size 5 and they fit just right. But I wanted to order them a little bigger. So I wished I would have ordered a size 6. But other than that they are nicely made."
4.0,"Pretty good deal...A little small but that is OK! Since it was kind of free, I cannot complain! I am sorry folks but I am not going to write a novella!"
4.0,It took longer than it said to get here but it's a great choker
4.0,"I ordered a small because I wanted the pjs to be a bit loose but they were way too big. I'm a thin 5'3 and a small could very well fit someone 15 pounds heavier and 4 inches taller. I just ordered the xsmall, hopefully that will fit better. The bottoms for the feet are also rather big and baggy. Returned and reordered the extra small and they fit much better. Still a bit long, I ended up cutting off the feet. But they fit much better than the small."
4.0,"We got the assorted colors but I don't see them listed right now.  They are colorful and made of heavy polyester.  The adjustable band is hook and loop.  The workmanship is okay but not great.  A few wrinkles on the inside of the brim.  There are six panels with a very small ventilation hole in each.  The fit is good but they are a little taller than I like.  The price varies depending on the color/quantity but overall, a good value per hat."
4.0,"Very sexy on my wife, easily washable.  wish shed wear it more often."
4.0,So cute! Exactly what we wanted.
4.0,light and thin for summer and looks like a shirt material but it is thinner and very breathable I am not certain if they are helpful for protection  however if you got to wear a mask I think these are great!
4.0,The jacket is so pretty. But very tight on the back and arms. I had to return the 1st order and reorder one in one size up.
4.0,It's the perfect length for me. Just barely above my knee
4.0,As described. I think going one size up would be ideal especially when wearing layers.
4.0,This was too big and I wanted to return it. I let the deadline go pass but I can't wear it. Can I still return it please.
4.0,they work and are easy to use.
4.0,LOVE THESE LEGGINGS THE QUALITY IS OKAY AND THE FIT IS NICE
4.0,Fits good very adjustable looks great
4.0,The sleeves are really long but other than that the dress is really cute and you will need a  full slip or shape ware because it shows every imperfect perfection your body has!!!
4.0,"I bought the medium size glasses, and it was a bit too big on my face. My face is pretty big and yet the glasses were still pretty big, so I suggest that for most people, I think you should order a small instead! Overall, I would say the glasses are pretty good, but the only problem is that they are kind of malleable so it would get out of shape of one were to sit on it! Other than that, I would have to say the glasses were pretty good."
4.0,I would have given these a 5 but the lever back hanger is too thick. It‚Äôs almost painful to try and get them in my ears. I was disappointed because everything else is so great about the earrings.
4.0,"Mi daughter is 8 years old and has a normal size for her age, I ordered the size 140 and it fit, but it seems that she will not be able to wear it in less than a year. The material and color are great"
4.0,I am 5'6&#34; 129 lbs 35x26x38 and got the small.  All in all it fit well but the neck was a bit lose so I tailored that.  It does not specify length in the description but on me it fit right to the top of my knee.  I would have preferred it to hit in the middle or below my knee but as it still looks good I am keeping it.
4.0,"Nice dress, good material"
4.0,"Loved the way it looked and the way it fit. Unfortunately, the snap at the neckline interferes with the bow at the neckline and I will have to move one of them."
4.0,Good product fair price
4.0,"These were a gift so I didn't try them on, but they look really nice. I felt good giving them as they look expensive :)"
4.0,"They are beautiful and wen very nicely with my outfit. However, the hook that attaches the upper and lower half of the earrings needed to be tighten in order for the bottom not to fall off"
4.0,Nice get compliments
4.0,Bought this for my daughter to wear in my SIL's wedding.  I got the ivory and the picture doest show any beading (some colors show it with) however it came with a beaded appliqu√© that cannot be removed without ruining the dress.  Not crazy about it but it isn't bad so we are keeping it.
4.0,"For reference, I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 199lbs. The 2x was a fit and does hug the body (even the problem areas), but it‚Äôs not too tight. I‚Äôm wearing shape wear in this image. The dress is true red."
4.0,"I bought these for my niece. Earrings have been irritating her ears and we've been trying a lot of brands. We didn't know if they were agitating the inside of the ear or if the posts were poking her skin. Anywho, she's been wearing these for a few days and hasn't complained once. I've asked if her ears are itching or soar and she says no and that she likes the earrings. I took away a star because my niece loves pink. Unfortunately, the rose gold earrings were not included and the iridescent earrings are more blue than pink. So, the 2nd reason I picked this set proved disappointing. It the company sold adult lengthed posts for earlobes, I would buy again for myself. These posts seem best suited for children and/or the upper ear."
4.0,"Well made but a little on the small side, good for a sports bra, light weight"
4.0,I like that the waistline comes up high enough that it covers my tummy and does not roll!
4.0,"I am 5' 6"" 148 lbs, and 36C bra, and this is the medium on me (after first wash and dried in the dryer).  The color is also brighter than the listing picture or my pictures show."
4.0,"I usually wear a medium. I had to get a large for the dress to be able to zip, and I am very small chested."
4.0,Material is a little see through and synthetic but overall a great fit and a great price!
4.0,I Like the style. and it's cheap
4.0,"The first week I wore it I got a complement from another guy wearing that style of hat. I bought it because its heavy wool and is warm and keeps the seattle rain off of my head. It is a bit small, i ordered a medium and should have gotten a large. These caps seem to vary from manufacturer to manufacturer in size and fit. It is well made."
4.0,"The quality of this dress is really good for $19.99. I am 140 pounds, I ordered a small, and it fits very nice. I ordered the dress for church, and it fits just right, not tight at all."
4.0,Everything I expected. Great gift. Chain I wish was a little longer but other than that it is ok
4.0,"Great Product!! very useful, good quality, i love it, the price it is ok, and the size two. I will buy it again!!"
4.0,I got it for my girlfriend and she loves it. She wears it every day and its still going strong.
4.0,Made of good material. They are a little bigger then I thought they would be. Slightly too big for my tragus in my opinion. They would be cuter if they were smaller.
4.0,Love this belt!! I wish it was a little tiny bit bigger but it‚Äôs not bad!!!
4.0,"Wasn't exactly what I was looking for (synthetic braided belt), but was a nice - decently priced - alternative.  Looks good with jeans, and more importantly keeps them in place."
4.0,Product style is but this is tiny
4.0,super cute for the price!! decent size and quality too
4.0,Loved the fit of the dress.  Did have a few scratches from the sequins.  Overall good buy.
4.0,"I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter. It's very cute and dainty, and it's not too much for a little girl...but ours broke about 2-3 weeks after we purchased it. Maybe the quality is a little poor and can be a little more durable but it's a cute item."
4.0,Nicely designed; soft fabric with a snug fit ‚Äî should keep my ears nice and warm during outdoor runs in cold weather. Doesn't hurt that it's also pretty cute.
4.0,Casino gambling
4.0,"The dress is comfy.  However I read through a lot of reviews and decided to order a Medium instead of a Small because I didn't want it to be clingy.<br />This dress is not clingy.  A medium is big and the arm holes hang down and expose the sides of my bra, etc.<br />The length is perfect as I am 5'1.<br />I love that it has pockets and the fabric is not thin but breathable.<br />I would order again but I would order a small."
4.0,"SOME FIT AS EXPECTED AND SOME WHERE SOMEWHAT SMALL.  SIZES IN PACKAGE SEEM TO VARY.  MOST WHERE JUST ENOUGH MATERIAL;  WHILE OTHERS HAD LITTLE MATERIAL , NOT ENOUGH TO COVER YOUR FOOT.  I WOULD HAVE SENT THEM  BACK , BUT I DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THE SIZE DIFFERENCE UNTIL I HAD ALREADY WORN THREE PAIR.  WHAT A SHAME -  SUCH NICE SOCKS, BUT I WANT ALL OF THEM TO FIT."
4.0,These are not glass but they look nice enough and are perfect if you have multiple ear piercings. The backings are rubber but I like them. The earrings don't slip out and they're not hard to take out of ears
4.0,"Size runs kinda small, but i have small wrists so it's ok for me. Also, it makes ticking sound which drove me crazy until i realized it was coming from watch. Lol."
4.0,pro's<br /><br />surprisingly really soft thought it would be rope or carpet like<br />pretty warm<br />just like a Oneise<br /><br />con's<br /><br />Not that thick<br />got it bigger but tight on torso and chest makes my confidence goüìâüìâ<br />shoe coverings don't really fit
4.0,I ordered these for my husband two sizes larger than he wears and they are snug because they are full of soft cushy material.  The leather detail on the side tore off after a few wears around the house.
4.0,I'm using this liner under my CPAP headgear and it is light and durable. It fits very well. I chose the white one so that it won't bleed any dye on my pillow case.
4.0,Nice necklace. Few strings loose when arrived. Unique style.
4.0,"Favorite pair of glasses. I would use these as my riding glasses, especially for night time rides. Night time has bright greenish hue so you can see pretty good. Doesn't block wind very well but look great. Had these guys for months and held up, until my cousin sat on them. Buying my 2nd pair now."
4.0,Top bodice is baggie and shows lining<br />As it sags
4.0,"Bought this for my wife. She really likes it. The only reason I knocked a star off is because it is a little difficult to see that there are butterflies on it. Could be a tad bigger, or maybe it's just because I am getting a little older and eyes are not working as good."
4.0,The quality is okay for the price of 3 items. The earrings are somewhat heavy.
4.0,"Muy bien, como lo esperaba. Buen material."
4.0,Love the look.  The length was good but the shoe is too wide.  Disappointed.  Had to send back.
4.0,Very nice gloves. Totally recommend
4.0,Love it looked great with the dress I wore it with.  Got plenty of compliments and for the price I couldn't beat it
4.0,It's okay.  The Glass scratched the very first day.  :(
4.0,Like this sweater a lot except that you're not supposed to dry it in the dryer and it's always wrinkled.
4.0,"Its a good product, the size chart is off. A few pieces were missing but nothing superstantule but over all a good product"
4.0,"Super cute.  I'm a petite woman 5'3 97lbs. Since swimsuits run small, i ordered the 40 (4-6)and it fits perfectly! ! I can't wait to wear it to the beach."
4.0,This tee is unique (I really like to be unique).
4.0,"A bit thin in a cold wind.  Otherwise, very comfortable."
4.0,This is pretty but not real sturdy made.
4.0,Tight stretch but comfortable and light would have given 5 stars if the filter didn't moving and folding in the pouch.
4.0,I like that it is easy to custom fit the length to suit my needs. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because you need a super sharp scissors/tool to cut the thick leather. It is a good quality for the price.
4.0,Nice bag little smaller than anticipated
4.0,"I have had this for almost 3 years. It has held up very well with my busy life. Only small dislike: I am tall-ish.... and the strap is just a little shorter than I would like . Plenty of room for a 7in tablet, journal notebook.... or some basic baby supplies.... or just all your average purse junk lol"
4.0,This fits nicely.  Good length.  It's more of a plum color than the bright purple color in the picture.  So I have to decide if I can still use it.
4.0,The coat has longer sleeves than some. In my case that is a good thing.
4.0,Cheap but for the price oh well.
4.0,"Very soft fabric, fits perfectly ü•∞"
4.0,Beautiful color and perfect size. Post bent a bit but no big deal.
4.0,"Es suave,igual que la foto, los colores, la correa es muy larga y me laColoco en el√öltimoBot√≥n as√≠ que sobra bastante"
4.0,Well worth what you pay for it . It's not the top of the line but it will last if you take care of it .
4.0,"I originally ordered this dressed based off the reviews even though the size chart recommended something different. I am 5'7&#34;, 190lbs, and wear at 40D. The XL was WAAAAY too small. The XXL fit, but was snug in the arms and chest. The dress does not come down as low on the waist as pictured.<br /><br />Also, the zipper in both dresses I ordered was defective and I had to leave it zipped so I could pull the dress on and off, otherwise it would not zip.<br /><br />The material is polyester like and I do not think it will survive more than a handful of wears. However I got plenty of compliments on it at the event I wore the dress to."
4.0,Light weight & comfy!
4.0,Great shirt and I get lots of compliments on it. I would say buy a size bigger or 2 cause it will shrink.
4.0,I just received it and haven't changed purses yet.  It looks like it is going to work for me and I love the way it looks.
4.0,I likr the fact that I can adjust an auto time-showing every couple of minutes ...<br /><br />It is kind of heavy but really cool watch
4.0,They are a little small but seem to be a good sock
4.0,"Shirt was cute, fit nice, just thin but what I expected"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8723664eafe5f1332cc94d6877d29dec]] It looks really pretty when it's on. The fabric stretches nicely for a good fit. I normally wear size 6-8 but I'm 5'11&quot; so I ordered large but that was pulling cause I'm so tall.  It was easy to return and I got size XL and that was a nice fit. Feels comfortable but the quality isn't that great but hey, what else can you buy for under $15? For this price I think it's perfect! It's transparent so you'll probably need either a bra or silicone bra or nipple cover if you don't want to be exposed but if you just want to we are it at home for a special someone then the body is perfectly enough.<br />I would recommend ordering 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear and you'll be all set."
4.0,"For the price, these are very nice earrings.  My daughter has not had them long enough to comment on how long they will last.  I would recommend them and I would buy them again."
4.0,"Nightgown runs large, should have ordered a M instead if a L.<br />Quality seems good. Fabric is a heavier cotton than I expected."
4.0,These are beautiful boots.  Look very quality and I really like the fact I can use the buckles to make the shafts smaller to fit my legs.  I put my inserts in them to give them more arch support and the are more comfortable now too.  They are not as padded as I had hoped.  I also knocked off a star because the picture shows them to be a very dark brown and they are more of a saddle brown.  I liked them well enough to keep them though.
4.0,"Great  Shirts, but tend to run small... I ordered another in  a larger size."
4.0,My second pair of these. The first pair are still good but a little worn so I am wearing them around the house and when putzing outside. The new ones I wear to the store or out for the evening. OK with slacks and great with jeans etc. Good arch/insole and durable.
4.0,Fits nice except for the boob area. It's a little snug. I removed the pads and that helped some. Nice soft material and side pockets.
4.0,This purse is reliable and sturdy. It can fit all my stuff in it which is great.
4.0,"I bought an XL and thought it actually ran a little small. Plus, the quality of the cotton is so-so. I‚Äôd expect a little better quality from adidas. But overall, not bad, looks good. I would buy a size bigger next time as I expect it will shrink. Again, overall it‚Äôs pretty nice for the $."
4.0,Cute!! Definitely a lower quality item judging by the details of it. But that is totally overshadowed by how cute It is.
4.0,"It really is as described and pictured, but felt a bit small to me. I ordered a medium based chart, and probably dose fit correct. I wanted more material around side and back. And the color was more bubble gum than the lighter pink I was expecting. For reference I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 145, 34B. I personally would size up, but could have gotten away with the medium. Mostly returning for the color."
4.0,"Gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it. The clear face allows it to go with any outfit and you can dress it up or down. The band is nice at first, but after a little use it starts to make the watch look cheap. He'll need a new one soon if the wear continues."
4.0,Very pretty. Came in good time. The sash on the gold dress does not match the ribbon to lace up dress and straps. Color a bit off. Other than that pleased
4.0,This set more than covers the bases
4.0,"I had to return only because it was too short in the tummy. When I lifted my hands up in the air, skin would show and I couldn't get it to look right with a long tank underneath. I wish I could get a longer version of this exact top. It was lovely. I'll have to keep an eye on this seller to see if they have anything longer in the future!"
4.0,"Nice skirt, great for Fall. I am 6 feet tall and weigh 150."
4.0,Love everything about this except for the padding sewn in. The padding is poor quality and I ended up cutting the fabric to remove the pads.
4.0,Comfy and light. Perfect to wear around the house on a hot day after showering.
4.0,Wish the trap can make stronger
4.0,"Nice, well-made, soft top. Just a wee bit smaller than I had expected."
4.0,"It does run a bit small, but I do fit in it. Will wear once I lose a few more pounds!"
4.0,"The tint of these is pretty light, as you can see by the photo. They're better for overcast days than bright sun. They're comfortable, and many people have commented how cute they are."
4.0,"Super cute, but tight. Stretches, but with big boobs it's kinda hard..."
4.0,These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
4.0,Fits good except the arms are to tight
4.0,Pants fit perfect but the top is tight<br />I wish we could choose the size of the top<br />It would look great together<br /><br />I will still give it a 4 star because I like it<br />Minus 1 star because the top is to tight<br /><br />I weight 214 and I am 5‚Äô10<br />I got this in a xl
4.0,Average gloves.  Get the job done.
4.0,"Someone else mentioned that it was small - it's tiny, maybe a half inch tiny. But it is cute and it's just a prop for a costume so I'll make it work."
4.0,Love this but I‚Äôm a 34/36 inch waist and I can‚Äôt fit into a 38. I went with the 38 just to be safe because I read the reviews but I have to return it for a 40 now.  If you can figure out the sizing it is well worth it. Great quality. Very nice.
4.0,"This sweater is only good for fall or spring season......  it wouldn‚Äôt work fro winter wqw in because if too thin fabric  wouldn‚Äôt keep you warm,,,,  if you want to wear it during winter time wear  nice jacket or suit along with this too, good luck!"
4.0,Should have gone for larger size but they are loved by my daughter
4.0,Love thi dress
4.0,They are really cute! Not too heavy. Glamorous :)
4.0,Great watch band fits watch great easy to install!
4.0,I was super excited when I received my scarf until i opened the package. The scarf isnt like the picture sadly. Its a beautiful scarf but the red is much brighter and the yellow is closer to neon green sadly. This scarf is very large and exceptionally soft though! Definitely recommend ordering this. Ill be ordering another one in a different color in hopes i get one closer to the picture.
4.0,If you like skinny jeans these are the ones to cop
4.0,Love the style. Light enough to not pull your earlobe down which is a big plus. However I bought these because I have sensitive ears and can't wear anything but gold. The gold plating on these ends at the stud..which is the part that goes in my ear -_- Description doesn't state that and hard to tell from pictures.
4.0,Lenses scratched
4.0,"Capezio is a trustworthy brand and their products are of great quality, however this particular leo runs VERY small... I would say 2 sizes smaller than advertised. After much trading in and up-sizing, we found that the XL fits a girl who normally would wear a Medium perfectly. It is very well made and seems that it will last."
4.0,My son loved it. It is good quality and good fabric.
4.0,It's a good product but being big chested it's didn't give my breast the upliftment I want
4.0,"I got this outfit for my son, and it's super cute! The only thing is that it runs a tad bit small. I ordered a 6t for my son because I wanted him to have some room to grow (he's 5), but it's firs now pretty well, there's just not much room to grow. I really like the stretchy material of the shorts. Gives an active boy freedom to run around and be crazy. The shirt is made of a nice, breathable material. The colors are very vibrant, and haven't faded through the wash twice. The stitching is all done very well also, no frays, or breaks in the seams. The button up collar isn't too tight either which is nice. Doesn't irritate the skin.<br /><br />I recieved this item for free in exchange for my honest, and unbiased opinion."
4.0,A little tight but it‚Äôs loosens up later.  I like it
4.0,A bit of a crude cut but I like it!
4.0,"I honestly don't remember what I paid for it, but it was a nice scarf."
4.0,I am very happy with my boots.
4.0,The only reason I didnt give this dress 5 stars was because of the material used.
4.0,Beware that this is very see through sheer.  You will want to wear a cami under it.
4.0,I got small and it fit as a small. Just wish it was a tad bit shorter in length but it‚Äôll do. The light pink is a muted bubblegum pink.
4.0,The mask looked amazing! I have a larger head so I needed to loosen the straps almost all the way. Not very comfortable on the nose. I think it would fit really well for people with a smaller face. I have a longer face so while it still looked great it was very uncomfortable at least for me. I would really recommend it to others.
4.0,"This is a sweet little gift to inspire someone. Makes a great any occasion gift. It is flimsy due to the coated string, so I don't think it would last long if worn on a daily basis. But, it is easy to wear and lightweight.<br /><br />The sentiment is lovely."
4.0,Band looks great just need a couple of extra links so the guys with larger wrist can wear it comfortably. Overall very stylish and good looking. I've gotten great compliments from people who have seen it.
4.0,"These are comfortable but loose fitting, there is no wire inside to form around the bridge of the nose. These are are also pretty loose if you have a smaller face. In my opinion these better fit larger faces but still tend to slip down a bit. They're not bad for the price though."
4.0,"My son has these shoes - they are awesome and we are looking for another pair, however, the price from this distributor (plus over $16 for shipping because the item is listed as weighing over 11 pounds?) is OUTRAGEOUS.  The most expensive off-sale pair of these shoes sells anywhere else for $34, and they go for as low as $28 with free shipping at other online sites.  Ridiculous."
4.0,seems slippery.... might be because I'm use to the bulkier bases... very pretty
4.0,This is much nicer than I expected!  Fits well and is colorful.  I would recommend this to a friend.
4.0,A bit smaller than expected. Still a good fit. Pretty color combination. Very comfortable.
4.0,"Shirt arrived on time and of good quality.  I was a little worried about it being too short after reading the reviews, but it was perfect (I'm 5'6&#34;)."
4.0,"I really like the Jogger sets they are of good quality for the price, the only thing I found wrong with them is that one of the sets jacket had a dirty sleeve.  I had to put it in the wash before I could give it to my granddaughter for her birthday.  It looked like it had been dragged onto a dirty floor, that's why I gave four stars instead of five."
4.0,exactly what I needed! good quality
4.0,I ordered a pair of these for my wife several months ago. She liked them so much she wanted me to order another pair recently. She says they fit great and work awesome!
4.0,"I ordered this blouse for My girlfriend and even though she's somewhat tall @ 5'7&#34;, this top looked too big for her.  The shoulders fit fine and the neck line didn't Hang too low, but the length and weight was too much.  The colors are pretty and I'm sure it all comes down to body type because My sister tried it on and it looked fabulous.  The sister is a little heavier, but I'd never tell her that, and if you see this review remember I said it looked fabulous.  It arrived nicely packed and on time."
4.0,little tight but other wize good
4.0,like but post are really large
4.0,"Comfortable , fits well."
4.0,It is a really neat mask and it does exactly what it's told. What's keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that there isn't a clear indication whether the mask is on or off. The switch on the box is not labeled.
4.0,"Pro: Beautiful shirt. Soft material, Size S (5'4/120lb) fit like the model, (only very long.) I received plenty of compliments the first time I wore it... get it!<br /><br />Cons: It's longer than pictured and WASH WITH CAUTION. I'm bummed that once it was washed and dried the seams twisted so they cross over the front with the hem twisted incorrectly at the waist -  now it's awkward and unwearable. :-/ Soooo... don't put it in the dryer."
4.0,"The style and colors of these are excellent. They were a little on the big side, but still wearable for my 12 month old and he will grow into them very well. I took one star because they aren't quite as grippy as some of his other socks. I still see him slipping in these sometimes."
4.0,"I thought that it would fit a bit bigger than normal beanies (because normal beanies usually don't cover enough for me). This one covers a little more but when I pull it down to cover half of my ears, it is no longer slouchy. It stretches very easily and doesn't seem to take it's form back to its original size."
4.0,"Only downfall is, it‚Äôs not a dark tint it actually shows in a bluish glare. Messes w sight a bit"
4.0,Beautiful socks!! They could be used for working out and they‚Äôre probably comfortable and I think I need to get a larger size.
4.0,"The dress was missing the hole to run the string through for the wrap, but I was able to cut one and make it work."
4.0,"These are your basic socks at a good price for little ones. They aren't thick, so not ideal for winter- but otherwise they work just fine."
4.0,the leather is a bit stiff. other than that..its a nice watch
4.0,"Really like the release button for this belt, better than other ratchet belts I've used. The buckle however already has quite a few marks in it from light use wearing only in an office environment. Disappointed in that. Was hoping would last longer. This is on the black belt with duller silver buckle."
4.0,"Nice weight to it, love the sparkle."
4.0,Smaller than I expected.  Has 2 interior pockets for phone and glasses or slim wallet.  Also large zip pocket and large open drop pocket up front to drop keys for easy access.
4.0,"My issues with the nose screw have more to do with my inexperience with putting a nose screw back IN, it was difficult and took me almost a half hour to do it.  It is super tiny so the stone isn't as brilliant and pretty as in the picture, but I like it nonetheless.  Thanks!"
4.0,"I got these for my niece and she loves them. While they don't have a ton of padding in the shoes, she says that they are comfortable. They loves the color and the little rhinestones. They do have some traction but I don't think they would be the best in a slippery situation. They slip on easily as well. Cute shoes."
4.0,"I haven't had a chance yet to wear, but the blouse seems to hang quite nicely.  It isn't as noticeably large as it actually is due to the material, but rather seems to have a flattering drape.  I love over-sized, comfortable blouses and this appears  as if it is going to 'fit the bill'.  It arrived very quickly and appears to be excellent quality.  I selected &#34;fit as expected&#34; because I knew it was going to be very large - but it is, very large (and I'm a large woman).  As a larger, busty woman, I appreciate finding clothing that fits yet is fashionable.<br />I will update my review after I've had an opportunity to wash and wear.  I'm going to take it on vacation, so I'll see how well it packs.  It does not appear as if it will wrinkle, which will make it nice for traveling.  One more note - the blouse did not arrive with the chemical / harsh smell that some items bought online often have."
4.0,"Just got this product today. It was packaged well and it looked good for the price!  The only negative is that the chain feels like it will break any second.. It's a really cheap material. Over all, I am pleased with my new clutch, and can't wait to wear it!!"
4.0,"Beautiful colors, just am curvey and is a little tight fitting....am a DD on top. So have to wear with sonething under it"
4.0,My daughter looks so adorable in this dress. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs pretty thin but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs cold right now it would be perfect for a summer birthday!
4.0,"This is a comfortable sports/sleep bra, but not so easy to get off & on. I had to pull it down & step out of it to get it off. Wish I'd ordered one that zips in the front. Other than that, no complaints, & it's a good buy."
4.0,"just received yesterday. shipping was fine, looks nice. Item appears as described. Lots of room for a toddler suitcase, and backpack is a nice addition. have not used yet so I cannot speak to durability. Hopefully it will hold up nicely once we start using it."
4.0,its quality
4.0,"As the title states, the wallet works great I especially like the combo bottle opener/ money clip, and the only reason I took a one star away from the overall ratings is the fact that the pockets are a little tight for the cards, so it can be a struggle to get them in and out on occasion.<br /><br />Its good quality material and has held up quite well despite how rough I am usually on any wallet that I use."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful glasses.  MY ISSUE:  not enough height for progressive.  They are my computer and go to glasses.  I get compliments all of the time.  Bvlgari makes great eye glasses!
4.0,i got the wrong size
4.0,"Second time ordering them, transition works great. They do fog up sometimes."
4.0,"Compresses really well. I was on the border between a medium and a large size, but based on reviews, I ordered the medium ones. They are hard to get on. Likely impossible for anyone with arthritic fingers. After a while, you forget you're wearing them. I'd recommend removing them every few hours or so, because I did notice they were making my ankles swell a bit. I've only used them for rehabbing so far, but I'll try them for a workout when I'm brave enough to try running again."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful. The clarity of the stone is wonderful. I have purchased quite a few of these<br />these rings in remembrance of a family member. Everyone was thrilled with their ring which was in their own birth stone.
4.0,"The length was too long. And harem pants are hard to hem. But the design is cute. I might just have to make them into harem capris, and make it a new fashion statement üëå"
4.0,Love the shirt but it‚Äôs too small
4.0,"I got the grey color, listened to the reviews to order a size up, fits great, ordered another in black, it can be worn with the cris cross in the back, fabric could be a bit lighter"
4.0,This fit as expected actually. It is meant to be short and as I am 5 ft 2'' it was not so bad. There were odd strings to cut off but nicely made.
4.0,Size was a little small around the arm holes and chest for xl
4.0,"The jacket fitted as a glove. Excellent, no problem at all. There was only a little problem with the colour, but the seller sorted it out imediately. He just sent another jacket. Therefore, just fine."
4.0,didnt like the way they feel
4.0,Super nice quality. Exceeded expectations ! Goo buy for the price. Seems to be holding up well. Five stars if it had access hole to slide out Driving license(have to dig it out).
4.0,"Fits great and feels comfortable. They came in a padded envelope and the box inside was squished, luckily my glasses weren't damaged."
4.0,Warm and toasty are the words my 7year old would use to describe his house shoes. They're light weight so there are no loud footsteps when he's walking. I line them!
4.0,"I have mix feelings about these shoes.<br />I feel in love with these shoes as soon as I saw it. It was everything that I was looking for. Black wedge shoes that look comfortable, have some height, but not too high (for long wear comfort). So I did not hesitate to buy these despite the price. Because that is how much good shoes costs nowadays...just go to Nordstrom.<br />So as soon as it arrived I tried it on. It was comfortable for the first 15 minutes. And after 30 min of walking around, these shoes are starting to hurt. The top of the shoes keep cutting into the back of my ankles. I was wearing socks too.<br />Maybe I will try putting some gel insoles to make it more comfortable. The height is about 2.5in. Exactly what I wanted.<br />The style I love. Goes with everything. Great for work or play.<br />Maybe I need to wear the shoes in more and maybe the materials will soften up and become less stiff and cut into me."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. The color is what I expected and hoped for (green). I bought medium, and it's tight. I bought a medium in another Knitee dress so I hoped this would fit the same, but it doesn't. I can zip it and everything, but it's very, very snug and shows my rounded belly way too much. Considering exchanging it unless I think I can lose a few lbs before my event."
4.0,Loved the skirt ! Only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars is because the material is a little thin and it does run small . So glad I read the reviews first and sized up . I usually wear a size M but I went up to a size Large .
4.0,Overall great product! Definitely buying more soon.
4.0,"I do love the pattern on this backpack and the quality seems of high quality.  I am waiting until Spring to bring it out, but I do think it is bigger than I needed and think it won't be used as a purse like I had thought.  I don't fill my purses much, a wallet, make up and small calendar book with cell phone.  The bag slumps over because it is only half filled.  So, if packing for a trip for the day (where you would bring snacks, water, and maybe a change of shirt, or hat), this bag will be perfect.  A little to big for my needs at the moment, but so pretty in person."
4.0,"Product is good.  I love that there are a lot of velcro around the strap so that you can attach both of the pockets at the same time if you wanted and you can apply the strap practically anywhere on your appendages.  It would fit on your ankle, knee, thigh, upper arm, or just above your calf.  For me, being a plus sized woman, it would be more beneficial for me to use on my knee or just above my calf for the purpose of keeping drivers license, some cash, keys, and a phone on me under a dress.  I tried around my thigh and the strap does fit, I just worry that the strap won't stay put. Love this!"
4.0,"Loved it, the writing peeled a tiny bit but you can barely tell."
4.0,Beautiful and comfy. Not the most expensive material but great for warmer months. Light and airy.
4.0,I love it but a little bit small
4.0,Bought this for my grandson. Fits a little big especially for the car seat. Beautiful color combination.
4.0,"Not sure if I have a big head or what, but they are tight on my head. Still use them anyway."
4.0,"I know there's tons of these things floating around on Amazon, but let me save you some searching. Yes, they are all the same for the most part, except all of those are MEDIUM size, and this one is LARGE. I don't have a small head by any means; my hat size is like 8.5 or something. I was able to wear my chainmail coife under this helmet, which I thought was fantastic: It let me get that real authentic look to my costume. IT also matched perfectly to my eye level and the eye slits. I don't know if everyone will have such good luck with this product, but it was perfect for me, even though my nose was a bit smashed. Two things to look for though, make sure to get a polishing rag, because this thing will be covered in oil when you get it. Also, watch for sharp edges. I had a sharp edge in mine that ended up cutting my nose. All in all, a good product."
4.0,My 4 yr old grandaugter loved it.  It was a birthday present she got last nite
4.0,Has a variety of letters and figures
4.0,"I needed a lightweight robe,, and this fits the bill."
4.0,Nice glasses. Great case. Comes with a nice cleaning cloth. Good value for the price. Just didn't fit over my husband's eye glasses. They are polarized so it was not a waste as I can use them. Jay a little disappointed that they didn't fit my husband's needs.
4.0,Took a very long time for this to get here from China. But it is nice and the price was right. You just have to have enough patients. The color is a lighter shade of blue then the picture. Just be aware of that.
4.0,"He wears this thing all the time.  He bought it for cold running days because of the wicking factor, but to be honest it's no different than any other hoodie you'd find at wal-mart, fruit of the looms.  It's been washed quite a few times and still no fading."
4.0,I love jersey maxi dresses. This one fits well.<br />It is comfy but VERY long. Usually I don't have a problem with length and I just may take an inch off this one.
4.0,Doesn't retain its tension.
4.0,Looks cute but is very cardboardish and feels very uncomfortable. Baby doesnt like it either.
4.0,Elsa was very popular with my granddaughter. She still plays with it even though Christmas is long over.
4.0,"This product is exactly as pictured and very versatile! I am currently 7 months pregnant and thought it looked cute over a tank with jeans as well as a loose fitting maxi dress for my baby shower. I was nervous with the one size option as I am tall & overall pretty thin (minus the baby bump) but I could see where this would be flattering on most body types. It is a very thin material and I wonder about how it will hold up over time, but so far so good!"
4.0,"It's more A-frame line than the photo shows. Other than that, it's a perfectly fine old-fashioned slip."
4.0,"I bought these for winter and they didn't disappoint. They're 78% wool and above average on thickness, which is what I needed. They'll soften some after first wash, but these are not your regular cotton tabby socks."
4.0,I love they way the belly hoop look and feel. I just had a hard time putting the ball in. So I just put my barbell belly ring back in. I might go to a professional priecing person to put it in for me.
4.0,The bracelets are beautiful.  They even came wrapped up in red tissue paper.  It was a nice touch for Christmas.  Thank you.
4.0,"I am a size 12, 36DDD, 185lbs, 5&#34;8' and this<br />Cocoship Royalblue Solid bathing suit fits great. Quality material, true to color and size. Right amout of sexy. LOVE IT! The only issue is the breast part is small."
4.0,"Fine for inseam and waist. Comfortable material. Crotch is shorter than ideal, but still fits."
4.0,Runs narrow so I ordered a size bigger.
4.0,"It is comfortable to wear and meets my needs, but the visor is flexible vinyl like a rain poncho. It came folded in the packaging which creates waves in the material. I'm hoping it will flatten out with a little time so that the view is clearer."
4.0,"This Padded Puffer Quilted Hoodie Vest is really cute and fashionable. I got the red color(small), I absolutely love it. It fit nice, comfortable to wear, and lightweight. It is made well, It is perfect for cold weather really feels warm with the faux fur around the collar. However I don't think this will warm me up in  winter season, This is still cute and fashionable hoodie vest<br />I received this Padded Puffer Quilted Hoodie Vest at a discounted price in sharing my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Still love them despite how big they are. super comfy
4.0,Gorgeous top. It is shear so I had to have someone sew in a liner but after that it looked amazing and everyone at the wedding thought it looked incredible. I felt so comfortable other than where it rubs on the collar bones. I have visible little marks today after wearing it for 9 hours yesterday from where it rubbed but it wasn‚Äôt incredibly painful more just annoying. I expected this based on other reviews.
4.0,"Usually wear a 2X or an 18 1/2 - 36 for a dress shirt, I am 6'1"" 230#.  Ordered the 3X for the extra room required of a bowling shirt - the body is naturally too large for me, but I wanted the extra room in the arms and shoulders area, this being a bowling shirt.  The arms and shoulder are somewhat tight, even though I ordered the larger size.  The garment is of high quality, excellent stitching, buttons, workmanship, but I would order the larger size if you want the freedom of movement in the arms/shoulder areas."
4.0,Returned and exchanged for 8mm pair.
4.0,"This is such a cute dress for the money!  Wore this on a date night with my husband and he LOVED it.  It was comfy and sexy and not too short!  The gathering was flattering but didn't exactly hide my belly completely and it's definitely thin material... it even showed bra and underwear lines in the back of the dress so I was kinda thankful it was a tiny bit big.  The dress also seemed to stretch out a little over the night I wore it, but still looked good.  For reference, my measurements are 36-26.5-39 and it's generally hard to find things that fit well so I was very pleased with this even though the waist was quite big. I am considering buying another in a smaller size to see if that is better but overall I really like it!"
4.0,"I received it very quick. It looks exactly as shown, its pretty big, the star looks kind of cheap but overall its cute."
4.0,"Some purses of the sam dimensions hold more or less , depending on how they open. This sturdy bag won't hold as much as similarly sized bags.  However, it is the quality I wanted for half the price of a similar item I wanted earlier.  The enclosed bonus piece will work great to carry medications or medical items (glucose meter, oxymeter,  or peak flow meter, depending on my needs that day."
4.0,Everything was great. The necklaces lit up and was exactly what I expected!
4.0,The shape is great but the quality is a little off. The color is not the same as it advertises...
4.0,The material on these is a bit thicker than expected but it fits very well.
4.0,I like these but the fabric is not as soft as the afitne shorts. They're really high wasted and flattering.
4.0,My locks are very long and this is a bit too small.
4.0,Super cute! They arrived very fast! I only gave them 4 stars because they smelled a little weird when i opened them but I hope they just need a little air and I was expecting this product to be light gray but they are more of a charcol gray. Other than that I love them!
4.0,"I measured myself and took the average as some people said. I got 47 inches so I ordered a 2X for some leeway. I can wear it, but it restricts my breathing too much  to be comfortable. More than a couple hours and my ribs will start to hurt. I‚Äôm gonna try a 3X but it‚Äôs weird my size didn‚Äôt work even though I measured right."
4.0,This dress was nicer then I expected for the price.
4.0,I like it.  It doesn't glow like the picture though.
4.0,"It seems to be made pretty good. It's a little more girly looking than in the picture, most men wouldn't want to wear it I don't think. Got this for my mom's ashes."
4.0,Dress if nicely and looked great.
4.0,"Edit: Maybe I was a little unfair. I used these for most of a 12 hour round trip to West Texas and they are actually pretty good at reducing the glare. I still have concerns over the quality, as they seem too light to last and I feel like they are fragile. But so far they're holding up. So changing to 4 stars.<br /><br />  First off, these are NOT Locs. They're ""SA106""  meta brand-ehatever that is. They are very light & cheap. Think Dollar Tree sunglasses. I bought these thinking I was getting Locs. We'll see if they last longer than Dollar Store ones, but they seem very fragile."
4.0,it gets uncomfortable after a while put other than tht great buy they look real
4.0,Exactly as pictured! The arms of the glasses seem like they would break easily and I wish they came with a hard case but other then that I love them. Ordered 3 different types
4.0,Super tiny but I love them.
4.0,"I love the look of these belts and I bought them because I was excited to tailor the fit. But, then I just got lazy and never created the custom hole. I still haven't worn them or the outfit I bought them to go with.  The point of this review is to be realistic about your life. Is something as simple as poking a hole in a piece of leather going to keep you from using something. If you are like me consider taking the extra 7 seconds it takes to measure your waist now and save yourself months of guilt over the cute belts you aren't using because you are lazy. (or you talk yourself into the trap of, I'll do it the next time I wear that skirt. planning to wear that skirt will force me to do. cut to scheduled skirt day, I don't have time to figure out how to poke a hole in this thing. AH! I need to wear something else instead)<br /><br />Cute belts!"
4.0,"Absolutely adorable boots! I got them because I love the bows on the side but they fell off the first time she wore them. Nonetheless, I'm still giving 4 stars because they are cute and my daughter is obsessed with them."
4.0,"I guess having a fly stitched closed is a new trend.<br /><br />My husband likes everything about these boxer briefs, but the inaccessible fly.<br /><br />That's personal and subjective.<br /><br />The company may want to advertise that feature in big print and at the top of any description.<br /><br />We will pass these along to a relative who prefers a stitched closed fly."
4.0,Love the colors and fit of the dress. I wish the belt was include in my order. I plan to order the other colors. I just hope the belts are attached with them.
4.0,"Before buying these shoes I read the customer reviews. Most said they usually were too small, so I ordered up a size. Unfortunately, I shouldn't have done that because now they're too big! I'm an 8.5, I ordered a 9. I don't think the sizing issue applies to everyone. Besides that, they're a great snow boot. They're sturdy, comfortable, and have great traction."
4.0,"Ring is correct size.  It looks pretty good for price.  I purchased it as a souvenir to the series , which I will put away, not to be worn."
4.0,"Pretty, but a little itchy at the wrist part.  Maybe after washing it won't itch as much."
4.0,Nice big colorful
4.0,"I love this dress it‚Äôs just simply great, it‚Äôs good quality!"
4.0,Attractive design<br />Like ability to disconnect badge without taking lanyard off<br />Emergency disconnect doesn't work exactly as expected
4.0,It's cute and really comfy. I got a large but should of went with a medium....On the other hand see it snags super easily and its see through. Not sure if I would buy it again.
4.0,"This is a nice and affordable 3 pack. It fits well but it cuts on your hip. So, if you are a bit fleshier, you might want to go with a thong with a wider band. The material is great and it breathes a lot. I have found no issues wearing this other than the thin band."
4.0,"I like the simplicity of the design. Nothing fancy, just wood and cord.<br /><br />While praying, I noticed that one decade has 11 beads instead of 10. I don't see a downside to saying an extra Hail Mary though."
4.0,Fits like a glove.  Love the way it fit and looks. Hugged around curves.
4.0,I bought this shirt for hiking. It's very cute and stylish. It fits well and is flattering . It does run a little small so you may want to size up .  I normally wear a medium but I ordered  a large and I'm glad I did. This top is great quality for a small price .. Buy it !!
4.0,"Super cute shoe. Got these for my son, who was ring-bearer in a wedding. The only thing I noticed was that the black band on the front of the shoe rubbed off after one day of wear, but other than that, it's a nice set of shoes."
4.0,"Nice material, pretty stretchy. Runs small-order up a size! I normally wear an XL (that‚Äôs what I ordered) and this feels too snug on me."
4.0,Beautiful dress. Perfect as a bridesmaid dress. Not what I need right now but still lovely. More orange than red though.
4.0,"The bottom portion fits perfect, but the chest part is a little tight. The padding is  small, but can be taken out. Overall, great quality üëç"
4.0,"The penguins are super cute and these slippers are very warm (which I love!). They are a touch big - I wear a size 7 (womens), ordered the size medium, but I probably could have gone with a small. The medium isn't too big to not wear, but it just is a little bigger than I need. Quite comfy, though I have noticed that the foam padding is already getting compressed after just a few days of wear - I hope they stay soft and comfy for a while."
4.0,Me gusto mucho pero me hubiera gustado abajo de la rodilla .
4.0,Slightly bulky
4.0,"i'm 5'2', 115 lbs.  I bought a small for a looser fit.  The length of the pants is a touch too long.  I will still wear them and with shoes that are not flat they should be really fine.  Very comfortable, pockets are clutch.  Can tie the waist higher to help address length somewhat."
4.0,"The shoes were a bit smaller than expected.  My son is 2 and loves them. He walks around saying &#34;cool&#34; and touching them. Like the other reviews state, the charge doesn't seem to last all day. We shut them off during nap time, so I'm not entirely sure how long they do last. It is easy to charge and turn them on. I was pleasantly surprised that there are a lot of different color settings. They are really bright too! Sometimes with walking he does accidentally turn them off. My son hasn't figured out where the button is so we haven't had to worry about that."
4.0,I'm a size 11. they work for running but a bit tight.
4.0,"very nice hoodie. but if your 2x like me,  don't bother,  fit's my 15 year old daughter perfect"
4.0,"Material is very soft and light, not what I was expecting but not bad. It reminds me of swimsuit material without the lining. The navy with white pattern is exactly as pictured, color is accurate. It fits well and will be a nice summer top. Mainly giving 4 stars instead of 5 b/c while the material is soft and light, it has a somewhat cheap look to it and is a bit shiny. Just not exactly what I wanted but I will be keeping it."
4.0,It is cheaply made but for the price it served its purpose!
4.0,"I liked it. It was so pretty!! But just a little too big the top and the bottom. I'm not sure if it shrinks but I don't know. I might return to get a smaller size. I'm 5'2 and I weigh 126, my chest size is a 34B and the medium is too big on me, and I am like a 5 or 4 in bottoms and the bottoms were fairly large."
4.0,"The blouse fits, but is tight in the arms. I ordered a size XL and as I am plus sized it is a little snug. The sellers measurements are spot on though, but as mentioned the upper arms are snug, I would consider that when buying."
4.0,Just what I wanted for the price I needed. Only con is that they were a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,Only problem is the size. Other wise so far ok
4.0,"Expensive, comfortable, but I don't like the strings.  I wear them but they are stretching out."
4.0,Fashionable baby outfit
4.0,"They look okay for sure, but not as modern as you'd think. More like 70's mom jeans."
4.0,"Love the colors in this shirt, the fabric is not super thin and the construction seems good.  I have not washed it yet, so I don't know how it will do in the wash as far as shrinkage or fading.  Given that it is polyester, I do not expect shrinkage.  There is no fabric care label on the garment, so note that the ad copy says to wash in cold water and hang or line dry.  No bleach, of course.  I took off one star for the product because it says that it is an oversized shirt.  So when you look at the size chart and it says that the XL will fit a 43-inch bust, I figured it would have a loose fit on my 41-inch bust.  Not so.  See the first picture that shows about 20.5 inches laid flat across the bust area, which would be 41 inches, not the 43 inches that the size chart shows.  It fits, and is a little long on my short torso, but it is in no way an oversized fit."
4.0,"Not 5 stars because I haven't actually worn them as yet. I have a small suspicion that they may not be long enough. I can fix that, But, I do like them."
4.0,"After my son lost his wallet at a Steak and Shake, I decided he needed a wallet with a chain.  This fits the bill and plus he loves Batman!  The wallet is sturdy and feels like leather. The chain has both a clip and a snap and the length seems adequate. The reason I kept this at a 4 star instead of 5 was that it could use a few more slots for cards--he has several gift cards and there's only 3 slots. Other than that, it seems to be a decent wallet.  As for the seller, they were very prompt in shipping."
4.0,"Gorgeous hat! Fits great! The only problem I had is it smelled from the front part of the hat I‚Äôm guessing the material used doesn‚Äôt do well with heat, and it was a little larger than I anticipated but no matter still wore it all day. Just make sure wash before wear with string detergent and fabric softener to keep the smell at bay"
4.0,"I wear a lot of flip flops. I've tried a lot of brands and usually go through a pair a season, but these lasted two seasons, so I'm rebuying. After 2 years, the rubber soles had a lot of wear and the whole thing kind of squished, but they were still comfortable and wearable. The final issue to make me replace was the leather under the balls of my feet started peeling and getting uncomfortable. They're about twice as expensive as I want, but, hey, they last twice as long so I guess that's fair.<br /><br />I have shallow arches and prefer no arch support, but I don't find this arch annoying or uncomfortable."
4.0,The dress beautiful! But I was sent the wrong size. Too much trouble to send it back.  Get out seeing machine & make adjustments.
4.0,nice and funky colors for adventures boy.
4.0,It's just like picture
4.0,Looks good; you get what you pay for here.
4.0,I plan to wear this tutu for the Disney princess half marathon.  I think it's a great value and I got the champagne color. It does have some kind of satin like material liner underneath on the version I got which I was not expecting but I think it will add coverage.
4.0,"I loved it, it how you style yourself, its very sexy especially on skinny girls. It does adds volume the way your body looks but not all. To me its the true test of being sexy, anybody who can pull out a sexy look from a dress like this , is my idol.."
4.0,"In our household, we go through so many pairs of socks. Mysteriously, socks always disappear and I'm constantly buying new packs of socks for my husband and little ones. This Zoo York men's thin, no show socks are comfortable and keep my feet warm. Yes, I am wearing a pair of the white socks since it's been so cold here. I asked my husband to try these socks too and he said it's very thin; but, fits fine. I was surprised that there are 10 pairs of socks in this pack. Specifically, there are 3 pairs of gray, 3 pairs of black, and 4 pairs of white socks in the pack. I am glad that these are very neutral colors and match any color clothing and shoes. I would not recommend wearing these socks if you're going into the snow or severely cold weather; but, around the house and/or when you work out, these socks definitely suffice.<br />I hope this review was helpful to you and I attached a few pictures. The picture of the gray socks is my husband wearing it while he sleeps and the picture of the white socks is of me wearing it. You can see that it is thin; but, the description states that.<br />I received this product for my always honest and unbiased review/opinion."
4.0,"I would recommend ordering a size smaller.  This is quite a bit more loose than expected.  It will still be a cute tank top, it just is not compression fit as it should be."
4.0,Peeled too fast...
4.0,Perfect magnifying glasses for putting makeup or magnifying craft work.
4.0,"Pretty. Wore it under a sheer blouse. Happy it wasn't too skimpy. I was complmented about it. But I needed fashion tape, to prevent any embarrassing malfunctions."
4.0,Very cute dress. Top portion runs a little short if you have a long torso. Besides that great dress length and appropriate to wear to work!
4.0,"It fit just as expected. The belt shoulder straps weren‚Äôt adjustable, but that was the only issue with jt"
4.0,"Good goggles overall! the issue I had though was, the anti-fog portion was all bubbled up and foggy after the first use. Not sure how, this is not my first pair of goggles with anti-fog, so I do make sure i don't wipe it clean on the inside. I keep them in the case, it is aired with the little holes, but not sure what went wrong. Other than that....THE BEST so far"
4.0,Just a bit to wide. But i have a pretty small head
4.0,I REALLY LIKED THE STYLE &lt;3
4.0,Ok for what I need it for but I definitely would go up a size they run small.
4.0,comfortable but definitely see through. I am 5'5&#34; and the length on the sides was just a little too long. Every time I walked up stairs I would step on the sides
4.0,"Pretty, but I keep ordering a larger size than what I usually wear, and it still doesn't fit."
4.0,"It's works. Nothing more to say, its comfortable."
4.0,This dress is really comfortable and stylish at the same time! The fitting was great
4.0,"If I were a smaller person or if I had bought them for a child, they would have been perfect which is not the fault of the manufacturer."
4.0,i bought this product because i have a full sleeve tattoo. it covers my arms good. for the price there are good. i also use them when i go fishing on my boat and they seem to protect some of the sun rays.
4.0,Fits comfortably but I returned it as I didn't like how the navy color looked on me.
4.0,"This model of OR cap is great. I have many. The dusk blue is nice. The one I received this time was mis-stitched where the upper part of the cap meets the top of the hat band. The fabric meets the band at an angle, from two directions, causing a pucker where it is is caught up into a bad stitch. I will keep it since it does not have to look great to do its job."
4.0,Black finish comes off a little too easy. Otherwise great.
4.0,"Like other reviewers I noticed a lot of repetition (I had about 20 of one design, 17 of another) , but this was a good deal nonetheless. The charms are good quality for the price and they did come with rings (I removed them actually). I used these to make my preschooler a charm bracelet. She was delighted for 2 gourd and has since forgotten about it, as is to be expected."
4.0,"These are a good looking and super comfy and warm pair of leggings.  From the outside they don't look obvious as being thicker with fleece lining and have a few color options which is nice!<br /><br />These were great for sitting around for a few hours in a cool outdoor setting in something comfy while still looking decent.  I got the large size and feel most other leggings would fit better and these were a bit snug.  Not sure if it was due to them maybe being thicker material.  I had no concerns on the quality after running them through a cycle of laundry.  These will be great for my cooler weather walks outside!<br /><br />Based on how I feel about the sizing I'd love to give these 4.5 stars but since I can't, 4/5 is still pretty good in my book."
4.0,"Liked the fit, disliked the fat it displays"
4.0,"It's a very pretty and delicate silver necklace.  It's longer than real gold necklace.  Its pedant is super shiny<br />and larger than average pendants.  I especially like its light blue cubic zirconia, almost like a real diamond<br />except that real diamonds have no colors.  It comes in a fabric quilted jewelry box with a wiping cloth for<br />cleaning.  However, for a necklace with a fake diamond pendant, it's more expensive than average."
4.0,These hats will be great in Europe. Just one problem- one of the strings inside one hat that you use to adjust the size was sewn into the hats brim- will be quite hard to use this feature in this hat. Quality control???
4.0,"Love the look, hoping my father in law loves it (Christmas present) and the fit is good!<br /><br />Packaging for $50 could be a bit better but it is protected from the elements"
4.0,Beautiful band but broke the first day. The little piece that holds the watch band down to the watch came off.
4.0,Like them but kinda poor quality as far as stitching goes...had to reinforce the seams.  No problem because I can sew.  Good for the money.
4.0,"These are really nice and sexy as hell!! I love them and my husband does too! Only issue I have is at the bottom where my ankle is, They're a bit loose instead of being snug to my body like the rest of the legging so that really annoyed me. But it could just be me because I do have very tiny and skinny ankles and wrists. Who knows!"
4.0,Son fishes and uses this for additional protection from sun.
4.0,"We actually received 102 charms. They seem to be the same quality as  jibbitz. We did not receive a few we were hoping for and it came with a few duplicates but we are splitting them between three kids so that is fine for us. A few of them looked a bit wonky, but overall we are happy with what we got!"
4.0,"While this 2-pack of Genuine Leather Watch Bands is compatible with Samsung Galaxy/Samsung Gear Sport watches, the bands also work well with 20mm lug width watches in general. So I asked my husband, who likes to use different watch bands on his watches, to test them out. He immediately liked the look of the pair of bands that came in this set. The black and brown leather watch bands each have exposed cream white stitching that contrasts nicely with each band's color. The bands also have solid feeling black metal tang buckles. My husband found that both of these bands work very well with one of his black case 20mm lug width field watches. As the bands have quick-release spring bars, he can change out and alternate between the bands easily. He noted that the bands taper nicely from 20mm at the lugs down to about 18mm at the buckle, giving each band an attractive appearance on the wrist. The only issue he found with this set was that the leather quality was not as supple as some of his other leather watch bands. That said, the leather is still decent. Moreover, this 2-pack of leather watch bands currently sells for about $14, which is considerably less than what my husband pays for any of his other leather watch bands. All in all, this pair of replacement watch bands is handsomely attractive, decent quality, and very affordable."
4.0,The shirt is super cute! It‚Äôs flattering! The one downside is the material around the wrist and lower arm is itchy!
4.0,The sleeves are sheer (which I was not expecting) and it‚Äôs quite long... too long for me at 5‚Äô 4‚Äù even with heels. The fabric is lovely and the sellers have been quick to respond to me. It does run a bit small.
4.0,A little bigger than expected but good quality material
4.0,a little long but it fits
4.0,Didn't expect such thin t shirt material
4.0,It was the right size. There was a fishy smell on the inside. Went away after a few weeks. Color was accurate wish the inside was a bit better sewn together. There were loose threads everywhere but its f uhnctional and seems very sturdy on the outside.
4.0,"I love this shorts I really could have sized down, I was worried about my booty fitting...Booty fit great I has more room in my waist then I needed over all a good purchase"
4.0,Good case. Just a snap on case though. Would be better if it had a faceplate. But a good durable case. So far at least
4.0,"I am using this as a travel bag for my vehicle as it matches the interior and holds all of the stuff i put into my travel bag.<br />functionally this is nice bag due to its purse/backpack design, the dual straps are quite functional though the backpack straps are nylon. The half zipper stops the main compartment from sagging, it also has a fair amount of zipper exterior compartments. the main compartment also has enough dividers for variously sized items, however the pocket on inside strap side of the bag arrived with a hole/tear/cut in it, i did not notice it immediately until i realized the small items i was putting into the pocket were disappearing, the hole was relatively small but because it existed, all my small items fell into the inaccessible interior, and i had to tear the hole more to get my hand into the inner wall and pull everything out, i can probably fix this on my own, but this is somewhat of an inconvenience"
4.0,well item arrived there soft  feeling..and fit.. so they should work when i put them to use on the job -owens
4.0,Sus encajes de enfrente
4.0,"This fit perfectly.  Needed a large, ordered a large.  Some said if you didn't order up a size the material was see-through, but I did not find that to be true, even in the bust and I am relatively large-chested.  Nice soft cotton material and a basic silhouette that can be easily dressed up or down with the right shoes and accessories."
4.0,"This is very good baggy chiffon outerwear!<br />My daughter liked this blouse, it was very nice and attractive but it was little big.<br />The quality is good."
4.0,"Deber√≠an agregar una talla m√°s peque√±a, compr√© la talla peque√±a y es bastante grande para ser esa talla sobre todo para la parte del busto. Es muy bonito pero creo que eso deber√≠an mejorarlo."
4.0,Love this but 2nd one broke again
4.0,"Great quality, great fit- no complaints aside from a bit pricey but definitely satisfied with my purchase!"
4.0,"Beautiful bangle. It does say the name brand on the front though which I found strange, but all in all it is beautiful"
4.0,"Love it!  Had to hem it a little, it was slightly to long but then I'm short."
4.0,Good but bad sewing
4.0,"The quality is ok. The bikini is cute and fit well. Somewhat the bottom party is small but fits ok, the top is super cute."
4.0,"I‚Äôm tall, 5‚Äô9‚Äù. Thin material but good quality. I don‚Äôt see the scoop front but it‚Äôs still cute."
4.0,Workout!
4.0,"Nice set, good quality"
4.0,These glasses seem well made and durable given the low price.  I have worn them a few times now during a night drive and I have to say even though I was initially skeptical that they would make a difference; they really do.  There is much less glare and therefore your visibility is increased significantly making it safer to drive at night. I do wish they had more options as far as styles are concerned but otherwise great glasses.
4.0,"I bought this for a Vikings Con that I didn't have time to put together my own cosplay for and I was very pleasantly surprised! I am 5'7"", 135lbs and it fits perfectly. The length is perfect, down to my ankles but not touching the ground. Very comfortable! I expected it to look a little cheap but it actually looks quite nice and I got many compliments on it! Note that I am wearing a long-sleeved black shirt in the pictures because it was cold when I wore it. That actually worked out for me because the shirt sleeves extended the length of the dress sleeves that were a little too short for me (but I have longer than average arms so that is always an issue for me with clothes). The fur does shed as others have said in their reviews but this is typical for faux fur so I don't consider it a reason to include in my reasons for docking one star.<br /><br />I docked one star only because the sash was a little awkwardly sewn onto the dress so that it didn't drape quite the way I wanted it to. I used a small pen knife to detach the sewing from the hips (which detached nicely without damaging the sash at all), but it's still sewn in the back by the zipper which can't easily be altered. While I wish the sash wasn't sewn into the dress, it wasn't too hard to make it work.<br /><br />One other reason for one star off is that the necklaces were strung on plastic fishing wire and the beads don't go all the way around so that there are several inches of exposed line, looking rather cheap. This is also easily modified, however, and I did this by cutting the line, making loops on the ends, and pinning the ends with turtle shell broaches to accent the dress in a more traditional Viking way (see the first picture). I was pleased with the look in the end and I recommend doing it yourself if you get this dress!<br /><br />Overall, I was very happy with the dress, more so than I expected. It is a great costume for the price!"
4.0,"It arrived on time, and just as described."
4.0,I am glad that I bought this hat for my collection.  The quality is excellent and it feels great on my head!
4.0,"Head piece, earrings and gloves are great quality.  String of pearls and cigerette holder are cheap looking.  But all in all.. For the price its great."
4.0,"Wear them everyday. So far, so good."
4.0,Cute ~ well made ~ fits a little tight but that's because I'm plump!!!!!
4.0,"Ran a little big, I wasn't able to get the touch screen part to work, but maybe because they were a little big on me?  Liked the plastic grippers on the palm side of glove.  Nice color."
4.0,"The product is well made. The design is less visible in person than on the computer. It doesn't have a built in sports bra, so that is slightly annoying. I'm 5 foot 7, and 145 pounds...and I bought the medium. It fit perfectly! The suit itself has really good ventilation and is really comfortable to wear! We will see how well it holds up in my triathlon!"
4.0,"Super cute design, but I am a medium and I ordered a small.  It is still a little big, but wearable."
4.0,"Great watch, a massive pain to change the settings though."
4.0,Stays pretty tight on luggage
4.0,Nice quality and looks great. It is a bit tight so I wish it came with just one or 2 more links or at least the ability to buy more. It's to a point it is almost too tight to wear.
4.0,Light weight.  Look hood. Great price.
4.0,"Prompt delivery time but after I read the reviews I ordered a bigger size, people said it ran small.. The item was just as pictured & a nice product! My fault, she can wear it next Christmas, its that big lol"
4.0,"I'm satisfied with this replacement band for my Vivosmart HR. At first, I thought I'd have to send it back as I couldn't get the side without the button to fit. Then I read several reviews where I learned that there is a plastic extension that needs to be removed before the band will fit. It doesn't look like there's anything removable there but if you pull on that end hard enough, that pesky plastic extension pops right off. I actually used pliers to pull it off as my hands are not strong enough and that worked like a charm. Once that piece is removed, the band fits on nicely. There is a small gap on that same difficult end that I'll have to keep an eye on and keep cleaned out but that's better then having to buy a whole new Vivosmart! I just wish there were installation instructions that would have explained this whole thing."
4.0,I would order up due to the quality and material used to make this dress. I wore it for a couple of special occasions and now do not have it due to the short durability.
4.0,"I bought this strap for my oboe because I was looking for something with a small hook end (instead of a snap or leather fob).  It does the job, I could probably hook a 25 lbs weight to it and it wouldn't flinch.  Everything seems nice and sturdy.<br />My one complaint would be that the neck padding piece is very large.  I look like I am wearing a neck whiplash brace.  It is comfortable, sure....and if I was holding up a big, heavy instrument, I would be grateful for all that padding.  But it's a little overkill for an oboe."
4.0,"If you use the fit guide, it runs too large.  I am a size 4 and the guide indicated M for the fit, but it is too large.  If you order your &#34;usual&#34; size, it should be fine.  Other than that, the shirt is good styling.  It runs longer than usual (over the hips), it could be due to the larger size."
4.0,Confortable. True to size
4.0,"Use mostly for going back and forth to pool at gym! A little thin, but price is great. Great when it is really hot."
4.0,Very pretty but too big awkward looking.... If you like small things
4.0,We purchased for an 80s party and after some work it turned out well! It was incredibly wrinkled so make sure to plan accordingly as it took a while to get it right.  Sleeves and pants were long and needed to be shortened.
4.0,"Let's just say for the price they're fine I won't feel bad if I break them ,they sit on my face and little further away from my eyes than I'm used to but they're still comfortable"
4.0,It is nice and soft very comfortable
4.0,"I‚Äôve used my pack now several times, from the Hualapais in Kingman, AZ to a Rim to Rim hike in the Grand Canyon and it held up great and was comfortable to use. The only negative is the waist clip broke during my canyon hike. I‚Äôm very pleased with it."
4.0,Looks exactly like the pic. Can't wait to use it!
4.0,"Love the black earrings, not sure about the unfinished edges of the pink. Very light-weight!"
4.0,"I actually loved this bag, but it was so big that it would have been really heavy when filled! It is actually more like  a carryon for when you fly! So I had to return it and am sad that I could not keep it! It is a great looking bag and had it been a big smaller would be a wonderful addition to my Tink  handbags!  However it shipped time in a very timely manner and I would purchase from this seller again!"
4.0,I am very happy with the service and product!
4.0,Super cute. Fits as expected. Looks really cute with leggings
4.0,The bottom of the pant legs are very full...almost feels like it flares a little.
4.0,"The watch band looks good, but feels really cheap. You do get what you pay for. It looks cute and dressy, good for formal days."
4.0,Beautiful jewelry set. The only thing is the ring was too small.
4.0,"‚ùì What Do You Get? üí≠ 1 Dark Denim Hat - adjustable<br />‚ùì Did I like this? üí≠ Yes<br />‚ùì Why? üí≠ This is a 100% cotton hat - it is not made from denim.

4.0,Love them. I wish the compression was higher but they do the trick.
4.0,Cute pants! A little big around the waist and longer than I expected. The edge of the pants reach my ankles.  I am 5'5&#34; 110 lbs. and bought a small.
4.0,Cute Bracelet! This Bracelet met my expectations. It is a great piece to have for an exceptional price! I would recommend this to a friend!
4.0,Great money bag
4.0,Beautiful and simple. Only complaint is Gemstone King packaged it inside a baggy and caused it to bunch and knot up. Took me a bit to untangle.
4.0,"Very nice robe. I washed and dried it on medium heat to get the package creases out. The white is not snow white, but off-white. I would buy again from this seller."
4.0,I love the fabric and style but it runs small.
4.0,This mask is well made but it's very large so it's not easy to read it you have a smaller face.
4.0,Too think in my opinion and does not really work with my masks.  My face sweats with these on. Lesson learned!
4.0,"Good fit, and perfect length."
4.0,"These brightly colored luggage tags have a wire loop to secure them to your luggage and thus ae less likely to break and allow the tag to become lost. The tag itself is made of silicone, they are bit oversized and very brightly colored for easy identification. You can fil out your address information on the card and put it inside the tag. There is a slot on the tag to allow one line to be visible without removing the card from the tag. Conceptually this is a great idea with the bright color making it easy to identify and the wire loop which won't break. At this point I'll have to see if after a number of trips whether the size of the tags gets them caught on other luggage and tears the tag but so far so good."
4.0,"Quality is good, color is a bit darker than picture.  The laces are a bit loose and not that fit onto the shoulder area, but it doesn‚Äôt affect its funtion. I just washed it. The chest pads inside are loose, you need to adjust the pad position if you wash it and just hand wash is good.  Hope it goes well through my winter. It keeps my belly warm for winter which is good"
4.0,these are all pretty but not for new pierced bellies or if u planned on  leaving it in long term do not they will turn .
4.0,"Don't let the picture fool you, the cowl collar on this doesn't sit quite as perfect as the way the model makes it seem. Its cozy though, bigger than what I expected but it does say over sized so that was my mistake thinking I should still order a XL and not just a L I'm pretty busty so I wanted something that looked over sized even for me and this does. I ordered the orange and its more of a light orange or melon color, pretty goes well with boots and leggings or to cozy up on the couch with a movie. For the price its good quality. I would order again but probably in a different color."
4.0,"This suit is perfect for my son's Christmas.  Everything seems to be of good quality, until you get to the shirt.  The shirt is paper thin and see through.  Overall, I am satisfied, just not with the suit."
4.0,"The detail and finish on this ring was better than I expected. The only thing I don't like is that it is hollow, but for the price, it's great."
4.0,I would have loved these if they had fit.  They are well made and look really good on....I gave them to my son who is two sizes smaller than me and they fit him perfect.
4.0,I love this easy on and off spring slip on.<br />I am ordering other one.
4.0,"I purchased the (4) pack. Love the variety and the material... wicks moisture away very well. My only negative comment (and very negligible) would be that they all don't fit the exact same... one of them was a bit smaller than the others, but considering the price point and the fitment, I would definitely recommend."
4.0,It‚Äôs a very cute and pretty dress. It took a long time to come but really worth waiting for it. It‚Äôs thin so it‚Äôs great for summer. The size is perfect as well. Nice design too. Soft material. Highly recommended
4.0,The bottom fit great the top did not- too loose. Had to return.
4.0,"Need clear coat, turned my girls skin green"
4.0,"I like'd the style, but I had ordered small. I will order again when I return to my home state."
4.0,Perfect for work and to wear if you play sports. Why risk losing your real one?
4.0,I have been buying several stainless steel watch bands for my apple watch and this is another great one. I use this at work and can wear it all day without worrying about my watch falling. Its comfortable and stays in place. I am female and did have to adjust the band as I have the 42mm watch but it was super easy to do. I have bumped the band and everything and it is still looking amazing.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a stainless steel watch band. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"The watch is soooo cool!  It keeps great time and looks great on.  I love streampunk and this is a steampunk watch.<br /><br />It was suppose to come with an extra battery and I did't get it...I have emailed the problem to the vendor, I am waiting for their reply.  When I get an answer I will edit tnis to let you know what vendor did to fix this problem.  I thought by getting an extra battery, not only would I have an extra but I know what number battery I would have to get to replace it down the road without haveing to open the watch...oh well we will see what happens.<br /><br />It seem to me that it took a long time to get the watch...I have gotten other shipments from China and this one just took longer.  It did get here when they said but it was the very last day."
4.0,Good for limited use. Suspenders  seemed a bit thin and it had wear marks on the suspenders that looked like glue or a machine rubbed too hard. I am 6ft 2 and they fit well and did not come loosee after hours of heavy movement.  Overall a hit at the wedding i went to or  i would have given less stars for quality.
4.0,"Love it,looks good on any face type and a good run around pair,it's also quite sturdy and has a nice finish.mine had a scratch on the outside of the hand but it's not something I would obsess over,really cool looking shades,buy if you are considering"
4.0,Good shoe for winter light use.  Had some trouble with one zipper at first but that got better.  Wear them for 3 mile walks every day.
4.0,"Nice structure, color, and soft material. Ran large. I get lots of compliments and my sister constantly wants to steal it. Will buy others in other colors if restocked. Great for teacher wardrobe. Love it with a mauve bodysuit and floral pencil skirt."
4.0,They were well made but much bigger than I expected. I used the sizing chat too.
4.0,Very nice and great fit just wish it was a bit fuller
4.0,The 16mm was too tight and wouldn't work. The 18mm is too wide and will surely break in no time. Maybe you could include washers/spacers in the future? We'll give it a try...
4.0,These are Great and comfortable only issue I had was the metal piece on the nose after its washed the metal piece isn't in its correct place! I would recommend hand washing and not throwing in the washer. Other than that the product is really great comfy for the children and simple! Will be ordering more!
4.0,"Is a little bit long which in my case works just find. My job require for me to bent down to attend the need of little children. Like the material, I use it as a undershirt but you can use it just as it is because is not see through. Hope this help."
4.0,Beautiful flowers are not coral than burnt orange.
4.0,Bands fit great for the Fitbit Charge 3 and seem strong to last for awhile.
4.0,I love this onesie! It‚Äôs too cute! The only problem is that it runs really small. I ordered 12m but it fits perfectly on my 9 month old that‚Äôs in the 50th percentile. Looks like he won‚Äôt be wearing this for long.
4.0,Very nice quality but the colors are extremely dull not like the picture. I‚Äôm going to just fill it in with paint.
4.0,"They are super cute and great quality, but small!"
4.0,I bought these nose rings and the size is perfect for my nose. Only reason that this is not 5 stars is because the color will peel away after some use which is a little annoying
4.0,Very good. Sturdy material. Son loves it
4.0,Tag @ the bottom of the dress doesn't in no way match what the actual material of the dress says. Dress material is cotton. Not what I was looking for but love the dress despite what the false material description says.
4.0,"I liked this dress and actually bought it in all the colors,red, blue, black and yellow unfortunately none of them fit. I am 5'6 190 lbs and ordered an extra large, way too tight across the chest. I gave them to a co-worker who loves them and they fit her great."
4.0,"Going into this purchase I knew I had to buy a size up and to expect holes. Everything was true. My 5'1 tween who weighs just under 100 lbs. said the medium fit her just right, maybe even on the smaller side. A large would have been too big. There is a hole on the hood that i will have to stitch. It came packaged air tight and is super soft."
4.0,Ducti comes with lifetime replacement! The wallet is quite tough though the clear trim peeled back after two months. The glow-in-the-dark strips are sensitive and long lasting. I buy these as gifts. If the minor issue of some trim peeling is resolved I would give this product 6 stars!
4.0,The tags are strong and not too large. The company provides great support.
4.0,Grand-daughter age 10 liked it. I did not like the quality for the price.
4.0,"Very nice, thick material. I like that a lot, and my husband loves the deep green color. It is a bit too large, but next time I'll know to order a smaller size."
4.0,It's cute but it's a bit big
4.0,"I bought this in a size bigger than I wear because I sew and I could take it in, which I did and now it fits great. But the sleeves are a bit short.I still love it though."
4.0,"This dress is perfect for summer and such a great price! I love that I can wear it with a racer back bra. It‚Äôs so comfortable and cool, too. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 130lbs, and a medium fits me perfectly. My only complaint (and the reason I did 4 stars instead of 5), is not about the dress itself. It‚Äôs that when I went back to order another one, none of the solid colored mediums were available for Prime."
4.0,Hoping that I dont get to know if they are better
4.0,Great watch for small wrist
4.0,Fits like a small/medium. Material is awesome thick and super soft. Very well made!! Quick shipping. I am ordering a size up but my daughter will enjoy this one.
4.0,Quality item very comfortable
4.0,The shirt is very thin and would need an undershirt. The shorts are definitely longer than what the picture shows. But overall for the price it is very cute!
4.0,It's exactly what we ordered and needed. I ordered a size up bc the last one we got was too small.
4.0,"Bought one of these a couple months back to try while I workout/run, they feel great, are nicely cut and the pockets are great with a zipper to keep stuff in there.<br />Wish there was a back pocket but other than that it's great."
4.0,"Somewhat small could be partly my fault.  Dang kids grow too fast.  Daughter LOVES them.  She will only get one year out of them but, not manufacturers fault.  Merry Christmas!"
4.0,"Got this hat for fall and i love it! I love the color for the fall. Its has the adjustable string inside to help fit to the head better as it was a little big for my head. The only thing I didn't really care for was that the belt detail around the hat is not secure at all, so it easily comes off and can be lost. Maybe they did that so you can use with or without the chain, however I don't like that it's not secure. Great hat for the price! I will definitely be getting more colors."
4.0,These high waisted leggings do not disappoint. 5‚Äô175 lbs and the medium is perfect fit. I tend to roll the bottom by the ankle for a cute look. There is a slight difference in fabric thickness from color to color however they are perfect weight for mild winters.
4.0,So far very pleased with the quality
4.0,Hat was as expected
4.0,Not as soft as expected
4.0,"Cute dress for the beach or a cruise..  It runs big in the bust area, I wish it had boy shorts instead of undies and I wish the dress was a little longer.  Overall it's still a cute dress.."
4.0,One of the feathers was torn a bit<br />Otherwise super cute
4.0,Good for school age children. Exactly what was expected from the picture. Can break easily if elastic is pulled too hard.
4.0,"Comes in two pieces but very simple to put on. I like it, it looks cute. The only recommendation would be to have the under slip be a little thicker material. Overall I like it and am keeping it."
4.0,"Overall, this is a pretty nice polo shirt. The material is excellent ‚Äì decently thick but still very soft. The stitch quality is excellent ‚Äì tight seams throughout, and zero loose or pulled threads. The collar is firm enough to hold its shape well without being rough on my neck. I really like that it comes with an extra button (it‚Äôs sewn onto the care tag). That‚Äôs a feature you don‚Äôt often see these days.<br /><br />The cut is on the relaxed side. I have it in large and, while I would not call it baggy, it‚Äôs certainly not a trim or fitted cut. That works fine for this shirt since polo shirts are casual wear by design.  I have it in gray, and the color is a nice, medium gray that looks very similar to the color depicted in the product listing.<br /><br />The one area where the cut could be improved is the sleeves. They are cut really wide which in and of itself is not bad, but they also have a cuffed hem on them. The wide cut would look better without a cuffed hem (or, conversely, a tighter cut with the cuffed hem).<br /><br />Other than that issue, zero complaints. It‚Äôs a nice shirt that‚Äôs priced well for what you get.<br />[Sample provided for review]"
4.0,"I love the quality, shape and fit of this shoe. A major plus is that the bottom of the shoe is silvery, making it look even more fashionable!  A great surprise I must say."
4.0,Very soft. My wife loves this sleepwear.
4.0,Good quality and good price can‚Äôt go wrong.
4.0,"I love it and I will use it almost daily if I could. The only downside of the swim dress is that is a little too big for me in the boobs. and the shape is a little odd ( Only in the boobs). but makes my figure looks amazing, the colors are cool and I have gotten many compliments out of the dress. perfect for when you dont have time to change and you dont want to feel naked.I will prefer to have a size 1-2 for better fit."
4.0,Well made. I was looking for something simple for Christmas pictures and they fit the bill.
4.0,"Why dress like you are in your twenties when you can dress like you are in the twenties. It brings out the suffrajette in everyone. Forget the vote, wear this dress instead."
4.0,"I got this for my daughter and her mini me doll. My daughter has an 18 inch American Girl doll and the robe fits like a glove. I just wish it fit the same on my daughter. My daughter is about 47 inches and wear 8/9. However I decided to get my daughter a 10/11 robe. The robe reaches past her knees, but it is a little short on her arms and rests just above her wrists. If the arm length was longer, than I would have given this 5 stars. Either way it is a great product for my daughter and her look alike doll."
4.0,It came on time and fits as expected
4.0,"I was really suprised with the performance of these shoes, great boardfeel and were already broken in when I got them. However, I do like to break them in myself. The Adiprene insole looks good, feels good but they make your feet sweat. My feet usually never sweat, maybe it's the shoes lack of ventillation but who knows. Overall, great shoe."
4.0,hard to buckle
4.0,Gorgeous ring!! I've received many compliments on it and am very happy because it doesnt leave the green stain most &#34;cheap&#34; jewelry does. Very happy with this ring and would highly recommend!
4.0,"my husband wanted thin sock for the summer and these fit the bill, fit nice, thin and comfortable. would buy again."
4.0,"Love all three bands! Easier to switch out than any other watch band with pins - these have a built-in release handle on each pin, so hooray on the design! I'd rather give 4.5 stars vs. 4.<br />The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the magnetic band DOES catch on and fray fabric of the sweater variety. Otherwise, I highly recommend!"
4.0,Cute soft knitted boot cuffs. The seller's picture shows 2 boot cuffs on one boot.  they are actually half that size. The reason for only 4 stars:  they are sooo over priced.
4.0,Cute. Giving in a charity gift with other items for a young tween.
4.0,Great fit to the legs and thighs. Comfortable stretchy material. I wish the waist was stretchy for comfort.
4.0,"Bought this shirt to wear on St Patricks day. I was in need of a ""Kelly Green"" St Patricks Day shirt. Though, I don't think<br />I will wear this rather gaudy  green color on any other day. (just saying)"
4.0,I love the dress but it is a little shorter than I hoped.
4.0,Fit well and was snug without restricting breathing. Returned though because the metal on the shoulder straps kept twisting. I‚Äôd also say it runs slightly small.
4.0,"Love them, just had to take them up by 4 inches.  I'm  5, 6&#34; and very long. Feels soft and so comfortabe. I've reordered them 3 times because I love the fit so much."
4.0,"Holy cow I received this item 2 days after I ordered it (without prime) which was great. The shirt is so cool I love it. It's so hard to find Kill Bill shirts these days and I loved the look of this one. My only complaint and reason for the 4 stars is that I ordered an XL and it looks tiny. I am going to have to cut out the arm holes sadly. It's also 100% cotton so I'm worried it will shrink even more in the wash. I wish it came in XXL, then maybe it would fit more like a L or XL. It feels about a size too small. Other then that I love it."
4.0,This is a very nice quality headband. It is made with yarn that is thick and seems to be a quality product. It is a little wider than I had expected it to be but will be good for keeping ears warm in the colder months.
4.0,"Got them today, looked very real and were perfectly sized, the only issue was that they weren't as red as they look online, more of an orangy-copper look."
4.0,Get ready to sweat. üëçüèª
4.0,Cozy dress for the winter and comfortable
4.0,My oldest got them for prom and they were comfortable and looked good.
4.0,Very cute very comfortable purchased a medium normally a US medium but this is quite a bit baggiwr than expected very loose but I like it
4.0,"These overalls fit as expected.<br />The material feels nice and does not feel cheap or too thin.<br /><br />I do not like the blue color I got very much and i wish i had got it in a different color.<br /><br />The length was average and a large size fits someone that is 5' 4"" well.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these."
4.0,Very comfortable. I am a size 16-18 ..I was a little concerned about the fit and it was fine.
4.0,Don't know about coat? Bought for someone elsa?
4.0,These are actually quite cute.  The imaging was clear and the fit was good overall although the leg openings are a little loose.
4.0,"Top drapes oddly but the waist and bottom look great. I ordered up in size and should not have, stick to your correct size!"
4.0,"I wanted. Day pack for hiking and for attending conferences. This does well. It fits my 12‚Äù MacBook, a couple of notepads/journals, cords, and a few other small items. I am not the biggest fan of the zippers. We‚Äôll see how long it lasts. Drink holder is rather small. A 16 oz water bottle fits best. Also wish padding on strap as a little longer. But all in all this has most of the features to meet my needs"
4.0,cute dress for baby
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:fa1d534df140542fc96daf0948d0e1db]] Yes this dress does stretch, but know that stretching changes the intensity of the color pattern ( it becomes a lighter grey when stretched too much. Please buy the correct size to fit all your generous parts. I normally wear a size US 18/20 (XL) and so I ordered the XXL counting on stretch and the size conversion . With my chest and tummy, I probably should have ordered another size up. I like the dress. Seems to be a decent bargain. Dress is mighty thin so plan for appropriate under garments ( or not üòè). I'm super tall (over 6ft) so the skirt may hit you in a better place. Hopes this is helpful."
4.0,"It's an inexpensive bauble that I won't wear everyday. I don't expect it to last long. I cut the cross off pretty quickly, though, because it flopped around too much."
4.0,Like it looks nice
4.0,"So normally I don‚Äôt write these BUT the medium (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 160) was a great fit, easy to get into, and brought a huge smile to my face when I put it on. The mask holds on pretty well although rubbery but overall much better than I expected."
4.0,"I would buy again, but it is hard to fit in general I don't think it's the manufacturer's fault, just the type of glove. So make sure who you are buying for, or yourself, what kind of hands you have."
4.0,Son buenas viene. Un poco reducidas ideales para mujer
4.0,"The fabric is cheap looking, but otherwise it's totally as expected."
4.0,"They feel great they look amazing but the tummy area is very tight, it makes my lower tummy pop out because it‚Äôs so tight on the top"
4.0,Great dress but did not realize it had pockets so it puffed out more than i'd like.
4.0,I absolutely love the color and length of this dress! The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I thought it would be more fitted at the waist like how it is featured. It is definitely more loose fitting which isn‚Äôt bad just not what I expected based on how it‚Äôs advertised.
4.0,Nice green pants for summer
4.0,Very nice.  Spouse love it
4.0,Cute -love it
4.0,I love the design of these sunglasses. Very fashionable.  But I get dizzy when I'm wearing these sunglasses.  I know it sounds weird.  I don't know if it has something to do with the mirrored lenses? Is it just me??
4.0,"its cute, ""cottony"" but not cotton.  100% polyesterüòï<br />still soft and comfortable.."
4.0,Quality product.  Management dedicated to make it right.
4.0,Very nice. Bigger than what they look like
4.0,"Aside from the fact that this scarf and beanie set screams ""I'm INSECURE,"" it's kind of cute in its own way.  The colors are very fall, so we might have to wait until next year.  The quality seems good and its pretty soft.  I'd recommend it probably only has a gag gift.  If I saw someone wearing this, I'd probably run the other way."
4.0,They are definitely an attention getter!
4.0,Got this for halloween costume as Oil Shaykh. Perfectly fit me!
4.0,"Looks just like the picture , little short got it a size bigger but great !"
4.0,They are really nice. But wayy too big. I ended up giving them to my mom. Gonna buy a second pair though.
4.0,"I am writing this two months after receiving the item.  I bought this for my wife for our fifth anniversary. An almost exact version is sold at Sam's Club for over $400 more.  She loved it right out of the box.  It appears well made.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Price was the best I could find<br />- Settings seem good - no diamonds lost yet!<br />- White gold beats silver and so pendant hasn't turned colors. Note chain is silver.<br />- Size was about what I expected - but I always remember that jewelry is not as big as it is on the screen.*<br />- Chain is okay(functional), but at some point it is always better to buy a stronger thick chain (white gold) for your loved one's jewelry.<br />- Nice box; well packaged - always important when giving jewelry as a gift.<br />- Delivered in a reasonable time<br /><br />CONS (from mine not my wife's perspective):<br /><br />- Needs good lighting for diamonds to sparkle*<br />- Though setting seems well made, reflection of diamonds not as bright as I'd like*<br />  Rating of 3.5/4 given due to this.<br /><br />*Notes: Convert MM to Inches and get out the ruler so you know the size you are getting.<br />  It seems that clarity ratings/cloudiness are nearly always low for pendants (here or at other online stores).<br /><br />OVERALL: This item works for value, as comparable items I have seen are about the same quality. My wife is happy with it and that's what really matters.  I am a little more critical when spending money on jewelry since jewelry is a very high-profit item.  Sam's Club had these on sale at the store at the time of this review, may want to check theirs out or a jewelry store for comparison (compare by clarity ratings).  My unofficial non-numeric ratings: COLOR -  slightly off-clear; CUT -  Fair (affects brightness); Clarity - some minor defects."
4.0,Gave it to my grand daughter as part of her. Hristmas present. She loved it!
4.0,I purchased this for myself to protect my hair during my shifts at the hospital. I love how much room I have in this because I have really thick hair. This bouffant is adjustable which is a major plus. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because it doesn‚Äôt have the buttons on the outside for the face masks. The buttons would‚Äôve been a plus!! Overall I would purchase this product again.
4.0,"Socks were $9.99 for 7 pairs which puts them at about almost a $1.50 per pair.  Only thing I would say is that they are very linty and I can't figure out what one of the designs are. It looks like it may be an ""M"", but that's okay."
4.0,perfect!!n Material is soft! Im 5'4 34C and perfect fit!
4.0,The belt is a nice style and the little chain is a cute add on for a little different look.  Quality is decent for the price. I only gave 4 stars because the belt seems to run a little small.  I'm a size 6 and it is set on the last couple of holes and this is on my jeans a little higher on the my waist. If I was wearing my lower cut jeans I probably would not be able to wear the belt.
4.0,"I like everything except the zipper.  It is metal, which is good, but there is no lock on it so it unzips itself a little which if abrasive when it rubs against you.  I wear mine around my waist as a holster so when I‚Äôm sitting, it‚Äôs grating my arm!"
4.0,I gave it a 4 star because the packing of dress had a smell but I will wash it before wearing it. Other than that cute dress!
4.0,I always think I need Large in all tips; this top is generous and could have done a Large; I am 5‚Äô3 198#.
4.0,"These liners fit fairly well. They are a little bit thinner than I would like them to be and have rubber around the inside of the liner and on the back. The rubber around the inside can get a little uncomfortable, but you get used to it after awhile. I love the quantity that come in this pack! If you are like me I wear my frequently and I always seem to run out. It's great to have so many pairs on hand. Overall, I give them 4 stars because they are slightly uncomfortable."
4.0,"First off. These are Not jeggings, at all. They are some sort of polyester/lycra blend stretchy pants. But, that being said. They are Very comfy pants, and the material is nice, and could be dressed up or dressed down. You could wear these as office attire, or club wear, depending on the top. They look really tiny coming out of the package. But they stretch alot! I ordered a size medium. Im 5'5, 145 lbs 27&#34; high waist, 37 hips. I usually wear a size 2-4 in high waist jeans. I could not have buttoned a small. And i feel the large would have been too big...For the price, ill be keeping these and wearing them with longer tops. My legs are pretty short, and these hit me at the ankle. They are gonna be capris on someone taller than me.  Keep in mind these pants have no structure to them. They DO NOT hold you in at all... So,skip the big breakfast..They are very unforgiving!"
4.0,"Very cute, but a bit longer then expected."
4.0,"Somewhat small, but cute"
4.0,"Nice shirt, bought for Christmas but the colors were more primary than Christmas appropriate. But nice shirt."
4.0,These are cute but run pretty small.
4.0,"I ordered this bag for an upcoming trip.  I haven't put it to use yet so I can't really give it 5 stars.  I must say I really like it.  I thought it was going to be heavy but it's not too bad.  I haven't put anything in yet but the empty weight is fine.  It is VERY sturdy.  The strap is plenty long enough to adjust to any height.  I see what people mean about the strap being awkward near the neck but you just have to lower so it's more on your shoulder.  I won't be putting a cushion on it cause...well I want to look cool.  I was concerned it would look too masculine but it doesn't.  I'm totally fine wearing this across my body with a nice outfit on (meaning shorts and a top or a casual dress).  The bag wouldn't work with a  dressy outfit...purely from a vanity standpoint.  But just for casual walking around this bag is fine (even when NOT traveling, this bag is fine).  I'm excited about using it.  I've even decided to wear it on the airplane.  And there are lots of pockets and pouches and zippers which I absolutely love.  I just have to be sure not to overstuff it.  I don't think it will look as flattering if the shape is 'round'  from jamming it with too much stuff.  I will definitely feel safe that no one will 'cut and snatch' this bag.  The price is the best on Amazon.  I checked another store and it was $16 more.  Same bag and even more if you want it in cranberry.  The cranberry is exactly as pictured.  It's kind of a muted red; not red lipstick red.  A nice 'go with anything' red.  I'm happy.  And I'm glad I got this size."
4.0,Fit is good I like them
4.0,Really beautiful pair. Much nicer than in picture and a lot bigger than I expected. The crystals look like they are of good quality and always got compliments when wearing these. Only negative is that they are heavy and so cannot wear them for an extended period of time as they start to hurt.
4.0,"Work at an art gallery so always looking for fun, artistic design in clothing.<br />  This dress meets the bill....and for a low bill!  Wear with bare legs or leggings, it transitions from summer to fall."
4.0,I am pleased to receive a set of socks that fit just right!
4.0,"Cute hat, thin but comfy.  It's a little tight, but I have a big head!"
4.0,I really like the color of this watch band because it matches my purse perfectly.  The leather is also very flexible and is extremely comfortable to wear.  The attachments that fix to the actual apple watch click into place perfectly.  I did not experience any problems at all taking the band on or off the watch.  This band goes perfectly with the stainless steel apple watch since the clasps are stainless steel as well.  I am very pleased with the band.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,"Very very cute. Doesn't seem like it will last terribly long, but it is cute and sturdy enough for a summer purse. Small interior space though, fair warning"
4.0,"Awesome hat! But beware those with larger heads! This will run a bit tighter for those of us who have a heads on the bigger side. Still, a fun addition to the evergrowing Doctor Who Ensemble"
4.0,Usually wear a medium ordered a Large just to make sure it hangs off shoulder it fits perfectly
4.0,"Kinda big, no left-side pocket. üòû"
4.0,Used to make our Halloween jelly fish costumes which turned out really cute!
4.0,"I have had  problems with 2 or the carabiners not wanting to open or close easily. I may try treating with WD-40 to see if that resolves the problem. Other than this, they are good products."
4.0,easy to take with you
4.0,Love my Defender2/kaki- I like it much tho in low light it is hard to tell what time it is if the lume is not charged.. In light/daytime with the chocolate canvas strap its a sweet looking watch- it runs about + 6/7 a day..
4.0,"This sweater is super cute!  I am a little worried what it will look like after several washes, but for the price, it can't be beat.  Great color.  Very soft."
4.0,"Ordered a large and although it fit, I could have definitely sized down to a medium. The material is also a little funny but that‚Äôs only in person. It photographs very well and the color shows just like in the picture."
4.0,"The jewelry looks too big on me, it is very pretty."
4.0,"I‚Äôm a 53 y/o male Dr. Who fan. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô, about 190 lbs, 41‚Äù chest 34‚Äù waist. The sweatshirt fits great! It is very comfortable. The hood is large and deep, completely covering your head and beyond, blocking wind from the sides. It also rests comfortably around your neck, if you like, or on your back. I ordered a large as I like my hoodies a bit relaxed. I don‚Äôt know if a medium would have worked. I just received it, so for now four stars. I‚Äôll have to see how good it holds up-hopefully for a long time."
4.0,"These earrings by Rimayzi remind me of some I had in the 90s, which is probably what attracted me to them in the first place. They are 18K gold plated, with a solid base/disk and multiple oval rings. They dangle (but don‚Äôt jingle) and are fun. They can be worn dressy or casual. They are lightweight, comfortable in the ear and don‚Äôt irritate my skin."
4.0,Love these offer great support as I am pregnant and really don't fit in anything other than sports bras right now. 4 stars simply because one shredded in the washer first wash.
4.0,"I'm giving these 4 stars, because they look really good and the leather was nice. Very well made. However, I ordered an 8.5W thinking it would be a wide calf as in most boots. I was wrong. It was a wide width in the foot. They were way to big in the footbed. I actually like a little extra room in the toe box for thick toes, but this was too much. These were going to be a gift for my daughter who has long skinny toes, but likes a little extra room in the calf to wear jeans comfortably. Her feet were flopping all over the place. Based on the fit, I am guessing the regular width would also be pretty roomy. So, if you like to wear bulky socks or your feet tend to swell, you will probably love these."
4.0,"Cute, but quite large for what I expected. My grandson is six and a slender boy. He needed a size closer to four, instead of a 5/6.<br />He loved them, I hope he still likes them next summer."
4.0,"This necklace is very pretty. Of course, as expected at such a low price, the chain is poor quality and won't look great for long but I don't regret my purchase since the price is so low. Shipping takes forever but it's worth the wait."
4.0,"So far I like it. It appears to be a pretty good clone of another tritium watch and they pull it off rather well and at less than 1/2 the price. My biggest concern is the black coating over the stainless. I've had it about 6 weeks and there are already places where the coating is rubbing/chipping off. I wish I could have bought a full stainless model but at this price point, I can deal with it. The tritium glow is very comparable to my Lu***** watch that this is replacing and I really like the multiple colors. The band seems to be well made but it could be smoother at the edges of the links. The crystal seems very well made. I thought that might be a weak point as well but so far not a scratch and I am not gentle on watches. My only other complaint so far is that the rotating bezel rotates too easily. I am constantly having to realign it to 12."
4.0,I'm 5'6&#34; and weigh 170 lbs and I'm between a Medium and a Large so I ordered the Large. It's a little on the roomy side so it probably fits a true Large like a glove. The material is stiff right out of the bag but the dress is comfortable. The legnth is at the knee on me. Perfect for work!
4.0,"I ordered these for my husband. They are really nice, soft, and comfortable. The elastic is perfect, not too tight and not too thick. He loves the way they feel and that they do not bunch up. They didn‚Äôt shrink up when washing and drying which is a huge plus and five to a pack is a great deal."
4.0,Good quality for price. Surpised how well you can see out of them.
4.0,It‚Äôs what I would expect for the price but don‚Äôt expect it to last long. It hangs well and fits as expected (5‚Äô5‚Äù 130lb) but I don‚Äôt think it will hold up well with washing so I‚Äôm washing on gentle and hanging to dry. I do like the pockets and it doesn‚Äôt wrinkle
4.0,It's cute but doesn't fit my iPhone 7 plus
4.0,"So pretty, I love them! One point taken off for poor packaging."
4.0,"Looks great, but creeps up alot.  Got alot of compliments!"
4.0,My wife likes the wallet/clutch but it has a very strong chemical smell. Hoping it will fade away shortly.
4.0,"Arrived on time. They come in a vacuum sealed package which is very nice. Its a gift, so I can't give a total review since I won't open the package. I am sure they are going to be a great item"
4.0,Looks great. Nice material.
4.0,"I'm 4'11, 104lbs, and it fit really well! The inside of the cups is soft, and the material is thick enough so that you don't have to wear a bra. The cups might be just a tad too big, but other than that, no complaints :) I wear a 34B cup bra"
4.0,The sleeves were a little tight on her upper arm (was a gift) but it was very soft and still very wearable
4.0,Super cute. Lovely fabric but straps are a tat long. My girls have to wear a shirt under to prevent their chests from showing.
4.0,Cute earrings. Casual
4.0,"The product is one size fits all. I wish the product fit a wee bit tighter. But I have a small head, if iou have a large head, tight fit. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with product, as the price was reasonable and shipping to my house only took a few days. I‚Äôll recommend to buy."
4.0,"I wore these to a wedding as part of the bridal party. It's heavy and doesn't feel cheap! However, if you have sensitive ears, I wouldn't wear this longer for 8 hours. At the end of the day, my earlobes were burning slightly and uncomfortable. It's definitely because of the subpar metals in this product."
4.0,"I bought this pair for everyday wear and it is great, so far. It‚Äôs made out good-quality plastic and the arms are of metal. Personally, they don‚Äôt look good on me but that‚Äôs an individual issues. Overall, I do like the product, it does what it is designed for: blocking out sun rays. Also, they do look stylish."
4.0,I brought the same kind of frame 2 years ago and loved it. This new one I just got is good but not as good as the old one.
4.0,Love this dress! Can dress it up or down and wear with chucks. One seam was coming undone that's why I only gave it 4 stars. But fits as expected. I have a larger chest. Looks great with a belt etc. must have!
4.0,"I love the soft pink color and the feel and quality of the material is much better than anything else I've found.  I ordered a size small for my almost 3 year old, and it fits perfect.<br /><br />I wash it with her tights every week after her class on gentle cycle and its starting to look rather worn/snagged in places.  In hindsight, I should have only hand washed it separately to keep that from happening."
4.0,The white one came dirty. And you can‚Äôt tell from the picture but there is pink on it too from the packaging. But besides that they are comfy.
4.0,Fit as expected  because I bought an extra large but I wear 33 in waist. Love them.
4.0,"I love this bag, I love the color but after a few days of using it my jeans started rubbing on the bottom side so it has some blue jean residue :("
4.0,"Looks like the picture, fast shipping, and it fit as expected."
4.0,This one size cover up is somewhat small. I assumed it would be pretty big and flowy because it is one size but it is a little more fitted. It is very pretty though and I haven't been able to wear it yet so I don't know how well it will hold up.
4.0,"I haven't worn in the pool yet so I don't know how it will hold up, as I do water aerobics 3 - 5 times a week.  I ordered the blue because it had racerback but when I got the suit, it has the keyhole in the back (like the one ordered in brown).  I'll keep it and if it holds up I'll order another one.  Not sure why they show the back different than what they sell.  Little disappointed in that."
4.0,"I have to wear a face mask at work for twelve hour shifts. Much more comfortable than the ones they provide, but the picture is really small."
4.0,overall it is good quality but pendant is on the bigger side
4.0,It is running fast despite recalibration and receipt of radio signal.  Has not been dropped or abused.  Does this warrant a replacement?
4.0,Absolutely love these they just ran a bit smaller than what is labeled.
4.0,I like these and they are comfy and soft but kind of tight at the top.
4.0,"Good fit. Fun item. Would be a cute gift. Especially love the butterfly motif. However if you turn the cuff down, it covers the motif so I tend to just scrunch it down."
4.0,"Very cute one-piece.  It is made in average quality.  It fit me rather well in butt and tummy area, bust is a little big but I have smaller chest.  I think I will add my own cups so I have more lift.  I ordered 4 other one-pieces and this is the one I am keeping.  I added a photo because photos in reviews really help me in making purchasing decisions.  I am 5'1&#34; and 115 pounds."
4.0,Order a size down from your regular size due to the batwing style as ot is very generous in fit. I actually sold this one to a friend and ordered another one size smaller. It is a beautiful top and looks great with gray pants at work and jeans otherwise.
4.0,just as described very nice
4.0,They fit great and are holding up as expected after a few workouts and washes.
4.0,"Even cuter than I expected! I want one in every color. I ordered an XL, I'm between a size 12-14. It is a tiny bit loose.<br />I also ordered the petticoat to wear under it. Very good quality fabric, love the heart shaped buttons. I would buy more items from this seller.<br />I was leary of buying a dress online,  but I'm thrilled with the purchase."
4.0,"Mother of bride dress, it was perfect."
4.0,"Ok, these may not be designer, but for the money, they work great. Used these to dress as the grinch for Christmas, they fit good and I was able to use my hands somewhat. Only issue was the green ‚Äúfur‚Äù on them does shed some, especially if you wave your hands a bunch or use the gloves vigorously, but I expect that for an inexpensive option. IMO- good buy for a one or maybe few time use to get the Grinch affect."
4.0,"These panties are lovely, but if you read the product description, you will note that they need special washing care, in a lingerie bag.  Also, they fit me snugly, and I ordered size 7--the size I used to wear before I lost 73 pounds. The sizing chart is not accurate. I suggest you buy 1 or 2 sizes larger than you think you need."
4.0,The dress is very pretty but the material is rather thin but still wearable to a club or dressed up with jean shorts. The arms were tight for me but I will be ordering a xxl.
4.0,Help with seeing at night
4.0,"For the price they are a great buy ,the lenses are very good"
4.0,Noisy when walking
4.0,Great watch for casual or dress
4.0,Like the bra but wished the fabric under the arm was longer.....
4.0,They are cute for summer. Not the best quality but I really like them for the price.
4.0,Very attractive and solid.
4.0,"I loved the design and the product appears well made.  However, it would hold at least two pairs of glasses and is not soft or flexible at all.  I carry a small purse with just what I need, and this would not fit inside.  You might like it a lot, but it simply doesn't fit my needs.<br />  Another plus:  My order arrived two days after I place it (FedEx); sure can't complain about the service!"
4.0,I love them. Wear the galvanized ine every single day. But after an hour of wearing it. It becomes painful
4.0,I wear these everyday. They are my fave earrings
4.0,Good price for quantity.
4.0,Full coverage bra that will work well for low intensity sports.  I'm a 36D and bought a large which works fine.
4.0,It looks great but it fits super tight. I'm 5'7 about 185 lb athletic and medium is usually comfy with room for me on most hoodies but this one is very form fitted. Looks great but not the most relaxed fit which is what I am used to when it comes to most hoodies so keep that in mind. Otherwise all is great
4.0,I like the size and style of these. Two of the shells had slipped off the rings ad were in the bottom of the package. I can fix them with small needle nose pliers. I like them enough to fix them because they match my straw handbags.
4.0,"This is a well made bracelet with bold styling and it has a bit of a premium feel and look to it.  The polished clasp hook gives it an extra flair of shine and premium looks, but I was also very impressed with the tight braiding done with the leather which really can be hard to accomplish.  I've been looking for a nice leather bracelet to wear as part of my DJ persona when I perform on stage and when I was offered a discount for it in exchange for my honest evaluation and opinion on this one I couldn't say no!  I've seen some other reviews regarding its durability and so far I haven't seen that issue, but perhaps time will tell?  From what I can see this bracelet doesn't show any signs of falling apart or even fraying, so maybe it comes down to a matter of quality control since these have to be hand made, or at least finished with human intervention.  My only complaint about it is the fact that there is zero adjustability in the sizing and it's just too large for my wrists, and I'm a 200 lb man.  I can't really dock the bracelet too much for that since they do state the size in the description, but I believe they'd sell a whole lot more if they figured out a way to make it adjustable.  Overall, I'm still happy with this bracelet, impressed with its quality, and definitely think it is worth its asking price.  Now if I could only figure out a way to hack it and make it fit!"
4.0,"I'm 5'6', ~120 lbs, and I ordered a 6/8. I found the fit to be pretty great!<br /><br />The material is a little bit thin, as other reviews have mentioned. I'm pretty happy with this dress though, and I found the fit to be about what I expected, after navigating their weird size chart."
4.0,A little smaller than posted size
4.0,Ordered a 3x. Really really big. Returned for a 2x. Fits exactly as pictured. Looks somewhat odd when you wear it straight. Really cute when you put it off the shoulder.
4.0,"Quality fabric, fit great"
4.0,Everything ok it doesn't lock in or anything but some how its keeping the earing in place
4.0,Cut kind of small. I'm usually a small but I should've ordered a medium. Other than that I LOVED it.
4.0,"I love to switch up my bands to go with my outfits & I didn't want to spend a mint on the Samsung brand so I tried this one (black) from V-MORO and I LOVE IT!!! Very reasonably priced, comfortable and flexible, I think just as good as Samsung. I plan on buying more of these really soon."
4.0,The bracelet looks nice enough it's just that the stainless steel look really cheap.But the design is nice.
4.0,"Smooth and comfortable, plenty of space, and the slide pocket makes my most often used cards very accessable"
4.0,The fabric is very light but not thin. Structure and zipper back is beautiful I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and the dress Runs<br />Longer than i was expecting but it‚Äôs plus bcuz I like to wear over knee style dresses the slit is beautiful too. The shipping was precisely faster.
4.0,"Good value.  There is a net lining which I like.  Wide brim provides good protection.  But the color is not ‚Äúoff-white‚Äù, it‚Äôs beige.<br />So hard to find a white sun hat these days."
4.0,"The seem good for the price, slightly large but I was at the in between size and sized up to be safe but may return for a size down"
4.0,These are super cute and actually look like much more expensive shoes. Where you can tell they are not is comfort. They‚Äôre pretty stiff and will need to be broken in. I‚Äôm thinking after 4 or 5 wears they will soften up a bit.
4.0,Nice print.
4.0,When I saw the shirt i imdialty saw myself wearing it and to be fair I like it however the only thing I don't like about it are the lines divding the color it feels werid pressed up against the skin or maybe im just used to flat shirt with out any divding bulbs if you're thinking about buying this shirt go for it its worth the price and looks nice and nothing a muscle shirt underneath cant fix those bump dividers
4.0,"I got this to wear for gardening in the backyard, and it's perfect for that...thin and breathable material. The fit is a bit odd and I had to tie the shoulder straps to make them fit properly (I'm 5'5"" and 125lbs) but other than that they could be cute for wearing out if you're okay with the thin material."
4.0,"A friend told me to buy this for her because it had so much good reviews. The title said ' It's okay ' because for one, it's long and the length could be adjusted. But the down fall is that it roll up when she does slightly workout and the velcro barely stick on"
4.0,"Good, but way more &#34;polyester&#34; looking than I care for."
4.0,My grandson loves them. Especially since they light up.
4.0,It‚Äôs stretchy material to move in. It is tight fitting if it‚Äôs the look you want. It‚Äôs not a short mini skirt falls about 3 inches above knees.
4.0,"This sweater runs small, but I like the way it washes and I really like the material. Would buy in a bigger size, if they had it."
4.0,"WISH IT HAD COME IN A SIZE BIGGER, BUT ITS SO BEAUTIFUL AND FLOWY"
4.0,Very pretty caftan.......Nice to wear on a hot day........
4.0,there decent glasses but just a few months ago I got the same ones that were polarized less dark better for three dollars less
4.0,"I use the cap to hold my satin scarf in place when wrapping my locs it does the job well. However, the logo faded without any washes and for that I give 4 stars. Still I like the cap"
4.0,These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I will say that they are on the heavier side for earrings so I'd more than likely only wear them for events and maybe date nights.
4.0,"I waited for this dress for awhile as it was on back order.  The colors (navy and yellow) are true to the photos, and the fit is good although I'm only 5'3&#34; and it hits right at the top of my foot/ankle.  I have to wear flats with it."
4.0,"Does not fit everyone. Too small for me. The hat itself is nice, though not for a head that would normally buy large"
4.0,"I ordered these wedges for my wedding, and overall I am happy with them. I usually wear a size 8 and ordered an 8. They fit, but my heal was slipping out of the back a little too much for me to be comfortable. Instead of sending them back for a smaller size, I just got some adhesive heal pads and adhered them to the back of the shoe. They fit well now. I have worn these shoes for my bridal shower and my bachelorette party, the later having spent a good 4 hours dancing and partying it up. Overall, my feet held up well in these shoes. The next morning, my big toe was a little sore, as there really isn't any padding or support in the shoes. I think that they will look great for my wedding and they have held up well to two all day wears already."
4.0,"Kind of thin, but overall great socks."
4.0,Had to return it as it runs extremely small. My husband is a 10.5. I ordered an 11 because I read the reviews saying they ran small but I did not expect to have to go up to a size 13. The 11 had hand of his her sticking out
4.0,Feels sturdy can't wait to shoot a long shoot with it to really test it
4.0,"I only wanted a Snoopy keychain, but the price wasn‚Äôt crazy so I bought the set ( they did t have Snoopy by himself).  Seems like a typical decent keychain."
4.0,"I failed to read the word scarf. I thought it was a jacket, but it is very pretty."
4.0,"Great selection, and more durable than plastic, hold collar in place"
4.0,"I decided to try this for our ever growing boy. It came large as expected and his feet did slip out occasionally because the miss measured snap spacing, leaving a larger gap between the last snap and the end of the opening near the foot.<br />All in all though I am satisfied with the jammies. They are soft and comfortable. No issues with them falling apart in the wash. For the comparable price it is was good value. I could have gone to Carters for a similar quality and more expensive. Also I believe he grew into these well and they were useful longer than most. We graduated a size of name brand jammies while these were still in use."
4.0,Made a little small from costume material. Seems durable.
4.0,"These are super cute and thick slipper socks. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to have my babe wear them with shoes but they are absolutely perfect for hanging around the house which is where my baby spends majority of his time! The grips are substantial and help my newly walking dude cruise on the wood floors.<br />The colors are great and dog designs are really cute, my baby kept playing with and looking at them the first time he wore them!<br />My baby is 12M and fits a 4 shoe and these fit him well. I tried taking a picture but moving toddler so ya know‚Ä¶<br />My only concern is the pompoms! While being very adorable they CAN and DO pull off and become a choking hazard. For peace of mind don‚Äôt leave baby unsupervised in these sock unless you cut the PomPoms off from the start. These socks are still super cute thick and warm without them."
4.0,"Very cute, bought as a gift for my niece.  She luvs it, I'm very happy with the product and the price. I would recommend this product."
4.0,Nice little  Wallet
4.0,"Run larger than Sam Edelman.  I kept the 9, not sure if the 8 1/2 would have worked better..."
4.0,"and what a fantastic gift!! Came with a box, a case a cloth and as a bonus, a really nice pair of clip on sunglasses!!! Overall, i'm very pleased with this item.. and the recipient of the gift was as well!!"
4.0,A gift for my granddaughter.  She chose it.  It was exactly as presented and she was very happy/pricing a plus too.  Only thing to keep in mind is that it is shipped from out of the states so if you want it quickly don't make the purchase.
4.0,Was great but a little too big I'm 5 feet and I know I'm short
4.0,"Unfortunately wearing a mask is currently a necessity, whenever I'm able to remove it I do, and not having to carry it in my hand or forgetting it.  This lanyard is great for that, however, I feel it is a tad long and the strap is a tad too wide."
4.0,"I really liked this! Good deal, good skirt. It does spell when you remove from the packaging but that should go away."
4.0,"Good for design, not for protection!"
4.0,"Not as comfortable as I hoped, but good overall. Slightly itchy/scratchy. Very slightly."
4.0,"I bought these for a half marathon that I was running in. They're perfect for running, they don't move! Although, the only complaint I have is that they fogged up super easily. I do live in swamp city so that didn't help while I was sweating and the morning air was chill and wet but overall great glasses!"
4.0,If I could get replacement lenses these would be the best glasses I‚Äôve owned.
4.0,"This actually was better than I was expecting! It is a slick sort of fabric, which worried me when I opened it. It isn't the cotton-type material I was expecting. I washed it in a delicates bag with detergent & liquid fabric softener, and line dried it. It feels much nicer once it's washed. It fits, however I was hoping it would be a little looser, so if you want something more like what the model is wearing, you may want to size up. It's a pretty versatile top, and you can easily pair it with leggings, jeans, or shorts."
4.0,"No strap or anything, but the clip definitely holds onto my boot nicely. Please don't think you're getting a ka-bar knife or anything like that. The price you pay shows in the quality, and the body of the blade has this textured coating on it. But for the price, it's a decent blade. Really no complaints"
4.0,Short in back will probably have to order a size up and hope it is not too baggy on top. I am 5'5&#34; and 145 lbs. I ordered a medium. The laser cut design revealed my butt in back. My bra size is a 34D.
4.0,Great alternative to the real Holbrooks. Tinting is not a mirrored as the real ones but great looking shades for the price. I definitely would recommend.
4.0,"I‚Äôve purchased this dress twice before in different sizes. This material was different. The other two were cotton, this one was silk."
4.0,Had to return and order next size up even though sons measurements were just short of previous size.. other than that my son loves it and wears it regularly
4.0,Was pleased with the quality and fit.
4.0,I did not anticipated the size and length of these earrings. Very pretty for someone taller and slimmer.  Thank you though for letting me return them.
4.0,"The corset was a little smaller than I expected (I have a small waist but larger boobs), but with some relacing and manipulation, I was able to make it work for the costume party I attended. Quality was great, especially for the price!"
4.0,I love the design of the shirt and fits good. The Frankenstein picture is a little low on the shirt otherwise great shirt.
4.0,So far I like it.  I don t know how it will hold up.  A little &#34;brassy&#34; looking for low price.....
4.0,Very cute! I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the sleeves so I cut them off. It was very cute!
4.0,"This is a very nice leather bag.  It has lots of pockets and I like that it has an adjustable strap.  My only problem is that it's surprisingly small inside, that's why I gave it only 4 stars.  I can barely fit a wallet and two pair of glasses.  I even downsized to a smaller wallet but it's still a tight fit.  Needless to say I only use it when I don't have to carry all my other stuff with me."
4.0,These look a little cheap but if its just for daily wear then theyre cute and easy to slip on.
4.0,"True to size.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 34B, 140.  I usually wear a size 4, and the small fit well, hit right above the knee.  I did return bc the floral pattern looked matronly on me personally, but I actually really liked this dress."
4.0,Everything but the broom is great. A little too generic
4.0,"I wore this coat the day after I received it and the fit is just about perfect. It is a little shorter than what I normally wear but I love the rich color and the luscious, rich texture of the fabric. It looks great on and I can do a lot of mix and match as I have a lot of black & white outfits.<br />LOVE THIS COAT!!!"
4.0,"I bought this for a holiday gift!  Even I am not a prime customer, I placed order on Sunday and received it by the following Thursday!  I meet the person for the gift Sunday!  Very happy I made it!  The necklace looks pretty and hopefully my friend will love it!"
4.0,"Lovely hat, but size adjustment strap at the back poorly designed and will not remain locked. Hat fits well enough that strap becomes more of a visual thing though. Ear flaps large enough to allow adequate protection against winter wind. So, no problem"
4.0,"I originally purchased screw back diamond earrings because I constantly lose the normal type backs. Well sure enough,  lost a screw back so I purchased these. They look exactly as shown. I was very apprehensive however these are great! They work well with the threading on my earring and definitely lock in place. I still have my original backing on one side and am always having to adjust it while I never have to adjust this product. They come as a pair, I'm just not using its mate yet. Highly recommend. I sleep, shower, etc. I never take them off."
4.0,"It‚Äôs comfortable and a nice length - almost to knees on my 5‚Äô9 frame. It‚Äôs a kind of cheap material and I don‚Äôt expect it to last long, but it‚Äôs pretty and I‚Äôll enjoy it while it lasts."
4.0,Material 2 tiny
4.0,"Well made, but a little heavy and large for me."
4.0,"The hat arrived in a small plastic shipping envelope thus proving the claim that it is crushable. However, as noted by other reviewers after it gets unpacked and worked into its approximate intended shape it gets better.  If you place it on a flat surface and put books or such on the brim for a day or so it becomes respectable.  Lightly spray the persistent wavy spots with water (or wrinkle spray) and repeat the above until you get it where you want it.  I've got one part of the brim that still needs to be taught a lesson but seems to be ready to give up.  Remember what you paid for it and be patient and you'll find it's a pretty good product."
4.0,"Overall loved ths product, unfortunately a friends child loved it as well asked if he could have them and i had to part ways. He recently turned 10 and still are in great shape. Would buy them once more but I now have 4 pairs of different sunglasses and 2 that need repairing."
4.0,"Fabric is heavy and plastic coated. This makes it durable,  but also makes the pockets rigid and tight. It is hard to fit much of anything into them. Color is a little brighter than I expected,  but it looks good"
4.0,It doesn‚Äôt breathe as well as I‚Äôd hoped
4.0,"I liked it for what it was, but it runs big and I got a small and it fits like a medium. It's a good, durable skirt to  have, but I dont know if it was worth the price."
4.0,"This top is better in person.  The colors are beautiful.  I do wish it was a bit thicker, but for office or indoor wear, it's perfect."
4.0,"Overall a very good set of gloves. The cashmere lining is soft and the leather extremely supple, with decent responsiveness when using my phone. The only small issues I have is that the fit is a little loose around the palms (but maybe that's just my hand), and they aren't the absolute warmest gloves. They do a decent job for New England winter weather but I can still feel the cold creeping in a little. I've received many complements though, and would largely recommend these to anyone else."
4.0,Sash was large and crown too big but I was able to make it work.
4.0,I ordered the 2t for my 2 year old because I read these were tts. The neck on this dress is so large it could almost slip off. We didn't get to wear it for Christmas so ill hold onto it for next winter we might get to wear it as a tunic.
4.0,So instead of buying a maternity swimsuit I wanted to see if I could find a better option & I found this! I ordered a size large and it fits great!! The top might be slightest bit big but I‚Äôm growing and it might be a bit cheeky but that‚Äôs okay! :) but I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. Ima wear this for my baby moon üåù
4.0,"Perfect lightweight summer dress.  Only gave 4 stars because it does need some pressing once washed, which I don't like to do!"
4.0,"Legs are much shorter than advertised. That was disappointing. Otherwise, comfortable."
4.0,"It should be cool as I was hoping. Somewhat large, but it will be more comfortable."
4.0,Beautiful coat.. Arrived super wrinkled
4.0,They were cheap so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. My son loves them though.
4.0,Hermosa gafas
4.0,"I lost my kitty, Dolly, on April 20, 2020.  It was one of the hardest days of my life.  I wanted to know that I could always have a little piece of her with me, so this was the perfect way.  I love this necklace so much.  Very cute and love that her name is on it.  The only flaw is that it can only hold the tiniest bit if ashes and half of that space needs to be saved for the screw.  I thought there was going to be a little more hollow room upwards in the cat for her ashes, but there wasnt.  I managed to get a tiny bit in, but wish it could have been a little more.  Might buy something additional to fill and out on the chain with it.  Regardless, I love this necklace so much"
4.0,The size was a good fit for me and comparable to other cycling gloves I have worn. They are comfortable and provide adequate protection from the vibrations the biker receives from the road.<br /><br />The price was good considering the quality of the product.
4.0,"This is a cute top, but I wish it were cotton instead of the silky workout wear type material. @ 5‚Äô8 120lbs 36C bust I listened to other reviewers & ordered waaay up!!!! A large. I usually wear a small. The large fit perfect. Also. There ARE modesty panels on the sides where the laces are but the laces are literally 10 inches too long, and they came only partially laced. I had to lace the panels up myself."
4.0,"You don't have to be super skinny to look great with this dress, great quality for the price."
4.0,El producto fue lo que esperaba
4.0,"SUPER CUTE. Easy to walk in, comfortable. The only thing that sucks; I was sent the wrong color. Still cute either way but I wish I would‚Äôve gotten the color I ordered."
4.0,This dress was adorable for my baby‚Äôs bday. She‚Äôs 5‚Äù2 and 112 lbs and the dress fit nice it‚Äôs loose and the print is nice
4.0,"Super cute and good quality, however, these bottoms run pretty small so I recommended sizing up at least one size."
4.0,my son likes the look at workouts
4.0,Fits well and they are warm. I tend to be super cold all the time even in summer even at 95 degrees.<br /> So for me I would like them to be longer but they are just as pictured and lasted for a year.
4.0,"The blue color is beautiful.  It is a slightly fitted style.  I bought the xl, for a looser/longer fit to wear with leggings. My normal size is a medium/large or 10/12; and I am 5'3"", 140lbs."
4.0,my mom like it a lote
4.0,me gustaron mucho los compre para regalar a mis nietas a las que le encanto.
4.0,This was a stocking stuffer for my husband. He wears a normal size toboggan. He really liked that this is lined and so warm but it does fit a but snuggly.
4.0,Nice scarf. Looks like the picture but I don't like it as well as I thought I would (not the seller's fault.)  Arrived quickly.
4.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a lot of earrings but ones that don‚Äôt cost a ton of money then get these. I wear them all the time and get a lot of compliments. They‚Äôre pretty cheaply made, so you‚Äôre invisibly getting what you pay for. I think they‚Äôre great considering the cheap price."
4.0,"The chain broke day one, which caused us to lose the BFF piece for good - eventually found the half heart though so I can put it on another chain. Don‚Äôt have a ton of faith that the jump ring will last on the new chain but the pendant itself is GREAT. The two halves connect with a magnet to click in place, they look really nice too. So we can‚Äôt expect too much at this price point - I‚Äôm happy with the purchase overall, but if you‚Äôre going to lose the awesome parts because the crappy parts eat it, have to deduct a star"
4.0,Very comfortable. I bought 3.<br />It does not do well with hot water so I washed cold and hung to dry.<br />The black one is a lint magnet.<br />They are not expensive so I didn‚Äôt expect premium quality.
4.0,These leggings fit wonderfully. The pocket is big enough for a large phone. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the inner stitching is a bit bothersome for my skin.
4.0,I am very pleased with my shirts... I only wish they were without the tags on the neck.
4.0,Good size and weight
4.0,love these - only :( was the fake pockets are to low on the butt. I just wear a longer shirt!! I would buy again
4.0,"This was a big hit with my 12-year-old daughter.  It fits well, seems to be made well and is apparently &#34;cool&#34; enough :)"
4.0,Fast and really cute. Just a little tight.
4.0,I love the dress. Little darker than I expected but cute. Very modest.
4.0,"Size runs a bit big, but other than that the dress is beautiful and material is great!"
4.0,Gift - as advertised.
4.0,Very eell made and shows off medallion great
4.0,A lot thinner than I was expecting. I also wish it was longer to cover more of my neck. Still like it very much though. I'd buy again.
4.0,"The apron part is supposed to be gathered into ruffles but the threads were pulled out leaving one side of it just flat... it still looks cute, the flaws are fixable and it is great for cute photos. For the price this isn't bad at all, just know that you might need to touch up some of the sewing."
4.0,Looks nice - but they are heavy - after a few hours I have to take them off - too heavy for my ears
4.0,This product is just what I needed to organize my carry on bag. Love it. I'm going to buy more.
4.0,"Love them! But runs small, order a half size up, I wear a 9 and my toe is right at the edge, but they are so cute and comfy."
4.0,"Love the color, love the fabric, love everything minus the small neck hole. Purchased a size up, it didn't shrink but glad I did since the neck hole is so tight (and I don't even have a big neck)."
4.0,"Fits snug on the stomach and chest, however tight on my arms shoulders"
4.0,"I got these as stocking stuffers for Christmas, and with this many in a bundle, everybody will get one...or two, or three. These are large enough to fit over most women's wrists, and they are lightweight, and don't make a lot of noise when they collide with each other. The design is nice too."
4.0,Its pretty. Haven't worn it yet.
4.0,Very pretty and well made but they run big! Super stretchy!  Order a size smaller. I am currently in the process of returning them and ordering a smaller size. brilliant deep black and nice embroidery.
4.0,"Work in a cardiac unit, on my feet alot. Made my legs feel much better."
4.0,"This suit is so cute that I‚Äôm sad that I had to return it. I thought I could make the top work- even though previous reviews said larger chests can‚Äôt wear this. I am a true medium bottom, but a 34D top. I bought a Medium suit. Bottoms were perfect, the top didn‚Äôt fit, and trust me I tried to make it fit. Everything was spilling out the sides of the top. I reluctantly returned it. But if you are smaller than a  D, you‚Äôre going to love this suit!"
4.0,it's beautiful and you have to be careful when storing this make sure it's not squeezed or it can break. Each little flower vine is connected with little metal rings in the back that can open up if they are strecthed too far. just be careful. It was a great buy for me
4.0,"Little on the small side, but soft fabric!"
4.0,VERY NICE ITEM WITH GOOD PRICE
4.0,"I really like these tanks for general wear, but they are just stretchy material not a compression garment at all. I have two compression shirts so I know the difference. The fact that seller uses guys with six pack abs,that are the last people to need a compression garment, tells you these are not compression shirts.<br />Sizing: I am 6-1, 198, 42 chest, 36 waist, and a taste for craft beer hence need for compression shirt. I ordered a Med and it fits comfortably snug and is plenty long (5-6"" below my waist). As such advise ignoring size chart, if you want a snug fit,which puts me in a Large.<br />I still need to purchase a compression tank or two, but am keeping these. I have washed one 6 times so far and it is hold up well so far."
4.0,I love dragonflies and the look of this bracelet. It's a little too delicate though. Easy to bend
4.0,"Good product. Long enough to cover head top to bottom. Doesn't have ear loops, so if you have a small head it can slip down below the nose. Nice comfy fabric, feels cool."
4.0,"I've had this dress for some months, just writing a review. Wore it today ( again) comfortable, a bit thin--but  I needed thin.  It's still hot where I am. It does not shrink. Pockets are great. Bluer than the pic with small white flecks. I wore a high waisted belt part of the day --dressed it up...<br />A bit long-after I took off the belt had to tie a knot at the bottom."
4.0,"This could be a really good watch if the quartz movement held up.<br /><br />I hate that the quartz movement failed after a few months while the leather strap and sapphire glass looks so intact.<br /><br />Yes, I bought this watch because of the sapphire glass and the beautiful leather strap, hope that the manufacturer can use higher quality quartz movement, then I would buy again."
4.0,These are some of my favorite socks to wear during BarreAmple. I do not slide at all and they are very comfortable!
4.0,"I indicated the product was &#34;somewhat large&#34;, but only because it is really flowy.  The arm holes are bigger and I often have to check to see if my strapless bra is peeking out. Despite the fact that I thought, based on the product image, that it would be a little more fitted/tight through the bust with the flowy hem, I still really love this top!  I often wear it with jeans and some tan pumps."
4.0,"They do run a tad on the bigger side. I usually, normally wear a 5.5 a nd this is what I purchased, in any sandals, heel type shoe. Sadly, these shoes run a tad big. My feet, toes do move in them more than they should. The material, straps need tightening. I am going to wash them and hope the straps will tighten up a bit. I really like the comfort, style and color. I wish there was a size down (5) I could order they'd be PEREFECT. Hence why I only gave them 4 stars.  If washing does not tighten them, I ill have to return. :("
4.0,Great shirt to use for a costume. Wish it were available in XS (and I'm not even skinny). It just looks a little baggy without a more tailored fit. Would recommend for anything that needs a Victorian feel.
4.0,"These are pretty good.  They are just a bit smaller than I anticipated, on my 5 & 7yr olds."
4.0,"Pretty, but a little  tight."
4.0,"Cute dress, comes as two separate pieces.<br /> Material is stretchy and thin but not see-through."
4.0,Too snug.  Hope to fit it soon
4.0,"Really comfortable. Fits great. I bought a medium and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 130lbs. I wanted a loose fit and I got that. Only downfall is that the material is on the thinner side so as I needed for work, I had my seamstress line it so it‚Äôd be appropriate. I can‚Äôt say about the other colors but the white is definitely see through. Other than that I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. Super comfy!"
4.0,Love these light weight earrings. They are more green than anything; not really jonquil coloring.
4.0,"I have been trying different types of compression socks to see if the hype about how they relieve different types of foot and or leg pain is true. I have nerve damage so I get that electric shock pain which is pretty hard to sleep with. For me, this pair made my feet swell and throb by the end of the day. My feet never swell. This pair was a real tight fit. I wear a size 9 for reference. I think I do better with compression socks that are mainly for the legs with no coverage on the toes. I think these caused me trouble because they ran small. They are made well. They had no bunching at the toes, no overheating, no odor and no moisture and they are a good value.<br /><br />*If my review of this item has been helpful please hit the helpful button to let Amazon know. Thank you!"
4.0,Like how they feel and fit. Also how flexible ande warm these gloves are. I thus far have found no dislikes
4.0,"I like the key chain, however on top of the unicorn horn it was not completely painted. ‚òπÔ∏è I do like the fuzzy ball. Just wish more attention was given when ensuring products are completely paint and ready for customers."
4.0,Ordered XL and armholes too big and too low cut.  I kept it and altered it myself at the shoulders and fits much better because when I first wore it I kept adjusting it all day long to not show cleavage.  Otherwise a good top but you need to wear neutral colored undergarments.
4.0,This wallet is durable and well made. It has an excellent feel to the grain and it fits almost everywhere.<br />Well packaged and excellent shipping time. The only thing I would change would be the inclusion of a zipper for an integrated coin holder.<br />At this point all the coins fall out when unzipped.
4.0,Its  a nice dress
4.0,"I love the color and the lacy top, but it‚Äôs definitely a lower quality material than I expected. The material itself if very comfortable, but was very loose around the bodice and even chest. However, it is certainly worth the affordable price. It isn‚Äôt a sturdy material and won‚Äôt hold anything in or keep a bodice structure - it feels almost like lingerie and is quite thin. I am 5‚Äô9 and ordered a medium and thought it would be form-fitting and hitnjust above the knee, but it was loose and longer than expected, hitting 2-3 inches below the knee. I‚Äôll still wear it, but will probably add a belt for support."
4.0,"I was expecting this to be skin-tight, but it was a little loose toward the backing... maybe I should just work out more? Anyways I'll still be using it for a costume piece!"
4.0,It's tight for me but works for my 13 year old son
4.0,Costume fit maybe just a little snug.  Straps were annoying. Good for the price.
4.0,Nice light pair of readers
4.0,This band is really nice with the quick change pins it makes it easy to swap out or install. The carbon fiber pattern looks cool but I thought this was going to be a top layer of carbon fiber with leather on the bottom. This is just leather stamped with a checkered pattern on it that has lines going in alternating directions. I still like the way it looks but I thought I was buying a carbon fiber strap not something that just looks like carbon fiber.
4.0,The fabric is very soft
4.0,I think they fit very nice and feel nice on.<br />Great choice of colors.
4.0,This is a very pretty top but is a little smaller & shorter than expected.
4.0,"They're larger and heavier than I expected, but seem pretty durable.  They've held up well for their first month.  :)"
4.0,Even though it is too small for me it's beautiful and well made
4.0,"We love Cristiano Ronaldo, but my son was pretty upset that the shirt was to big for him."
4.0,Gift for friend who loves flowers and plants. She was thrilled
4.0,"My 10-year old son wanted a watch to wear at school because his teacher chooses not to have a clock in her classroom for whatever reason and told him to bring a clock/watch from home (I know, what a weirdo). Being able to keep track of time makes him feel less anxious and helps him to stay on schedule. I chose this because it‚Äôs small, simple and affordable (plus these Casio watches are a classic). Nothing flashy, kid-friendly, and does what it‚Äôs intended for. Bonus points for date and day. I‚Äôm knocking off one star because the built-in ‚Äúlight‚Äù is kinda sad, and the buttons are tiny and a slight pain to mess with. Otherwise, It fits his wrist perfectly, and he loves it."
4.0,"I love this dress. It's very sexy, but it will highlight your flaws. I'm going to drop a few more pounds before I wear it out."
4.0,The seller kept begging for a review.  Great product but not cheap basically same price as in the stores.  Item arrived on time and was exactly what was advertised.  Not for serious weather more for looking good on a chilly day.
4.0,"Looks like picture, aside from a few sections where where the enamel appeared to end or continue a bit off the boundaries.  The details are lovely, especially the face, and it's quite sturdy.  It makes a bit of a jangling noise when you move around due to the multiple pieces, but I don't mind it at all.  Overall, a fun piece.  I love wearing it~"
4.0,I really like the bands except the silver band clasp on one side won't completely snap in so it comes apart sometimes.  I managed to push it in and wear the band tight enough that it doesn't pull apart.  The magnet is VERY strong and keeps your band in place.  I like it much much better than the plastic bands.  I would buy this item again.
4.0,These are great.  I put a little tape on the end of my glasses to make sure they are secure.
4.0,Nice lightweight warm down jacket. Runs a tad small.
4.0,As a gift for my granddaughter. Fitted perfectly
4.0,GGOD
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; , 152 lbs , 34A and 28 waist & I ordered a M.. I previously ordered a small before and it fit fine but the bottom was too tight for my butt cheeks. It's cute over but from the side you look bigger than what you are because of the oval cutout"
4.0,Like them a lot but had to immediately throw in washer. They smell gross. Hopefully that fixes it.
4.0,"The scarf might not last to a second winter, but at this price who cares?  I'll be tired of the colors next winter anyway."
4.0,"These fit great, would have loved them if they didn't have powder on them. Didnt know this when I ordered. But I did like them a lot and the held up well.<br />Got them to wear at work during the high of covid-19."
4.0,"I love the bracelet. I bought it as a gift for a friend. I haven't given it to her yet, but I'm sure she'll love it too. The band expands to very wide wrists, which is great. The beads seem very durable, and pretty. I would definitely purchase this item again. Loved it!"
4.0,This was a gift and it was too big.  The material was soft and warm. The design needs some changing to make the sides shorter and the snap band shorter/adjustable.  When the hat is on the snaps are was down to your neck and it doesn't snap anywhere close to your face.  It was a very nice hat but had design flaws.  It also ran larger than the person needed.  That person has smaller head (petite person) at 20 1/2 inch head.
4.0,"The band is very comfortable, several velcro points to ensure it stays. You can make it as loose or tight as you want. The edges that connect to the Fitbit face has sharp points and sometimes scratches me if I cross my arms. Other than that very good."
4.0,Cute dress just as pictured i should have ordered a size down because it‚Äôs so much dress i had to get it altered for my daughter
4.0,"The fabric is soft but it loses a star for being a bit thin. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 175lbs. The length hits at a flattering spot at the bottom of my knees. I ordered this dress in large and extra large because I have gained a tooon of pandemic weight. Unfortunately, the extra large fits my bosom but it is too big in the waist and a little short waisted for my figure. The large is also a little short waisted. It fits in the waist, but it is too small in the bosom. (I am currently spilling out of a 36DD) I will be returning both. Sad they didn‚Äôt fit because who doesn‚Äôt love a dress that shows off the girls and has useable pockets?!?"
4.0,"These shirts are unexpectedly Nice. These bulk purchases are normally not great. They are lightweight, quality, and Nice looking."
4.0,"nice dress, but I'm a curvy girl. I was constantly pulling it down in the front. Was showing my goodies all day üòü"
4.0,"I love the looks of this, and I love The style of the clasp that makes it adjustable. I would like to get more bracelets this style in the future. My only complaint is that you can‚Äôt adjust it on both sides of the clasp to keep the pendant even in the middle. I noticed it did give you a tad extra on the adjusting side probably for this reason, but I have very small wrists, around 6.25in around, so i I had to take off a lot and it ended up being awkwardly short on one side. I still wear it all the time and like it a lot, but I just wish I would have had it in my power to make it even. If they could add the ability to adjust on both sides, it would be perfect. I thought the quality was great for the money, exactly what I expected and wanted."
4.0,"Lovely dress, good quality and fits great. I usually wear a medium top and large bottom so I ordered large based on the reviews that it runs small."
4.0,my son likes his scarf
4.0,"I have been fairly disapointed with the durability of Star Wars Lightsabers for a long time.  You stike blade on blade to hard and they will be garunteed to bend.  Since then I have enjoyed these purely from a collectors stance.  There are a couple of things that are noteworthy though<br /><br />1) it IS possible to use two of the three filters at once.  Red and Green produce a orange-red color, and the blue green makes a nice teal.  This alleviates many complaints about blade color in my mind.  One can also find other filters at a Photography store for around $5 a pop.<br /><br />2) The customizability is Superb.  While the product says thousands of combinations (Mathmatically true)  to get really good looking Lightsabers out of one kit, it is more like a couple of dozen which is still plenty.<br /><br />3) the adapter ring means it is possible to create dual balded sabers.  While Cool, there is an insufficent amount of parts to make it look right.  I planned on getting a second kit for my girlfriend eventually so that way things can be symmetrical.<br /><br />4) The Solid Red Blade just plain looks better over the clear blade.  I know that means the only color you can see is red, but the tone itself is richer.  I have been un able however to transfer some of the solid blades over to this kit.<br /><br />If I have one complaint it is this, there are not enough parts avalible.  If I had my way I would include two more emitters, a purple filter, one more ""Grip"" and two of each of the small rings.  this would allow for more versatility, and uniformity in saber design.  Maybe Hasbro will sell ""add-on"" kits in the future..."
4.0,Larger than expected according to reviews on fit.  Needed a size down.
4.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 135, got the medium, think a small would have worked. The upper arms look a little poofy just like it shows. Roomy, warm."
4.0,If your short u will need heels on when u wear them other than that awrsome the feel of them are very nice i love them and the color never fades
4.0,"It's a nice little hat. But when I got it the little piece of Velcro that holds the speaker to the bar came off, I had to reattach it with glue. You might want to check that."
4.0,"Fits great!!! I only give it a 4 cause its a bit short for the event i'm going to. I got a med.  Could have gotten a large may have made a difference on the length. But it would be great for someone going to the club. Its nice and soft on the inside. It isn't see though, was a concern of mine. If this helps anyone i'm 5'5 160lbs and i have a rather big chest."
4.0,"Great price, good product. The reason for 4 stars is because they run about a size too small!"
4.0,"Very cute earrings. I thought they might be too heavy, but they are actually not bad."
4.0,Nice dress other than a bit shorter than I expected
4.0,Gorgeous pieces. Just a bit small on the bottoms.
4.0,Pleasantly surprised at how pretty it was for the price!
4.0,"Love the sweater, but the size large, is LARGE!!"
4.0,Wife loved the necklace. She being a nurse.
4.0,A simple design makes it easy to work.
4.0,"It's a very nice dress but a little tight even with the size up that I chose to get. Comfortable and worth the price paid, good for work but probably will start to get those fuzzies after a few washes."
4.0,they came really fast! i love the look. BUT four stars bc they aren't both pink . one is clear. i will order the blue pair eventually
4.0,Very comfortable!  I have plantar faciitis and my feet don't seem to hurt as much as when walking in other sandals.
4.0,Chain looks cheap. But pendent is very pretty.
4.0,"I have orders my fair share of giant tassel earrings.  These are beautiful and look expensive, but they are pretty heavy on the ears.  I will still wear them but long wear my cause stretching of the earlobes."
4.0,Not as big as I thought it was.  I'm a little bigger then normal.  5'3&#34; at 160 lbs
4.0,"When ordering this make sure you are aware that the print is made to look distressed. As I did not catch that (shopping in a hurry) and when I recieved it- it felt brand new but looked like it had been used and washed several times. I still like it, but would have preferred the writting to look new."
4.0,"I like them.  I'm a new pistol owner and take my gun to the range every 4-6 weeks to stay current.  I have also worn them for several hours at Nascar races.  I find them to be exceptionally comfortable for both short and long time periods.  They also have the highest NRR on the market, and they perform well at the range or the track.  Great value for the money.  My two complaints are VERY minor.  #1, they have a cheap feel to them.  That being said, they haven't broken in any way.  #2, they're gigantic, you look like a bug with them on.  This doesn't bother me in the least, since my only concern is saving my ears.  I would not hesitate to purchase these again."
4.0,"I'm a slim medium and this fits me well. Only wish it was a little longer as it can become untucked when bending over, at least for me."
4.0,Very nicely made good material would buy another in a different color
4.0,the shoulders strips are small in the L size while the circumfuse of the towel is large
4.0,"This dress is very pretty.  I ordered it in Boho red, which is really more of a magenta than a red.  I do like to color, though it was not what I was expecting.  It is very long.  I am 5'10&#34; and it is to the ground on me barefoot."
4.0,"Very confusing to tie up. The strings came separate and I had to figure out how to string it up like the model. I lost my patience and had to have my bf string it up, I still don't know how he did it. I think it would be so much better if it arrived already tied.<br /><br />Once I got it on, I was disappointed that it didn't look more similar to the models look. It's still super cute tho, very edgy!"
4.0,"Stays in well but it's pretty small, also makes you look like you have a huge blackhead because of the circle where the post connects. Does it's job for work though.."
4.0,They came smaller than I expected. So if you wear a seven get a size bigger. I love just can't wear them.
4.0,"The only reason I gave these 4 stars is because the fit is slightly norrow. But not to the point of unable to wear them. They do NOT pinch at the toe. Just more narrow then I like. Over all a very good boot. I love the color! I will probably only buy CAT boots, this is my third pair and I love them all!"
4.0,"The material quality is quite good for the marbles, but the string that holds it together does not support the weight of the bracelet. I have fixed it twice already in a couple of months because the string breaks all of the sudden. The only solution is to replace the fiber material with metal"
4.0,"The lens color in the pictures is more accurate than I expected... very very bright blue.  Still cute, but not subtle at all."
4.0,Fits well for me and I don't have a small head. Love the vintage look and worn feeling. Great bad hair day hat.
4.0,Bust area too big
4.0,This product fits good over your shoes also I like the look . I'm waiting to see what happens when I wear it outside
4.0,Nice frame and lens color.  Wish these where the Happy lenses..
4.0,"Really comfortable I‚Äôd buy it again, but not the same stripe pattern as shown in photo."
4.0,Super cute and fits perfect. Was a lil bumpy after washing. Be careful not to wash with certain items
4.0,"It is very nice, loves,The color is very nice...But I wasn't able to because of the lack i have very narrow. I am size L and I stay close"
4.0,Super light and breatheable. Fast shipping. Only wish they were made in usa. Would by from again.
4.0,"I like the bright pattern, overall shape is flattering, and good bottom coverage, but not sure if I like the tie behind my neck. As a 32DD I‚Äôm worried the thin strap will pull on my neck and bother me. I‚Äôm long waisted, 155 lbs and 5‚Äô4‚Äù and medium was a a good fit. I tried tying straps behind me and it seems like it would stay this way as strapless, but I need something for swimming with my kids, so this isn‚Äôt the best option for me."
4.0,I really live this pair but the quality is not so good. My husband just wear them for one week. One of the tunnels fall out on my rug and they broke. I recommend them but you really have to take care of them. They will brake easily.
4.0,"I've been using these regularly for a few months for working out. I'm extremely sweaty and these absorb my sweat without making me feel uncomfortably wet or hot. These are tight in the arms, so definitely size up because the seams are not stretchy. I sometimes pull up the sleeves because I don't want my wrists to be covered, but then it becomes tight in the forearm because the seams don't stretch with the fabric. The shoulder and torso fit is narrow, so it's good for people with square shoulders. There is also an odd seam that runs down the back of the arm. Usually in a sleeve this seam would run down the inside of the arm, so at first you might adjust it so that the seam is in that area, only to realize that the seam is supposed to be in the back; that's probably the weirdest thing about this garment. Despite these construction details, I still use these because it's hard to find this kind of garment at the retail stores where I live and especially one capable of absorbing the buckets of sweat I secrete. I don't recommend these if you have a larger chest because the compression causes it to pull up in the armpits and then there's a bit of a cowl around the neckline. These shirts only shrank a teeeeeensy bit in the wash the first time I washed it."
4.0,Shoes are pretty but way to big.
4.0,"I ordered this necklace on the 5th of November and received it on the 8th, the shipping speed was amazing and I was very excited to unwrap and wear the necklace.<br />The packaging was nice, it came in a box that would have been very easy to gift wrap. Lifting the top of the box off revealed a clear plastic front behind which the necklace and inspirational card sat, this would make a lovely display piece if you didn't want to actually wear the necklace.<br /><br />The key itself is well made and sturdy, 3 dimensional rather than a flat cutout like some keys. The crystals are very sparkly and catch the light beautifully. The only draw back was the chain, its a delicate (flimsy) faceted ball chain and though it fits very well with the necklace it would not be good for everyday wear. it is also much shorter than I would have liked with a necklace such as this, the length caused the key to sit oddly and it kept tucking itself into the collar of my blouse. However the pendant is easily removed and can be placed on a different chain if you are looking for something longer or stronger.<br /><br />All in all for the money spent I am pretty happy with the pendant, and I can see it being one of my more frequently worn pieces."
4.0,Love them so purple this is a good pair of earrings just a little heavy
4.0,I felt sexy wearing this dress. The zipper up the back with heels did just the trick.  Nice material and form fitting. Looks expensive but for those on a budget. There is a panel inside neck area that is weird which prevented me from giving it 5 stars.
4.0,"I bought the maize / blue / white circle shirt.  It‚Äôs not the best, but it softens up after a wash.  97% cotton and 3% spandex so it has some stretch to it.  I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù and about 190lbs.  Normally get large.  Went XXL and it‚Äôs a decent fit (just long enough and a little loose in the chest (normally wear a 40L jacket). For $15, I‚Äôve got a 70‚Äôs shirt and something perfect for Michigan games.  Win - Win."
4.0,Nice warm hat but too small for my big brain
4.0,This  t shirt is nice and the material is smooth  and wonderful  It  fits those of us who want to feel athletic when working out or  getting some much needed reps in. I  highly recommend this shirt to the serious workout minded individual . You definitely want to invest in one of these MONSTA  shirt .
4.0,Cute design - material is okay! Not loving the color of the strap though.
4.0,Someone could have glued the Stones on better but my niece of 9 loves it.
4.0,"Really cute, comfy!  I am 5'3 size 4 slender I bought PINK 3/4 sleeve size small perfect & I love the pockets, but way to long even with heels. I did have to have it hemmed. I did buy a second one for a friend she is 5'8 slender I got her a med 3/4 sleeves in Burgundy! That is how cute this dress is :)"
4.0,It's pretty but not like the picture The chain looks nice but somehow the material is different . I'm rating 4 starts because of the style and model of the product
4.0,"Great socks! My daughter likes them, thinner than what I expected."
4.0,I'm a medium. They would be best if they were small
4.0,"Love it, would have been 5 stars if the fabric was as good as it used to be, same review I‚Äôd give to the other tees we ordered."
4.0,"I wanted to love this so much. I thought it would be mid calf length but it was floor length. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the way it hung on me, seemed to purse up and hang oddly, but I think that has to do with the fabric and sizing as opposed to the cut. The design and cut are lovely and it's very well made. I can see this lasting a person a long time. It does seem like the type of fabric to pill up though.<br /><br />I'm a 14/16 and got the XL. I'm returning it but If there is a 2X I might try again because it really is lovely."
4.0,"I fell in love with the little 'LADIES, I HAVE ARRIVED' camo outfit.<br /><br />The dark green and camo go so well together. The hoodie is lined with the camo fabric to match the pants. The wording is large and made to be noticed.<br /><br />C'mon. It is so adorable!! Yep, it is. BUT...<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that the overall craftsmanship feels a bit cheap (think Dollar General). Stitching appears fairly tight and even, but the fabric is not very soft for infant wear. Even after washing, it's still coarse feeling. For the larger sizes, I may not have minded as much, since little boys are so active. But, for the 0-6, 6-12 mos sizes...well, I might wish it was softer.<br /><br />Also, the sizing measurements aren't labeled anywhere on the outfit. There is a maker's tab on the inside of the neck only, but no size information. I like to sort my kids' clothing by size and season. This will initially get put in the right tub, but after... well, without the size listed inside the hoodie or pants, I have a feeling it might get misplaced or mis-sorted in the future. This could also be a problem if gifting. New moms won't know what size it is... :-(<br /><br />Despite the cons... even if I had seen it at Dollar G, would I have bought it?! Probably. The saying just makes it worth it.<br /><br />I still give it 4 stars because it.is.perfect.for.a.handsome.little.man. :-D"
4.0,"This is such a great dress! I'm 5 months pregnant and wanted something loose and comfortable to wear on vacation - something to conceal my bump a little bit and not look too ""maternity"" for times out with my husband. I definitely won't be able to wear it for long during my pregnancy but it's perfect for now and I'll look forward to wearing it again after baby comes. It's seriously so comfortable and flattering. It's called a maxi, but I would honestly classify it more as a ""midi"". I'm 5'4"" and the medium hits me almost mid calf (a little longer). With the slit it's just so easy to move in! Probably will need a slip underneath since the buttons are spaced pretty generously. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because one of the pockets seams was delivered unstitched- nothing I can't fix, but definitely would have appreciated a once over so I didn't have to sew it up before my trip!"
4.0,Fits perfectly and wears well as an undershirt or when working out. I'd buy it again.
4.0,My granddaughter wears them everywhere.
4.0,"The belt is a little wide, but it looks great and the buckle is easy to reverse. Overall a very nice belt."
4.0,"Very cute, a little small on me.. main issue was that I was sent a blue skirt that was supposed to be black.. the bag said black on it so obviously just a mistake ‚Ä¶ will be returning"
4.0,Fits as expected but I don't really care for the type of fabric it is made from.
4.0,It's made of cotton and feels great. Nothing to complain about besides the fact that the sizes aren't all that accurate...
4.0,"Great quality, arrived in official packaging and accessories"
4.0,"Such a pretty top, beautiful color, the shoulder gap is a bit too wide though, makes the sleeve hang too far down"
4.0,Reviews were correct a little big but many compliments
4.0,This shirt looks just like the photos! I only deducted a star because some black pieces flake off of the shirt when it arrived. It is really cute though and made with good quality materials. I definitely recommend this if it‚Äôs the type of style you‚Äôre looking for!
4.0,I really like these. The length is perfect.  Color is a little darker than I expected.  They also seemed a little large. I run between a small and a medium and I ordered medium. Returning for a small.
4.0,"Helps keep my laptop bag neat and tidy. Keeps all my accessories handy for quick use. When I ordered the cocoon it I didn't realize there was a zip pocket on the back, but have found it a handy spot for smaller items that might fall out of the straps on the front. At least one of my office mates has mentioned that he's jealous of my new &#34;toy&#34; and is eyeing one for himself! More than worth the purchase price."
4.0,"The shipment came in one day, but this looks like a maternity top!"
4.0,Watch works great and I constantly get people asking me if it was super expensive.  I wish it had a back light and a date function though
4.0,"I would order a size (or 2) up. I normally wear a size 10 sometimes 12 depending on the clothes so I ordered a L which is supposed to fit 12-14. I think it's quite small especially the bottoms. I was going to return it but my bf talked me into keeping it. Another thing I don't love is you can see the white lining on the inside of the top from the outside. Overall for the price, I think it's a pretty good deal."
4.0,"Love the top piece. Not as long as I would of expected, just touches the top of my pants. Debating on sending it back. I dont belive sizing up would help as then it would be to large in the top section."
4.0,"The name is ""Comfy Sleepshirts"" and that what it is. It wears well and washes well. The color is bright and stays bright after washing. I didn't give it a FIVE because it's not my favorite nightie. Maybe it will when the weather turns warm again."
4.0,"So, I always looked at this as pajamas and can't really see myself wanting to wear this out ‚Äî even when I decided to select it from the Vine queue. It definitely runs a bit big as I ordered a medium assuming it would fit like a lot of online clothing does ‚Äî¬†where you have to size up to get a good fit. I could have ordered a small and would have been fine. But if you like the roomy nature (which I don't mind for sleep/lounge clothes), then ordering up a size is a good idea."
4.0,My daughter loves these shoes. I did order a size up and glad I did because they seem to run a little small and my daughter has a tiny foot. The lights work perfectly ..and still work. The quality is nice and the color is so pretty.
4.0,"my step daughter was In love with the original / real one from Pandora but she looses jewelry so easily , she just not ready for real jewelry this was a perfect option for us and her . she did loose it already will be order another , didnt turn green and looks beautiful . great for little girls who dont know the difference lol . no for real its very nice quality . and looks amazing on ."
4.0,Love this product. Would buy more from this vendor. Wish they made more tie clips
4.0,"Durable and looks great. The only problem I find with the band is that I ordered the color that‚Äôs on the inside of the band, which is camel colored, not the blond leather color that is shown. I thought maybe it was reversible upon opening the box, but it isn‚Äôt. I was lucky that the color looked good with my watch, even though it wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. The strap is only slightly awkward to put on. I‚Äôve gotten frustrated a few times getting the two knobs into the holes. I likely won‚Äôt order this brand band again, for this reason."
4.0,Very nice set.  Inexpensive.
4.0,Had to order one size bigger
4.0,"I have a nice amount of jewelry by Milacolato & have been happy with 99% of it. I ordered a pair of their small hoops in the past (with an adorable sliver feather charm on each hoop) & had to get rid of them as they were impossible to close. When ordering this trio I expected the same results & I was right. I took off a star for the hoops.<br /><br />The stars are adorable. They have plenty of sparkle & are very small which is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />The ball studs are also tiny. They look exactly as shown. Nothing exciting to say about them other than I wear them next to the stars in my ears. Like the stars, they are very small which is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />I prefer minimalist jewelry because I run my own eco farm full time. Wearing jewelry isn't safe or realistic. Small stud earrings or a very short (almost choker short) necklace with a tiny pendant are what I typically wear as I like to feel a little feminine while doing such dirty physical work.<br /><br />Note: If you are considering this as a gift, mine arrived with each pair in a little zip style plastic bag, these 3 bags were then placed in a slightly larger zip style plastic bag, this bag was then inserted into velour type of drawstring pouch with the Milacolato logo on it."
4.0,"I bought these to wear as maternity lounge pants. I found the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù maternity pants to be itchy because of the spandex across the belly. I thought the fold over waist on these might work for maternity pants and I was right. They are true to size and very comfortable. The length is great too - I dislike when pants are too short. The only negative I‚Äôve found so far is that they‚Äôre on the thin side (still not see through, but thinner than other yoga pants I‚Äôve had)."
4.0,Really lovely gift set. My personal preference would be that I wish the pendant was a tad smaller/lighter but over all its lovely
4.0,"Cute, and the quality is good also came really fast"
4.0,"To much dress for me, sent back for a return."
4.0,"This thermal works and is very comfortable and soft. However, this was not made for Ski weather. At 26 degrees, I felt a little cold.  I would recommend this product but not for individuals like skiers and construction workers who have to word in 20 degrees weather for long hours."
4.0,"Great addition to my granddaughter's Power Ranger costume. She is 3.5 years old and they are a little big, but so is her costume, which is a size 4. She is really into Power Rangers so these gloves work well and seem to be well made."
4.0,"I like the softness, an fit. Comfortable for sleeping an lounging."
4.0,Well made. Fit as expected. Havent used it yet.
4.0,hiking boots fit me fine
4.0,I'm not sure if these are steel or aluminum. I bought them to  Rig up a few slings on a few rifles that I that I don't use very often but I want a sling for. I will update this this review once I once I have a better feel for them but they do not feel very sturdy.. I hope I'm wrong and if I am I will return and go a full 5 stars.
4.0,todavia no he visto nada sobre la suerte
4.0,I loved this top but it was too baggy under the arms and the shoulders. I might size down cause I love the printüòç
4.0,Love the color of this dress! It is a reddish black color. It is soft and comfortable after washing. It fits great and really shows off your curves. My daughter loves it! It can be dressed up with jewelry and some heels or casual with flats and a sweater. The fabric is a bit thin but I still like it.
4.0,"These glasses have crossed my path a few times looking around on amazon and I finally decided it was time to try them. I don't necessarily need glasses but i've always wanted them These looked like the perfect style and from the reviews they seemed very nice too. I got mine in the mail, and instantly opened the box cause I was so excited to try them out. When I first opened the box, I was very impressed with how expensive looking all this was! It came with this little sleeve case, a little screwdriver thing to fix the glasses incase they ever have a loose screw, and also came with a little cloth the clean them. I put them on and they fit so nice, they didn't feel cheap or plastic-y. They fit perfectly on my face and I usually have a hard time finding glasses that I like on me, cause I have long face and chubby cheeks. But these looked perfect. I love the gold and especially the floral detail on the top. They look very classy and feel very nice and sturdy. The only complaint I have is they have a very strong reflection, which they reflect everything. so it makes them look kinda fake. I want to get real lenses in them, cause then they wont look fake. I am in love with these glasses and I get so many compliments. This is my honest  opinion. I did get this product at a discounted price in exchange for my HONEST review. and I am giving you my complete honesty!"
4.0,Loved these! Not only are they cute but perfect size for nipple piercings!
4.0,My wife loved  the shirt but when she put it on the collar was too tight. If you have a large neck it may not fit you. But the shirt is made extremely well overall.
4.0,"They are nice looking, I bought them for my 8 yr old granddaughters birthday which is this Thursday. I hope she likes them as well."
4.0,the fabric is comfortable but is quite revealing of body lines.
4.0,For the price it is very nice. I was surprised
4.0,Runs large but I like it that way so I can layer. Very warm. I like how long it is. I'm 5'8 and it goes to my knees which really helps keep me warm. Only down side is the sleeves seem a little short but that doesn't bother me much. Also it sheds on itself BAD and collects hair and lint so I would recommend keeping a lint roller close by. All in all for the cost of this coat I think it's pretty great.
4.0,Good for the price. The sizing is off ..I ordered a 5/6 for my 5 year old and it was entirely too big she couldn't wear it. The color is off on the purple from the picture (it doesn't look exactly the same but similar) and the bows and flowers are detachable so be careful with small children. But all in all it's a good buy for the price I just wish it would have fit.
4.0,"It's a thin felt fabric feels cheap, not like what typical outdoor coats have. But it fits good and it's so darn cute that I love it anyway. Buttons are not same as what's shown in picture but doesn't bother me."
4.0,Nice summer dress for a mature woman
4.0,"This product arrived very quickly, and was super cute, but didn't fit in the chest AT ALL. I am a D and it did not even cover half of my bra. It has been returned."
4.0,It's perfect! I usually get a small or xs But I got a medium because it said you should size up so I did but I wish I got a small because It is true to size
4.0,It is cut small I got this for my mom she is plus size it looked good on her I loved it it was not to much ch not to little
4.0,Love it......
4.0,"Easy to use and convinient but is a bit small for use in a grocery store or in a fruit/vegetables shop, but totally recomended if you shop ingredients or supplies on the fly also the plastic casing prevents damage or cuts if you have inside a bag for convenience. Folding can be enhanced"
4.0,"As expected, good quality. We were worried it would be too small, but the sizing was good, a little generous."
4.0,I already own this band in the Green/black and love it. Bought the red/black one for my wife but upon receiving definitely wouldn't call it red. It has a slight orange color to it. Love the band and brand but the red one just wasn't the color I was wanting.
4.0,"This is exactly what it says, a crossbody bag for a cell phone. The main section can hold a larger phone or phablet. The front pouch is a good size to put money, keys, etc.<br /><br />I bought this for my daughter and she really likes it. For myself, I would go with a larger crossbody bag.<br /><br />The material looks nice, although the clips for the straps look a little lightweight.  Hopefully they hold up"
4.0,"Love the material on this dress, doesnt feel cheap. I'm very petite so it's a little baggy on me but its perfect for work regardless. A little see through, i have a slip on underneath."
4.0,I ordered a size up.<br />I got these and 2 other colors/patterns.<br />These fit tighter than the white snake print pattern. But still fit good.<br />Love them so much. Will buy more from this brand of workout pants. There is a black extra layer inside.<br />I love this because you can't see skin or your underwear. Finally...SOMEONE got it right.
4.0,Shirt was a little thinner than i thought and i have to be aware of being able to see through it
4.0,"I always have a hard time ordering clothes online. I have a short torso and so shirts never fit the same way as the pictures show. This shirt is really nice. I like the material. It's soft, thin and flowy but it is not too thin that it is see through at all. I really like the neck line. It is a bit different than your ordinary neck line and adds a nice bit of character to the shirt. I like the heathered grey color. This shirt will look nice with either dark jeans or black pants. Now to the fit of the shirt. It fits me and I will wear it. I do think that it doesn't fit me perfectly because I am short. I got a size small and I still feel like it is a bit big on me. The shirt blouses out too much and makes me look wider than I am. If I had a longer torso the band would sit lower and it would be less blousy and not make me look as wide. I‚Äôm also not used to wearing shirts this style so I‚Äôm not exactly sure how it should look on me. I like that this shirt feels like a t-shirt but looks fancier.<br />I received this product free in exchange for an honest and fair review"
4.0,Even though I have a small wrist the band is a little tight otherwise I like the watch
4.0,Very nice shirt fits great.
4.0,The band is good. My wife did not like the color. I ordered a stainless steel in I suppose Chrome looking color.
4.0,"The dress is so gorgeous! Unfortunately, I had to return it because it was too large on me. I am a 5'1, 105lb woman and ordered a size small. The belt is attached at the sides but is free floating from the dress across the midsection. It was a little long on one side as well which made it hang lopsided. It could have possibly been altered slightly to fit but I didn't have the time to take it in to find out. If you're larger than I am, I recommend this dress."
4.0,These may run a little small. They didn't quite fit out of the box. Would suggest sizing up 1 size. Especially since I think they are part cotton and shrink a little after washing.
4.0,"A little tight on the top of the toe, but I think it'll stretch out"
4.0,These tights are very good as far as sweat drying quickly and they are easy off and on .... Comfortable while working out .
4.0,"These are a little more of a light yellow than beige, so if you're going for more of a nude tone, these might not be it.  Fit is good with full coverage."
4.0,Very pretty but a bit too small for an adult
4.0,It's nice but for the quality of the hoodie I was expecting better quality material üòï But my kid loves it üôÇ
4.0,"Fits well, fabric feels nice, definitely worth the low price!"
4.0,Very swingy and nice but the sleeves were short on me; they were more like 1/2 sleeves than 3/4 sleeves lol. The rest of the dress fit fine
4.0,They are nice but a little heavy. The wash nice and my glasses don't fog up as much.
4.0,Was too close...tight fit..
4.0,I like the feel of these.  I did order a 2XL but they were snug.  that was my only complaint.
4.0,"My wife likes the look of these a lot. The size is a little off so she gets a little shifting. That may not happen for all women though, every body is different. She finds the material comfortable and I like how she looks in it."
4.0,I like it too Mach
4.0,They're just a little bit too big but other than that they're perfect
4.0,"My only complaints:  each pair of sock came in its own plastic packaging.  So wasteful.<br />Also, I would have preferred the heel to have more cushioning.<br />Other than that, very comfortable!!"
4.0,"I love this skirt but it's a little larger than I expected. It's extremely cute but I have to roll the waistband up a bit so it doesn't look too long. I may order another in a medium, but until then, this works."
4.0,"These are really cool, my teen daughter thinks they look nice, and the illusion of the cat hanging on the earlobe is nice without being too &#34;goth&#34; or &#34;strange&#34;."
4.0,Fit is good and shirt well made.  Not quite as soft as hoped but perfectly wearable.  Good value for the money!
4.0,"Great purchase for the price but I do agree with other reviews that the material is NOT soft. It is extremely breathable and light, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äútough/rough‚Äù material. I do recommend buying if you need something cute and/or something lightweight for hot weather while lounging/working throughout your home, but don‚Äôt expect this to be a ‚Äúregular jersey tshirt‚Äù material."
4.0,I love ‚ù§Ô∏è this dress really show my curves. Am 5:0 and 125ilbs I order small and fit perfectly
4.0,Good quality got them for my husband a half size bigger than his normal and they fit perfectly
4.0,Fits true to size in the body of the suit. My only issue is this isn't made for larger chested women. I did follow the sizing chart and the body of the suit fit great but a little small on the bust of the suit. If I would've went up one more size it would've fit in the chest area but then would've been too big in the body.
4.0,Nice material soft and super stretchy. Love the slit on the dress. The length falls right to the ankle which is great for an evening event. The arm sleeves were a bit snug but still fit. If you have bigger shoulders or arms you may want to go up a size.
4.0,"I LOVED this costume! It looked even better on than it showed in the picture. And you can wear it for anything really; I wore it to the Tex Ren Fest and it worked out perfectly.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the ties in the back are a little flimsy. I wore the costume 3 times and the ties practically fell apart. I tried sewing them back on, but to no avail. So if you Do buy this costume, be aware of the back ties! Other than that, like I said, LOVED this costume!!"
4.0,"Great quality leather. It was a bit too small so wished it had a larger size. Otherwise, great price for the product."
4.0,"Purchased for my 14yo son, he loves the watch and I love the price, it's a win win for us both."
4.0,"The band is very nice and looked very good on the Asus Zenwatch (1 and 2)<br /><br />Removing links was easy to do with proper tool.<br /><br />Has nice micro adjustment for a perfect fit.<br /><br />Very nice, but metal is just a little too soft.<br /><br />After 2 years one of the pins enlarged one of the hole in the clasp and would come apart."
4.0,Love these. I'm short with short arms. The sleeves are wrist length which is what I want.
4.0,Seam started coming undone in the back where the zipper is but it still served its purpose
4.0,"Good: The print is awesome. It looks very cool, and it lasts. I've washed mine about 6 times since I've had it and so far the color stayed the same.<br />Bad: ZERO support, and very thin, sheer fabric. If I hold a piece of paper under it, and stretch out the bra a bit, I can read the writing on the paper, that's how thin it is.. So, if you go to the gym wearing nothing but this bra, you will give everyone a LOT to look at it, and I'm not just talking about the awesome print.. But if you wear a nice, black sports bra underneath it for support and coverage, it will look sick as heck.<br />Sizing: Fits somewhat as expected.. I'm a 34d and I got a Large that fits me well. If you are in doubt, order one size up because the less you stretch the fabric, the better the print looks.<br /><br />Overral, I would recommend it.. I really like mine!"
4.0,"i love this sweatshirt, the style is really cute. i just wish the material was a little better and more like a cozy sweatshirt material too"
4.0,"This top is really good quality and came as expected. My only complaint is that it is a bit to thick to wear in the summertime, which is prime crop top weather for me. That is personal preference though. I will probably wear it at the beginning of fall when the weather is not too hot or cold."
4.0,Great dress for the price! I'm 5'4&#34; and around 120lbs. I ordered a medium because I like my dresses to be loose - could have probably ordered a small and still have plenty of room. Very comfortable!
4.0,it was nice but  kind of big
4.0,"I am 5'4&#34;, 120 lb., 34B. I ordered a small based on the sizing chart, and while it technically fit, it was a bit too snug. Since it's a very tight-fitting shirt, I actually ordered 2 sizes up and got a large. I just got it today and it fits great. The only down side is that it does feel a bit too long in length (and I like my shirts/sweaters long!) It doesn't feel tight and binding, but it still highlights my figure just like the small did. As with all of PattyBoutik's clothing, this sweater has amazing shape, it's very flattering, and it's a great classic sweater!"
4.0,"Well constructed, I have a lot of these in different colors. Roll it up and it pops back nicely. Really shades the face and looks stylish. I get a lot of compliments."
4.0,"This is a pretty cuff, but it is a little smaller than I had hoped.  Still, I would buy it again, given the opportunity."
4.0,My grandson was excited when the package arrived early.  He put it on right out of the package.  I would recomend this to anyone.
4.0,Satisfied with this purchase.  No buyers remorse.  The pants were a little large but not uncomfortable.  They were used for international travel and performed well.  Quality construction.  I would recommend them to a friend.
4.0,Would be 5 stars but the hook i wanted to fit didn't fit the bag had to use the other part good thing it came with 2 hooking features but besides that I loveeee it!!!
4.0,Love these... I am going to order another pack to keep in work; someone (including myself) is always losing the back to an earring.  I don't understand why all fish hook earrings don't have them.  Just wish that they were a tiny bit longer.  :)
4.0,Love these. Very thin but will be Great for summer.  Super cute.
4.0,Good product overall.<br /><br />If you work out like me - keep in mind your bench-press can put pressure on this pendant and it can hurt really bad. On plus side it is made from decent material and it did not break.
4.0,"Pretty, nice size earrings, good price"
4.0,Great find. Fits like a dream and have gotten so many compliments on it!
4.0,"If you‚Äôre a member of the Itty Bitty Tittay Committee (A-cup here), the neckline is probably gonna be pretty deep. Think Mariana Trench deep. If I move it back on my shoulders (iykyk) it will work‚Ä¶until I lean forward and open the gaping chasm between clothing and man. The material is great, though- lightweight and silky. I almost kept it as a pajama top tbh. But alas, I don‚Äôt want to experience the sensation of Righty or Lefty escaping mid-sleep."
4.0,"Didn't work correctly, but kept anyway."
4.0,Was a Christmas present
4.0,Some of them are too small. They tarnish quickly. Fun for the summer.
4.0,Very nice quality for the price<br /> Wife loves them!
4.0,"Really cute suit! I like it, runs small, wish I had gone up a size."
4.0,Little to shiny.
4.0,"Really like this dress, I am a large figure but a much shorter person so the length was a little odd but it definitely fit correctly elsewhere"
4.0,"Forest green, not emerald green."
4.0,Smaller than expected. Order a size larger. My son seemed to snag them pretty easy. Not sure if that‚Äôs the shirt or my son‚Äôs fault. Nice value.
4.0,"These are a bit large than other shoes, but the extra space is definitely for some serious socks! I have one pair of smartwool socks that I bought years back. I had them with me when I traveled North for Christmas, and they were just what I needed for a snug fit with these boots. The boots are quite warm themselves, so they are not for summer wear or for warm climates. It will be a year or more before I wear them again, but I was sure glad I had them!!"
4.0,"Great belt, buckle and stiching.<br />The only thing that needs improvement is that if this belt was double layered."
4.0,"I would post 5 stars if only the Men's version of the watch is larger than it is.  It's good for men with small wrists but for larger-boned men, I wouldn't recommend it.  The quality of the watch itself is good!  Luckily, I have a small wrist.  :)"
4.0,"Cute ring, just no size on listing. Feels like it may hold up well but had to return due to no size"
4.0,I ordered the largest size. I would say it‚Äôs a 7.5 size in American bracelet size. I was lucky it fit. The weight is good. Jade is usually a light color for the cheaper jade. Darker jade would cost more or you should be suspicious about the cheaper cost. I would recommend this bracelet
4.0,They are a little too long. They are comfortable but stretch out by the end of the day
4.0,Pants are not comfortable
4.0,I used it for ‚ÄúQueen Spider‚Äù costume.  Headband fit good and is lightweight....seems to be made out of felt which I was surprised at but still worked for what I needed
4.0,"This is basically what I carry around with me all day. It carries all my credit card and gift cards, and I just want to point out that it's just soooo cute. Additionally, I also see that my co-worker also has one, too. However, the little pocket that has the zipper doesn't carry a lot of coins inside. I still don't know what I can put inside other than one or two coins."
4.0,"I love this beautiful bag, which is really a tote. Although I knew the measurements, I was surprised at how large it is. That said, it is terrific for when you need a larger bag. The blue color is lovely. It comes with 2 straps, and has a full zipper closing across the top, and several  pockets  and zips inside.  Very good price for a genuine leather bag. Only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is its size, which doesn't work as well for me.<br /><br /> I really love the soft blue color!!"
4.0,The bag is great. Nicely made and holds a ton. The only problem for us is we bought it for a 14 yr old girl and it was WAY to big for her even with the straps completely pulled tight.
4.0,Very fun for &#34;ladies who read&#34;.
4.0,The fabric of the item is great. The sizing was my fault. I thought I order an XL when I ordered a medium instead. Planning on buying another one soon.
4.0,Tama√±o perfecto! Buena calidad
4.0,i wanted to wear lose fit on my body. but after washing with cold water and dryed with no heat it was little shrinked.<br />but still i liked it.
4.0,nice shirt... wish it was alittle less shear
4.0,"The organizer was good quality, well made and looked like it would be very durable, but it is too tall for my loungefly backpack and only barely fits the width of the backpack inside."
4.0,These are super comfortable and better than I expected. Wish they came in an XS as SM is a bit too big . I would certainly order again and in more colors
4.0,Extremely cute but shipping back. Too small
4.0,I found these in a local store for my son and his actual size was too small. They didn't carry the next size up so I ordered them here. Fast shipping and he loves them though they seem to run a little short even though it's a bigger size than he wears. I actually wish I would have gotten 2 sizes bigger so he could wear them longer than one year. He said they are super comfortable and wears them all the time. Will for sure be getting him another pair when he outgrows these.
4.0,"My daughter really likes the case, protects her phone well"
4.0,"I am looking forward to using these to transport groceries home this summer.  I will buy some kind of ice packs or cooler blankets and put my perishables in these boxes.  Should put an end to rushing right home with the groceries in the heat!  They are a nice big size and seem sturdy, with a zipper closing and straps to carry.  I don't know how well I could transport extra-heavy loads in them, but I don't buy big turkeys or hams any more, should be fine for milk, ice cream, produce - things like that."
4.0,Good for the price. Like the style and rhinestones.
4.0,"Looks good on my Gear S3 - Unfortunately the 22mm pins with the original band don't work for this watch because of the levers, so I had to go out and buy pins"
4.0,Pretty. This was a gift and she loved it.
4.0,"Runs a little small. I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear and it fit just right.<br />However, I LOVE the weight of the fabric, the length and the cut!  I looked for more of this brand, but sadly couldn't find much."
4.0,A little to big but my granddaughter is petite
4.0,...awesome to see the world through rose colored glasses!!! Takes a while to get used to the change in color...but then all is great!!!
4.0,"Girlfriend loved it, my wallet not so much. But willing to buy one again to see the look on her face when she sees it's Coach. Compliments her wardrobe and never goes out of style. Women love name brands and fashion, fellas"
4.0,"I ordered an XS and they were a little small. For reference, I'm 5'0"" and 95 lbs and usually wear a 24 or 00.  I do have an XS in another pair of Just USA shorts and they are a little loose on me, however these were a little too tight around the waist so they weren't very comfortable on me. I also didn't think they were high rise. Returning because I'm not sure I could go up another size. Other than that, they arrived quickly, and were very cute/good quality and I'm disappointed they did not fit me better!"
4.0,"Great watch but smaller than I had expected. The wristband barely fits my arm. The backlight it comes with is mediocre and only useful in complete darkness. That said, an excellent retro timepiece that is perfectly accurate to the second."
4.0,"this dress I should have went a size down, however it's  a nice dress. the only thing that threw the dress off for me is the gold zipper in the back. material  is a clingy material not poorly made just wish the zipper wasn't  there.<br />*****I received this product for free or at a discount price in exchange for my honest, fair and unbiased review.*****<br /><br />*****This is a required disclaimer but it does not make my amazon product reviews any less truthful or valid.

4.0,"I first bought this for my daughter who was turning 5, it was to big,"
4.0,Nice hat and fits great!!!
4.0,Nice to wear for casual and comfortable fit.
4.0,4stars for the price and quick delivery... too shiny though lol.... I‚Äôm not 18 anymore
4.0,"The nose part was great, but because arms of glasses were too short I had to pry the ear piece to make fit. This caused them to be too tight on my nose & it was uncomfortable, but I kept them on (won 1st place as witch at the dance!) When I took them off I had a sore on my nose where it cut in d/t being too tight/ill fitting"
4.0,"I like it and will wear it, but it's a bit snug.  Not a lot of extra room in the headband."
4.0,Nice dress. But not what I expected.
4.0,The hoodie is great and good quality.  Unforetunately I tried to get a hoodie for my wife with the Rockie logo.  It is not available in Women's hoodies.  I hoped it would fit her but it was too small.
4.0,"I have a 30&#34; waist, but if this had been any smaller it would have been too tight. I know it says one size fits all, but if you have a waist 34&#34;+ this may be too snug for you.<br /><br />The color was a slight shade lighter than the pics, but it is still a nice piece."
4.0,"Very beautiful necklace! Well made, however the crystal pendant is the size of Elizabeth Taylor's engagement ring!!"
4.0,"This dress is quality (somewhat thick) material, cute, and a great value. I paid well under $20 and it was worth every Penny.  Great for all occasions.  Fits true to size."
4.0,"I wore this dress for a sorority formal and got soooo many compliments on it. So fun to dance in, very flowy and cute! The only reason I didn't rate a 5/5 was because of some loose strings."
4.0,"They are all cute but were too short to go all the way through my nostril. I called the company that did it and asked them to try (in case I was just not doing it right) and they said they wouldn‚Äôt work for me. They recommended a flat back instead of a L or screw, it‚Äôs WAY better and easier to change when I want so I recommend a flat back."
4.0,"The earrings are small, but when I go to the gym, I pull my hair in a high bun.  My trainer noticed them, and said how cute they were...so of course, I gave them to her. (NOTE: This gave me a few seconds to catch my breath between sets). The next day, I gifted the other pair that I was going to give to a friend to my other trainer.<br />Cute earrings...I just wish the shipping was included int he price."
4.0,It's exactly what it looks like. I wear 6.5 size surgery gloves or small latex gloves. These fit just fine. Not sure how they would fit on larger hands. Used it for a costume. Served its purpose.
4.0,"Pros:<br />The colors (pink and black) are crisp and vibrant.<br />The material is soft.<br />The material seems of good quality.<br />Good stitching on the shirts that I received.<br />Cons:<br />Very slightly see through--I will self disclose and say that I got these with the intent to wear them myself (so I got the largest size in kids). I'm a 5'3&#34; adult (typically wear a size S or M in adults). They fit fairly well, maybe a little snug (but this is not due to the shirt size, rather than my size and my getting something meant for children).<br />I have not had a chance to wear them multiple times, but if I see that they wear well and that their vibrancy stays, I am willing to add another star."
4.0,Good quality. Size runs a little bigger than expected.
4.0,"This shirts quality was good. It was sturdy material and it did not have any seam rips like I saw in other reviews. I wear a medium shirt usually, I ordered a medium and I ended up returning it because the shoulders were too tight. It fit fine at the bust, and I am large chested, and it fit loosely through the waist so ordering a size up did not make sense. I really liked the design, so I may still do that."
4.0,It was gorgeous.  Really well made with intricate beading.  I ordered a small and it fit well (I usually wear a medium or 6-8).  The only complaint was that the slip was too short.  I cut it out and then wore a nude undergarments.
4.0,Ordered this for our anniversary and she wasn't disappointed. A bit smaller than it looked but still a deal for the price.
4.0,"Esta muy bonito, buena calidad la met√≠ a la secadora y no encogi√≥ ni se estir√≥....<br />Bastante grueso perfecto para invierno!!!"
4.0,"The toque is pretty good, but it's not made out of wool, so it's not as warm as others that I've had. That's fine, but if you're buying it, you should know that the wind cuts right through it and it's not really suitable for temperatures much below freezing. If you need something for colder temperatures, I would recommend getting something made out of wool."
4.0,I like the material and overall value.  Good choice
4.0,My grandson said he is very pleased with the look and fit of this sweatshirt.  He has the same physique as the guy in the Amazon photo of sweatshirt.
4.0,Somewhat large but not too bad.
4.0,Is very pretty using it for a birthday present
4.0,It was a gift to someone. They were pleased üòÄ
4.0,it fits nicely for a full figured woman. I did not wear it as Alice I changed it to be the Little Sister from Bioshock. So it had blood and stuff all over it.
4.0,It was a very nice rich green color and the quality was nice for the price. I would buy more ties from them if I needed to. It came packaged in a box and that kept it from getting wrinkled.
4.0,Not th exact material I was looking for
4.0,Necklace is prettier than pictured. Will enjoy.  The colors are very nice.
4.0,I love the jewelry set.  The only problem I have is the earrings will not close and lock.
4.0,Love the colors in this skirt.  I paired it with a bright yellow cardigan and it looked great.  I rate this as a 4-star as the zipper sticks a little right at the waistline.  But overall it's a beautiful and flattering skirt.
4.0,At first I thought they were a little small.  I bought them for doing Pilates on the reformer.  Now I also wear them in the house good traction and the fit is better after breaking them in.  Keeps me from flying off my uncarpeted stairs
4.0,"The charm itself is pretty, but I can‚Äôt even use the app. It doesn‚Äôt let me adjust, crop, nothing. Automatically freezes. I‚Äôll be finding another app to use other than the one they advertise to try to make it work.<br /><br />UPDATE: after countless months of trying to get the webpage to work, it worked! And the pendant is easy to assemble (although it could use a smaller safety pin) but it is beautiful."
4.0,May want to order .5 size bigger cause although the shoe is beautiful and comfortable it runs small
4.0,Good one. Cloth quality is very good for the price
4.0,Good quality product. Easily holds drivers lisence and two bank cards.<br />Wish money slot was larger (tight compartment with limited space.
4.0,Very comfortable.  Goes very well over jeans or leggings.  The top is long enough that it does cover the rear end area if that is what you desire.
4.0,Be careful near anything hot stove or candles.
4.0,It‚Äôs fits just right ! I just thought it would be longer
4.0,"I generally wear a size small. I decided to go with a medium in this dress just to be safe. A small would have been WAY too tight. The quality isn't bad, but it was just a little too snug to be appropriate for the event that I'd wanted to wear it to. It was cute, the price was right, but I guess I was just expecting a little looser fit since I got a size bigger than normal. I returned it, but I do think it's a nice dress for the right person!"
4.0,Love this dress! Fits beautifully and very comfortable! The only dislike was that the burgundy dress is more red than pictured.
4.0,i do wish it had pockets and i‚Äôm a small most of the time and ordered a medium and the size runs a little small so i recommend ordering a few sizes bigger than you want (like 2) but it‚Äôs a great material and is really soft! i love the character design as well
4.0,"Comfortable to walk in, but not for a long period of time...rubs up on back of heel"
4.0,Thin fabric. Top is large but it's a cute outfit.
4.0,Looked small in the waist at first but actually has a lot of give. Very thin and breezy but extremely comfortable. Wish they hugged my ankles a little more. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 175lbs
4.0,This was for my 4 year old. Its a little bigger than average kids umbrellas. But it seems well built.
4.0,"Great value but was difficult to install and looked a lot like the price, inexpensive. All in all still a great buy for the price!!!"
4.0,Family complimented me on the fact it was very flattering and feminine. I bought it and truthfully it is outside of my comfort zone. But it is so cute...can't wait to wear it.
4.0,"I generally like the LaLoop product line, but they cost waaaaaaaay too much money. Come on - this is a mini-bungie with a look attached! And you're gonna charge me over $20 for it?<br /><br />...But still, they do just what they are meant to do. And I will keep using mine until I lose it (I am now on my 3rd). And hopefully by then, somebody makes one for cheaper."
4.0,Super soft. Good material. The print looks very 2D instead of the 3D the original has so it looks like a knock off but still a nice style.
4.0,Very pleased with this product. They were big but certainly not obnoxious. Very classy looking and good quality (not light weight or flimsy.)
4.0,Sexy  but material is not the best.  Fit as expected.
4.0,Liked the hat but medium was a bit too tight.  Plan to get next size up even though measured 7 1/8.
4.0,"lightweight and wash up well.  The pockets seem small in relation to the size, but you can see that online.  The color and sizing are spot on.  I really like them."
4.0,Fairly good quality and  easy to use.  The plastic parts making up the locking mechanism can be thicker then I would rate it 5 stars instead
4.0,Very cute and came in a nice packaging. A tiny bit big but not too noticeable.
4.0,Good product for the price it cost.
4.0,"It's a great belt and I love that with a wet whip I can clean it, but securing the tail end is difficult! As well as getting it undone. But all in all, it serves its purpose well."
4.0,"Cute shirt, nice fabric but furs small!"
4.0,too many came already rusted or discolored
4.0,"So I agree with the other people that review it before me, I'm a little disappointed though. The material isn't cotton but some kind of stretchy material, probably spandex. It's definitely a sized medium to small. (I'm normally an x small so it wasn't too bad). But wished that it had sizes to pick out.<br /><br />Hope you can see the material in the close up picture i did"
4.0,"They are really pretty.  Tiny but pretty.  I had a hard time getting the jewel into the post until I cut my nails then it went in easily.  I think the jewel is a bit small for for the hole in my tragus so I'll need to keep an eye on it.  Overall, great product and fast shipping."
4.0,"My daughter loves this. They fit as expected. The  only thing that happened was after about a week, my 4 year old daughter was able to pull the bow off the one slipper. I sewed in back on no problem though and haven't had any problems since."
4.0,"I ordered a medium. I really like this sports bra. I love the straps in the back and the little see-through mesh around the back. Super cute! I would say it runs a bit large. I probably could be ordered a small and it might fit a bit better, but it's not too bad."
4.0,Glasses look great but don‚Äôt fit my face right over all they good for the price
4.0,"Beautiful scarf, but a bit too long."
4.0,Solid and comfortable material. The support is good and they fit well. Nothing to complain about for the price.
4.0,Very Cute but studs don‚Äôt hold on very well after giving it a good hand wash. It does not come with filters. Inside is made with only cloth.
4.0,Ordered my usual size Large but it shrunk slightly after washing. Not as roomy as I usual like my shirts.
4.0,"This was a replacement for an earlier model of the same Therm-ic boot dryer that died after many years of use.  As was the case with the earlier version, it's simple, lightweight, compact, sturdy, easy-to-use, and gets the job done.  No frills, no fuss, just works."
4.0,Nice looking band. Only flaw is the lock releases too easily at times while wearing.
4.0,Great. Looks good and comfortable.
4.0,I really like it but the material is thin. You can see through it.
4.0,"Dress was just what daughter was looking for and long enough as she is tall for her age. The waist/stomach areas was pretty snug but it is stretchy material, so the only way it worked."
4.0,The bodice is a little long but other than that she looked super cute in it.
4.0,Not sure it‚Äôs michael kors. Brand tag fell off
4.0,"Lightweight, not too dark, good for reducing glare.<br />I like the full reading lenses as opposed to bi-focals."
4.0,Awesome it armpits slightly big.
4.0,All in all really pretty and fits but the torso could have been two inch longer.
4.0,"I don't know why I didn't realize by pictures in the listing how pointy these are - it's just not my taste. They are very comfortable though and this style seems to be ""in"" right now. Typically I'm 8 1/2, sometimes wide, and these fit just fine."
4.0,"For the price of these shorts, I didn't expect the quality to be all that great. But these blew my expectations out of the water!  I knew as soon as I pulled them out of the package that the material was good quality and not super thin or too thick. Fabric and stitching have perfect amount of elasticity and they are so comfy. The only drawback is that I ordered the same size as my other shorts like these and these are a little smaller than I was expecting. They still stretched too fit me comfortably but they are close to being too small. I would have liked to see them equal in size to other shorts of this style."
4.0,Dress fits great.  Just didn't like the fact I had to cut some strings.
4.0,Nice bralette type tops. Only con is that the straps are loose even after tightening them all the way.
4.0,"the quality of the picture is great, the the frame detail is nice. the chain is very light, and feels like plastic. the back of the frame is also slideable and can be opened. DO NOT get this thing wet! or sweat too much! i'm a little scared of getting it damp.<br /><br />i am going to try stringing it on some thin ribbon.<br /><br />overall, it is very nice."
4.0,They fit perfect and are very cute although a few things were missing.
4.0,I'm a size 6 women's who is 5'1 and they fit perfectly up to my knee.  The only downfall is that I have hardwood floors with no roomba and 2 dogs and 3 kids so the bottom of these socks are looking dingy after 3 wears even after being washed but I still like them.  They do make my calves look a little thick but all is well.
4.0,"This is a nice quality material with great color graphic. The shirt does run a bit small, so I had to return the original 2X I ordered. It was kind of a pain to not have the option of simply exchanging for a bigger size. It was a present for my husband & he loves it."
4.0,My daughter loves spider man and wanted to do spider man princess for Halloween.  This managed to satisfy her requirements for the overall look.  She doesn't wear it as much as I expected because she finds it a bit itchy.  It is holding up well and costume quality.
4.0,"These earrings are very elegant, and beautiful. They have a unique design that is timeless. However, they are very hard to put on and I accidentally bent them a bit trying to get them on. Are they worth $25? Eh... Depends on how much you like the design I guess."
4.0,"I love this! Great size and great price! Te description had me hoping it was more coral than red, but it's definitely more red than coral. The picture is true to it's color!"
4.0,Product runs small so I would recommend that you go up in size if purchasing for a person who has thighs or hips... product arrived in a timely manner and of excellent quality
4.0,"These pajamas are very warm, however they are a little tight across the bust. I would recommend them to friends and family."
4.0,Liked the color nice material
4.0,product as describe
4.0,Love the color and material. I wear it to sleep in because it didn‚Äôt fit right to wear as a dress. It‚Äôs all good.
4.0,"Love them & would buy again. Havent tried the touchscreen feature but honestly the gloves as most are to bulky to text with anyhow. Buy them for the warmth & waterproof features, not the texting"
4.0,For the price this is great. I like that it's fabric so the lanyard lays nicely and I also like the double window. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the holder doesn't close all the way. I used a pin to sort of &#34;seal&#34; the top.
4.0,"I love the size, but would prefer that they not be polarized.  Also, I'd love for them to offer a bifocal like this."
4.0,"Out of the 35, I have used about 30 of them and so far I have had 1 break on me. It broke right as I tested to see if the clasp opened, broke in half. I opened the clasp for each and every single one of them and they were all a bit stiff, but once I opened it, they were all easy to open up again. I have been using one for my wallet and it is still holding up pretty well with no rust or wear and tear to it! Great quality for the price I paid!"
4.0,pretty bracelet but does tarnish fast so dont get it wet!
4.0,Very soft material and as thin as it it it keeps my head warm even in subzero temps
4.0,"I'm 5""4 130 lbs and a small fits perfectly.  You can dress it up or down. Happy with this top."
4.0,"This is great for inside a bike or ski helmet. Keeps my head nice and warm. It fits quite well, but honestly took me a little while to figure out where to place this on my head. Machine washable and easily fits in a pocket."
4.0,They are a deal!!!!!!
4.0,Beautiful .... but wings dont seal completely so if you put a pic in it dont wear it in the shower
4.0,"It's a wonderful looking time piece, but the quality of craftsmanship is lacking a bit. Got one as a gift for my friend Christmas '13. Had to get him another one Christmas '14 after a young relative of his overwound it and broke the movement. It's cheap enough  to replace on a whim, and it is a beautiful LOOKING, functional watch. He and I are especially fond of the magnifier cover."
4.0,"These glasses aren't just FUN, they are FUNctional!!! I am really glad I got them."
4.0,"really nice but im giving it a 4-star because I couldn't figure it out how to wear or twist it, it didn't look right."
4.0,"Good stockings thin enought to wear with boots and up to keen mind you iam 5'1"". I had to wear a sescond paid of under socks they are not too warm."
4.0,"As advertised - it is a solid, no-frills leather belt."
4.0,I can more than your eyes
4.0,This is a fun item but the key word is novelty. It is definitely not meant to be worn for more than a couple of times. But still fun.
4.0,Good to use for work.
4.0,"It's a beautiful watch and runs well. The bracelet is way too large and the clasps are very tight, so it's hard to adjust it. Other than that, I like it and have received compliments on it."
4.0,Super cute little keychain. I bought it for my niece who loves polar bears. She loves it. There isn‚Äôt a great amount of detail on the polar bear but that‚Äôs okay. Seems to be made well enough.
4.0,This top is very comfortable and is very flattering.
4.0,"I love this company. Was hoping this style compression would work for me. But I have not seen up to calve size 28 inch. Which I need for my lymphodemia, edema. I have full coverage knee high and they are great. Comfortable, no slipping, bunching up. Wash and wear very well per directions to wash. Hope I can find this style a but larger."
4.0,"Product arrived on time and was in good condition and was advertized as expected, great jewelry set"
4.0,I like this hat.  It fits and looks great.
4.0,"Overall I'm ok with this shirt. I wish it were a bit longer for more coverage in the back. The shirt is soft, for is the same as pictured. This is a good value for the orice paid."
4.0,"This dress is soft, with adjustable straps and pockets that sit at the hip on me. It's not a high quality fabric, looks simply sewn up and the tie die is a screen print on the dress.<br />I ordered a Medium and the height on my 5'5"" frame falls at my feet lightly sweeping the floor without shoes on. With my flips flops that have a heel/wedge on the back, allows the dress to not touch the ground by a 1/4"". My full chest circumference is 42"" and it fits nicely in the chest area, I wear a 34 J in U.S. sizing.<br />Overall it falls nicely on me, I just didn't like the loud color and screen print once I saw it in person so I returned it but I wanted, people to see what it looks like on. Hope this helps! :-)"
4.0,"5‚Äô9‚Äù 140 lbs for reference. Ordered a medium. It fits well and is cute BUT as you can see in the photos it‚Äôs not an off the shoulder by any means. I tried as hard as i could to make this an off the shoulder and could not. I unbuttoned the top 2 buttons and got somewhat of an off the shoulder look but then it just looked like I was having a wardrobe malfunction... i will probably keep it because It‚Äôs very comfortable, cute tucked into jeans and will be nice for spring and summer in the office as it‚Äôs very breathable. However it‚Äôs definitely NOT an off the shoulder if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for."
4.0,"Good umbrella, just a little bit heavy."
4.0,"They‚Äôre really adorable on my 2 year old. They‚Äôve managed to endure her and my tough 1 year old for awhile. Unfortunately the arm came off, however it looks as if I can fix it. Honestly haven‚Äôt had the time, but it looks like a simple screw fix. Will update once I do."
4.0,The colors aren‚Äôt as vivid as the picture but it still looks amazing! I love it and goes perfect with my Overlook carpet lanyard. I‚Äôll update once I‚Äôve put on some wear & tear.
4.0,Son likes it a lot. Good addition to his collection
4.0,Super fast delivery! Product was as expected. Very pleased with product.
4.0,The leather ones were not the same on both sides. They were thick. The other pairs were just horse hair on both sides. Felt weird to me.
4.0,Looks great as a midi ring.
4.0,Great mask for the money. Simple design that goes well with a black suit.
4.0,"Great replacement buckle! PVD finish very dark and even. Fit my strap perfectly. The included 2mm and 3mm tangs are a valuable addition that I really appreciated. The 3mm tang is unevenly rounded off at the tip, but doesn‚Äôt affect use at all. Overall, this is a great inexpensive replacement buckle!"
4.0,A little big in the chest and I don‚Äôt love how the bow ties but it‚Äôs really adorable overall and is super comfortable. Pretty short but it is a romper so...I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 6-8 or Medium in dresses 34C I got the large and I‚Äôm glad I did because If it was any tighter it would be uncomfortable.
4.0,An extra large usually is more than sufficient.  This fits a little snug.  Otherwise it is satisfsctory.
4.0,"I really like these pants. I wear them with an oversized, french tuck t-shirt (plain, band or graphic) and ""fashion"" sneakers. They are quite cool with the flowing legs. There are a few things I don't love (hence the 4 stars): the waist is disproportionally tight, the fabric, while light is a bit plastic-ish and the suspenders can be rather awkward."
4.0,It‚Äôs a lovely dress but just a little heavier weight than I thought.  If I stayed in Michigan for the holidays it would be perfect but it would be too warm in Florida.
4.0,It‚Äôs baggie but a great sweater!  Might buy another
4.0,"I order this pair for extra wide calf. It's so, tight, my toes hurts. The black & beige fit great."
4.0,This item is comfortable  but I was disappointed that there is very little back over the heal to keep it on. It is more like a sandal than a shoe.<br /><br />It is comfort and offers support but it is certainly not a walking shoe.
4.0,"Good fit, appear to be well made. I am happy with them."
4.0,Warm and comfortable. Bottoms are a touch on the large side but hoping they tighten up on the dryer. Top perfect fit.
4.0,"Shoelaces, but they're gray!"
4.0,I like it no I love it. Fits good I got xl and I'm a 6 foot skinny dude. It will shrink to great fit. It's dyed all the way through so it won't peel unlike the plastic print option.
4.0,Did not like color..
4.0,Fabric is very silky but wears well. Very cute print.
4.0,My son hated it but I thought he was freakin' adorable so that's all that matters. Side note: This costume is made of a fleecy material so it is HOT. Make sure to air out your child.
4.0,Fits a little tight. Recommend buying a size up. Shirt is a little thin but otherwise I love it
4.0,"Very good 100% cotton well finished shirt. Zipper on neck makes easy to put head through without stretch the collar. Thick fabric too, so it feels nice and comfortable. It isn't a replica, so the Federation logo in the shirt is a cheap version. One can buy  an embroidered and substitute. Size medium is very similar to regular American T shirts same size. Didn't wash it yet. If I find any issue after washing (washing machine). I'll update this review. I will definitively gonna buy other Star Trek costumes from his manufacturer in the near future."
4.0,"It's cute and seems pretty durable. Holds a good amount of stuff. Obviously not as much as a school-sized backpack but it's great for what it is. I like the texture of the material. Really nice, and looks sort of like those Swedish(?) bags that are really popular, but with its own spin, AND it's cheaper, so it's a win-win!<br />You probably have to adjust the straps a lot so that it's not super tight on your back, though. You can make the straps single instead of doubled (if that makes sense??) I had to do that. It probably makes the straps ever so slightly less durable when you have it like that, but it's been fine for a few months so far."
4.0,"I don't find this dress to be the highest quality material or sewing, but it's really comfortable and fits well.  I'm 5'4, 140 pounds, and it falls just below the knee where I like it.  I also have a small chest, and it fits well there too.  Sometimes V-necks don't lie well on me and too much shows."
4.0,"Not quite the same color as pictures and the craftsmanship is decent, but I got roughly what I expected!"
4.0,"Very cute pattern and nice fabric but it runs very large, order two sizes down."
4.0,"Several reviews of this jacket said to size down. So I did and had to return it. 5'6"" 120 lbs, 34B, broad shoulders, XS was too small. Wish the faux leather wasn't ""so"" shiny, but might try it again in my usual small."
4.0,Beautiful scarf and colors but the scarf is a little to baggy and loose knit.
4.0,Looks super cute from the front. It sits a littlefunny when wearing because it has a wide bottom which creates a triangle shape. Seems well made and like it will hold up well.
4.0,THEY ARE REALLY LONG 4 INCHES PLUS.  YOU CAN WITH STRENGTH OPEN THE LINK AND REMOVE OR MOVE UP.  THEN THESE EARRING WILL BE 3 INCHES.  BEAUTIFUL FOR FALL COLORS AND NOT HEAVY!  WELL MADE TOO!
4.0,"I have been using this wallet for about 7 months and I love it. I wish it has the RFID because that would then be a 5 star. It is soft, durable and<br />compact."
4.0,"This is a lovely piece. I have worn it about 4 times now. The triple chain at the neck has started to turn and discolor, so I'm a little disappointed that it began this early. Other than that, it is a great style for t-shirts and jeans."
4.0,Cute relic.
4.0,COMFORTABLE WEAR AROUND THE HOUSE OR SMALL ERRAND PANTS. USE MOSTLY FOR WORKING IN THE YARD OR BIKE RIDES ON COOL MORNINGS. NOT SOMETHING I WOULD WEAR TO DINNER IN A RESTUARANT BUT THATS JUST ME.
4.0,No chance to wear it
4.0,"just be aware that the sizes are somehow small. I'm normally S, bought M and it fit perfectly!"
4.0,Nice quality and great priceÔºÅ
4.0,I really like wearing these - so fun- unfortunately one of the backs fell off and I couldn't find it.  But they are darling and I think you will enjoy them.
4.0,Nice but size varied a little with color
4.0,Nicest pendant necklace I have ever seen. Looks better when wearing light clothes!
4.0,Great band. Only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 is because the magnet is TOO strong. Sometimes I have difficulty with it. I got it because the rubber or silicone bands make me sweat. This does not. And it‚Äôs comfortable.
4.0,"Cute, comfortable. Defiantly have to wear these over something our the slip down on my scrawny legs. Can wear then with hose and they don't shift as much as when on bear legs."
4.0,Disappointed  with the sticker placed on the shirt.  It left a mark that won't come off.
4.0,Super cute! Colors are very fun! Ran a little bigger than expected but I kind of like the baggier look
4.0,Thicker than the other pairs of converse socks I have owned but well made and comfortable.
4.0,cute but comes up super high
4.0,"The pattern on this dress is fun for work or even church. However, I was disappointed with how thin the fabric was. It stretches too much and I don't anticipate getting long wear out of it. Only time will tell."
4.0,"It was made for a small wrist, but looks great!"
4.0,"It's beautiful as pictured. My only complaint is that it is described as a bracelet but it's actually a necklace, which is quite challenging to wear it as a bracelet."
4.0,"This CHARMYI T-shirt Dresses for Women Casual Summer Tie Waist Flowy Knee Length A Line Tunic Empire Waist Midi Dress feels soft and comfortable, and I think the highlight of the dress is the belt, which can be tight or loose for different body types, and the right thickness, which is cool but opaque.<br />It's  a birthday present for my wife,  it was the right size and she looked great in it."
4.0,It's cute and works for me.
4.0,"I loved this mask, but there were places on it that the paint was chipped off. It wasn't too noticeable though. The mask is really pretty heavy for the ties, so you have to tie it on pretty tight so it doesn't slip. It looked awesome though, and great quality."
4.0,It looks good hope it's better than the original.
4.0,"Adjusted my review.  Do not wear these while running in the rain.  They droop and pull down.  It is annoying.  Otherwise, these feel great, soft smooth material and work in 40f degree as well as 80f+ degree temps.  Easy to get in and out of. Non compression. Figure flatterin.  Love Under Armour products,."
4.0,I received it with a small hole.
4.0,"Very good quality but runs very large.  If you normally need an XL, get the large, even for layering."
4.0,Cute cute dress! I ordered a size up just because I didn‚Äôt want the dress too form-fitting. Because of the type of fabric-I just didn‚Äôt love the look on myself.
4.0,"I love these leggings!  So much so that this is my second pair. My first pair only lasted about 5 wears and then there were holes in them. But, you get what you pay for.  I will more than likely by another pair when these get holes too."
4.0,"Very nice quality blouse. I get lots of compliments when I wear it, which makes me very happy. I would give 5 stars IF the blouse was true to size and looked exactly like picture."
4.0,"These are great! Perfect for cold weather! We don‚Äôt get cold weather for too long here but when it‚Äôs cold, it‚Äôs freaking cold! My previous gloves were thin and fraying, so I needed something new ASAP! I‚Äôm glad purchased these, cause they don‚Äôt sell stuff like this in stores down here, only the cheap stuff. These will keep your hands warm during the wintertime, and I love the style!"
4.0,At first when the item arrived I didn't fancy the item much because there was no stretch in the material and I was wondering how I would make this work. After watching some tutorials I know realize how much I'm in love with this item.  It's very beautiful and I get alot of compliments. Its definitely a good buy for me... No regrets
4.0,This jacket is extremely warm. I ordered I size larger for layering. Loved the jacket but the material was too loud while in my stand. Had to return.
4.0,They were smaller than I thought
4.0,"Looks great. The links do come out to adjust the size; however, putting it back together was not easy. I finally went to a jeweler and had itdone there. Not sure I will ever change to a different band after that experience. Which takes away from the benefit of having other bands!"
4.0,"I was trying to replace an old, favorite pair of linen overalls, and I ordered these thinking they would be a linen/cotton blend, based on the description, however the item tag says 95% cotton and 5% spandex. That said, it's a nice, soft cotton, so I'm going to keep them. They fit very loosely, but still have a bit of shape to them. Very comfortable. Overall, I'm fine with my order, but do feel that the mentions of linen are misleading."
4.0,"Great deal, nice quality but runs big."
4.0,These are big enough for a man to wear. You get whatever color they randomly select. Worth the price. If you are in a hurry to get them order something else because they took over three weeks to get here.
4.0,Too small for my daughter.
4.0,"Great Gi for the price. Very light and durable. It's the only gi she likes to wear, love the fact they come in different colors. Also has plenty of space for patches. Good job Elite!"
4.0,Love the material but runs small
4.0,It is a pretty top and it‚Äôs flattering for a flowy type blouse.<br />I recommend buying.
4.0,Needs to be .5&#34; longer.  Otherwise it is nice.
4.0,"Only four stars because it was too small.  but the shirt was so pretty.  Loved it.  Had to give it to a friend, but it was beautiful on her."
4.0,Really like the skirt. It lengthens in extreme heat!
4.0,"It looked really cute and was perfect for my wedding photos! There where just a few small things, the pants where a little long so I had to roll them a little and the bow was crooked."
4.0,when I received the package there were only 4 pair not 5. They are well made though.
4.0,"Nice color and fitting. Wore a few times to work this summer and, always received compliments."
4.0,Cute pj's but fit was all off.
4.0,I was looking for a sports bra that would offer daily support without the uncomfortable tightness of a binder. This the best one that I have found. They do run small.
4.0,"This is the 2nd hood I bought for an upcoming snorkelling/diving trip to Hawaii.  I got a full body rashguard, but as someone who is folically challenged (!) I also wanted something to protect my scalp and neck from sunburn.  The first hood I bought left a gap between it and the rashguard, which would lead to sunburns.  This has a nice neck skirt that means there is no gap from the rashguard to my neck.<br /><br />Sizing is on the smaller side - probably best order a size up and it will still be snug."
4.0,It‚Äôs great for taller heavier  people but I am a short 5ft woman of 200 pounds  way too long and way too big. I usually wear 2x -3x size tops so I ordered 2 x. I think I‚Äôll try a 1x. But robe was good quality and after a good wash with nice smelling softener. It will be perfect!
4.0,Cute BUTTTTT you do gotta watch out<br />üê´üë£  Yuh feel me?
4.0,these pj's were exactly what I wanted but a bit too expensive for the quality.
4.0,Husband loves this hat. fits well and keeps his head warm. Definitely would recommend this to others. Can't beat it for the price.
4.0,"My son ordered these, much to my dismay...but I have to say they are made surprisingly well. I believe after several months one of the rhinestones fell out but otherwise very well made, goofy looking grill!"
4.0,Color and style just as advertised. Very comfy knit fabric and- again- love the color. If you purchase one of the X+ sizes be prepared to hem these or wear them high waisted because the legs are very long.
4.0,I am 5'2 and 112 pounds. The small fit me great in the legs but feels a little right in the waist.
4.0,I had an issue with the first pair of glasses that were delivered to me. The team at Duduma handled the problem quickly and followed up to make to make sure that I was satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"It was too big for me. When it says its large, it is.<br />I will be giving it for gift to a person that is large enough for it!!"
4.0,Simple but class
4.0,"Be sure to wear a regular mask underneath, as even with multiple layers this is too sheet to give adequate protection for you and others against viral infection.<br /><br />Got loads of compliments every time I wore this mask, but alas, the stitching was not meant to be and came undone after only a handful of washes.  I decided repairing it was more trouble than it was worth.<br /><br />Overall not a bad product, with just a couple downsides."
4.0,Love this skirt. Got lots of compliments on it.
4.0,Top fits perfect. Bottom is too big
4.0,"I am a 36C and got medium which actually fit fine (even though I consider myself bigger than the average young woman)! The colors were nice, I like both vibrant and neutral colors.<br />I had 2 problems. The first is that the holes for taking out the padding were smaller on some of them which made it difficult to put padding back in after wash. The second is that I am getting a small rash on my back because the fabric is rubbing my skin, but it's not a big deal to me.<br />Overall, good price for what I got."
4.0,I like how easily it folds up when I‚Äôm finished. I have used it alone as a duffel bag for weekend trips. I have also put it in a larger piece of luggage when I thought I might need more room for the return trip.
4.0,"This earrings were a bit heavy, but beautiful."
4.0,small sizeed
4.0,"Love these plugs. My gauges produce a lot of goo, so metal and acrylic don't get along well with my ears. The wood however, I guess absorbs it and keeps my ears mostly goo-free."
4.0,I had been searching for months for slippers like these!! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the fact they could be a hair longer.
4.0,Very pretty feminine blouse. Super comfortable great with leggings covers my backside.
4.0,I bought this as a gift and unfortunately the black writing has faded and came off but it is engraved and my best friend wears it daily and doesnt mind it too much!
4.0,shipped exactly what the pictures showed.  (pants/coat/shirt)
4.0,Only issue is the method of tying the string. It's not easy to do. Love the design. Because it's a choker it doesn't get in the way or flap about. You should check the position of the shells every now and then because they have a tendency to flip
4.0,This was a gift to a friend and they liked it.
4.0,Cute but runs small & rubber material so I know they wont last long but they a cheap so its cool!  I have been wearing them everyday!
4.0,Gave these for a gift. Very antique looking. Should of bought me a pair too. I recommend these earrings any day.
4.0,Worked well enough until I could get a new prescription.
4.0,These are nice to have.
4.0,"Nice quality with good hooks, minimal stretch but they work."
4.0,I got this because I'm allergic to silicone and I love it. I think my wrist is a little too small for it but that's not surprising. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an alternative to a silicone band. It's also very nice for anyone who's very active. It absorbs sweat very well.
4.0,Slightly off color.  Not really pink...more mauve. But certainly worth buying. Good quality and price.
4.0,"The UNCHARTED video game is a huge hit and it's star, Nathan Drake, is becoming quite well known among the young(ish) boys and girls who play the game. In fact, the fictional Nathan Drake is also inspiring boys to dress the way he does.<br /><br />Thankfully he's not into pirate sleeves and poofy pants because those would be difficult to justify. What sets him apart are his accessories. In this case, the leather watchband. Growing up in the 1970s, I remember well the when bands like this were actually fashionable. I never thought I'd live long enough to see them come around again.<br /><br />While the leather on this feels a bit stiff and thin, I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt as this sort of leather piece does get more supple and soft with wear. Although I'm not sure this one is going to get the wear it needs.<br /><br />See, one thing I forgot is that kids these days aren't much into watches, even if you can attach them to these really cool leather cuffs. Since it wouldn't work very well attaching a cell phone, I'm not sure how much use we'll get out of this.<br /><br />Not that the reality of the thing is stopping me. No, I went ahead and cannibalized one of my old watches, replaced the battery in the watch face and attached it to the leather cuff. It looks great. The weathered-looking leather matches well with the scuffed crystal face on my old watch.<br /><br />I'm tempted to put it on, myself. The leather strap that holds the watch to the larger leather cuff is a sturdy piece and fits snugly, while also holding the watch tightly to the cuff. For such an inexpensive piece, it's surprisingly well-made.<br /><br />So, then, why did I give it only four stars? Probably because I'll never know if the leather will hold up the way it should in the long run. I THINK it will, but, since I don't know, I can't give it the full marks. Still, if you'd get some use out of this, I'd certainly recommend getting it and giving it a try.<br /><br />It certainly looks like it would hold up and it brings back some really old, sepia-toned memories of my own childhood, even though this current iteration comes from a very modern, very popular video game."
4.0,It's a very nice cover up. It is longer than expected. I wear a 2X 18-20 and it fit me perfectly. If you are larger than that it will be to tight in the hips. The beading is not sown very well and some have fallen off but overall it is a very nice coverup.
