"Honest review of an edm music lover
","No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

"Battery life is good enough to keep going all day
","I can’t get enough of this earphone! The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better.

"Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.
","Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

"Good Earphones with good sound quality and build quality
","Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

"Overall good but not that worth
","he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

"Review update - Product failed after a few months
","Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

"Good sound quality
","Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

","Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

"Puchase it for sub 1000 price during offers otherwise it will be too expensive for its quality.
","Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.

"Average product
","The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

"Great earphones fir bass, MIC has no noise cancellation
","Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

"No Second Thought.....Just Go for It.........
","I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

"Not a great product but great for price.
","I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

"Not great sound performance but overall ok
","Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

","Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

"It is just Best among the other worsts. Just a Earphone wirthout jack. Nothing more to expect.
","It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market

I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

","I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

"Earphone cables are a bit lengthy that makes irritation
","In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.

"Not good for workouts
","The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

","I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!

","Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!!

"One of the worst earphone I’ve had
","I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

","Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good.

You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4.

When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this.

"Honest, unbiased review. Won't recommend buying this.
","I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

","These are of really good built quality(premium quality) except rubber holders and provides smooth sound quality and bass(condition is to use proper ear bud) , happy with the purchase as I used some other brand such as JBL,  skullcandy, house of Marley. It is standing with those brands .The bluetooth gets connected very easily, and u also get a 1 year insurance card for your product which gives an enhancement for trusthappy with the productPros:Good built qualityGood sound & bassEasy connectivityPerfectly fitsGood for our doorCons:I found it some what uneasy while in use (might be because of gripper I never used )*Note examples I gave for JBL and .... are for sound quality that I really consider at this point of price

"Sound quality is not good, over bassed
","I brought this one, after using boAt Nirvanaa Uno. Uno had good quality stereo with nice bass. This is sounds like a mono headset. I think bass is too much or not set correctly. It sounds differently on Mobile  and PC. I am not satisfied with the sound output. It connects to both PC and Mobile same time, so attending mobile call and Skype call with no hassle. For Rs. 1990 there are better quality available. I trusted boAt based on my previous purchase with UNO.

"Good one but not great !
","Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected.  While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation.  Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.ANyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range

"Good buy at an affordable price
","I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.

"The “Boat” experience !!
","I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3.

"A budget all-rounder by boAt
","I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

"Think twice before buying!!!
","I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.

","The pity is that everything about these earphones are great, starting from the sound quality, the technology/user-friendliness, and even the instructions. But I don't know which genius came up with the earbud designs. They hurt a lot! Unless you insert them deep in your ears you won't really be able to get them to stay on. Inevitably after about 15 minutes of usage, your ears will ache. Therefore even though its a perfectly fine product in all other ways, its not very usable. A great pity.

"Conectivity dissapointing, design of earpeace flawed
","Overall:  Decent product, not worth the cost.Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.Pros: Sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.

","Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

"Terrible sound quality.
","Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

"Conquers the competition...
","Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.

"Just ok product. Otherthan bass quality nothing great about
"," Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.

","To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones.

","Let me tell you this, I've used Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, Audio technika, JBL, Skullcandy, boAts and many tens of top and mid level brands. But I'm a fan of boAts for their Price - Satisfaction ratio and used many of their products and never was disappointed.Bought these earphones, I liked the build as soon as I saw them, loved the thumping bass when I tested it with multiple songs, loved the audio clarity too.And then an amazing thing happened.I was wearing them and was riding my motorcycle a bit faster and they blew away. An SUV drove over it. I thought I lost the earphones. But when I put the buds in my ear, songs were still playing as loud, as clear as ever.Button areas were damaged so badly but still, working perfect. I did not find any problem till now. I'm loving it.Perfect value of money.*I wish I could have a replacement*

"Go for something else , Spend money more get a good one.
","After using of 1 months :1. Bass is awesome.2. Battery is also good.3. The design is good but the wire is bit lengthy. It feel a little out of the neck.4. The buttons on it are horrible. Sound buttons are good but the middle can do nothing useful. It will pick up the call but u can't disconnect it from there. Also no music forwarding after two click instead it redial the last dialled no. Shitty Configuration.5. Also after a long use , i usually get a bit of headache. Its quite often. So , i use it only when i need to other times, i had to off it.

"Best in budget
","It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.

"Lousy headphones
","I primarily use this headset for my daily bike ride to farm which is full of pot holes , trenches and bad roads. When I listen to music I tend to forget these obstacles and focus on my day to day goals. Day one use was okay. However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money.

The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

Second problem I faced is that the wire is too long,  hence lookwise it looks bit shabby and also it keeps calling from the ear.  Here again the earbuds design not so good to add it to the easily falling off from the ear. Who likes it!  Apart from this boat always provides satisfactory listening experience at cheaper rates.

","this should have come with a disclaimer-you will never look like Jaqueline Fernandez that you find in the manual coming along with this product. What I meant is not the cosmetic beauty of hers. The wire has to be twisted before you plug into the ear or it sticks out giving you an embarassing look in the public. This I learnt after several months into buying the product. Jaqueline was lucky enough to have somebody help her with the twisting part. On other accounts,Sound Clarity - 4/5Noise cancellation - 2/5Gym compatibility(sweat, chaos) - 5/5

"Sound quality not remarkable but build quality excellent
","Not great sound quality. The bass is over amplified. But its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. Some of the JBL headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. But if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. Boat makes quality products for the given price.

"Just okay
","Cons:1. No vibration on call.2. 6-7 hrs battery drain in not use but connected state.3. Wires are longer than it looks, so they are hanging around while in use.4. Inear support is useless.Pros:1. Bought for 999 which just okay.2. Sound is okay.Would suggest Samsung Level U for 2000.

","Excellent headphone for calls and music. But if you are gamer, you will face issue of sound. As it is bluetooth device, you will get sound delay by .5 sec. Like when i play pubg using this headphone, I get sound delay. So sometimes its difficult to spot any enemy in close range. No issue with headphone, it is because of bluetooth connectivity. And you gonna face this issue in every bluetooth headset. So go for wired if gaming your priority.

"Sound quality same as Boat 225 Wired earphones which is amazing
","Amazing bass at that price range. Play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. However, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for Noise cancellation but not so good for your ears.

"Good but not happy
","The sound quality is good, stays firmly on the ear and battery life is decent. But, the turning on and off and battery low notification with voice is very annoying. The battery notification that appears on the phone jumps in large increments and is unreliable. Also this is unusable while running or riding as the audio gets distorted a bit under shaky situations which is I guess is the biggest flaw.

"Average deal
","Overall its a good deal in the price given. I think the noise cancellation could have been better.Also if you use continuously battery doesn't last more than 4 hours. At times it becomes irritating as despite having headphones you wait until you go back and charge it. Did not help in long travelling hours. Keep a wired headphones with you if don't want to be bored when the battery goes off.

","Durability is really good, flexible and doesn't fall off ears that easy, although the rubber material used for the eargrip isn't that great and is the only con (for which I have given a star less). Also for the price it's available, one can't really complain about battery. Which is 6hrs.

"Don't buy! Poor Quality Headphones
","First thing first, there is no bass at all only shrill treble. Bluetooth connectivity breaks down beyond 3 meters while it's falsely claimed that it has a range of10 meters. Absolutely no proof of them supporting bluetooth version 5 as claimed on the website . Chinese product with a lot of exaggerated claims.Last but not the least, the headphones have a very poor in ear grip and keep falling out despite the extended over the ear additional support. Changing the earbuds also doesn't help solve the problem.Returned them for them being very ordinary headpu that couldn't provide any real listening pleasure.

"Defected beyond belief. Feel extremely cheated
","Do NOT buy this product, even with nice discounts offered. I got cheated out of 800 rupees. For one, the bluetooth earphone is extremely defected. After a couple of weeks, my phone kept repeating ""Volume maximum"" despite it not being so and the earphone was causing disruption on my phone, unable to play properly. Now, it charges but has simply stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money on this product.

Good quality of earbuds that fits perfect in ear and wont hurt for continuos use.cons1. connectivity is wont last longer tha 2.5 mtrs.2. fits slight loose over ear, if you have small ears like i have.Note:havent checked the water resistivity yet.

","Most of the I use wired earphones , but given there are situations in which a wire does get in the way 'such as when working outside' and it results in me accidently ripping , them out of my ears.Hence I decided I should try out these wireless and see what all the praise was about, So I did my research and decided on these, so Here is a pro's and con's list for any shoppers considering this item:Pro's:-It Comes with plenty of extra ear pieces.-Battery lasts a long time.-It includes good packaging too.-Wire around back of neck prevents earbuds from falling to ground.-The magnet holds earbuds together when not in use.-Sound quality is actually quite good.-The contols are good and the buttons feel tactile too.-Useful buttons for performing certain tasks.-Noise canceling.-Sweat Proof.-Quite inexpensive.Cons's:-You have to charge it ""this is obvious but it still a negative when compared to wired versions""After these I have tried many other wireless earphones and they have changed my mind on going wireless, Very good product overall

"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product
","This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

"Great Headphones!
","Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

"Not at all worth the money....
","I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth. Please try out something else other than this. This product is only for people who have money to burn without expecting any returns.

"Must buy if u need Bluetooth n u r audiophile who prefers balance sound
","I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work

"Best in its segment!
","I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App, one can customize options like Vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

"JBL T205BT Complete Review
","I was looking for a budget friendly wireless earphones similar to apple earpods as those ""in-ear"" types don't fit my ears properly.I then came across the JBL Tune 205BT randomly and I did not find any reviews online.I took the plunge and bought it. Below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**Fit/ErgonomicsI really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Rating: 9/10**Built QualityBeing a JBL product I had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.The cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. I personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.Since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which I imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.Please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.The other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.Rating: 7/10**SoundTo explain this better I’ll compare this with my previous earphones - Boat Bassheads which is fairly common.Now, the Boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when I used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.I had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (Viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.The JBL Tune 205BT is a thousand times better in the bass department as I found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).I'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than Apple’s earpods too. I also used previously a couple of Philips’ earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.I'm currently using the JBL Tune 205BT earphones without any equalizer as I find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. I generally listen to Hip-Hop and these JBL earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.I was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but I guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.Rating: 9/10**Volume & Noise CancellationSince these are Bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.That being said, I found the volume to be enough and then some more.Don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars, people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. I tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.The sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.Rating: 7/10**Connectivity, Range & CallsThe JBL Tune 205BT earphones support Bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptX or aptxHD codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (FLAC).(I have subscription to Google Play Music which plays music in 256kbps and I have no issues with the quality).Once these earphones have been paired to your phone, the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.I did not experience any disconnects or any lags. The range was pretty good, I leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.When we talk about calls, I didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and I'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.Rating: 8/10**Battery Life & Charging timeThe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.Your mileage might vary.Added bonus: You get the battery info on the status bar. I'm using OP3T on Oreo.Rating: 8/10**PriceI thought thousands of times before buying these as I never spent so much for earphones before.But in retrospect I'm glad I did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.Rating: 10/10***ConclusionIf you're on a budget and want earpods style Bluetooth earphones then please buy this.You won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you’re getting. I have many JBL products (2 Bluetooth speakers, 1 home theatre system) so I can vouch for the sound.If you're a Hip-Hop or an EDM head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won’t disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.If this is your first pair of Bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and I cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.

"Not an Ergonomic Design. Not easy to Use!
","Even though, the Sound Quality and In Ear design is good, for couple of Ergonomic reasons, I am not satisfied with the following Features in the Ear Phones:1. Skipping/Changing songs- Very difficult. need to Hold for 2 Secs to change- Which is  very difficult while you are on a  jog/fast run. Need to completely slow down and Hold the Button.2. Volume Changing Button is inside and it takes couple of seconds to locate the VOlume Button and Press. Tedious and Very much iritating.3. The Driver Set and Mic Piece is very large and and heavy and which makes the ear piece to fall off while on a run/Jog.4. There is NO option for Clipping to our sports wear to avoid a Fall off.I had faced this Troubles More number of time in first 1 hour of the usage.  I feel my Present Iphone wired Earphones are the best.Please consider this feedback and have some deign Modification.I dont have Any Feedback on the Seller. Seller Communication  and Delivery was Perfect and very much Satisfied.I have requested for the Refund for Earphone.

","I'm not happy with this product. If you've use JBL earphones before, you won't get feel like JBL from this product. I've purchased this product in ""Rs 2399""💰 but made quality is not like the price. And important topic is, after every few minutes it'll automatically disconnect from device you connected if you get any call. Sometimes it unable to response when we've to power off the earphones.

"Lives up to the name
","My first JBL earbud. Straight to point :1 Sound quality - It's pretty good, clarity and tones. No thumping bass, but you should consider that these are not high end headphones but earphones.  But you will get good bass, notes are clear. I had used apple earphones before and I consider them the best in earphone category and JBL is in par with it. And here it is wireless.2. Battery life - Is good and holding 5 hrs3. Connectivity - Very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. I am using it with iphone. P.s - Near iphone battery life, it shows earphone battery life as well. I like it !!!4. Noise cancellation - I don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. It doesn't apply here. If you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'Noise Cancellation headphones'That's it.

"Good headset if you don't mind what I've stated below
","I bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. Here's my impression:PROS:1. Sound quality - these Bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which I loved, however I find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which I don't think it's heathy at all.2. Noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style, so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. Bluetooth range - the range is good, you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant, I really liked that. However it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. Decent range, works for me4. Built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good, well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. Battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1½ days on a single charge which is not shabby.CONS:1. The design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. It happens even when you wear both, either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. The earphones - I found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving, plus my ears started hurting a little as some point, not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but I believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile
",3,JBL T205BT,neutral
"Good sound quality with compromise in features
","Bought this 1 month back. Very impressive sound quality and reasonable bass and noise cancellation as well. But lacking few important features. 1) No multipoint connection. You can pair to only one device at a time 2) No auto off (battery saving feature) when not in connection with any of your devices. It drains battery at the end of the day even if not connected! and not available to use (due to batter drain throughout the day) when you really want to use it. 3) No magnet in the backside of the earbuds. So, you need to take extra care when you hang them around your neck.I am unhappy with these drawbacks at this price because, my 1200Rs BT earbuds is having these features built in. Hence giving 3* even though I like the sound quality.
",3,JBL T205BT,neutral
"Before you buy this please have a look at my review.
","First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

"Poor quality and only for listening YouTube videos.
","1. You have to be on 100% volume in the mobile to hear some good sound in earphones.2. Battery comes around 3-4hours.3. Comfortable in the ear but wire size is uneven and a big minus. It is bit large than it supposed to be.4. Sound quality is ok , not great and not very poor. I give 35 marks for sound quality.5. Device quality is bit poor, attached a pic . In that you can observe how it is after 1 month.6. Bluetooth range is also ok kind not more than 10feet. If you are in different room it is not connecting.Finally compare to level U, this stays bit low in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth range, but quality wise this is somewhat better than level U. Because my level U got broken in the middle and Bluetooth is connecting now. This earphones are idea for listening some stuff in YouTube but not recommended for music lovers.

They claim they do not handle headphones nor do they revert to mails (send to customer care and service center guys).Update: After almost one month of following up with Jbl, I received brand new headphones.Happy with it. But customer service is slow to respond.

"Sub-standard peoduct from JBL, very less volume, 0 Noise cancellation
","Sound quality poor,  seems like a very cheap product labelled JBL, didnot expect this bad earphone for Rs. 2400. The worst of in ear also deliver better sound.Must say it is light weight and has sattisfactory battery life.Dont ever go if you are music freak and live quality sound.Sound volume is very very low, noise cancellation is not poor it is just not there.

","I am writing this review after using these headphones for 3months.Though JBL is a brand name but this headset has connectivity issue.

"Very bad battery life. Not good
","Well sorry to say that  the sound quality is good. But its not worth buying it lacks the basic functionality of a good headphone.I want to return itThe battery life is so pathetic that it never lasts more than 3 hours. I previously owned sansung level U and i miss the 2 day battery life. Ease of use and the way it connected.This one disconnects automatically and then has to be turned off and on many times.I hate it i hate it do not buy. Instead go for Samsung level U.

"Not comfortable at all.
","Didn't like the product earbuds, they are not at all comfortable. Asked my few other friends to try it on, even they said not comfortable. Starts paining in the ear after 20 mins of usage, which results into massive headache.Also there's no return policy from Amazon nor JBL as well.Feels like both companies doesn't care about customer complaint.My suggestion would be to buy another model except this.

"Regular music lovers this earphone rocks
","I would have given 5 stars however, please find below my reviews.At first i was very skeptical to buy this earphone after reading mixed reviews. Since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. My first impression in regular usage was awesome. Sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. Definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. I am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. Music control is definitely big and heavy. I have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. As of now batter backup is good. I will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

"Full indepth review of jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone.
","Tired of reading? Watch full indepth review videoAnd please please subscribe my channel on youtubeJust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit Suryawanshi'So lets start review.....Used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. Whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging, product itself, and manuals2. Build Quality:- The build quality of earphone is really good. The cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. Product feels sturdy and premium. Hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. Comfort:- Talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. Earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. One side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. Hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. Features and Functionalities:- In this area the earphone lets you down. The earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. The earphone has three buttons. Long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones, while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. Remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. Single press will change volume and long press will change track. The volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. Earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). It is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. Earphone uses bluetooth V4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. You can easliy travel from one to another room.Microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have No issues hereBattery life:- The battery life of these earphone is average i would say. It would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. It will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. But on heavy usage you have to top it up. Watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.Charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. Earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.Sound Quality:- Here i would say its a Bomb. It's surprisingly really really good. High are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. You will love to hear all types of music. Instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. But yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. Base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. Hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.Pros:-1. Good build quality and great design2. Comfort is subjective but it's good3. Sound signature is phenomenal4. Good bluetooth rangeCon's :-1. Doesn't support Google assistant or siri2. Battery life is averageSo lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? Well definitely yes, an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.So overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodSupport by pressing help button if like the reviewAnd please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. Any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

"Very good pair of in-ear bluetooth earphones with Apple like eartips
","Ordered these because of the Apple earpod like eartips, which I prefer to the normal in-ear earphones with rubber tips. They fit really well in my ears. Very comfortable to carry them around the neck. Sound quality is very good...not too high bass, but not too low as well. They are very soothing to the ears. Noise cancellation is not that good...but I'm not that bothered about that.

"Amazing sound experience
","These bluetooth headphones are awesome, JBL keeps the sound experience great as always. Pure bass, clear, and crisp trible. The music  coming out is clearly audible even in at low volumes and high traffic (road) conditions. The only concern for me is the battery does not last that long even after a full charge. I highly recommend this to every music lover out there.

"One of the best Bluetooth earphone from JBL
","A great product from JBL, as a Bluetooth earphone it's really good, no connection issue, good noise cancellation, good bass and vocals. It's light weight, will not fill any weight in the ear, good connection range. Support both android, iOS in terms of control (buttons). Connect well with laptop but sometimes it's gives fraction of second beep sound but no issues with mobile devices.

"Most uncomfortable HeadPhones
","One of the most uncomfortable headphones I tried.Actually, I bought this from Amazon with feeling that I can return if I didn't like the product (and I confirmed the same from one customer care executive). But, when I tried to raise return request it was denied. I told them it's uncomfortable to wear (maybe issue with my ear size), and there are no earpads using which I can wear it, but the so-called technical guy was not listening. He was just insisting that I should try the same and give us call on the last day for return (unfortunately I went out on tour during the same, so they are struck with me). Regarding product, if it fits your ear fine I think you will love this product. If you have sensitive ears, a big no for you.

"Average earphones.
","Now that I've been using the product for about a month I'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.Pros- sound quality is good. You can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. Sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.Cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable, they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. You cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. And regarding the sound, it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. At mid-volume it's okay.And regarding the battery, it's really terrible. It's written that you can use it for six hours but I can hardly use it for four hours. The battery is really disturbing.The Bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. Like if my phone is in the next room I can play the dock in the current room. But if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.Overall I would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. These one's are not usable for working out. The buds will keep falling. Considering other reputed brands I'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.

It was tape sealed instead of air lock.3. The seal of box was not holographic. Just a piece of tape cut from tape machine.4. Quality of material used for making body of earphones is quiet cheap.I'm don't have second thoughts to, that these earphones are not genuine JBL. They are duplicate.Kindly don't buy. You can't even get refund. They are non refundable.

No sound distortion and mic is decent.  But sometimes the mic is being hidden behind the collar of your shirt, so be careful. The battery backup is also good. You can feel the thumping bass when required and might be the sound output is awesome due to its 12.5 mm driver size. I used JBL T210, but this provides better sound.Till now I didn't find any flaws in this earphone. I can say one thing - value for money, you wont regret buying this.

I contacted JBL and they closed this issue as its physical damage. This damage is due to the non - durability of 2500/- product only.

","This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ain’t paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a “In-Ear” type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Battery’s life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u can’t expect Noise Isolation it’s good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

"OK OK Product #WORST MIC
","Build quality is not satisfactory would've been better, battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements, for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs, the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting, standing, walking, traveling and especially driving it is just shit, while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away.

I bought this for the price of Rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other BT devices containg same features2. Noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. I bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4.

","Good product nice quality.. good sound quality. My only concern is the head set is not fitting properly in my ears as it's not a ear bud type. This is the only reason that I returned this product.

"Not so bad, but not too good product
","JBL t205bt is light weight, flexible and easy to carry. Sound quality is good. Bluetooth connects very fast. Build quality is very good. But the design of earpiece is little different from ibuds, hence ot is quite uncomfortable for ears. Bluetooth connection quality is not  good for calls. Sound cracks and breaks very often. Battery is ok for normal daily use. ( About 3 and half hours of music play with whole day connection with mobile can be expected). Biggest drawback is noise cancellation is terrible. You can not get good music in traffic or while riding.

"Worked great for 10 days. Then totally DIED.
","For a product thats made for mobility, this pair of earphones just is absolutely NOT made for the gym. The built quality is tacky, plasticky. Earphones are large and not in-ear so they slip out often. There's no clip or fastening mechanism to keep them attached or in-ear. Worst of all, 10 days of use in profuse sweat and moisture has killed them. The bluetooth connectivity comes on and off whenever it pleases, rendering them totally useless. Not at all worth the price.

"Read before you buy.
","I bought them from Amazon, ans they were okay, just average sounding earphones, but after a few days, Left earpiece started giving me problem such as low sound or sometimes no sound at all. I tried resetting them but nothing worked, I tried replacing them and the window got expired, I called Harman and they informed I need to send them to Delhi so they can have a look and check them, for like 2K I had to go through so much trouble. Although the delivery was on time as expected but things get worse when customer service is not good or helpful.

You cant use it continuously for more than 2hrs otherwise your ear will start paining.I did compare it to iPhone's headphone, and the difference and the reason for pain in ears was that the buds of JBL  headphones are bigger than that of iPhone's.

"These surprised me!
","I'm personally not a fan of the ear-plug type earbuds so I went for this. Initially, I was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. However, to my surprise, their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of Mi & Altec Lansing.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, Got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.Talking about the sound quality, sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. The sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. These sound fantastic!Anyone who wants to listen to EDM or Bollywood go for these. Good product from JBL.

"Great for Music -- Not for calls
","I purchased 2 sets of this product and been using for 1 week.Pros:Earpod style, fits nicely, no pain even after using for hours. (This is the main reason I bought)Good sound quality and BassNice build quality and looks great.Cons:No Sir/Google Now-- Very Disappointing, If I knew this, I wouldn't have bought it. I thought every earphone will have a long press google now support. Feels useless while riding bike and while walking.Very low call volume -- This is serious issue while in traffic riding bike in India.Low battery life.Not sweat proof.Poor quality audio in Skype for Business. (App shows your device is causing low call quality)

"Overrated
","I was planning on buying these but fortunately, an office colleague of mine bought one and I got to try it.The fitting in the ear is just OK; it is definitely not painful but pops out as you indulge in some physical activity like running.The Bluetooth connectivity also seems a bit off; the phone was in my pocket and it still gave that mushy noise sometimes.The biggest let down for me was the audio quality. The highs, lows and beats are just overhsadowed by uncontrolled bass. It feels like music being played in an empty hall. Also, the volume is also not very impressive. Definitely not worth the money.I currently use Boat earphones which I bought for Rs.500 and they are way better than these 2k ones.Better go for MiVi or Boat.

"Sound, bass
","I was looking for simple ear phones which remain just outside ear and not like other pieces which go inside the ear and we r totally cut off from outside.Such earphones were not available online, even in some good offline stores also.But one day while surfing I found these .I immediately ordered ., bass is deep and loud as claimed , light weight.

"Good product to go with Bluetooth
","Bought this from jbl site and was available for 1999 Rs but black color was not available.I did lot of research on Bluetooth headphones before purchasing. Asked some of my friends already using some other company Bluetooth headset. All was having problem while calling. The other person on call hear some disturbance. Mainly I was looking for calling purpose. Following are the pros and cons according to me:Pros-no issue in call on both side. Perfect for callingBattery also seems good to me. Haven’t used for continuous day long but looks like it could hold for day long.Music sound also good. Was using iPhone headset and seems no much difference.In ear comfort also fineLook and quality wise no problemCons: no magnet but given one plastic kind of thing to hold both side wire togetherAuto turn off if not in use. For some it could be drawback and for some battery saving feature.I would suggest to purchase without any doubt.

"Go for it if you are not into plug in ear buds !
","Bought this doubtfully during the great Indian sale. Happy with purchase. I’m against in ear plugs as I feel uncomfortable beyond a point. This ear plug replicates apple earphones and sits on the ear.  Very comfortable and sound is enough to satisfy my needs. Also use it for taking calls so far no issues. Charging time 2hrs and lasts for a day.

"Not worth the price!
","I think JBL is just a brand name. To be honest this is good for nothing. Noise cancellation is zero, if I am on bike I dont even get which song is playing even on full volume. The bass is okay, not so appreciable as they market it the way it to be. I recently shifted from Sennheiser  brand and quite disappointed with this :-D

"Sound quality is great but it may not be that durable.
","Before I write my review, I’d like to make clear that I DIDN’T purchase the item from the Amazon store. Regardless, I wish to write the review as I did come across one problem and would like others to consider it.I’ve had the earphones for almost about a month. I use it on a daily basis. And after first few weeks I noticed the ear-thing coming out. And I didn’t give much attention then but now it’s fully out and it’s bothersome.

Listen to some acoustics and bam, this will take you away on your own music studio, :P.....Bluetooth connectivity is okayish mediocre range works only with one device.Hence, as mentioned the pros doesn't justify the cons and nor the price.

Battery- depending on song, I listened music with volume varying from 50% to 90%. Well, battery lasted 7hr+. No issue there.I had mi Bluetooth headset in mind.  But warranty was 6 month for that. 1 year jbl. So went with this.So it's like vivo oppo cameras beautify camera photos,same Chinese manufacturer amplify base to sound good.  It's just unnatural.

"Great pair of earphones
","I usually don't write reviews, but I've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.The sound quality is good, but for me, the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. I take a lot of calls, and though this doesn't have noise cancellation, it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. I rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in India). I'm able to take conference calls when travelling, which is a huge plus. The build quality is good. There is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. I've had that problem once, but Sennheiser replaced this without question. I've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.The pouch really keeps things secure. A couple of days ago, I forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. I later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle, dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.I'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like, but for me, this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback, great service and ability to make calls on the street. I find very few reviews focussing on these, so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.

"Excellent product but cable quality could be better,
","I have used wide ranges of earphones over years, some brands being Skullcandy (Smokin Buds 2), JBL (T 210), Sennheiser (HD 180, HD 210, CX 271, CX400 II Precision, CX 185 Street II, and now CX 275 S) Fiio (f1), Koss (Porta Pro) Audio Technica (ATHCOR150RD),First off there is a large difference between CX 185 Street II and CX 275 S don't even compare, CX 185 has too much of treble with very low bass, CX 275 S is very well balanced, CX 275 S reminds me of my CX 271 which I used for 7 years, its wire was of great quality and tangle free, I would have easily paid an extra 1k for that kind of cable,To anyone looking to buy earphones, go for Audio Technica>JBL if your budget is below 1k and Sennheiser CX 275 S if you just need the best audio output, and regarding other earphones I've used JBL has decent output, and regarding Fiio f1 it is just a piece of crap, it was an impulsive decision I made based just on the brand without any research, don't throw your money in garbage buying it, finally make sure you buy it from a well rated seller.

The earbuds are small and therefore allow a comfort fit while listening lying down or sleeping and they do not poke or irritate while listening for long hours.I purchased it for Rs 1600/- , it comes with a leather case and a L - Shaped converter which is very thoughtful .Overall i would highly recommend.

"Simply put - the best earphone in the price range!!
","I don't know why this earphone is getting a lot of hate from a lot of people. Quite frankly I've tried tons of earphones at this price point and personally the right amount of bass and excellent lows and mids would describe this earphone. If you want Xtreme bass then I would suggest you to go for Sony or JBL earphones. But this is a balanced earphone with the right amount of bass and good clarity.

"My Experience With The Product
","Have been using it for over 10 days now and have been testing these beauties under extreme conditions and therefore thought of sharing my experience with this product. I will try to keep it short and to the point.Note : you get 2 years domestic warranty with the product and to check the authenticity of the product, do scan the QR code given on the box.So here we go :👉Look And FeelPremium- thats what you will feel when you hold in your hand for the first time. The material is of excellent quality and offers great durability. The earphones are slightly curved which fits in your ears very comfortably. The three button remote is of high grade rubber and feels smooth while touching.👉ConnectivityThe CX6 from Sanheiser comes with bluetooth 4.2 and connecting your phone is a butter smooth operation. I have tested it with a distance  of about 15 meters and never faced any issue.👉Battery and ChargeThe product claimed of a 6 hours long battery backup but you will get around 5 to 5 and a half hours. But the best part is it supports Quick charge and even a 5 minutes of charge can give you over 1 hour of support.👉Sound OutputThis is where the real test starts when we talk about a headphone and specially when it is at this cost. I have used BT headphones of other companies and can assure you that at this price point, its not the beat sound output but there are no competitors too. The sound is crisp and clear. The treble is just awesome, you can hear every lows and highs of it but the bass is not the best. The bass should have been a little more because thats what I like but again thats depends on person to person. But I can assure you that you will be pleased to hear the music in this headphone and even for long continuous hours.For those giving negative reviews, its adviced that you download the song at the best bitrate and then try this headphone.👉CALL QUALITYHave been using it since 10 days now and during all these days, I have tried to use it as rough as I could in all kind of noisy and louder situations but the product has never disappointed me. The sound cancellation works simply superb and the other party could hear me clearly even when I was in the noisiest condition. Never faced any issue over call quality till date. But many months to go and hoping that the brand will keep its good name as it usually does. Kudos✌️👉VERDICTSANHEISER has been understanding music and sound since 70 years and one thing can be assured that you wont be disappointed with their product. If you are a Sanheiser user, there is nothing to be said about the quality but about this product, you can definitely give it a try and you wont be disappointed and for those who are planning to buy Sanheiser for the first time, reading reviews wont help you, you need to make a BUY and experience it yourself. Since I have been using this product, I can assure you that using BT headphones for longer hours will not be a pain for your ears anymore. I hope that this review has made you make an informed PURCHASE decision because overall you would be spending your hard earned money. Thanks for reading and Happy Shopping !!

"Best for the buck but lacks in built quality!
","Pros:Really good quality sound.Perfect balance of treble and bass.Value for money.Lightweight.Good for every genre of music.Cons:Really thin wire seems fragile I fear I might accidentally rip them with simple pull.Three button pad is big compared to the thin wire, it just looks ugly in my opinion.sometimes i hear distortion when i listen to hip hop.I mostly listen to all genres.These give better kicks when listened to rock.More dept when listened to edm.These are definitely better than the previous pair (RHA M390U) which I've owned. Enhances the sound quality. You need to have good quality mp3 files to get most out of this earphone. Gives me studio feel even when I'm in public. Earbuds are very comfortable in my ears. I could hear instruments which I've never heard before in  songs. Definitely best earphones I've owned. Feels like there's orgy in my ears when I listen to songs with these. It's like someone's pouring sweet syrup in my ears.

"Great sounding earphones with one shortcoming
","Let me get this straight, the sound from these is amazing. The highs and mids are clear and the low bass end is great. Recommended for bass heads. Fit is comfortable and they don't fall off from the ears.Now the shortcoming, these earphones are not durable. The wire is very thin as compared to other earphones. In the unit I received, sound from the right ear piece had reduced to half after only 3 months of use. But as Sennheiser gives 2 years of warranty, they replaced the earphones without asking any questions. Right now using the replacement ones and they've been working great.

"Great sound, mediocre built
","Sennheiser are known for their great studio grade sound quality with a flat EQ, and this pair is no different. I really love the sound quality of these headphones, it is full with equal emphasis on the lows, mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. You get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. It is great for movie watching and voice calls. The mic is great. Everyone I called using this pair said I sounded clear with no distortions. Also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.Now let's get to the cons, and as usual its the built quality. The wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. I have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. I would have loved Sennheiser to at least give some quality materials, because you have to really take care or else I feel the wires will break. Also the mic button feels cheap.Overall, this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound. If you like bass, something from Sony would be better for you.

","I have been using cx180 since almost 4 years. Those earphones were of much better quality than the cx275s.The sound quality is OK, but the wires are too thin and feels very delicate. Apart from the quality, I had hard time authenticating the earphones from sennheiser, as the QR code on the box doesn't work anymore and the customer care services over the call & mail are Horrible. After wasting cumulatively 3 hours over the phone listening to YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US, PLEASE HOLD THE LINE  and WASTING 4 days, (including sat and sun)  I had given up all the hopes and decided to send the product back to Amazon.

The wire length got reduced drastically after the wire twisted from several places. Even the music was not extraordinary but it was definitely decent.However, the mic and earphones were good if you compare it to other brands, just that it did not meet the high expectations one normally associates with Sennheiser. One of the earpieces stopped working 5 months after purchase. But a big THANKS to the best after sales support of Sennheiser, the product was replaced in 5 minutes with no questions asked!Kudos to Sennheiser to have such a customer friendly attitude and have such warranty policies which are actually there to help customers and not bog them down with questions and procedures.I will buy Sennheiser again despite this product being average given its cost because I am not afraid that my product might be faulty or develop a fault.Verdict - Buy this product for the decent sound with a great mic and the promise of Sennheiser.

The most disappointing feature about these earphones is the quality of the materials used to make it. Nothing short of awful, it's very fragile and if not given extreme care will break.

"True review of CX 6.00BT and Sennheiser (as a brand)
","The battery life is a little low for my taste. Apart from that, CX 6.00BT are a solid pair of earphones with well built structure and housing for the drivers; they have a wide frequency spectrum with pretty flat sound signature with a little bit of coloring (boosted bass and treble frequencies). Sennheiser’s engineering is yet again proven to be the best. CX 6.00BT may not be a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, but trust the Sennheiser’s reputation and you’ll be surprised by buying these earphones how much well worth Sennheiser’s products are. Sennheiser is a German company, and Germans are known for their engineering skills, even in audio.Note: for people looking for bass heavy earphones, CX 6.00BT should not be one of your choices.

","Used the earphones for over 7 hours today on a train journey, absolutely no fatigue or any kind of irritation on or in the ears, the large caps provide a snug fit and cancel out external noise to a great extent, the wires look deceptively thin, but can make out it is quality build, reason for 4* & not 5*is because the wires get tangled way too easily and frequently, which is very annoying, also not rating below 4*is purely coz of the worldwide warranty it's not going to WOW at this price range is my personal opinion, definitely more than a good product without doubt, especially comfort level (4.5)update : after 6 months of use, it's sturdy as hell!

"Doesn't work on Nokia 8.
","Sennheiser CX225S has been on my list of earphones to try because of its earpiece design. I love that it's in-ear model and comes with a total of 3 earpieces; small medium and large. I use the small ones. They're very extremely weight and don't seem to weigh the earphones down while they're in use.The mic is pretty much what made me buy this. Quality of sound on call is very good and I majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime. They work pretty well for the purpose.Cons:I use a Nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. The little connecter is even worse.

However, if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.They are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point. The 2 year warranty that is provided, makes these the most bang for buck earphones. If ever, you face issues with the earphones as long as they are within the warranty period, replacement is quite hassle free.

","This product is good but in this price range probably not so mucg value for money as you get disappointed because you are paying that much but u get an over average product .still it's Sennheiser I say it is Okay.here are my rating for better understanding :Sound quality: 4/5Bass:3.3/5Build quality:5/5Noise cancellation: 4.5/5Battery life: 3.5/5Value for.money:3.2/5Pros:- have nice design n build-withstand rough use-sound quality is not top of world but good-fits comfortably n easily- can connect to 2 Devices at same time-sound clarity n originality is maxCons:-Battery life not much-sometimes our of sync with YouTune video n audio but if u reset synced again-no travelling pouch is given as I guess for that price it should be given-not Bluetooth 5-Basss is not much: if y r heavy bass user then leave it

"The Pursuit of Perfect Sound.
","Sennheisers are meant for the production of perfect sound. These aren't for bass listeners. These are only for high fidelity sound listeners. I am using Sennheiser since 5 years firstly CX 180, then CX 3.00, and now CX 2.00G. These have a perfect flat sound response. Has High Treble, Balanced Bass.The only issue is that they are very sensitive to humidity, sweat, and water. I had kept them in my front pocket in the humid climate in Mumbai. The one side that encountered sweat, or humidity and sounded a little low. But got replaced in the Service Center. Just be cautious while using it and prevent it from any type of water or sweat. Their service centers are only big cities in India, and getting them replaced is a tedious task. Sennheiser please note this issue that these earphones are very prone to water. I had used CX 3.00 and they did not have this problem (by the way I had put them in Washing Machine thrice) but the sound was not affected a bit and lasted more than 3 years (after which its wire got torn). So for the sound, these are perfect, but only if you prevent it from water.

"Awesome!!
","I was really confused before purchasing...as there are many reviews ..for cx275s...bt this one had better base and sound quality...also...there is volume ctrl remote...so I went for this one.And...now I feel...my gut feeling really paid well...this one is just absolutely fantastic. Balanced sound...decent treble...and bass. Base is on the heavier side. Overall audio quality is just amazing.I purchased this 5 days after getting cx180...which I didnt like ..as the treble was too piercing. Go for this one if you want some bass backed music...with balanced treble.

","Well first things first .Awesome product jst buy it ..But here are some pros and cons .Pros:-1. good clear crips sounds.2. Bass is adequate enough but i think it is lacking bass .( but enjoyable )3. design is good .4. noise cancellation is good.5. 2 warranty is great .Cons:-1. The wire is so thin I'm having doubts about the durability of the product .. (since it's about 1700 the product should have be gud ( should have given a breaded cable))2.Bass is not enough i think (considering the price).Overall the best earphones u can but if u can look past the thin wire and not enough bass .

"Sennheiser, sadly  this is one of your bad ones!
","The earphones are stylish and fit perfectly well in you r ears as you place them in.You don't need to press it in unlike other earphones, reducing the damage, typical in-ear earphones cause your ears.Coming to the sound quality, the high and mid frequencies can be heard very clearly. Wouldn't say 5 on 5 though. Listening to the low frequencies or the bass in other words was quite disappointing for the price you pay. Bass quality - 2 on 5.Overall you could but them for ₹1000 bucks may be. It's not worth ₹2000.It's disheartening even writing this as I'm a big fan of Sennheiser.I've used the CX180, CX275s and both were worth the buy. Amazing products by Sennheiser. But the CX 2.00 is not just not worth it but you could buy the other two that I mentioned above as they're cheaper and better I believe.

"Excellent pair of headphones
","I like the clarity of these headphones. Noise cancellation works best if there is a good seal between your ear cavity and the head phones. However, this tends to prevent air circulation within the ear for me. I found this air tight feeling to be uncomfortable. Hence, I usually wear these headphones with some clearance so that air can flow freely into the ear cavity. However, this results in reduced noise cancellation properties. Overall, these are a good bunch of headphones!

","First of all,  I love the design of the earbuds, very unique. I was using Sennheiser CX180 before this and they worked perfectly for two years no issue at all. Jst that they didnt have a mic so I got these. They are very comfortable and sound quality is great, balanced. Only the cable is too thin, looks fragile it was like that on CX180 too and nothing happened to that so i dont think it will be a problem.I ordered one and after using for a day i realized the mic wasnt working properly and the button also didnt respond sometimes, but i got it replaced and now no issue with it. :)

"Just okay. Wire too brittle
","The sound is absolutely superb for this price. No complaints. ALSO a superb faux leather pouch free with it!Cons:The plug is a straight one, instead of a 90° bent one. So it'll definitely be kinked there and prone to break.The wires are very thin and round. Feels very flimsy. I don't know how long it'll last. I'd recommend some wire protectors.The in ear plugs are just okay. Not too happy about the shape and size of it.

"Sound quality is marvelous
","I'm writing this review after about 6 months of use.Material quality:The build quality of this product isn't on par with with some other products at this price range as the wires are thin and unbraided which often causes them to get entangled pretty easily.Durability:After 6 months there is normal wear and tear which also depends upon individual use but they are working just fine.Sound quality:The most important one for most of us,so the sound quality is what made me fall in love with these earphones.They're just perfect for my taste as the bass isn't that intense and the mids and lows are just on spot.To sum up:It's a pretty decent pair of earphones for their price with great sound and average build quality.I say go for it.Ps: if you are confused between jbl's earphones and this one,just go for these as they sound much better

"Middle of the road. Your mileage may vary.
","My Mother is pleased with these earphones. The Sennheiser bag is very sleek and presentable.Personally I found the audio to be okay-ish. The loudness is on the higher side and the bass seems to be excessive, overwhelming other sounds. It is not bad but it is lacking the signature Sennheiser balance and quality.This may be a good fit for phones that come sans a 3.5 mm jack. Audio over USB is low energy, and these loud earphones should even it out. My Mother is using this with a Le 2.

"Absolute value for money
","These are incredible Headphones. I had bought a one three years back. There is hardly any damage to the headphones. I use them for taking calls, listening to music, working out, etc and they seem to hold ground everywhere.The buds fit snugly into the ear and the headphone doesn't slip even when working out.The music quality is excellent.The bass is punchy and not super thumping. The mids and highs are balanced. I used songs like Jumbalika, Thriller, etc to test them and you can feel the different instruments distinctly.Recently I had wanted to buy new ones and found that these stand in comparison to 1More Dual Driver and Boat Nirvana Tres Headphones in most features.I'm quite satisfied with this buy.

"The best sound but delicate build
","Its best headphone with clear sound and amazing bass, although the effect of base is best while listening it in less noise. As it doesn’t have any noise isolation but still if it perfectly fit in ears the sound is least effect with considerable noise. That is, it’s great for general commute. Its mike is also great with it position and recording quality makes it best for calling.Although it’s not a deal breaker but like me do not expect much with l shaped extension adapter it only works with Samsung or some selected device. And it is also mention on its cover.Comparing it with Sony MDR series (extra bass series) Schneider headphone is way ahead in sound quality, although it depends on your taste but it like Sony MDR series have special punch to bass slightly cutting other aspects like tone quality and treble. Schneider (This model) have almost the same (or better bass) with even better quality of other sound, other than sound it’s also have superior in comfort and ergonomics.The only thing it lag is the build quality, in almost same price tag Sony MDR series are IP68 and build to last till you are bored with it. While this headphone needs to be treated like a baby and the other trade off with Schneider is lesser service centre in India.So, if you are planning for workout or training music then forget this try Schneider’s higher sports model or try Sony, Skullcandy etc. but if you are music lover looking only for premium sound quality then it’s the best in this price range.

"Best Bluetooth Earphones Under 10000
","Many audio enthusiasts have been scouting for good BT earphones, but JBL and Sony have dissapointed at the lower end. Most of the big names have been too busy amping up the battery or range. So I'll keep this about sound quality only, as the range and battery life is as good as the others. Many reviews have been too critical about the ''lack of Bass' but let me assure you that these beauties produce 90% of the sound signature of the Sennheiser 275, which is a huge compliment for a BT Earphone in this class. Since the bass is not overpowering, the mids and highs are crisp and clear  , resulting in true sound. Yes, the drums and bass guitar is nowhere as booming as on Sony XB55AP, but it is just good enough for Knopfler or Gilmour's guitar to sound true. While I love the Bose Truly Wireless buds sound (sans the audio lag!), I found this close to Bose Soundsport BT performance at half the cost.Bottomline: If you're a Sennheiser loyalist, you won't be dissapointed at this price point. They are light, don't feel much, fit right and have awesome build quality.  These are the best BT earphones I've heard under 10k.

"Excellent option at a very reasonable price
","I received my earphones today and although this review might be a little preemptive, I felt it was necessary to put in a word to address some concerns that potential buyers might have. One of the first concerns I had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. As soon as I received the package, I went to the Sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. It was, indeed. My primary concern allayed, I opened the package and I was very happy with everything. You get a 3.5mm adapter, extra ear buds, a pouch, and a manual. The earphones themselves are just fantastic, I tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. The bass is not extraordinary, but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile, you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. The build quality is good, they don't feel cheap. I played a range of music, from your Bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to Djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. At decent volumes, these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. At the price, these earphones are a steal. I'll continue to use these and revise my review if they ever fall short of expectations.

"Review after two years. Great earphone but not for rough use
","prior to this earphones i have used JBLT150A, Sony MDR-EX150AP, Sennheiser CX 180  all of them were good products which lasted 2 years  except JBLT150 which i had to replace after 6 months. i tested Sennheiser CX 275 when my friend bought it and i knew which earphone would be my next daily driver. Its audio quality was great in all freq ranges whether its low, high or mid it was engineered perfectly. biggest con of the earphone is its build quality the wires are too thin and could be damaged easily for a rough user it will brake easily(for such user i would suggest to go for something with kevlar,flat or braided wires ) i consider myself a rough user i would fell asleep with my earphones on plugging it on either phone or my laptop. it finally took a tall on it. it started tearing of on joints and and other parts were it usually bend or gets tangled today its left driver stopped working due to damage on the wire. it  worked perfectly fine for 2years which is great considering its thin wires.

Highs, mids and lows are very well balanced, you can hear every note and instrument in the background. Can be a suitable alternative to Bose in ear wired headphones.

","The model and the sound quality is is on par excellence. The moment i saw these headphones and plugged them in, there wasn’t any resistance in inserting them. The angled design gives a great comfort that my ears aren’t irritated anymore and I have spent hours and hours listening to songs before my ears start crying from pain caused by the structure of the buds. This for one has two variants and I wasn’t aware that one supports the android and the other iOS.The reason behind cost difference between both of them is an unknown fact on my side and hence I chose the wrong OS headset since I use Apple. That may be the downside on my part and the length of the wire is an issue which in turn gets intertwined with each other and I seriously fear that because of this I might not utilise the product’s life.Altogether put it’s a great product and if you’re looking for Android CX2.00G is your model and CX2.00i is your iOS variant.

"Excellent audio quality and noise cancelation but left right polarity is flipped
","Ordered product on early september 2018, delivery was timely as usual. After approximately 6 months of use, here's what I observed.PROS1. Sound quality is really good. Covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15,000 hz. Means, excellent bass, and remarkable treble sounds.2. The mouthpiece, or the mic, is also really good. I have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when I am riding a bike @60kmph, which brings me to another point3. I occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike, and I have to tell you, noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. Another good thing I noted about this piece is that, while you are on a call and you speak on the mic, the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. In other words, you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece, which I found to be an interesting quirk. Reason being, in most of the noise cancelation earphones, you can't hear your voice, except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)CONS1. Well, the wire noise is a bit turn off. Could have been better, but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. Now this one really gets me. The left and right earpieces are reverse! From a brand like Sennheiser, this simply is negligence. Now, this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from, but for music lover like myself, this is a bummer. Your favorite song does not sound, well, like it should.But then, you can always switch your ears... Put left on right and right on left. That fixes everything, and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.But still...Anyway, a 4 star from my side. Fix the left right issue, and its a 5 star product.

"Best Value for Your Money

If not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours, I mean really long time, still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6.

Sound equilibrium from high freequency to low without distortions is well maintained. (I can give u a tip to check your audio listening devices. Play ""Bohemian Rhapsody by queen. The song covers all most all freequency levels, with different vocals and instruments.)  No sickening high bass. Those who love thumping bass may opt for other ear phones.But.......

For any headphone, 3 years is a good span and Iam sure that if we protect the portion near the plug from being worn out, it will definitely last much longer.

Sennheiser CX 2.00G do not worth a 500 rs cost.I am writing names of earphones again N again because I found that Review Content for both the earphones 1-  Sennheiser CX 275 S, 2-  Sennheiser CX 2.00G is same. Amazon is showing same reviews for both the earphones. But both are totally different in Quality.Check the reviews here,- https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00NQ17ZUS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1- https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B008V6T1IW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

"Perfect for voice calls and decent music
","Purchased this earphone to attend voice calls and telephone meetings and liked the voice clarity a lot. Voice is very clear and crisp. It is also delivers good performance while playing music, bass is soothing and not very high. To compare, I also have Sony WI-C400 in-ear headphones but it gives poor audio, inspite of comfort of neckband i have to forgo it for sake of voice clarity on wired Sennheiser CX 275. I am rating it low in terms of material quality and durability as it's wire appears delicate.

"Too bad that they had microphone issue within 1 month of use
","These are pathetic earphones for such a high price. I bought them after seeing good reviews but ended up feeling bad for taking a bad decision of buying them. They advertised as noise cancelling which is not. There is not any quantable noise cancelling or noise reduction. They feel loose in the ear and won't be comfortably inside the ear. After not more than a month of use, microphone is not working. Dealing with Senheiser Customer care now. Don't go for these ear phones. There is a reason why they are selling for 2.5k while the MRP of product is 4.5K. Because they are bad performing. Don't buy them.

The mic and the voice clarity is excellent.In addition to this the music clarity is great.The only thing I felt to be improved is the thickness of the cable.

"Great sound but a delicate piece, pin stopped working.
","I have no issues with Amazon delivery, it's seamless as expected.Product is great too but it's too delicate.The pluggable Pin is damaged in 6 months. When I connect it to a device and play music, it plays in only one of ears, and, when I try adjusting the pin while connected the device, it flickers and starts playing in both ears and any movement of either ear phone pin or the device, it again stops playing in one of the ears.I have not yet taken to Sennheiser service centre as their working hours are only on week days so it makes very difficult to  get it done.Over all, these ear phones give best sound but too delicate to use outdoor on daily basis.

But I was disappointed when I played EDM's , R&B etc. Because even though the quality is amazing this product lacks bass, which is kindo disappointing for someone like me who listen to every type of music.

","Wanted to buy this headphones for very long and finally got good deal on Amazon.Built quality could have been better. Wire is thin and feels very delicate. Also wire tangles easily. Although Sennheiser trust is there and I'm hoping headphones will last for long. As of now it's hard to tell if this headphones can handle the rough treatment.Sound is just great. Not a audiophile and don't know about the notes and all but when you plug in these headphones and start the music you can easily notice the clarity in music. I previously used Sennheiser CX213 but I find these headphones to be better. In line mic is good and works well during call.Overall these are great headphones in given price range. Definitely worth the money.

Good delivery by Amazon, got it on second day.I've been trying different earphones of philips, sony, skullcandy and even steel series siberia v1(though it's built for gaming not for music) for long time to get the best earphone in my budget and now I tried this. I haven't experienced anything like this before. Excellent bass with crystal clear sound even at 10% volume and complete isolation from noise.

","If I would have written a review in the initial days of usage of these earphones, it would have been an amazing review of the product. But after 6 months of usage, I observed a volume difference between the two ear buds. This is something that is damaging for the ear. No one would recommend using such a product. Sennheiser should really look into the product's performance in longer term(more than 6 months). If the product is not able to deliver as promised after 6 months, then it should be mentioned in the product's description.

","First off, great service by Amazon, received the earphones in less than 24 hours. Next, the sound quality of the earphones is phenomenal. Sennheiser, as usual, have one of the best sounds money can buy, and these are no different. Only downside is, the wire is so thin and fragile, I'm 99% sure it's not going to last the 2 years of warranty the earphones come with. Maybe a little stronger cord would do wonders. 4.8/5 stars.

First of all, the product is really premium in terms of sound quality, call clarity, material used, provided accessories. You can't find such a bass effect on a headphone as it looks simple but blows out the music experience. Only con is the product wears off in two years and this is my third purchase and I buy this only for the experience which no headphones had left me with. I would definitely recommend it for any music lovers and gamers.

"Internal damage within 6 months
","Bought it on May this year, now it's completely damaged from the inside even though it looks good from the outside. When the earphone is connected, it turns the volume up and down on it's own, plays or pauses the songs automatically and opens apps (especially Google assistant) on it's own. I thought it was a virus at first but after thorough scanning with different anti- viruses with no signs, I realized that it was indeed my earphone that was actually messing around with my smartphone. Also the sound quality was not worth right from the start (maybe I received a defective piece). It had more trebel and hardly any  bass. Even when I set my equaliser to bass boost, the bass quality was not that great. Infact the cx180 I had before sounded better than this.

"Clarity is good but few issues i found.....
","Volume seems to be very poor and sound can be heard only after raising the volume at least 50%. I got it replaced with another piece but still having the same issue. Also, this headphone doesn't have that punchy bass but clarity is very good and sound is crystal clear. So if you are a bass lover then may be its not a perfect choice for you.Also, the mic is not that good and i have to keep it very near to my mouth then only the other person can hear me properly.

We can increase the bass by using equilizer but even though with equilizer the experience improved very slightly and also after using Equalizer the voice losses it's originality.

At this price-range it’s a good deal. 4/5 rating for it’s sound quality at this price.

"... about past 6 months and I find it very good value for money headphones
","I've been using Soundmagic ES18 for about past 6 months and I find it very good value for money headphones.The Sennheiser cx275s is also  a  very good value for money headphones ,a little more stylish than the SoundMagic ES18 .Sennheiser cx275s sounds really good, even though the bass is very power it is clear and  not overpowering. You can hear sound of each and every instrument clearly.The quality of these headphones are very good and it supports mic also. When compared to the SoundMagic ES18 you can go on hearing bass overwhelmed songs for hours and it doesn't hurt your ears but SoundMagic ES18 starts hurting after sometime. These headphones also comes with a warranty of 2 years.Finally these headphones are real value for money under rupees 1500.

"Why should I upgrade when it sounds the same as CX180?
","I ordered this item ""Sennheiser CX275 S In-Ear Universal Mobile Headphone with Mic (Black)"" hoping it would give a better output than my current earphone ""Sennheiser CX180"" but I was disappointed. The wire was too thin and delicate. The sound output was only 5 to 10 % better than CX180. I decided to return it.

"Good
","Fulfilled by Amazon, so packaging was good. It came in a compact packing. Quality of the audio was good.. noise cancellation was decent, though I didn't test it much except for listening to music in front of the TV or somebody talking. You can take calls and end calls with the call button. It is the only single button present there. Voice quality is average and it was snubbing the voice a bit. On the main screen if you press the button, it would open the default music player and starts playing a song. If you press again, it will pause it. It is capable of capturing FM radio signals. This is tested on Samsung S3 as a headset. On apple ipad as a headphone. The volume up down buttons were not present. While some commented that it is thin (and it is compared to my stock Samsung headphone), it is not fragile.

After the first listen to a song, I could make out how the bass is boosted in the 275s and the notes as super clear. So happy! Totally worth the money. And I'm glad I upgraded to this. I'm a total sennheiser fan!

I personally couldn't get hands on a pair so I can't compare but no matter what you listen, in my experience bass is important.I'll recommend these to someone with a budget of under Rs 2000, but try to listen to Sony's once as I've heard their better before purchasing.Shipping is horrible, took more than a week. Unless amazon is the cheapest, buy from somewhere else.

It has proper and clear treble. lows, mid and high are all clear, constant and smooth. Base is beautiful as it should be or as has been recorded in the studio and does not loose even on high. I am enjoying listening at every level of volume. Under Rs. 2000/-, the best bye !

","This is the second time i bought this model as 1st one got accidentally damaged in my hand. The sound quality is awesome and the right amount of bass is set.

"Best headphone under 2k,no doubt about that.
","I have a collection of various headphones, but must say that this is ths the best headphone atleast in sub 2k price range.I regularly listen music in my Moto G 1st gen, and I am quite serious about audio quality of the phone and the headsets. I, may not be an audiophile but can assure that this excellent headphone have the most balanced, precise audio output capabilities.Headsets I have used-1) sony mdr ex 30 - too bass heavy, audio not clear, bulky2) Creative ep630 - less bass, short wire, less warm sound3) Nokia wh205 - very good audio output, slightly bassy, not crystal clear sound as sennheiser, wire don't tangles.4) Cowon em1 - at par with Nokia wh205. Slightly midtone heavy5) soundmagic es18s - just bought  cannot beat sennheiser, but 2nd best, good balance, not very loud, good cable, but gets tangled.6) sennheiser cx 275-Pros- good balance between bass and treble, lows are clear and crisp, quite loud, very comfortable, excellent noise isolation, nice bagCons- slightly excess treble, mids not perfect, wires get tangled, cables are thin.There is hardly any headphone without any limitations, still I must say that this item satisfied my needs more than enough. I will purchase another one.

"Average earphone, avoid if you are looking for great noise isolation.

The Beats and Bass of that one were better than any headset I have encountered.But after listening through this it took me to a whole new level of musical approach. The Beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.The Headset fitting in ears is awesome. You can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.The Noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.TheBut be cautious as it is not for persons who love Boombox type music.  The Overall bass is good but it isn't made for Bass based music.

"Great sound quality by Sennheiser
","Amazing product. after using for 4 months, i can say that it has a great sound quality and best balanced bass and it's super light and doesn't feel heavy for longer use but gives you a slight ear pain but, that's manageable.

This has got a more than average bass to it, and the sound clarity and all sounds which are overpowered by bass can be heard. Mic also a big advantage, and its fits into the ear perfectly , no chance of falling out. There are multiple options depending upon ear size.

(CX180 has a proper layer which gives enough support) , I would not recommend this while you have your helmets on the bike.

"I am changing my review over this.It stopped working within a year.
","the headphones worked for a year without a glitch, but almost a year later, the console became gummy and sticky, I used these headphones only while traveling in public transits(bus). The console cover got completely spoiled and came off the headphones totally leaving the inner circuit open, after that within a day or two headphones died completely. Now they are just a piece of dead garbage, doesn't even charge or get turned on.Skull candy provides 2 years warranty all across the world except India.WOW.... it's just a year of warranty u get in India and upon calling they told me that Skullcandy headphones cant be fixed in any other way and I have to buy a new one. This wasn't expected from Skullcandy, I am hugely disappointed with the product, my 3700 bucks are wasted. I would recommend not to purchase this garbage as it works only for a year.

"At this price tag its best. Mid bass is good
","Got delivery on time. Do not compare this earphone with wire earphone. As this is Bluetooth based wireless earphones it compresses the sound quality hence we don't get amazing sound quality as wired. I have compared this earphone with Sony SBH70 which is costlier then this but same result. So I will recommend this earphone at this cost the bass is good not amazing but mid range is amazing try listening song with 320kbps bit rate MP3 songs. Only disadvantage is you will not get the sound quality like wired one. Although it's best earphone at this price. Listen song just by tweaking equaliser you won't be disappoint.

"Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
","This is my personal experience with this product.I own JBL stuff at home.. but this device just doesn't belong to that category! Weird. Really disappointed by the quality. The audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine JBL make.. with very cheap BASE and slightly HIGH TREBLE.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the Chinese made ₹150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. The Customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. I agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a NEW one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. There was no defects in the earlier one either.. And now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my VISA card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my Amazon Pay Balance and not my bank account. Amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from Amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. Anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the Amazon Pay Balance. But who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using Amazon out there. That's again pretty disappointing. Totally unsatisfied with the seller and the product.PS : I tried this product on the One Plus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S9+ and also on an iPhone 7+ and it was all the same.

I bought a Portronics Por-766 Conch 204 along with this set, just as a spare, cost me some 400 or something which has a better output than the JBL. I wouldn't reccommend this product if you want to listen to music.I cannot believe I fell for this brand and model name like this. I wish I hadn't bought the product.

"Good sound quality but low on durability
","Pros: Crisp sound. Good bass. Good volume range.Cons: Works smoothly for the first month or two. Post that you realise that there are connection issues due to minor obstructions like fabric or even if device is obstructed by a body part (neck or hand), so the sound falters. Initially I could keep my mobile in my trouser pocket and listen to the music, but later on there was so much of connection stability issues, I had to hold it in my hand or keep it in direct, unobstructed range from the device. You can also see a drastic dip in the range between device and the headset over a period of time.Eventually, it pretty much becomes as good as a regular earphone, because of the way and distance you have to place your device from you phone or laptop.I had to replace it after 4 months (it was in it warranty period). The condition of the replaced product is the same now. Might get it changed again, I think, because its still in the warranty period. The good part about their service centre is that they replace it without asking questions, as long as you have the valid invoice with you.
